      <P>On the Order of Business, is it in order for the Leader of the House to tell us when it is intended to take the motion on the Developments in the European Communities &mdash; Nineteenth and Twentieth Reports?  At this stage these reports are nearly of historical value because it is so long since we have had a discussion on the developments in the EEC.  It is about time that we discussed them.  There has not been a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities since this Dáil and Seanad started and there were only two meetings of that committee in the last Oireachtas. There was no meeting in the previous Oireachtas and if we are going to have reports from the EEC they should be taken as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>My question fits in with the question asked by Senator Lanigan about the reports on developments in the Communities.  I have asked, since the new Seanad was reconstituted and I will ask again, when the motions for establishing the Joint Committee on EEC Secondary Legislation will be coming before this House?  I know that the matter is still before the other House, but it is time that the Seanad took an initiative.  Like other Senators I feel there is very, very important outstanding EEC draft legislation which is getting no scrutiny from the Oireachtas.  In addition, the statutory functions that the Joint Committee must perform of scrutinising the implementation of EEC legislation has not been performed for two years.  This is a matter of very serious neglect at an official level of our duties and responsibilities, apart from the worrying aspects because of the importance of EEC law.  This committee should be established forthwith and, if necessary, on the next sitting day we should have motions to that effect before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to motion No. 5 on Developments in the European Communities, we are very anxious to take this at an early date.  I will explain the difficulties the House is facing to the Senators so that they will appreciate that it might be a fortnight before this could be done.  The difficulties that have arisen with regard to the discussion of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill and the length of time taken, which is in accordance with Senator Dooge's suggestion to the House that we would take as long as we felt was needed to discuss it, have put a number of things in arrears.  I understand the Finance Bill will be coming to the House next week, and I understand that the Second Stage of the <Col N="1087" /> Finance Bill is one of the occasions on which the House likes to have a wide-ranging discussion.  It is, therefore, proposed that the Finance Bill would be taken basically on Wednesday, 1 June, Thursday, 2 June and Friday, 3 June. That would be the Second Stage of the Finance Bill.  That, together with No. 4 on the Order Paper, which is a Money Bill &mdash; the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill &mdash; would form the business for the coming week.  The Committee Stage of the Finance Bill would be taken either on Tuesday, 7 June or Wednesday, 8 June, as the Finance Bill requires to be law some time during that week.  Due to circumstances outside the control of this House we find ourselves with a considerable time constraint in that regard. Because the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill is, in fact, a Certified Money Bill it will be taken on one of the three days next week.</P>
      <P>I agree with the indications of impatience with regard to the Joint Committee referred to by Senator Robinson. I think the approach of the House should be a co-ordinated approach and I would suggest that the Whips of the three parties should meet to see what initiative they can take in this matter if they feel an initiative is necessary by this House. That is the constructive way in which we can bring this thing forward.  If it is necessary for the House to take the initiative on its own, that could well be a fruitful line of investigation.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.  It will, of course, be understood that Senators may speak only once as we are on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>For the convenience of Senators I have arranged for the printing and circulation to them of the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am presenting to the House this afternoon the 13 amendments to the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1982 as accepted.  They are all of a technical nature.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 6; Nos. 8 to 10 and 13 are absolutely identical, No. 7 is merely a printing correction and Nos. 11 and 12 deal with section 56 of the Bill and the definition of &ldquo;Articles in the Principal Act&rdquo;.  I will just briefly go over the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 to 6; Nos. 8 to 10 and No. 13 are ten identical amendments requested by the parliamentary draftsman. Section 5 (4) provided that a certificate of incorporation given under section 18 of the Principal Act in respect of a public limited company would be sufficient evidence until the contrary is shown of the company's status and its compliance with the requirements of the Companies Acts and that it had been duly registered.  In including the provision, the parliamentary draftsman was departing from the long-standing position in the Principal Act and indeed in earlier companies <Col N="1089" /> legislation, that the certificate of incorporation is conclusive evidence of the matters mentioned therein, for example, section 19 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Following expressions of concern by legal and other professional interests that the drafting of section 5 (4) had the effect that the certificates of incorporation would in future be <i>prima facie</i> evidence only and would leave the very existence, status and validity of any company open to challenge, the parliamentary draftsman was requested to reconsider the issues.  He concluded that it was appropriate and necessary in the interest of certainty to provide that the certificate of incorporation referred to in section 5 (4) shall be conclusive evidence of the matters mentioned in that subsection.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment therefore, is that all who deal with a company will know that they are dealing with a legal entity whose actual existence or status can never be challenged.  The same issues arise in the case of certificates of incorporation, issued under sections 9 (9), 11 (3) (b), 14 (5), 18 (6), 43 (11), 52 (5), 53 (5) and paragraph 20 (b) of the First Schedule and in cases of certificates issued under section 6 (6).  Identical amendments were adopted in the Dáil to cover each of these nine other cases.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I have not had an opportunity to do so before.  I wish him very well for the rest of his term which I hope will be for four years.  I know that he will bring that conscientiousness and diligence which he displayed when he was a Member of this House to his new post.</P>
      <P>On the actual word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo;, to my simple mind it is not clear whether that is deleted or does it run throughout the Bill?  Is that the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">

      <P>As the Minister indicated, substantially these are drafting amendments which have been effected by the Dáil.  My purpose in rising is to ask the Minister if he could inform the House when the order will be made bringing this Bill into effect once it is passed.  We have <Col N="1090" /> incurred the wrath of the Court of Justice of the European Communities for our delay in implementing the Second Directive which this Bill now does.  It is necessary to know that it will be brought into effect without further delay.</P>

      <P>In relation to a certificate of incorporation that has been improperly obtained, as, for example, where a certificate of incorporation was obtained by fraud, in such circumstances will such a certificate be deemed to be conclusive evidence as certified in the amendment? The amendment relates not merely to the form of company which this Bill establishes, namely, a public limited company, but the amendment will also apply to ordinary limited liability companies. That indicates there is a certain amount of difficulty in relation to companies incorporated prior to 1982 when in many cases certificates of incorporation may exist but the statutory requirements introduced by the 1982 Act to deal with directors and secretaries of registered offices have not actually been furnished to the Registrar of Companies as such was not essential prior to the incorporation of the companies prior to the 1982 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) as amended provides that the certificate of incorporation is conclusive evidence that the company has complied with all the requirements of the Companies Acts in respect of registration and procedural matters incidental thereto and it is authorised to be registered under the Principal Act.  This places the existence of the company as a legal person beyond doubt.  Consequently, even if, for example, the signatures on the memorandum were forged or some of its objects were illegal, the certificates would be conclusive <Col N="1091" /> evidence that the company was validly registered.  It would prevent any doubt from being raised as to the legal <i>persona</i> of the company but it would not, however, validate the illegal objects which could be challenged.</P>
      <P>In relation to the other amendments, there is the problem of companies registered who may have headquarters outside the State.  Amendment No. 11 arises from representations received recently which drew attention to a problem which section 56 creates for certain foreign companies operating in the State.  That section makes it an offence for any person who is not a public limited company which is defined in section 2 of the Bill to carry on business under a name which ends in &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo;, or the Irish equivalent.  The problem is that a company incorporated outside the State, for example under United Kingdom legislation, may be a legitimate public limited company and obliged to style itself as such but while it may establish a place of business within the State under Part XI of the Companies Act, 1963, without being incorporated here, it would be technically in breach of section 56 of this Bill by using the designation &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo; or the initials &ldquo;PLC&rdquo;.  The amendment is to put that situation right.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank the Seanad for co-operating so rapidly on this legislation which, as Senator Robinson said, and as the Minister has already said in the other House, is urgently required to bring our company law into line with EEC requirements. I would also like to thank Senator Harte and other Senators for their good wishes and I assure the Seanad that they will always have my fullest co-operation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;which shall not include the fertilised ovum prior to the time at which such fertilised ovum becomes implanted in the wall of the uterus&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to both these amendments, as I said last week on Committee Stage and as Senators well know.  I am totally opposed to the amendment of the Constitution in any sense in this way.  Therefore, <Col N="1093" /> it might be expected that I would not put down any amendments.  However, having thought about it very carefully and having listened to the words of my colleague, Senator O'Donoghue, last week and to various statements that have been made by churchmen and others about the wording suggested, I feel that it falls as a responsibility on me as a citizen and as a legislator in this House to try at least, by amending the wording, to minimise what I see as being the damage and harm that may be done by the passing of this wording of the amendment. Accordingly, while I am deeply opposed in general to the passing of the whole Report Stage of this Bill and will, indeed, oppose it, I have put down these amendments partly because at least two of the issues that have arisen in the previous discussions both on Second Stage and Committee Stage have been these problems of definition.  We have had the difficulty over the definition of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and the difficulty of definition over the words &ldquo;the equal rights of the mother&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first amendment which I have put down &mdash; and for which I am extremely grateful to the staff of this House for so rapidly providing an excellent Irish translation &mdash; was to insert after the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;, &ldquo;which shall not include the fertilised ovum prior to the time at which such fertilised ovum becomes implanted in the wall of the uterus&rdquo;.  This may seem a somewhat technical amendment but Senators who have listened to this debate and who have taken part in it will be perfectly clear in their minds as to the reason why I have included this amendment.</P>
    <P>When this campaign was started and through the various public statements and press advertisements that have been put forward by the pro-amendment campaign, it has been suggested by them that they are not trying to change the present position at any time.  They suggest they are simply trying to safeguard the law as it is, that they are trying to safeguard the position that the Supreme Court might bring in abortion through the back door and that they might overrule the Offences Against the Person Act.  They <Col N="1094" /> deny, generally speaking, that what they are trying to do is to take action to prevent certain forms of contraception. However, they tend to say that as far as they are concerned human life begins at the time of the fertilisation of the ovum. This has been stated in this House to be a scientific fact.  It is undoubtedly a scientific fact that some sort of life &mdash; if it is only a bi-cellular life &mdash; starts at the fertilisation of the ovum but it is a theological and not a medical or scientific contention that that is human life as such. The fertilised ovum if it does not implant will not survive.  It is not a human being on its own.  It is not even a developing human being until the time of implantation. On Committee Stage I mentioned various forms of contraception such as the IUD, the low dose pill and the morning-after pill in cases of rape.  I also explained that there were difficulties for women of middle life who were not suitable subjects for other forms of contraception. These particular types of contraception can certainly not be challenged if one accepts that the unborn only starts at the time of implantation.  It is very interesting that in the past couple of weeks we have had a statement by the English legal authorities that the morning-after pill is not an abortifacient precisely on these grounds, that it acts between the time of fertilisation and the time of implantation, that it cannot be considered to be an abortifacient and is, therefore, legal.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if the people who are backing this constitutional amendment are sincere in what they are saying, that they are not trying to change the law as it stands, trying to change present practice, trying to make things more difficult for everyone working in the field of family planning, that what they are trying to prevent is the introduction of the kind of law on abortion that they speak of fearing, that they see in America, England and so on.  If this is the kind of law they are really trying to prevent my amendment should not bother them in the least.  On the other hand, if what they are really trying to do, and this is what I feel they are probably trying to do, is to bring in, hopefully, a very restrictive definition of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; which <Col N="1095" /> would operate to prevent any of these particular forms of contraception, then obviously they will oppose my amendment and then we will be quite clear where we stand.</P>
    <P>As far as the definition is concerned, from the theological point of view it is extremely clear that it is specifically a doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church that life begins at the stage of fertilisation. Therefore if we refuse to accept this amendment we are saying that it is the Roman Catholic doctrine of life we are accepting and nobody else's doctrine.  We are not looking at it from a legal or medical point of view but simply from a theological point of view.  This is something which I would like to make clear, particularly as we are entering on the doorstep of what is described as the forum for a new Ireland.  Presumably we are about to come together and try to see in what way we can approach the majority community in the North and suggest to them that we are offering them a new Ireland which they should join without being shot into it by the gun or without being pressured into it by violence.  We should make it quite clear to them what we are doing. Are we bringing in legislation which is definitely based on the doctrine of one Church or are we prepared to amend it in such a way that it is clear that at any rate the medical and legal opinions of many other authorities are being taken into account?  From a medical point of view many of the leading doctors who have been involved in this controversy have said quite firmly that as far as they are concerned there is no way in which they would accept that it is a human life until the stage of implantation.</P>
    <P>At this stage I will leave that as an introductory speech to this amendment and hear what other Senators have to say.  I will reserve the rest of what I might say on the subject for my reply.</P>

      <P>Like the proposer of this amendment, Senator McGuinness, I spoke at some length on Second Stage in opposition to a Bill to amend the Constitution on this particular issue, but like <Col N="1096" /> her I feel that every opportunity must be taken in this House to try to convey to the Members of the House and to the public at large the total ambiguity, difficulty and worry about the wording that passed its Second Reading in this House, passed Committee Stage and may shortly be submitted in a referendum to the people. The time that has been taken by this House to discuss the terms of this Bill has given us all an opportunity to reflect on the measure.  As far as I am concerned that reflection has only emphasised what an appalling proposal this is, what a terribly shameful Bill is before this House today.  It is interesting to speculate what the role of the Minister of State responsible for women's affairs, who is here for the debate, is in relation to listening to the Report Stage.  Will the Minister answer some of the questions that I and some of the other Senators will put?</P>

      <P>I feel I must be entitled to ask whether the Minister is going to do what Ministers normally do and what the other Minister of State did on the Companies Bill.  He was prepared and briefed to explain what the amendments meant and he answered questions about when the Bill would come into effect.  That is his role.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill and the amendment proposed by Senator McGuinness, it is difficult to understand what the role of the Minister of State will be.  Will she address herself to the questions that Senator McGuinness has already put and that I and other Members of the House will be putting?  This is a very serious matter. If she will not try to answer these questions then I wonder what she is doing here.  Why bother to sit in on the debate? Why put a face on it?  I say that without implying any criticism of the Minister. She came in here and is doing what she was asked to do, so I am not blaming her personally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly a matter for the Minister but it is also a matter for this House.  Will we have a proper Report Stage in which Members of this House will ask difficult and searching questions about the text and the Minister steering the Bill through the House will tell us what she thinks the answers are?  I will be putting a number of very difficult questions. I ask at this stage whether I am going to get answers?</P>

      <P>It seems to be the only course open to me but, to a considerable extent, it changes the nature of the Report Stage on this Bill.  It is utterly different from any other Bill.  In my 13 years experience as a Senator this is the first time that I have been in a position where I have sought, as an elected representative, to find out what words mean. I have sought to find out what is intended by the words chosen in this Bill and what the implications will be.  It appears as though I will not get a normal Report Stage response from whichever Minister may be here when it comes to responding to the questions.</P>
      <P>They certainly were not answered on Committee Stage, although a number of very searching questions were put by Senators. For those who are following this debate in the press and who are not aware of the normal procedures in the Seanad, it is crucial that they understand that the questions we are asking are not being answered, that the clarification that we are seeking is not being given, that the Minister of State sitting here does not believe in this Bill.  She said so on Second Stage.  She is going to advise that it be voted against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most appalling travesty of parliamentary procedures that I have had the experience of witnessing.  It ought to bring shame upon every Member of this House to witness what is going on.  A majority of this House do not believe in the Bill; a majority of this House do not <Col N="1098" /> support the text of the Bill and we will have what we call a Report Stage to clarify and, possibly by process of amendment, to improve the Bill but we will not get any official answers or any official response on the meaning of the text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to envisage this House dropping to a lower ebb than to be faced with a proposal to amend the Constitution and not have the normal procedure for clarifying what that proposal means, not have at our disposal the opportunity to understand and to have explained quite clearly to Members before we vote on a proposal for a fundamental change in our Constitution before that goes to the people who in their turn are expected to vote on a text which will not have been explained or clarified and for which there is no authoritative voice, where the Government of the day do not support the Bill that they are in some passive way allowing to go through this House.</P>
    <P>I am in a sense reinforced in my opposition by the fact that I was unable to be here for Committee Stage last week because I had accepted &mdash; a considerable time ago &mdash; two public speaking engagements in the United States.  One was a symposium in Boston, in the John F. Kennedy Library, organised by the World Council, located in Boston, and the Northern Ireland Group who are very sympathetic to Ireland generally and who are very interested to know of developments in Ireland.  Although the context was broader than this amendment, most of the questions from the floor afterwards centred on this amendment.  There was shock, horror, disbelief and utter dismay expressed by the Friends of Ireland who had gathered together at that meeting in Boston.</P>
    <P>The second meeting that I attended was in Colombus, Ohio.  It was the annual meeting of the American Committee for Irish Studies.  Perhaps, knowing the Acting Chairman's interest in the Gaelic language he may know some of the people involved in various Irish studies, the Gaelic language, literature, history, political science.  It was not a political gathering as such but a gathering of experts and academies whose primary <Col N="1099" /> interest and research area are aspects of our life and culture.  There, too, I found unanimous horror, shock, dismay, disbelief that in 1983 Ireland could be taking this appalling step back into an era when we did not perceive that laws and institutions were sectarian, when this was not something which had been brought to the surface and when there had been an opportunity to understand the type of society which we should be moving towards and building.</P>
    <P>I feel reinforced on Report Stage in seeking, even at this late stage, to invite, in particular the largest group of Senators in this House, the Fine Gael group, to reflect on what they are doing.  They are standing aside and allowing, in this proposal to amend the Constitution to go through this House, a very serious distortion of the parliamentary process and of the balance between the two Houses by their stance in abstaining on this Bill. One cannot abstain on the meaning of this Bill.  One has to have some view.  By abstaining one is subscribing to the perception of the Bill which has been canvassed by those who sought a constitutional amendment.  Abstaining on any vote on Report Stage of this Bill, or abstaining from looking for clarification of its meaning is an acceptance that it meets the requirements of the pro-life lobby.  It is an acceptance that the text is as sectarian as its critics looking at it feel it is.  Those who abstain are necessarily and inevitably binding themselves, as Maurice O'Connell, a former Member of this House warned the Fine Gael Senators, to accepting a sectarian text and one which is a denial of all of the thinking and philosophy behind the constitutional crusade launched by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>As we look now at the amendment proposed by Senator McGuinness it will be done in a kind of official vacuum.  I will join with her in asking very detailed specific questions about the true scope and intent of the wording of the amendment and, because I require clarification on it, I am prepared to support the amendment which she has put forward because on Report Stage it has the great merit of being something that can be <Col N="1100" /> understood, something that has a clear meaning and is, therefore, a substantial improvement on the dangerous and worrying ambiguity of the wording as it stands.</P>
    <P>As Senator McGuinness said in moving the amendment, it is a relatively technical inclusion, as this Bill is a very technical and complex subject, for a constitutional amendment.  The text of the wording, if this amendment were accepted, would read as follows:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn which shall not include the fertilised ovum prior to the time at which such fertilised ovum becomes implanted in the wall of the uterus and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws, to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>My view &mdash; I will have an opportunity to explain this more fully when the other amendment is moved &mdash; is that both amendments before us today should be carried.  They both substantially improve the text of the proposal to amend the Constitution because there should be more precision about where it is intended as a matter of law, because there is no mention of it, there is no legal concept of the unborn and there is no medical concept of the unborn.  It is not as though we are talking about something that has a clear definition and scope as it is.  There is no medical definition and there is no legal definition.  There is only our legislative definition if we put one in.  As the text stands there is no legislative definition.</P>
    <P>The Lower House did not bring itself to define this particular and, of course, crucial aspect of the proposal that they want to put before the people.  This House could play a substantial role in this sorry, sad and muddled debate by bringing some clarity and some precision into it.  The first precision we should bring in is the legislative determination for the purposes of this proposal of when in effect it is proposed that life, for the purposes of this constitutional amendment, begins.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> That is what Senator McGuinness is proposing to do in her amendment.  She is proposing to say that the concept of the unborn, the right to life of the unborn, will commence not from the moment of conception but from the time of implantation. This is not an entirely novel proposal. There are a number of other countries, Germany for example, where the provision has been accepted that a distinction should be drawn between the fertilisation of the ovum and the implantation. The focus has been on implantation as being the more appropriate time to focus on in relation to any legislation or any change to be made in this area.  If we pass this amendment then it would also be appropriate to consider and support the second amendment because it would, as the Commission on Human Rights and other agencies have done, place the relationship between the woman and the implanted ovum in the ordinary human context.  It would not seek to equate those two rights but would of necessity give priority to the right to life of the adult mature woman.</P>
    <P>This proposal has the merit of being precise in the moment when it is intended the constitutional amendment would extend to what has been termed the unborn.  Although already there has been some medical discussion on the record of the House, it is on Report Stage, when we get down to the very precise wording, that it is necessary to spend a little while clarifying on the record of this House the importance of the difference in the concept of life beginning at fertilisation, for the purposes of this legislation, or life beginning at implantation.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we perceive our role.  Our role is a relatively modest one.  We are only legislators, we are not gods, so we are not determining for all time, every context and in every aspect of philosophical thought, theology or religion when life itself begins.  That is not the weighty matter before us.  We are merely being asked to clarify and to make more precise as legislators, because it will have a practical and real significance for the lives of women in particular in this country and for the practice of medicine in this country.  We are being asked to be <Col N="1102" /> precise about when, for the purposes of this proposal to amend the Constitution, it is envisaged that a constitutional right to life will begin.</P>
    <P>There has been a very substantial correspondence in the various newspapers in this country worrying about the deeper issue.  That deeper issue, although it is relevant to attitudes towards the precise problem we have before us, is not the precise problem.  All we really have to worry about is when as far as we as legislators are concerned, for very important medical, social and legal reasons the constitutional right to life will begin.  Will it be at the moment of conception or will it be, as proposed here in the amendment, not before implantation of the ovum?  For that reason it is necessary to take some time to look at the process which we must have under a microscope in order to understand the wording and the thrust of this amendment and, indeed, understand the ambiguity of the existing text if it is not amended.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to look briefly at the very clear and well written chapter on the beginnings of life in a book written, when this proposal to amend the Constitution was first mooted, by Dr. Andrew Rynne, who is known to most Members of the House as somebody who is identified as being anti-amendment.  His book on <i>Abortion, The Irish Question</i> has been widely reviewed and is considered to be remarkably impartial and fair on the issues that have been raised and the implications of the amendment.  Certainly, in the part I am reading from, the chapter on The Beginnings of Life, it is a factual medical description, and therefore, is not one which should be discarded by those who feel that it may be in some way propaganda against the amendment, or whatever.  What we are discussing this afternoon is a matter of an understanding of the human cycle, an understanding of the precise way in which, from a medical point of view, life begins and the appropriate points when the relevance, if this has to be, of conferring a constitutional right may stem or may be dated.</P>
    <P>Dr. Rynne starts chapter 5 as follows:</P>
    <P>Conception or fertilisation can occur <Col N="1103" /> within twenty minutes of having had intercourse.  That would be about the minimum length of time required for the sperm to travel up through the body of the womb and out into the fallopian tubes where conception takes place.  But, from the very second that semen is deposited in the top of the vagina spermatozoa begin to travel through the neck of the uterus and start their assent to the tubes.  Therefore douching after intercourse, for example, is not a particularly useful method of contraception.  In fact, it is normally quite useless.  That would be about the minimum length of time required for conception to take place.  At the other end of the time scale, fertilisation could be delayed for up to twelve or fourteen hours after intercourse.</P>
    <P>So now we have two different potential spans as described here and these are the first matters to cause us to reflect on the potential existing meaning and the importance of this amendment.</P>
    <P>Dr. Rynne continues:</P>
    <P>This is because the sperm has a viable life of about twleve to fourteen hours and can stay around in the body of the uterus or in the tubes awaiting ovulation to take place.  Sperm can live for more than fourteen hours, of course, but their ability to fertilise is eroded with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister of State will give us her own individual view or decide not to give a view since the stance appears to be simply to leave the matter to the people now, unclarified and unspecific but it is important for us to seek to ascertain if in this constitutional right &mdash; which we are proposing and which we are equating to the right of the mother to the right of an adult woman &mdash; that sperm which has a potential life of 14 hours, and still has the capacity to fertilise, and possibly for a little longer, but with that capacity for fertilisation eroded, to be equated under our law and under our Constitution with mature women?</P>
    <P>Dr. Rynne then continues:</P>
    <P>Once conception takes place in the <Col N="1104" /> outer end of the fallopian tube the fertilised egg then starts its long journey back down the tube towards the body of the womb.  This journey takes about three days, or seventy-two hours to complete and while the egg now fertilised travels along it divides into two, then four, eight and sixteen cells. These are the first strides towards the creation of a new individual.  For now the programme is set, sex, hair, colouring, personality and so on are all determined at the moment of conception &mdash; a new human life has begun.</P>
    <P>Now we have the fertilised ovum &mdash; prior to that we had the sperm &mdash; and that journey of the fertilised ovum to the womb, we are told, can take from three days.  The text of the amendment, as proposed, does not make it clear if this fertilised ovum, is being given, by us as legislators and by the people who will vote without the same opportunities as we have to try to get some clarification and some understanding of what we are doing, the same constitutional right to life, an equal right to life as the adult woman.</P>
    <P>Dr. Rynne continues:</P>
    <P>When the fertilised ovum reaches the womb it is called a blastocyst and is quickly becomes embedded in the juicy lining of the womb.  At least that is what usually happens.  Occasionally a fertilised ovum does not become implanted and is passed out in menstural flow.</P>
    <P>If the right to life dates from the very beginning of this process, from the time when the sperm is entering, before conception or at the point of conception, but within a period which can be up to three days before implanation, if that is when we confer the constitutional right, what happens to the natural wastage?  I will come to some figures on that natural wastage. What is the State supposed to do about that?  We are creating a constitutional right to life where we know there is a natural wastage of a certain percentage unknown to the woman concerned and of no concern of any particular kind to anyone, just a natural wastage in the <Col N="1105" /> fertility cycle.  What is the significance then of conferring a constitutional right to life?  If that is not what is intended then why does somebody not say so?  Why do we not have clarity and specific and technical information on this?  As I said on Second Stage, this is not a simple issue. It is not something that can be either discussed or dealt with briefly and without any reference to medical or technical information about the menstural cycle, fertility and so on.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that a certain percentage of the fertilised ova do not become implanted and are passed out naturally as wastage in the menstrual flow.  Dr. Rynne then continues:</P>
    <P>Remember now we are talking about a microscopic cluster of cells &mdash; a very specialised cluster of cells, I grant you, since they hold the genetic software for a brand new human individual.  But at this stage we are very much under the microscope; there is an amount of natural wastage of these blastocysts and they have been recovered in menstrual flow.  Taking it however that implantation does occur then, within two or three days, the blastocyst breaks up into placenta an embryonic sac containing the developing embryo already immersed in its protective amniotic fluid.  Both mother and embryo have their own separate blood supply and circulation and the two never mix. Oxygen and nutrients are transferred across the placenta barrier from the mother's circulation to the embryo's circulation.  After about ten days the embryo has grown to about the size of a pinhead and should be barely visible to the naked eye at this stage.  It is referred to as an &ldquo;embryo&rdquo; up to eight weeks of gestation, calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period. After eight weeks the developing baby is referred to as a foetus.</P>
    <P>In order that we understand the scope and intent of this amendment it is necessary for us to bear in mind in very considerable precision precisely how the cycle develops and the kind of timelags which can take place and, in particular, the degree of natural wastage which can <Col N="1106" /> occur.  If I might refer to another helpful briefing on that problem of natural wastage, a problem from the point of view of defining constitutional rights, I would refer to the briefing document on some medical implications of the proposed constitutional amendment.  It is dated 9 December 1982 and it is under the auspices of the anti-amendment campaign. I believe copies were circulated to all Deputies and Senators.  The part which I am referring to is factual.  These are factual medical data.  Therefore, even if a number of Senators or Deputies are not supportive of the anti-amendment campaign, or are concerned about some aspects of that campaign it is helpful to have the medical precision provided in a briefing such as this because it certainly has not been provided in any of the political speeches which have accompanied support for the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>The debates on the amendment in the Dáil were very interesting because almost without exception they are totally nontechnical and without reference to the reality of what this proposed amendment is about.  They refer to philosophy, theology, the Church and other social aspects of the problem from different perspectives, but they do not address the precise technical and medical steps which are part of the cycle which we are necessarily required to focus on because it is proposed at some stage in that cycle to confer a constitutional right.  The implications of that are only clear if we know at what stage it is proposed to confer that constitutional right.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from the briefing document on the wastage involved in this natural process.  The passage I want to put on the record of the House is as follows:</P>
    <P>It is important to stress the fact that, as with all animal life, there is an enormous wastage created in the natural reproductive process.  Of 100 ova which may potentially fuse with a spermatozoa, only 1 in 4 or 25 per cent. will successfully fuse and become fertilised.</P>
    <P>If we think that the amendment as it stands means that life for the purposes of conferring a constitutional right to life <Col N="1107" /> begins at fertilisation, then there will be a 75 per cent loss of that constitutional right to life by natural wastage within the very early stages of the process.</P>

It is obviously a matter of great concern, a questionable judicial decision, a man who is physically unwell, under and has been receiving psychiatric treatment, well into the fourth week of a hunger strike and with precious little concern from either us politicians, the media or, indeed, the Church agencies that seem to confine their consideration of these issues to North of the Border.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been referring to the substantial natural wastage that occurs at the very early stage of the reproductive cycle and the figure I had commenced with in this quotation from the briefing drawn up by members of the medical profession was that 75 per cent of the ova which may potentially fuse with a spermatozoa do not do so and do not become fertilised.  I wish to continue the quotation on the wastage after this process of fertilisation.  The quotation continues as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of fertilisation, which <Col N="1110" /> depends on factors such as how close the woman is to ovulation, takes anything from one hour to three days.  Of that 25%, only half (or 12½%) will continue in the normal fashion by travelling down the fallopian tube (where fertilization takes place) to the uterus (or womb) in order to implant in the wall of that organ.  In eight to ten days implantation is normally complete. Once again, of that 12½%, only some 9.3% will successfully implant &mdash; the rest being spontaneously aborted. Thus we can see that some 50% of fertilized ova which fail to implant are discharged in a normal menstural flow of which the woman has no knowledge. So even before the matter of contraception is introduced, nature has provided that only 50% of fertilised ova will have any chance of implantation.</P>
    <P>Clearly then, the fact of such a high rate of natural wastage marries poorly with absolute or theological definitions as to when life begins or indeed as to when potential human life becomes inviolable.  The incidence of spontaneous abortions is normally quoted as 1 in 4 of implanted pregnancies.  If the loss of fertilised ova (as well as implanted ova) were included then the rate would be in the region of 64%.</P>
    <P>One can see therefore, that the interpretation given to the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is of vital significance.  For if the Supreme Court of Ireland interprets the word in a strictly fundamentalist manner as being from the moment of conception of fertilisation in the fallopian tubes, then we may presume that such an interpretation will perceive the 50% of fertilised ova being expelled as being some form of spontaneously aborted life.  It should be noted, moreover, that while such an interpretation would therefore oblige the State to &ldquo;defend and vindicate&rdquo; the right of the fertilised ovum the question of what protection would be made to those spontaneously expelled is difficult to answer.</P>
    <P>The medical analysis of the cycle we are discussing is one which brings out the very significant natural wastage between conception and implantation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> It always has been my fundamental belief as a legislator that we should legislate for a basic reality and that we should not, for example, confer a constitutional right on plant life, or a constitutional right on the armchairs in the Seanad or a constitutional right on some very pretty orchid that flowers every century, or something of that kind.  We do not go about doing that but we may well be doing something rather close to it in proposing to confer not just a constitutional right to life but a constitutional right to life which is equal to the right of a mature woman on the fertilised ova a very substantial proportion of which will be flushed out by natural wastage before implantation.</P>
    <P>The question could be asked: what does it matter if we are conferring a constitutional right to life on fertilised ova when 50 per cent of them are being lost through natural wastage in the menstural flow?  The thrust, as I understand it, of the pro-life campaign, and of members of the medical and legal professions &mdash; including Senator Eoin Ryan in his contribution on Committee Stage &mdash; is to suggest that this constitutional amendment will not make any difference to the existing law which prohibits abortion and it will not make any difference to existing medical practice.  I question that very seriously because if the conferring of a constitutional right has any of its normal attributes &mdash; I presume it does because we have not qualified it &mdash; then it will and must make a very significant difference to medical practice and the legal framework which surrounds that medical practice. Any obstetrician or gynaecologist who says, &ldquo;As far as I am concerned this constitutional amendment will not make any difference to what I do&rdquo; is possibly saying, &ldquo;I will act outside the law.  I will act regardless of what the law is, particularly regardless of what the most fundamental law of the country, the Constitution, says.&rdquo;  I have no doubt that the doctors who have said it will make no difference to their practice do not envisage that they could be operating outside the law but it is our task this afternoon, and for as long as it may take us, to seek <Col N="1112" /> to bring to this debate at this very late stage the kind of technical precision which will enable us to understand much more clearly and precisely what is envisaged. If it is the case that the right to be conferred in this proposed amendment extends to the fertilised ova then we have to reconcile that with the reality that a very substantial proportion of the fertilised ova now blessed with the constitutional right washes away in a menstural flow.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the question is: what difference will that make to existing medical and contraceptive practices? This is crucial to an understanding of the existing text of the proposal and also of the scope and purpose of the amendment before us.  The implications of the proposed amendment, if it extends from the moment of conception to the fertilised ovum, are very substantial and very worrying in the area of contraception.  They would make a substantial difference to the review of the family planning law which the Minister for Health has announced he is carrying out.  They would substantially affect the existing position and, therefore, it is necessary to explain in somewhat more technical detail than is usually the case the way in which various types of contraceptives either work or are thought to work.  In some cases there are alternative interpretations of precisely how they work and how they would be affected by the wording of this amendment if the right to life of the unborn extends from the moment of fertilisation of the ovum.  I should like to turn to the description of various types of contraceptives as set out in the briefing prepared by members of the medical profession.  I will quote from part of the briefing which describes the operation of the intra uterine device, the IUD:</P>
    <P>It is still unclear how the IUD prevents pregnancies.  One theory is that its presence in the uterus creates a chronic inflammation which increases the number of white blood cells which in turn destroy the fertilised ovum or spermatozoa.  This inflammatory reaction is also thought to interfere with the implantation of the fertilised egg in <Col N="1113" /> the endometrium (lining of the uterus). It is also not clear how the copper in the more recent IUDs works.  The IUD is not recommended for women who have had no children.  Of all methods currently available in the field of contraception it has perhaps the most drawbacks.  However, notwithstanding this, it can be a good method for older women who have many children and whose circumstances make other methods of contraception unsuitable. In particular, it is used in this country by those women who require a contraceptive method which needs little regulation and which is relatively cheap. In practice doctors and family planning clinics find that many working class women, older women and women with large families rely on this method.  It is also one of the methods advised to the woman who is an unsuitable candidate for the combined Pill and for those women who have reached the age at which continuance with the Pill becomes increasingly dangerous, (approximately 30-35 for the woman who smokes and 35-40 for the nonsmoker). In 1981 alone, over 2,500 IUDs were inserted in Irish women.</P>
    <P>We there have a type of contraceptive used by women with the features described and with special reference to working-class women because, with certain drawbacks, it is nonetheless a much cheaper type of contraceptive device than the pill or some other devices.  We know it is prescribed and inserted by doctors in Ireland.  If we confer a constitutional right to life, which is equal to the right to life of an adult woman, on a fertilised ovum and if the State must defend and vindicate that right then it is very difficult to see how it could be possible to continue to allow the IUD to be used as a contraceptive in Ireland.  That is one immediate practical change which appears to be necessary in order that the doubt about the prevention of implantation, which would then be a doubt about the continuance of a constitutional right to life, would be reconciled with the constitutional amendment. There could not continue to be that practice given the new recognition <Col N="1114" /> of this constitutional right to life and the equation of that right with the right of the adult woman.</P>
    <P>Any doctors who say that as doctors they will continue doing what they were doing before are only aggravating the situation by in some way pretending that there are no implications in conferring a constitutional right to life.  The difficulty there is that in a sense the law has been brought into disrespect by this proposal for a constitutional amendment.  It has been very divisive.  It has given rise to a great deal of controversy and questioning. It is not helped by the attempt by some senior medical men who are in favour of a constitutional amendment blinkering themselves and saying it will make no difference to their current medical practice.  Those two stances are not in fact reconcilable nor is the general approach of the pro-life lobby that the constitutional amendment will not make any change to existing law and is purely for the purpose of copperfastening the existing law.  I dealt with that, like other Senators, at some length on Second Stage, but it is worth referring to it in more technical detail on Report Stage on this amendment.</P>
    <P>It certainly seems logically impossible to reconcile the known medical facts about the IUD and a proposal which would intend to confer a constitutional right on the fertilised ovum before implantation, a constitutional right to be equated with the right of an adult woman.  Any doubt about the method of operating of the IUD would simply rule out the IUD because the State would be bound to defend and vindicate the fertilised ovum.  There is no way that the organs of the State, or the Minister for Health, or anyone else, would be authorised to try to get around that though I know we have these Irish solutions to Irish problems, but must we always approach serious problems in Ireland with our hypocritical and back-door Irish solutions?  Surely we can admit in this House the absurdity of giving a constitutional right of life to a fertilised ovum which is equal to the right of a mature adult Irish citizen, an Irish woman.  If we at this late stage could admit that absurdity <Col N="1115" /> we would avoid some of the practical and, indeed, harrowing problems which are going to be the result of this amendment if carried because we are talking about working-class women who probably found it difficult to get advice in this area anyway.  They probably had to go out on the line a bit to find either a family planning clinic or a GP who was able to give them the medical help and experience.  Now we, as legislators, are proposing to let a constitutional amendment to be introduced with further barriers to that knowledge and that help, with further possible consequences of increasing the number of unplanned &mdash; I prefer the word unplanned than unwanted &mdash; pregancies and therefore increasing the pressure to go for an abortion or a termination in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>This is a very grave responsibility on all of us.  It is not too late for Senators to reflect that if this amendment does prevent the availability of certain types of contraceptives which are at the moment availed of &mdash; this is the real world, they are being used and women are availing of them in planning their families &mdash; then we may paradoxically and ironically be increasing the abortion trail to Britain. We may, in fact, put on that further additional pressure which will mean that the graph, which is already rising very sharply in a way which must be causing serious concern right across the board among legislators, will rise further, in the name of doing the very opposite.</P>
    <P>The other type of contraceptive which it would appear must be affected by this proposal is the type of contraceptive pill which affects the process of implantation, however it affects the process which in some way is intended to prevent implantation. I turn to the summary in this medical briefing of the progesterone only pill. It states:</P>
    <P>The Pill is thought to act in various ways.  These include a thickening of the cervical mucus at the entrance to the uterus rendering it hostile to spermatazoa; preventing implantation by attaching the steroid receptors in the endometrium and perhaps by altering <Col N="1116" /> motility in the fallopian tube, thereby curtailing the mobility of ova in the fallopian tube.  It may also inhibit ovulation (release of the ovum from the ovary).  It is the contraceptive of choice in older women because of the high cardivascular risks inherent in the combined oestrogen and progesterone Pill; in women with valvular heart disease and others who cannot take oestrogen; and by those who are breastfeeding.  It is also the only medical (non-barrier) method available to diabetic women. The numbers of women using this method of contraception have increased significantly since 1975 and in 1981 1% of Pill users were taking the progesterone only pill.</P>
    <P>That is another category of women who are at present using a type of contraceptive who would appear to have their choice of method of family planning affected by this proposed amendment. This is something which will have to become much clearer if this amendment goes through when the debate is taking place prior to the referendum, that existing practices must necessarily change if the right to life of the unborn is deemed to be a constitutional right of the fertilised ovum.</P>
    <P>The next method which would be affected is the practice in relation to post-coital contraception.  Again I quote from this briefing:</P>
    <P>A definition of &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; as beginning at fertilisation would also affect the availability of post-coital contraception which is particularly helpful in treatment of rape victims.  This is available in the form of an oestrogen progesterone combination &mdash; in fact one of the brands of the combined Pill &mdash; administered within 72 hours in order to prevent ovulation, or if this has already occurred or if spontaneous ovulation has been brought on by the act of rape, to prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum.  The IUD can also be inserted up to ten days post-coitally and both these methods have success rates of over 99%.  Should the wording of the amendment be interpreted so as to render many contraceptive Pills and IUDs on the market illegal, there <Col N="1117" /> would be no treatment available to the woman who has been raped and if she should find herself pregnant, would have no alternative but to continue with the pregnancy or to seek an abortion, if possible, abroad.</P>
    <P>This proposal could do the very thing which I felt, listening to the contributions to the debate, was not desired by the Senators on that side of the House who were strongly supporting it: it would increase the pressures for abortions, the pressures for termination of pregnancies abroad.</P>
    <P>There is no good saying that Irish women would not be susceptible to or are not affected by the pressures and the difficulties in which they find themselves and would not go abroad for termination of their pregnancies.  We have the statistics. We know that the official figure of 5,000 women going abroad in 1982 is an under-estimate of the real figure.  It under-estimates the numbers of those women who go to have their pregnancies terminated and give English addresses, either fictional addresses or addresses of relatives in England.  Therefore, it is fair to say that the figure of 5,000 is an under-estimate of the actual figure.  If we remove various kinds of contraceptive practices which are available and availed of at the moment is it not irresponsible of us not to at least admit the probability that some of those women will take the only other option open to them if they find themselves pregnant in circumstances which they feel they can cope with, that they will go to Britain and have an abortion?</P>
    <P>When we get down to the precise technical scope of both the wording before us and the intention of this amendment, it is a necessary consequence of the scope of the proposal, if it means that it confers on the fertilised ovum a constitutional right to life, that it will outlaw certain existing contraceptive practices and will necessarily increase the pressures for abortion.  We may end up with our high-falutin' constitutional amendment ensuring that no abortion is committed on holy Irish soil while we increase the abortion race to various cities in <Col N="1118" /> England as we export this social problem. That is only one important aspect of the wording.  The other dimension is that the fertilised ovum would be recognised in the constitutional amendment as having an equal right to life.  The doctor who was asked to treat, advise or help a woman would have to have regard to the equality of right as between the woman and the fertilised ovum.  This again could, and indeed must, affect the kind of advice and help which the doctor could give and the kind of approach he could adopt in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is, perhaps, ironic that we would have what I welcome very much, a proposal by the Minister for Health to bring forward a major review of and a major amendment to the legislation on contraceptives in a very substantial overhaul of the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 but the Minister too will have to live within the law and within the constitutional amendment.  He personally has opposed it, but if this amendment goes forward, then it will constrain the scope of any legislation on family planning and will introduce a kind of absurd dimension to it of equating the fertilised ovum with the adult Irish woman.  The proposal in this amendment to define the scope of the constitutional right which we are discussing and to exclude from it the fertilised ovum prior to implantation is in my view a significant improvement in removing some of the worst &mdash; in regard to both legal absurdity and practicality &mdash; problems of this proposal to amend the Constitution.  It would certainly diminish the very real apprehensions about the scope of the wording when undefined.  Since Senators are limited on Report Stage in the kinds of amendments which can be tabled, I would have no hesitation in supporting this one.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the conferring of the constitutional right which it is important to refer to again on this amendment and on Report Stage is one to which I referred on Second Stage.  It is worth bearing in mind that once we as legislators in our wisdom &mdash; or lack of it &mdash; decide that we will confer a constitutional right on the fertilised ovum, then that right can be vindicated in our courts.  That right can <Col N="1119" /> be asserted and can be put forward by third parties.  It obviously cannot be asserted by the entity which holds the right &mdash; if I may put it that way.  Clearly the fertilised ovum or the implanted ovum cannot assert any right, but the right can be asserted on behalf of that entity on whom we have decided a constitutional right will be imposed.  This is extremely important for the organisations which may help women &mdash; for example, the Rape Crisis Centre &mdash; in relation to advice to women or young girls who have been raped.  Rights could be asserted by third parties.  A kind of vigilante third party injunction procedure could develop to prevent the practices in relation to rape victims from in any way infringing a constitutional right to life. This is not far-fetched; it is quite possible once the constitutional amendment would be passed.  Similarly, as has already been mentioned, it is possible that a third party, or an organisation on behalf of people who had been sponsoring this constitutional amendment, would seek to ensure its full enforcement, and, for example to prevent any referral of women to agencies in Britain for termination of pregnancies, or if they learned that a woman had been referred expressly to an address in England for a termination of pregnancy, for an abortion, would seek an injunction to prevent the woman from travelling abroad for that purpose. This is not far-fetched, it is not unreal.  It fits into what we are doing.  If we give a constitutional right to life to the fertilised ovum and if we say that that constitutional right to life is to be equated with the right of adult women, then we invoke the possibility of a whole legal process.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and I recall you were listening intensely in the Chair at the time, I also referred on Second Stage to the cases that have already been taken before the Commission on Human Rights relating to the issue of abortion.  The Commission on Human Rights ruled out any broad-based right-to-choose approach under the convention. In examining the two articles of the convention that are relevant &mdash; article 2 which proclaims the right to life and <Col N="1120" /> article 8 on protection of family life, the Commission in the Paton case concluded that the foetus had a right to life, but that that right to life was not equal to the right of the mother.  It was necessarily and biologically subservient to, not equal to the right of the mother.</P>
    <P>This is the first example in my parliamentary experience of a case where we in Ireland appear to be determined to bring in a constitutional amendment which would appear to violate our commitments under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  As a high contracting party we are bound by our obligations under the convention, yet by the wording of this amendment we appear to be deciding that no matter what our obligations are, no matter what human rights issues are concerned, we will press ahead and allow this amendment to be put to the people and seek to secure this change in the Constitution.  It is important to bear that in mind.  We are in some way seeking to insulate ourselves and this is completely different from the question of whether some or all of the other countries belonging to the convention have legalised abortion of some kind.  That is not the central issue.  The central issue here is a definition of rights, a definition of the right and relationship of the fertilised ovum and then the embryo and foetus to the woman.  In the text of the amendment we appear to be taking a different course which would be regarded as not compatible with our obligations as a member state of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>Finally, yet very important, as Senator McGuinness said in moving this amendment, if the text before us has the meaning that life &mdash; which for the purposes of a constitutional right to life is equal to the right to life of the mother &mdash; begins at conception, then it is sectarian.  It is sectarian beyond doubt and equivocation because it represents the doctrinal tenets of one sect which happens to be the majority Church here, the Roman Catholic Church.  It is by necessary definition a sectarian proposal.  The only Church in Ireland which supports the concept of a <Col N="1121" /> right of that nature which can be recognised as a constitutional right from conception is the Catholic Church and that has been clear from the different doctrinal and, therefore, moral attitudes and responses on this issue of abortion.  It is the essence of the differences that exist, which are not very great but they are fundamental.  That is the fundamental difference.  If you take an absolute view of the right to life as from conception or the right of the fertilised ovum, then that is the doctrinal and moral viewpoint of the Catholic Church which is not shared by any of the other Churches.</P>
    <P>I have listened with considerable interest to the discussions which have taken place on various television and radio programmes on this issue of whether the constitutional amendment proposed is sectarian.  What is very interesting is the reluctance of senior politicians to draw a commonsense conclusion.  Even if they do not want to get too deeply into the differences on the theological and moral issues, even if they do not want to get too deeply into the fertility cycle and the time lag between conception and implantation, if that it too hard for the mental processes or too complicated or too embarrassing in some cases for these senior politicians to consider, surely from a commonsense point of view this must be a sectarian proposal if one Church not only supports but is pulling strings all over the place and is already deeply involved on the ground in influencing attitudes and approaches to it.  All of the other Church groupings are saying primarily that they do not want any amendments at all and secondly they particularly do not want this amendment.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Senator?  I would like her to relate her remarks to the amendment before us.  We are on Report Stage and the Senator is repeating much that should, perhaps, have been said last week.  I am sorry to interrupt you, Senator Robinson.</P>

      <P>What I have just been saying, with all respect to the direction which you are giving from the Chair, is <Col N="1122" /> precisely on the point of this amendment but I will make that clearer if you so wish. The problem is one of a very vague text which does not define when the constitutional right of the unborn begins.  I would like to hear the views of the Minister of State.  Indeed, we could take a roll-call on where Senators think this right begins under the present text.  It would be very interesting to ask each Senator if he or she thinks it is conception, it is implantation or later than that. We might get a whole variety of answers from individual Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I still think Senator that that would have been a nice exercise last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, this exercise is precisely related to the amendment, with respect a Leas-Chathaoirligh.  Senator McGuinness in this amendment is being precise in a way which would remove this charge of a sectarian text.  As I said, and I agree with her on this, it is open to the criticism that it is sectarian if the proposal is, as apparently most people think it is, that the right to life begins at conception and the constitutional right relates to the fertilised ovum prior to implantation.  If that is the case then we are talking about a clearly sectarian text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to pass a sectarian text and I do not think anybody in this House does.  If they do not, let us then consider what kind of a text we can pass which would not be sectarian.  If we consider that, then we can address ourselves to this amendment because it excludes the fertilised ovum prior to implantation. Therefore, whatever else this constitutinal amendment may be and whether it be strictly necessary or appropriate to have it by way of constitutional amendment, at least it would not be sectarian in that full sense that the wording would be if it has the other meaning.  If nobody wants it to have the other meaning, well let us get rid of this smear that it is sectarian. Let us not have the embarrassment of a measure that is going through the Oireachtas in 1983 being called sectarian. Surely if that is even raised seriously by a Member of this House then all <Col N="1123" /> of us on this island which has suffered so much in the last few years must spend a long time if necessary in reflecting on and considering if that is a serious charge and if it is being made by responsible people inside and outside Leinster House.  If it is, then surely even at this late stage we must do something about the wording that will get us over that problem.  We have the opportunity in this House because we have a proposal to decide precisely when the scope of this constitutional right will come into effect, into being and what the precise moment will be and the Report Stage amendment before us would largely meet that kind of critiscism, the kind of charge that is very difficult for people outside this country to understand.</P>
    <P>Our friends outside Ireland find it very difficult to understand how we could be considering and be determined to process through the Oireachtas a sectarian amendment in the face of all that has happened on this island particularly in the last 15 to 16 years and in the face of political initiative such as the proposal for a forum to consider the possible framework of a united Ireland.  Therefore, since the charge has been made by responsible Church leaders, leaders of opinion in this country, and a number of Members of this House, apart from myself, that this text is sectarian I would say that we have a very real opportunity by accepting this amendment to remove that charge, not to bull ahead with a sectarian amendment; not to put before the people a matter on which they are not specialists and which can ultimately to them be clarified into the simple issue of whether one is pro- or anti-abortion. They are not responsible as we are for the texture and fabric of the legislation of the constitutional amendments which we pass.  There is no doubt in my mind that the amendment now before the House could diminish very substantially both the charge of sectarianism which stands and which has not been repudiated and also the very real practical and medical difficulties posed by the text as it now stands.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I intend to sit out this debate in the hope that I will get some <Col N="1124" /> answers.  I do not really mind where I get them from.  In fairness I do not expect to get them from Senator McGuinness because she shares my problem.  She has already indicated that she wants answers too.  Although she is the proposer of the amendment and has explained why she has proposed it, she can hardly give either the official answers of the Government or the answers of the party in this House who support the amendment.  Perhaps an official spokesperson from the party in this House who support the amendment can answer the questions in the kind of detail which I am seeking. I really would like to have technical, medical detail.  I do not mind whether it comes from medical textbooks, from specialist knowledge or just from much homework done by individual Senators.  It would be interesting at least to get in this House precise answers either from the Minister of State or from the party who by supporting this amendment with a whip are ensuring, it would appear, that the text will go to the people in the way in which it has been passed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I shall listen to and read with interest every word spoken in this debate as I have done in the earlier Stages of it precisely to see if any Senators will address themselves to the questions I have asked. Will anyone address himself or herself to the issues of when, in the view of the Fianna Fáil Party, this constitutional right of the unborn begins, what effect that will have on the various practices that are availed of at present by Irishwomen, and how the Fianna Fáil Party answer the charge that this is a sectarian text not in vague terms but in very precise terms in the way in which it has been asked?  If I can get some answers to those questions, then this debate will have been of some use and can lead on to the broader debate in the country when the referendum itself takes place.</P>

      <P>I will not take long and I promise not to repeat myself or to incur the wrath or disapproval of the Chair at any stage in the course of my contribution. Perhaps it is an optimistic promise but I hope to keep my side of it anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to an enormous amount <Col N="1125" /> of the debate in this House.  Let us remind the public that this amendment was debated in this House, had a Committee Stage and is now having a Report Stage which did not occur in the other House, for reasons of political expediency, I suspect. The fact that we are having this debate stands to the credit of this House and its Members.  As one who has been critical of this House I say that at least on this issue this House distinguished itself.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to my contribution on Second Stage I received a considerable number of letters most of which I will not bore the House with, but one was from a Dissenter from Northern Ireland and by that I mean he would not describe himself as neither Catholic nor Protestant but Dissenter.  I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Robb, for explaining that fact to me about the individual in question. He is a member of the New Ireland Group who are, generally speaking, members of the non-Roman Catholic Churches who are committed to the ideal of Irish unity and he edits a newsletter. In the course of a complimentary letter which I will not read out he quotes one line from a poem by a Northern poet, John Hewitt, upon whom Belfast City Council decided to confer the freedom of the city last night.  Since I have a habit of quoting poetry and putting it on the record of the House that one line deserves to be added to the record.  It is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sick guilt-clotted legend of our creed-haunted God-forsaken race&rdquo;.  If ever a line summed up the underlying implications, guilts and fears of this debate it is that description.  We are all to some extent described by it whichever Church we belong to.  I have wondered for a long time about this debate and I do not wish to revert to Second Stage again but one thing needs to be said.  I hate to say it because it is party political and I try to keep away from that.  I abstained when we debated the constitutional crusade in this House on the grounds that I did not trust the Fine Gael Party to live up to the aspirations of that crusade.  In the light of recent events perhaps I am sorry that I did not vote against it but I am particularly happy that I did <Col N="1126" /> not vote for it because that crusade is dead.</P>
    <P>On the question of the amendment to this amendment that has been produced I will explain my own position in a moment.  I would like to quote from a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today, 25 May 1983:</P>
    <P>I ask the question &ldquo;is the right to life of the mother to be jeopardised in the interest of the unborn, who we, as doctors, know cannot survive outside the mother's womb&rdquo;?  I, as a doctor, will say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but where then do I stand <i>vis-á-vis</i> the law, which may soon demand equal rights to life for both? Justice is one thing and the law is another.  Unfortunately, the law is not always just.  Is it not unthinkable to expect doctors to rationalise in terms of the law first and medicine thereafter?</P>
    <P>He goes on to explain the Catholic principle of the double effect which is a Catholic theological concept permitting treatment of a patient with a serious condition despite the fact that she is pregnant.  Further on in the letter he says:</P>
    <P>The new wording must ensure that the principle of the double effect will now be applied to both the unborn and the mother with possible disastrous consequences.</P>
    <P>The author describes himself as:</P>
    <P>a conscientious objector to abortion when I was a practising obstetrician in England</P>
    <P>and the view, he says, was unequivocally accepted by his superiors.  He says:</P>
    <P>It is criminal, it is dangerous, it is wrong, to introduce a law which would withhold proper accepted medical practice from any woman in this country and people must be made aware of this fact.  This is a dangerous precedent, because neither the law nor the public should be able to dictate to doctors what is best in the field of medicine.</P>
    <P>He concludes:</P>
    <P>I honestly believe that the Pro-Life Amendment Group in this instance are <Col N="1127" /> unintentionally leading us on a dangerous crusade, which could end with this country having legalised abortion in a matter of years.  Give some thought to the fact that it is quite probable that the wording of this amendment could be interpreted as discriminating against conscientious doctors in the accepted practice of modern obstetrics.</P>
    <P>I read all this because it has been asserted continuously in this House that there is no problem for the medical profession with this amendment as it stands.  The author of the letter is Fergus P. Meehan, Lecturer in Obstetrics in Gynaecology in University College, Galway, and Consultant Obstetrician-Gynaecologist in the Regional Hospital, Galway.  I do not think I have been selective: it is written by a man who obviously has thought very carefully and in great detail about it.</P>
    <P>Again I repeat what I said on Committee Stage to the one party in this House who claim to have no problem with this amendment, that unless we are returning to the days of the empty formula which served that party well at one stage, and which I would have understood at that stage, they have an obligation to explain to us all what this wording means.</P>
    <P>With regard to the two amendments, Senator McGuinness has, unfortunately, touched the Tory in me to some extent in the sense that I do not know for certain when life begins.  I do not know at what stage you can talk about the rights of the unborn.  I do not know for certain whether you can define equal rights of mother and child or prior rights of the mother.  I know that I do not believe that the theological conceptions of any Church should be embodied in the Constitution. Where one wording would embody the theological perceptions of one Church, the alternative proposed by Senator McGuinness, I suspect, would embody the theological perception of another Church.  We have had too much, as John Hewitt said in the line I quoted, of Churches telling us how to define our legislation, whether it be majority Churches, minority Churches or other Churches who fall somewhere in <Col N="1128" /> between: in other words, presumably they are hung Churches, they do not have a majority or a minority &mdash; perhaps that is where they all should be, I do not know.  I do not believe the solution to these problems is to institute one definition rather than another.  All we are having pointed out to us is the fact that this is an unsuitable matter for a constitutional amendment, that it cannot be defined in terms which will not give offence and which will not cause trouble. For instance, if Senator McGuinness' wording was to be accepted and perhaps, although I would never accuse her of such deviousness, this was her intention, there is no doubt as to what the consequences would be.  It would be overwhelmingly defeated because it would be unacceptable to the majority Church which, unfortunately, seems to have that sort of influence. That is not the reason.</P>
    <P>I could not bring myself to vote for a particular form of words which would define some of the issues that I do not believe are definable and that I do not believe that I know the answers to.  I do not know when human life begins.  I do not think that anybody else knows when human life begins.  I do not know how you define the rights of one versus the other in a Constitution.  I do not believe anyone will ever know.  The problem with all this is that people want to do something about making abortion even more strictly prohibited than it is, if that is possible.  To do that they want to ignore the realities of human anatomy, of obstetrics and want to make definitions that are impossible to make and write them into the Constitution.  I sympathise with Senator McGuinness' dilemma.  I understand what she is trying to do but I regret that I cannot support her amendment.</P>

      <P>What I have to say at this stage of the debate will be specific and to some extent will be brief in so far as some of the questions have been posed by both Senator Robinson and Senator Brendan Ryan.  I want to develop a continuity between Committee Stage of the debate and the Fourth Stage which we are now at and we are discussing the first <Col N="1129" /> amendment in the names of Senator McGuinness and Senator Ross.  On Committee Stage, in the course of a second speech by Senator Eoin Ryan he made some extraordinary assertions of certainty. He said there was no ambiguity whatsoever about words and he went further than that to characterise the arguments of those who suggested that definitions were important.  Senator Ryan, for example, suggested thay my request for a definition of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; was in fact a pedantic pursuit.  He said it was a tendency of academics to be somewhat pedantic and only a pedant would make the point that it is not clear what &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; means in the sense that it is not followed by &ldquo;unborn baby&rdquo; or &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we discussed that, we heard the letter to which Senator Brendan Ryan referred, from Fergus P. Meehan, Lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College, Galway and Consultant Obstetrician-Gynaecologist, Regional Hospital, Galway, which is on page 9 of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 May 1983. Fergus Meehan is a former lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at Oxford University.  We have, in addition to Fergus Meehan's questions, a letter in the same paper from three individual obstetrician-gynaecologists in different parts of the country calling a meeting in Dublin to discuss the implications of the wording of this amendment for their doctor-patient relationships.  It was not their concern that moved me to ask specific questions on Committee Stage that derived entirely from the language: it was the fact that what I described had been provided to me as descriptions of situations that had arisen in the treatment of women by doctors.  It is in the interests of those women and women in the future that I want it on the record of this House that at every stage of the debate we asked for a definition of the words and for somebody to spell out the implications for women and for our society of accepting a form of words that nobody seemed to want to answer.  Today's letter from Mr. Meehan is most interesting.  It rejects flatly what Senator Eoin Ryan said on Committee Stage.  He ends with the quotation <Col N="1130" /> that Senator Brendan Ryan mentioned.</P>
    <P>Give some thought to the fact that it is quite probable that the wording of this amendment could be interpreted as discriminating against conscientious doctors in the accepted practice of modern obstetrics.</P>
    <P>He says earlier on</P>
    <P>Doctors must stand apart and consider the possible consequences of this new wording.  Under section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, we apply the &ldquo;principle of the double effect&rdquo;, which is a Catholic theological concept permitting treatment of the patient with a serious condition despite the fact that she is pregnant. The new wording must ensure that the principle of the double effect will now be applied to both the unborn and the mother, with possible disastrous consequences.</P>
    <P>Those are not the words of a Senator pursuing a pedantic definition, they are the words of a practitioner who, interestingly, and I quote from the first paragraph of his letter said</P>
    <P>I am a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist who is not affiliated to any pressure group and who is antiabortion. I speak as a citizen and as an obstetrician concerned for pregnant patients with serious disease who will require treatment in the future.  I believe that the proposed wording of the amendment to the Constitution could be detrimental to patients and endanger their safety.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that is a statement of somebody who is a practitioner.  He said it could also be deleterious to the training of obstetricians and gynaecologists in this country.  He makes a point which is interesting, he said</P>
    <P>... respect for the unborn is enshrined in the Hippocratic Oath and was updated in the Declaration of Geneva in 1948, but nowhere will you find references advocating equal rights to the unborn, except in pronouncements <Col N="1131" /> from the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign.</P>
    <P>He goes on to develop the point and I certainly do not intend to delay the Seanad by referring to it in detail.  I will quote one last paragraph to refute the charge of pedantry from Senator Eoin Ryan.  The lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology said:</P>
    <P>It is criminal, it is dangerous, it is wrong, to introduce a law which could withhold accepted medical practice from any woman in this country and people must be made aware of this fact.  This is a dangerous precedent, because neither the law nor the public should be able to dictate to doctors what is best in the field of medicine.</P>
    <P>This letter appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning and it appeared last Saturday in the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ryan for his courtesy and for his attempt in his speech to answer questions I posed.  Having said that the question about the unborn that I had posed was just the outgrowth of a general weakness of academics to be pedantic, he went on to suggest that none of these questions about the health of women was anything but an abstraction. His words were that commonsense would prevail.  He had the courage to state in Vol. 100, column 992, of the Official Report as follows:</P>
    <P>In these very complicated medical situations which were brought before us, the position will be, if this amendment is passed, exactly what it is at present.  No change will be made in the law by this amendment...</P>
    <P>So the answer to these complicated questions that are asked about medical situations is that what has been permitted up to now will be permitted in the future.</P>
    <P>Mr. Meehan is a man who confesses early in his letter that it is with reluctance that he intervenes in this debate at all. He describes his previous situation as a practitioner in England and he begs us in his last paragraph to stop before it is too <Col N="1132" /> late because he considers we are interfering in practices that are in existence at present and that what we are doing has implications for women and implications for the training of obstetricians and gynaecologists.</P>
    <P>I respect evidence like this and I respect the concern of those practitioners who have gone so far as to call a public meeting to discuss the implications for the Hippocratic Oath of having to live with the wording of this amendment.  I find it truly extraordinary as a Senator that one can stand up here and ask for definitions of words, as we are told in the Standing Orders of the Seanad we are entitled to on this Stage of a Bill, and be told by default that it is nobody's responsibility to define words that will go, presumably, if all this farce is brought to a conclusion, on to a ballot paper and appear before the eyes of the citizens. That is a disgraceful denial of our responsibilities as legislators.</P>
    <P>I directed my remarks through you, Sir, to the party who got the wording that they wanted.  I said to them, &ldquo;Whence your phrase &lsquo;the unborn&rsquo;?  Where did you get this phrase?&rdquo; There is no way that we are anything but perfectly in order when we ask what is the legislative definition of this term.  I must conclude from the evidence before me in the editorial of a Catholic newspaper about six months ago which ran an editorial headed &ldquo;The World Awaits&rdquo;, that we are willing to use a word that we are not able to give a precise meaning to, the consequences of which we are willing to live with, despite the clearly demonstrated evidence that it will have an effect on the lives of women, that we are willing to do it for window dressing because of course the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; does have a context. It was brought into discourse here in Ireland from the moral majority in the United States and, as I said on the previous Stage and it is the only repetition I will use, its attraction was its strident moralistic quality, its ability to strike a chord.  Since we moved to Report Stage there is a debate much less civilised than this one going on in the country in which there is an attempt to define the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> On 15 May 1983 the parish newsletter of Kiltoghert in County Leitrim had no difficulty about using the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;. The priest of the day put this newsletter into the hands of everybody who attended Mass.  After welcoming the new Bishop to the parish for his first Confirmation ceremony and describing the bunting in detail, he said:</P>
    <P>To go to a less pleasing topic, we must keep praying for the unborn.  No doubt some will say &ldquo;not that again, please&rdquo;.  That is exactly what the pro abortionists are hoping you will say and that is why they have succeeded in dragging the negotiations on from month to month, hoping in the end to prevent the referendum taking place.</P>
    <P>We are not dragging it on but we have the right for the Seanad record historically to show that at every stage of this debate we sought definitions and answers to questions that had implications on the lives of women and we did not get answers.</P>
    <P>I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>In the meantime their strategy is to confuse and ridicule.  It would be interesting to know how much of the millions of pounds that those American priests told us about a few months back, has already arrived.  Fourteen Senators opposing the referendum! I quote from their leader last week. &ldquo;The tactics practised by the society for the protection of the unborn child are representative of the ugly, bigoted side of Irishness&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I spoke on Committee Stage about the tactics, not the origin of the movement. The newsletter goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The fellow (Michael D. Higgins) doesn't know or doesn't want to know that the Pro-Life Movement began in England by a group of Church of England ministers and members of that Church and that the present international chairman of the movement is the Rev. Alan Robjohn, a Church of England Minister in Cardiff and that the governing body is quite English and substantially Protestant.</P>
    <P>So much for Mr. Higgins' label &ldquo;the <Col N="1134" /> ugly bigoted side of Irishness.&rdquo;  If Mr. Higgins' lies and distortions is of use to the pro-abortion movement then he should apply for a slice of those millions that must be floating around Leinster House those days.</P>
    <P>That was published and given to everybody who attended Mass in that parish since we had the Committee Stage debate under a canon whose name I will be kind enough to spare from the record, and a number of acolytes who are listed. The hyprocisy of this debate is that on Second Stage we asked the justification for this referendum at all; on Committee Stage we asked about the meaning of certain clauses of the Schedule of the Bill and we are given no answers, despite the fact that we asked the questions in the interest of women.  Now on Report Stage nobody is going to define the words and yet there are people who will not only define the words but will go on in their definition to slander and defame as they have for the last 12 years when something progressive was suggested in this country. There are people in the pro-life amendment campaign who would be appalled by a statement like this.  It is to the credit, for example, of Senator Hanafin that early on in the debate on the previous Stage he dissociated himself from tactics like this.  Many other people have written to me to say that anyone who put this into the hands of the public on a spiritual occasion does not speak for them.  Nevertheless, this is what we are assisting; we are willing to say that we debated the matter in the Dáil, we debated the matter in the Seanad, we asked questions which were not answered, and we used words which could not be defined.  We decided, like in the case of a greasy ball at a rugby game, to let the ball off to the people so that we could do some kind of hand washing exercise to suggest that it was not important</P>
    <P>I have thought very carefully of Senator McGuinness' amendment and she, I know, will understand that my position from the very beginning as one of the early sponsors of the anti-amendment campaign was that I absolutely opposed this <Col N="1135" /> amendment.  I described it as hypocritical and unnecessary and people can read the Second Stage record of the debate.  But I am going to support Senator McGuinness' amendment because she is seeking to do something that the representatives of the larger parties are not doing in this House.  She is seeking to do something that will save us from the worst of ourselves. She is at least trying.</P>
    <P>Senator Mary Robinson, as could be expected, gave a detailed series of implications ranging not only from therapeutic practices where doctors have to make choices but to implications in relation to the range of contraceptive methods that will be available and the further implication of the removal of these in relation to its effect on the reduction of the options available to women.  But Senator McGuinness said at least it will not extend this far and I have sympathy for her in another way.  She did not ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The points that I had been making entirely related to the importance of the definition of the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and the conclusions that might follow from the absence of a clear definition. I had begun to explain why I would be supporting the amendment in the name of Senator Catherine McGuinness on Fourth Stage because I felt that it at least had the merit of seeking to limit what, as I mentioned, other parties had left dangerously without definition.  My use of the word &ldquo;dangerously&rdquo; is I feel justified already in speaking of the implications <Col N="1136" /> which can follow and which appear not to move people to want to offer definitions.</P>
      <P>There is another side to it on which I would like to expand, because it has not been touched on by any of the other Senators who have spoken on this Stage so far, that follows from one's failure to define the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.  In a way we are redefining medical practice by a referendum. This is the implication of those who have written in with concern about what will happen if this amendment is passed.  They have asked us to consider the implication of changing medical practice by referendum.  I will go further.  We are not only doing that but we are curtailing the benefits of medical research and therapy by a referendum.  There are many practitioners who have said that they respect their colleagues who are able to speak with clarity and take up a position on one side, other colleagues who have chosen to remain silent and other colleagues who are uncertain.  They raise the question of the wisdom of deciding by public referendum matters about which they as practitioners are uncertain. They go further and say they have no opportunity to discuss formally among themselves the implications of this wording.</P>
      <P>Indeed, it is very interesting to hear from the man who has been quoted &mdash; correctly because of the importance of his contribution &mdash; on what he has to propose to us.  Fergus Meehan, Lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College, Galway, Consultant Obstetrician-Gynaecologist, Regional Hospital, Galway, former Lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Oxford University, said:</P>
      <P>It is not too late for sanity to prevail. This could be achieved by the establishment of a commission of doctors and lawyers with the possible help of theologians to determine the consequences of the wording of this amendment on the practice of obstetrics. Meanwhile, the legislature could suspend the present Referendum Bill until the findings of the said commission were reported to the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> Obviously we are not going to do that. We are not using our opportunity to define the words.  Frankly, I find it appalling that a party that would gloat they had got the wording they wanted and that they originally promised to the people would not first find an obligation on themselves to stand up in either of these two Houses and justify these words taken simply, in combination, taken in isolation or taken in effect upon existing legislation. I find that truly incredible.  I want the Seanad record to record that on this day I again asked questions to which I did not get answers and asked for definitions which were not offered.</P>
    <P>I have little else to say on this stage of the debate but I want to say a few words about why I am supporting Senator McGuinness's amendment.  It is very difficult for me because I began, as I said on Second Stage, a comprehensive oppositon against the necessity for this amendment at all.  I also think that it is in fact rather daft to be affecting certainty.  It is worse: it is ignorant, it is a celebration of ignorance to be asserting certainty where no certainty is possible.  I do not believe a wording is possible or appropriate in matters of such medical and scientific complexity.  It is very difficult for me since the show has passed along this far but I have to recognise on Fourth Stage my responsibilities as a Senator.  I must now accept as fact that the Bill has gone through Second Stage and Committee Stage.  There is at least the merit to the amendment in the names of Senator McGuinness and Senator Ross that it seeks at least to reduce some of the terrible effects of this wording on the lives of women.  As Senator Robinson has said, the wording interpreted in one way will cast a very definite shadow, a whole area of doubt over the availability of certain forms of contraception.  This amendment at least will save us from that and for that reason I intend to support it.</P>
    <P>The reason I have risen to my feet today on Fourth Stage was to say that it was just too easy on Third Stage for a Senator representing the largest party in this country, the party that gets most of the votes of the public, to stand up and <Col N="1138" /> suggest, as Senator Ryan did, that only a pedant would pose the question of the unborn, that in these matters of medical complication, commonsense would prevail. He has not addressed himself to the question: what about the situation where there are differences?  Today the differences are documented for him in the newspapers.  People are holding meetings about the implications of this wording.  I think it warrants a reply.  It demands a reply.</P>
    <P>I conclude with this: it is very important for it to be recorded in the future that we were not pursuing words and their etymological meaning for the sake of pedantry.  Last week I described five clear cases of doubt that could arise for a medical practitioner.  Four of those cases &mdash; the fifth was hypothetical &mdash; were based on actual choices that doctors had described for me as arising in their practice. The questions needed to be answered in the interest of women and it is just not good enough for this House to sit here at any stage and not give answers when answers are prescribed.</P>
    <P>We are at a time when people are unfortunately casting their eyes in a rather scapegoat fashion, at Parliament itself.  They are asking if we are worth our money and the rest of it.  I really think we are not helping ourselves if we say that we have to keep our heads down and not lift them up as we send a mumbo-jumbo of words off to the public and invite their assent for it.  What will follow? Earlier I had no pleasure in quoting from a parish newsletter.  Can you imagine the victory newsletters?  It will be rather like the editorial in the newspaper that I quoted.  It said six months ago:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The world awaits&rdquo;.  I suppose we will have an editorial saying &ldquo;The world is grateful&rdquo;.  But will we be grateful &mdash; a Legislature that sat there and did not define, a Legislature that allowed a referendum without definition to go to the people but, most importantly, a referendum in which it was demonstrated at every stage that the lives of women were being put into danger and that nobody could feel it encumbent upon them to reply?  That to my mind is the debasement of democracy. It is the debasement of Parliament. <Col N="1139" /> It is inviting a scrutiny of ourselves to which we have no moral answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is appropriate that at this stage I should indicate an attitude to the amendment. Let me say at the outset that I accept that the amendment proposed in the name of Senator Catherine McGuinness and Senator Shane Ross is an attempt by the Senators to meet objections that have been raised to the present text because of the ambiguity involved in the use of the expression &ldquo;the unborn&rdquo;.  Senators will be aware from the press statements issued by the Minister for Justice on 21 and 22 April of his efforts to gain acceptance of a clear and positive pro-life formula which would not be open to the very serious defects of the wording now before this House.  Attempts have since been made both in the Dáil and this House to try to clarify the ambiguities inherent in the present text, but without success.  Realistically, I cannot see that this amendment would have any chance of being accepted by the Dáil.  It could result only in further delaying the Bill and this would not be in the public interest. In the circumstances I am not in a position to recommend acceptance of the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief comment on remarks made by Senator Robinson.  She repeatedly spoke of the amendment as being sectarian.  I think it is right that we should place on record the fact that the largest Protestant denomination, the Church of Ireland, has never used the term &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; to describe the amendment.  I quote from a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 February 1983 by Mr. Alan Johnston, Church of Ireland Press Officer:</P>
      <P>today you state that the three &ldquo;major Protestant Churches&rdquo; had called the proposals &ldquo;sectarian and divisive&rdquo;. Whatever may have been said or written by Church of Ireland individuals, at no time have the official channels of the Church used these terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> I quote from the same letter:</P>
    <P>It was in November, and confirmed last week, that we added the comment to the effect that we recognise that the text of the proposed constitutional amendment represented an attempt to take account of the complexity of this subject and of the views expressed by our own and other Churches.  We added that we were in particular relieved that the proposed wording acknowledged the right of the unborn, with due regard to the equal right of life of the mother.</P>
    <P>This word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; in my view is an appalling word to use about this measure. The word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; has been used in recent years in this country to describe the most murderous activity of a bigoted denominational kind.  Must we use this word to describe a proposal motivated by concern to protect life rather than destroy it?</P>
    <P>Finally, may I add my own conviction that we are speaking about a human right?  How can we say that it is sectarian to argue that this right to life belongs to all, not just to some.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank in particular Senators Robinson and Michael D. Higgins who have spoken in support of my amendment.  They have given a very full survey of the questions which are raised by this amendment and have set out, perhaps better than I could myself, the various issues that are raised by it.  I understand very well the difficulties and the heart-searching which Senator Higgins has experienced in coming to the conclusion to support this amendment because they are indeed precisely the same kind of difficulties and heart-seachings that I had myself before I proposed it, because like him, as he well understands, I too, feel that it is a very sad day for this country and a very backward step and a totally wrong thing for us to propose to amend the Constitution in this way at all.  It is not the right thing for us to do but nevertheless, as he has pointed out and as I did in my original speech introducing this amendment, in <Col N="1141" /> the context of our responsibility as Senators, as legislators, and indeed as citizens I feel that it is up to us to try to diminish as far as possible the harm and the difficulties which are being caused by the wording proposed.</P>
      <P>This was referred to in the statement by the Church of Ireland Standing Committee which Senator Hanafin has not read, the one that came after the one that he read out and which I will refer to later.</P>
      <P>It has been made very clear by what has been said that we are totally lacking in a legislative definition of this term &ldquo;the unborn&rdquo;.  It is not good enough for Senator Eoin Ryan and others to say that there is no problem about it and that it is a piece of pedantry to want to define it any further.  It has been quite clear from the public statements made by leading and respected gynaecologists and obstetricians, by leading and respected lawyers and by leading and respected church people that they feel this is totally undefined. There is a total disagreement as to how it is to be defined and, as has been pointed out by Senator Robinson, there is a difference in definition between what appears to be accepted by the proamendment people here and what is legally accepted in other countries such as England and Germany.  It is not a question simply of pedantry to say that we are seeking a definition.  I join with Senator Higgins in saying it is an absolute disgrace on Report Stage of this Bill, on a matter of crucial importance to every woman in this country, that neither the Fine Gael Party nor the Fianna Fáil Party are prepared even to attempt to make any cogent answer to what I have proposed in my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, God help him, reads out from a little piece of paper which says that he admits there are defects in the wording.  Knowing the Minister of State well, I know he is well aware of the defects and feels them just as much as I do.  He is too good a lawyer not to, but he says that there is no purpose in supporting my amendment because it would only have to be returned to the Dáil, that this would result in further delay and would not be in the public interest. How is the Minister of State or whoever <Col N="1142" /> it was who wrote the script for him to know what is in the public interest?  I have argued all along, as have many others, that it would be in the public interest that this House &mdash; where this Bill has been properly debated, as was stated by Senator Brendan Ryan, in contrast to what happened in the other House &mdash; should reject the Bill.  It should amend the Bill to try to improve it at least a little.  To send it back to the Dáil, even if it only resulted in further delay, would at least show the public that there are problems. It would at least make it clear to them what they are voting for or voting against.  Perhaps a change of heart might come over the people in the other House, having read the words of wisdom that came from this House, and they might even change their minds and vote for amending the Bill and carrying a further definition into it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has admitted that great efforts have been made to reach a different wording from what is proposed in the Bill.  Surely by delaying the matter for a while we might give them a chance to see the light as it were and to accept a wording like this.  I cannot see how the Minister can argue that it would not be in the public interest to have further thought about a matter of such crucial importance.  It has become more and more clear at each stage of the debate that no one is prepared to define these words properly or to give us any reasonable argument about how they would affect the law as it stands, apart from pious ejaculations, if I might put it that way, saying that it will not affect matters as they stand, that it will not change anything about contraception or about present medical practice while, at the same time, producing article after article by their own legal experts to show precisely how the law can be changed if this wording is being brought in and how people's lives can be made a misery by some such change.</P>
    <P>On the other side we have Senator Hanafin's contribution.  To give Senator Eoin Ryan his due last week he made some attempt to talk about the definition problems even if he did not deal with them properly.  Senator Hanafin confined <Col N="1143" /> himself to dealing with the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; and while it is an important issue it is not in my view the crucial issue in the matter.  He is perfectly justified in quoting Alan Johnston in saying that the Church of Ireland did not use the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo;.  The Church of Ireland did not use the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; because perhaps it did not want to create a divisive approach to this matter.  It wanted to try to deal with the matter in a rational way but that does not take away &mdash; and Senator Hanafin is trying to obscure this &mdash; from the fact that in every one of their statements the Church of Ireland stated firmly that they were totally opposed to using the Constitution in this way to try to deal with complex moral and social issues.  They repeated that before the wording came in.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that in the Dáil Fine Gael Deputy John Kelly suggested that if only the Protestant churches had spoken out at an earlier stage this whole thing might have been done away with.  They spoke out before any wording was suggested. They said they thought this was the wrong way of dealing with it, that it would not solve the human problem and that it could create legal difficulties.  When the first wording was issued they acknowledged that some effort had been made to cope with their difficulties which was fair enough, but they continued to assert that this was the wrong way of handling the matter and that no amendment would be preferable to any wording.</P>
    <P>When the Fine Gael wording came out they again studied it.  I can assure the Seanad, because I took part in these studies myself; they spent many hours and listened to much evidence from their own medical advisers, their own legal advisers and from their own theological advisers. They did not just look at it and say &ldquo;We will say this and we will say that&rdquo;.  They sat and consulted and discussed the matter for long hours before they issued any statement and when they issued the statement on the Fine Gael wording they said they felt that this wording was preferable. This is the statement that Senator Hanafin does not appear to have read.  They said the Fine Gael wording was preferable <Col N="1144" /> in that it left a degree of freedom to the Oireachtas which they felt was proper order in a democracy.  While they accepted that an effort was made to meet their points in the Fianna Fáil wording, when the second wording came out they felt that it went further towards meeting their points but, again, they reiterated that no amendment would be better than any amendment because they did not see that it would deal with the human situation. They did not see that it would improve the legal position and said it was the wrong way of dealing with a complex moral and social issued.</P>
    <P>To debate whether or not they use the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; is the sort of pedantry of which Senator Higgins is being accused.  It is not so much the use of the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; as the fact that I suppose this is the hung church that is being referred to, the church that is not such a small minority and not a majority.  The hung church has totally opposed this amendment on basic principles and when it dealt with the wording it was dealing with the wording in the same sense as I am dealing with it today and as Senator Robinson and Senator Higgins are dealing with it.  They are trying to use their responsibility as citizens.  This is precisely what they said in their statement that as responsible citizens they had to comment on what wording was put forward. Whether they called it &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; or not is a quibble.</P>
    <P>I will say a few words about the position of women in this situation.  Senator Robinson has very well covered in the quotation she used from Dr. Andrew Rynne and from the briefing document from the Anti-Amendment Campaign the actual medical facts about the loss of fertilised ova by natural means and the unreality of thinking of the fertilised ovum as being a human life which can be provided with legal protection and constitutional protection.</P>
    <P>What has, perhaps, been passed over too easily is the number of women who are actually involved in the threat to methods of family planning.  This is something that was referred to by the Minister for Health in his contribution in the other House.  He had obviously done careful <Col N="1145" /> research in his Department to find out the kind of numbers that were involved. As was stated in the document that Senator Robinson referred to from the anti-amendment campaign, in 1981 alone 2,500 Irish women were fitted with intra-uterine devices.  These are the women who, largely speaking, have had children already; they are women who are moving into middle years and who cannot take chemical medical contraceptives, with whom the pill is contra-indicated because of high blood pressure, because of age and so on.  At the same time, they are the very women who are bringing up children.  If we take away this safe, cheap and easy method of contraception from them they are the ones who will get unwanted, unplanned pregnancies, and pregnancies in later years of their fertility when the chances of their having children with Down's syndrome or other defects are very much higher than they would be when they have their families in their younger years.</P>
    <P>If they become pregnant at this stage their fears are more real and more realistically based than the fears of a younger woman.  Therefore, if we take away, through a wide definition of &ldquo;unborn,&rdquo; the kind of contraception that is available to them we are pushing ourselves into a situation where they will be the people who may very well be trying to seek abortions in England and who will add to the abortion trail, making for more abortions rather than fewer.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the low dose pill where this pill is prescribed precisely because other pills have a risk of creating blood clots and so on in older women. The same argument applies there.  I suggest that by accepting my amendment &mdash; I cannot see how in principle it should really worry the legislators in this House &mdash; we will at least ensure that these women are medically safeguarded.  Certainly, if members of the Roman Catholic Church feel that they should not use these methods of contraception because they believe they attack the fertilised ovum and that the fertilised ovum ought not to be attacked in this way, nobody is forcing them to do so.  This is part of the whole extraordinary <i>rationale</i> of this amendment: <Col N="1146" /> the idea that we must use the Constitution, we must use the legal system, we must use the force of the State to make people do things which maybe in the conscience of some people &mdash; if it is in their conscience, nobody is forcing them to go outside their conscience; nobody is making them have an abortion; nobody is forcing them to use a type of contraception which they do not like.  On the other hand, the pro-amendment people are envisaging forcing other people's consciences into their mould. This is one of the difficulties I am trying to get out of by my amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan said that the constitutional crusade is dead and it is replaced by a dangerous crusade.  Indeed, I would absolutely agree with him there. When he says that I have touched the Tory in him, knowing Senator Brendan Ryan, I think I have achieved an enormous amount today in this House.  If I can achieve that surely Senators can pass my amendment.  It would not be more of a miracle than touching the Tory in Senator Brendan Ryan.  I really feel I can congratulate myself on this, but I feel that he is being a little unfair when he says that I am putting forward the theological perceptions of my own Church. As he said, my Church is a &ldquo;hung Church&rdquo; on this situation.  They have not issued statements about their theological perceptions about when life begins nor have they defined it.  They have left that to the individual case, medical advice and so on.  Certainly a number of Church of Ireland gynaecologists, including the Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the College of Surgeons, Dr. Browne, would say that he felt that human life began at implantation but that is no more than me speaking as a Protestant.  It is not the voice of the Church.  Therefore, it is not correct to say that I am, as it were, putting in a Protestant sectarian amendment to meet a Catholic sectarian wording.  I have backing in the legal system of other countries and in the carefully argued statement of the English legal authorities about the morning-after pill suggesting that the moment of implantation is the time to choose to decide if an abortion is taking place.  Certainly there <Col N="1147" /> has been no statement by any Church of Ireland theologian saying that, categorically, implantation is the time when life begins, or anything of that sort.</P>
    <P>When Senator Brendan Ryan suggests that if my amendment is accepted it will definitely lead to the defeat of the referendum in the country, that was not my original idea.  Perhaps it might not be a bad thing.  If we pass this amendment and the referendum is put with my wording to the country and the original pro-amendment people come out against it, it will show very clearly where they stand as opposed to where the Legislature stands.  That would be important from the point of view of the voters.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Higgins greatly for his support of my point of view and my amendment, particularly as I know the philosophical difficulties which he experiences in doing so.  I was very stuck by the news letter which he read out and the occasion at which it was produced, at a Confirmation ceremony.  I thought perhaps with the departure from the scene of Bishop Lucey of Cork we had ceased to see Confirmations being used as quasi-political platforms.  Obviously I was wrong.</P>

      <P>The Sunday after the Confirmation, I am sorry.  I have teenage children of my own, and I know a great many other teenage children who are their friends.  Children who never thought about the issue of abortion are now discussing it in grim detail, going around with pro and anti badges, discussing the whole situation, discussing it in their school classes, discussing it in all sorts of places.  I suggest, and I have as good an authority as Fr. Fergal O'Connor of Ally to back me up, that far more people consider abortion as an acceptable alternative since this debate started than ever would have beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one issue I would like to deal with here before I conclude.  It has been suggested to me that if this amendment is put to the House and defeated it will <Col N="1148" /> give an indication to the Supreme Court that they should interpret the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; to mean from the moment of conception and that I will have damaged my cause as it were by putting forward such an amendment and allowing it to be defeated.  I recognise the sincerity of the people who are putting this to me but I cannot really agree to saying that I will not seek a vote for two reasons.  First of all, the courts are not, in fact, bound by what we say in this House or in the other House when debating legislation.  They are bound by the actual wording and they must interpret the wording, not what was the intention behind the wording or what people have said in the debates about the wording.  They must interpret the actual wording.  This is where I think they will have a major difficulty.  Secondly, as I said at the beginning one of the purposes of my amendment is to try to make it clear to the people who will vote, what exactly they will vote for.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about appeal to democracy by those people who want the referendum.  We keep on hearing it said, &ldquo;well what is wrong with putting it to the people and letting the people decide.&rdquo;  When we say &ldquo;put it to the people&rdquo; what exactly do we mean by that?  Do we mean that the people should have a clear understanding of the issues involved, that they should consider these issues carefully and that they should then cast their votes in full understanding of what they are voting for or against?  Do we mean that people who have been flooded with propaganda of the type referred to at the Sunday after Confirmation in Kiltoghert or the great deal of other propaganda of the sort that has been referred to in earlier debates, propaganda which most insidiously sews the idea that all who oppose the constitutional amendment are baby murderers?</P>
    <P>Let us face it, that is the kind of propaganda that has been put around, that these people should be swept into the polling booths by sermons and by leaflets in their churches and that they should enact a constitutional amendment, the implications of which they do not understand at all.  It is very clear that they do <Col N="1149" /> not understand it, because whenever we have what are called box pop interviews on the radio or on the televisions with ordinary people in the street, it emerges very clearly that they have not a clue as to what it is about.  I took part in a television programme which put forward the different wordings and the constitutional amendment to various people in the street &mdash; it was run by the religious affairs department of RTE &mdash; and it was very clear from the answers that they got that people did not know what it was about or what they were voting for.  One of the ladies interviewed said: &ldquo;Well, what I do not understand is why do they have to go away to England to have this; why cannot we do it in Ireland?&rdquo; Obviously she was a lady who believed in buy-Irish goods, have Irish abortion and do not send these things abroad.  If a perfectly ordinary woman could misunderstand the situations to that extent, what are the voters going to vote about?  I do not think it is democracy in any real sense if, say, you throw out to the people something that the Government party will not define, that Fianna Fáil will not define, that nobody will define.  When we come into this House, ask these questions again and again and do not get answers, how are the ordinary people supposed to understand it?</P>
    <P>My amendment is aimed at making the situation clearer.  If my amendment is accepted the people will understand better what right to life they are being asked to preserve.  If it is rejected then, at least, we can say clearly to the people, who will vote that what the pro-amendment people are asking them to vote for is not a continuation of the law as it stands, not a continuation of medical practices as it stands, not a continuation of the present methods of family planning but for a change in the law which will make these kinds of things impossible, which will <Col N="1150" /> make post-rape treatment impossible, which will make various forms of contraception impossible, at least which will open the doors to doing this.</P>
    <P>I feel that any answers that we have got about this wording have been simply trying to diminish the legal, medical, social and other difficulties that are inherent in it.  I would go back to our responsibility as legislators and I would suggest that the two major parties in this House, today in particular, when faced with the question: &ldquo;Do you define this thing in a way that is medically and legally understandable or do you not?&rdquo; have simply opted out of their responsibility by not giving any real answers to why they should oppose this amendment, why they should accept it or what their attitude to it is.  They stand condemned before the people of this country as totally irresponsible as legislators when they sit back and say nothing except get up and mumble about the use of the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; or the fact that this will delay the matter and that will not be in the public interest. That is why I intend to press for a vote on this amendment and to let it be seen who precisely stands for what in this debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing this amendment I will do the same as I did on the previous one, introduce it with a brief speech and retain the right of reply so that I may deal with any points that arise during the debate. I am glad the Minister is present.  I realise that other business prevented him being here earlier this afternoon but, perhaps, as has been suggested by Senator Higgins, myself and other Members, now that the Minister is here we may get some answers to the questions we have been raising.  My second amendment seeks to delete the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; before &ldquo;rights&rdquo; and put in &ldquo;prior&rdquo;.  This may seem to be in a sense a negation of suggesting the right to life of the unborn in saying that the mother should have a prior right but <Col N="1155" /> when I explain what I have in mind it will become clear that in no way am I trying to say that the unborn do not have rights or that their rights would be overruled in all cases.  There are cases, and these cases do arise despite the efforts of all to pretend that they are non-existent or can be ignored, where there is a definite conflict as to actual life between the mother and the foetus.  Saying we have equal rights is medically difficult or impossible to decide and legally speaking is unjustifiable.  If we have people with equal rights how do we decide whether we should preserve the life of the mother or let the mother die and preserve the life of the foetus?</P>
    <P>It is important that we should sort out this question.  I would consider that there are real worries in this area about the danger to life of mothers.  Last week on Committee Stage, Senator Eoin Ryan said virtually that no one could possibly imagine a doctor letting a mother die because of a legal quibble or because of the amendment.  I have a lot of sympathy with what Senator Eoin Ryan said and on a practical level he is probably right but that is not to say that it is not asking doctors simply to act outside the law, rather asking them to act in a way that they see as humane but do not see as legal.  This, again, is the question of an Irish solution to an Irish question, like in the area of contraception, where we bring in a law which is supposed to say one thing, and we all whisper behind our hands, smile and say that is not the way it will work out in practice; we will not really do this.  As a lawyer I have great objections to this procedure where we bring in a law and at the same time say to people that they do not need to take too much notice of that; we will go on in our own old way whether it is legal or not. Jurisprudentially speaking we want a law to be accepted by people, to be respected by people so that people will think it is their duty to obey the law, not their humane duty to get around the law.  It is a very bad precedent to put in front of the public that we are saying we will create a law but we know perfectly well, of course, those of us who are in the know, that this law will not necessarily be <Col N="1156" /> obeyed.  Then we say to people, it is evil to evade taxes; it is evil to park a car in the wrong place.  How can we expect people to respect the law if we are setting the example as legislators and saying we bring in one thing but, of course, we know that something else will happen. By bringing in this amendment I am trying to make people face up to the reality of things, that there are situations where we decide between the life of the mother and the life of the foetus.  That includes what are known as the Catholic exceptions of ectopic pregnancy and uterine cancer because these, as I will point out later, are not legal exceptions, they are simply theological exceptions.</P>
    <P>Despite what Senator Eoin Ryan says that no doctor will stand aside, that commonsense will prevail and no doctor will allow a mother to die because of the amendment, it is nevertheless true that many leading doctors, including those quoted by Senator Higgins and myself earlier, have expressed doubts about the legality of present practice if they are faced with this amendment.  Among these is the Master of the Rotunda Hospital, the oldest and one of the leading maternity hospitals here.  Surely, we must pause to question what we are doing if the Master of the Rotunda is prepared to stand up and say he would have grave doubts about the things that are practised in his hospital now if the constitutional amendment is passed.  These are the cases I referred to last week where mothers are suffering from acute high blood pressure and kidney disease, where one has to decide at about the twenty-fourth week of the pregnancy whether to remove the foetus by caesarean section and thereby ensure the survival of the mother while putting the foetus at risk; while it may survive, it may not survive, on the other hand, making sure of the survival of the foetus and leaving the pregnancy carry on virtually condemning the mother to death.</P>
    <P>I would point out that when we are talking in terms of hospitals, maternity hospitals and what is done in hospitals, we are not just dealing with leading obstetricians, leading gynaecologists, family doctors and so on: we are dealing <Col N="1157" /> with hospital administrators and nurses. If we look into this we will find that hospital administrators and nurses here exercise a great deal of power in hospitals. One has only to look at the situation of the common contract which was brought in by the Department of Health and see what has happened in the what I would describe as Catholic hospitals where we have the position of leading respected doctors going along in St. Vincent's Hospital and saying: &ldquo;I want to sign the common contract&rdquo;.  They are told by the administration of the hospital: &ldquo;You may not sign this contract because Archbishop Ryan says you may not&rdquo;.  I have raised this important question in the House before.  Hospital administration is very heavily influenced by considerations other than the good of the patient, considerations of what they see as being morality.  The fact that one's doctor says one should have such and such an operation does not necessarily mean that one will actually get it in many Irish hospitals. Very often the reason why one does not get it is the reason of other people's morality, not medical needs or the person's own conscience but what other people say and the other people are not necessarily the person's doctors.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies with nurses. Several cases have come to my attention, and the attention of one of the Ministers of State in the Minister's Department, where a woman's doctor recommended say a hysterectomy and she was sent to a hospital to have that carried out.  Her doctor may be clear as to what she needs and she may be clear as to what she needs but the nurses in the hospital have said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are not going to carry this out because this woman is too young; she could still have more children; we are not going to do this and we are objecting to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we bring in this Constitutional amendment as worded we not only create difficulties for the doctor but we also put it into the hands of hospital administrators and nurses who feel that way to say: &ldquo;All right, you may think doctor that this lady's pregnancy should be terminated but we think that this is unconstitutional; we think that this is illegal and, therefore, <Col N="1158" /> we are not going to do it for you, or we are not going to give you a theatre to do it, or we are not going to facilitate you&rdquo; and so on.  It is essential that we make clear in the legislation we pass that in a situation where the actual life of the mother is threatened she has a greater right to life than the foetus.  It may be suggested that I am arguing theologically wrongly but I do not think I am arguing socially wrongly.  Apart from the women, I ask any of the male Members of this House, most of whom are husbands and fathers, whether they would actually stand by in this situation and say: &ldquo;I want my wife to die&rdquo;.  I do not believe for one instant they would and I have talked to quite a number of them about it.  Members who have very strongly justified feelings about abortion in this situation would not press the matter saying: &ldquo;Kill my wife&rdquo;.  That is what we are talking about.  It does not, perhaps, occur in an enormous number of cases but if it is one's wife it does not matter, or one's mother it does not matter if it is one in a thousand or one in ten thousand: she is still a person.</P>
    <P>In all the speeches on this subject it has been presumed that the mother's life will be saved.  It is presumed that the law will not be changed.  It is presumed that we can go on dealing with ectopic pregnancies, kidney disease, high blood pressure and cancer in the way we have done it all along but this is a very big presumption to make.  I am suggesting we should make it quite clear that that is what we want, not that we should just leave it hopefully and say that perhaps the courts will decide this or that.  The courts are there to interpret the wording that is put before them.  They are not there to listen to Senator Eoin Ryan who has said in the debate that any doctor is bound to preserve the life of the mother, or to listen to any one else who says the law will not be changed.  They are there to interpret the wording as it is put in front of them in the light of legal argument put to them in a particular case.  The legal argument put to them has to be based on the actual interpretation of the wording.  The legal argument cannot go into saying that the intention of so and so was this or the <Col N="1159" /> intention of so and so was that.  If we are not willing to he quite clear about this. are we just pretending to ourselves that we are going to say in this situation the mother's life will be saved or are we really envisaging a situation where we are going to say, well, perhaps, the mother's life will be saved and, perhaps, it will not be saved?  If that is what we want, that is what we should state clearly.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach expressed fears about this and said that the enactment of the present wording before the House would, possibly, endanger the lives of mothers it is obvious that he was quite sincere in saying this.  However he was attacked fiercely in particular by the doctors who are attached to the pro-amendment group.  They said they were absolutely convinced that what they were doing was not at present illegal.  They said they were absolutely convinced they would not have to change their own practice and so on but I would point out first of all that these doctors are not legal experts but they may be medical experts. They know perfectly well when they should be preserving the life of their patient, and they are doing so, but they are not legal experts and they do not know whether what they are doing or what they would do under this amendment would be legal or not.  Secondly, virtually the entire of their argument is based on this double-effect theory which may well be theologically sound but certainly has absolutely no effect in ordinary civil law.  It does not mean any more than if I said when I shot a man, I really did not mean to shoot him, the effect I was intending was to create a nice air hole in his chest.  That does not get me off the hook of accepting the normal consequences of what I have done.  Equally so, if the normal foreseeable consequences of what one has done is to kill the foetus than one must be accepted as intending that.</P>
    <P>One cannot say, because of the theory of double-effect, I did not intend it.  As far as that is concerned to an ordinary person, as opposed to a theologian or a doctor who is steeped in theology, this does not really make ordinary sense.  If <Col N="1160" /> one wants to see what it looks like to, perhaps, a sort of cynical eye those Members who read this sort of magazine or might try reading this sort of magazine should try reading the current copy of <i>In Dublin.</i>  In that publication Nell McCafferty has written an article about this kind of theory saying, &ldquo;Ok, if you have an ectopic pregnancy so you remove the fallopian tube; you do not actually touch the foetus so you cannot be said to be killing the foetus.&rdquo;  But, of course, you are leaving the fallopian tube on one side and letting the foetus struggle to death in it.  Of course, that is not abortion because one has not actually killed the foetus.  I cannot see, any more than she or most ordinary people can see, that that is not an exception to the rule about abortion. The double-effect theory seems like that to those of us who are not surrounded by clouds of arcane theological casuistry.</P>
    <P>These doctors may very well be wrong in law.  They probably are wrong in law. I am suggesting that by accepting this amendment we should make certain that in these cases where medical necessity requires that the life of one or the other, the mother or the foetus, has to be chosen we should make sure it is the mother's life that is chosen.  I do so for the reasons Senator Robinson mentioned earlier this afternoon.  Are we to place the life of the fertilised ovum at the very beginning of pregnancy in the fallopian tube as being of greater value than the life of the mature woman?  I do so also for the social reason that very often the mother we are talking about is a mother who already has children of her own who need a mother's care and would be deprived of their mother if she was allowed to die for this kind of reason.</P>
    <P>It will, obviously, be said that I am scaremongering, as was said of the Taoiseach, that I am creating a problem that does not exist, that I am exaggerating about what is going on, but I do not think I am.  The idea in law of saying that X and Y have equal rights is something that is very difficult to litigate.  How can a court decide between X and Y who have equal rights?  What can they do but stand aside and say well, we have to leave things happen as they are.  How can they say <Col N="1161" /> one must take this action or one must take that action if they both have equal rights?  On this account I am suggesting that if we replace the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; we are still talking in terms of the actual life of the mother.  We are not suggesting by this wording that we are taking into account all sorts of other factors; we are just talking in terms of life.  We are deciding in these cases where there has to be a choice that the choice should fall in favour of the mother. This has been tacitly or openly accepted as normal practice and as being desirable by both sides of the House and by large numbers of the medical profession.  I am simply suggesting that we should put this into law rather than leave this definitional gap again, leaving the whole thing as an area of doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express the general reservation I expressed about supporting the previous amendment in the names of Senators McGuinness and Ross.  My reservation is that I find it very difficult to justify supporting particular changes in wording when I have already said I believe that in this matter it is almost impossible to draft a form of wording that would be acceptable. From the very beginning I opposed the referendum on this matter on the basis that I felt it was not socially justified, was not requested by a representative section of society and because of its dangers.  I want to list that general reservation again but I want quickly to assure Senator McGuinness that again on this occasion it is my intention to support her amendment.  I will give some of my reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage of the debate I specifically stated cases that might arise in which a decision would have to be made.  I sought at that stage of discussion of the Bill assurances that no interpretation of any word, or combination of words, of the measure proposed or, indeed, its effect on any existing legislation or its effect in practice, would be such as would militate against the lives of women.  I did not get an answer to that. When I say that I do so with the greatest respect for a Senator present.  Senator <Col N="1162" /> Eoin Ryan who made an attempt to answer me.  I should like to draw the attention of the House again to a letter published this morning in <i>The Irish Times</i>, May 25 from Fergus P. Meehan, Consultant Obstetrician-Gynaecologist, Regional Hospital, Galway, Lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynacology, University College, Galway, and sometime lecturer in obstetrics and gynaecology at Oxford University.  In that letter he lists the situations I listed last week.  My reason for supporting Senator McGuinness on Report Stage is that I feel at least her amendment goes some way to removing the atmosphere of fear to which testament is now given by the letter of Mr. Meehan.  That is asserted by the fact that obstetricians and gynaecologists from all over the country have decided to meet to discuss the implications of the wording for their practice.  I suggest that one piece I have not quoted from Mr. Meehan's letter is extremely helpful in making a decision on whether or not Senator McGuinness' motion should be supported. He said:</P>
    <P>I am also perturbed by the impression which might have been given following public statements by eminent colleagues that the present practice of obstetrics will be unchanged by this amendment.  The very nature of the wording of the amendment ensures that that cannot be.  No other country has considered giving rights to the unborn such as are proposed.  That is not to say we are wrong; rather must it be considered as original thinking which could be wrong.  In giving equal rights to life to the unborn, we will embark on a policy that has never been adopted by any country in the world to date and there must be consequences of that action.  Philosophers and moral theologians from the dawning of Christianity have not been so brash, nor has the Catholic Church, in its wisdom, throughout its existence, expected us to accept equal rights for the unborn.</P>
    <P>Then he went on to ask the question I have already quoted:</P>
    <P>I ask the question &ldquo;is the right to life <Col N="1163" /> of the mother to be jeopardised in the interests of an unborn, who we, as doctors, know cannot survive outside the mother's womb?&rdquo; I, as a doctor, will say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but where then do I stand <i>vis-á-vis</i> the law, which may soon demand equal rights to life for both? Justice is one thing and the law is another.  Unfortunately, the law is not always just.  Is it not unthinkable to expect doctors to rationalise in terms of law first and medicine thereafter?</P>
    <P>He invites doctors to stand apart and consider the consequences of the new wording.  Let us be perfectly clear here. Even if, for example, a doubt was sown in the mind of a doctor it may delay treatment for a woman.  At its wildest it may delay treatment that would have an effect on her life and an effect on her future health.  I use that last word very carefully.</P>
    <P>Equally, apart from the question of delay, there is the whole question of the structure of interpretation if we do not put in the word as suggested by Senator McGuinness.  Who is, for example, to give the definitional interpretation in a maternity ward in a hospital?  Will the master of the hospital interpret these strange words for everybody practising in the hospital?  Will some authority outside the hospital convey to the practitioners how these words are to be interpreted? I ask myself as a member of a health board, how will the health boards of the country interpret these forms of words and how will they communicate that interpretation to those who will work in the hospitals under contract?  What will be the interpretation of that?  It is very clear.  Dr. Meehan says:</P>
    <P>The new wording must ensure that the principle of the double effect will now be applied to both the unborn and the mother, with possible disastrous consequences.  To state that this will not change the practice of obstetrics is foolhardy.  Some colleagues say it will not and I say it may change our practice and not because we wish to have it changed but because the law states we must change.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> He goes on:</P>
    <P>... this new proposed amendment. There could be a change in the management, or delay in the treatment, of a patient to her detriment.  The public have a right to be informed and doctors and lawyers have a duty to provide this information.  Politicians are no less ignorant of the facts, as evidenced by their behaviour to date on this issue. Most important, from the patient's point of view, if this amendment is accepted, it will result</P>
    <P>this is the most important part&mdash;</P>
    <P>in numerous possible interpretations of the law so that a doctor's hands could be tied, preventing him executing his duty to his patients as he does now, without breaking the law.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment could result in conscientious doctors in this country being forced to practice in a fashion which is different from the accepted medical practice pertaining to the treatment of certain conditions throughout the world at the present time.</P>
    <P>He moves on and invites us to give this matter further thought.  These are not my concerns; these are the concerns of the practitioner who will have to live with these words if passed.  Senator McGuinness is seeking to at least remove some of the cloud of doubt that will surround the position of women after the passing of this amendment.  It is just not good enough to simply say, as was said on Third Stage, &ldquo;I have every confidence that common sense will prevail&rdquo;.  Women are entitled to more than speculation as to the future of common sense in a hospital. At present the medical community are themselves anxious to discuss these matters and are very careful as to what they assert as certain, and we are, remember, trying to control medical practice by referendum.  Whether we could do it by legislation is arguable but at least there is a merit in Senator McGuinness's amendment in that we are invited this evening to consider the implications and seek to change the wording, as she does, by identifying and reducing <Col N="1165" /> somewhat the uncertainty that may exist in relation to the position of the mother. Another thing which her amendment will do is remove the spectre of doubt, recrimination and uncertainty from the obstetricians and gynaecologists.  If a person, like Mr. Meehan operating according to the Hippocratic Oath and within the Declaration of Geneva, 1948, anxiously trying his best to work and live in the interest of his patients, is forced to write to the newspapers to ask us to leave this situation alone and we say that we know better, what then happens if this wording is passed unamended?  I repeat my question: how will health boards interpret it? Who will interpret it within the wards of hospitals?  What will be the relationship, for example, between somebody who is in charge of a department who takes one interpretation and a doctor who takes another?  Will a doctor who takes one interpretation find himself competing for the loyalty of the nursing staff?  What about the different views of an administration who might move towards one interpretation or another?  We are creating confusion where we had the ethical sense and the judgment of the medical profession.  We are moving into an area where professional ethical judgment was being exercised with tremendous humanity from all the evidence available to us, and we are choosing to invite the public in a referendum to express an opinion that we are making superior to that.</P>
    <P>From the contributions so far it seems unlikely that other Senators will refer to the Irish text, but I will do so.  The day that this goes on a piece of paper to be put before the citizens of Ireland we will not only have made a mockery of women's rights but we will have abused the Irish language in the process.  I will quote the Irish language version:</P>
    <P>Admhaíonn an Stát ceart na mbeo gan breith.</P>
    <P>We did not get a definition last week of the &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; and I noticed no linguist springing to his or her feet to tell me how the &ldquo;mbeo gan breith&rdquo; might be more easily defined than by the English &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> Admhaíonn an Stát ceart na mbeo gan breith chun a mbeatha.</P>
    <P>I presume they are plural&mdash;</P>
    <P>agus, ag féachaint go cui do chomhcheart na máthar chun a beatha, ráthaíonn sé gan cur isteach lena dhlíthe ar an gceart sin agus ráthaíonn fós an ceart sin a chosaint is a shuíomh lena dhlíthe sa mhéid gur féidir é.</P>
    <P>It is taking the existing position of a woman who is in hospital and putting it, at best, in some form of equality to an undefined, unanalysed, asserted</P>
    <P>na mbeo gan breith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the authoritative text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Better people than I have expressed what the medical consequences will be.  We cannot say we did not know them before we vote on Senator McGuinness's amendment.  They are in the papers; they are before all of us but there is a vagueness in the Irish version that is insulting to the language itself.  It is ill-defined, badly worded.</P>
      <P>chun a mbeatha.</P>
      <P>Is it plural?  Is it singular?  What is it?  Is it eggs in one form or another?  Through all of this we will seek to give an equal right to a woman who may be experiencing difficulties.  Despite my general philosophical reservations for voting for any reformulation of this badly drafted exercise, for that alone I will support Senator McGuinness's amendment in this case.</P>
      <P>Another side of it which is appalling is that it goes on to suggest that it will balance and arbitrate between all of these unexpressed, unexplained rights with its laws.  What is meant by that?  The amendment invites us to put in one clear word which would at least remove some uncertainty from the position of mothers and will remove the ghost of competing interpretations and recriminations from the medical profession.  It invites us, on page 4, line 30, Schedule, part II, to delete &ldquo;equal&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;prior&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask those of us who are fathers of children and who have lived with and <Col N="1167" /> loved women, how can you accept in 1983 a mish-mash of words like that, and say at the end of the day as the woman goes off to the maternity hospital in any one of four or five cases of difficulty to which no answer is forthcoming, that common sense will prevail?  We have gone to the trouble of discussing in both of these Houses a porridge of words and incurred the cost of having a referendum.  We had all this so that we could feel that little bit more uncertain and so that the doctors could feel uncertain as women went in to maternity wards.</P>
    <P>It is worse than that, and I insist on extending it to its logical absurdity.  What of the position of, for example, a woman who needs treatment for a form of cancer and indicates that she will not have another pregnancy?  Does she then negotiate this with her husband?  What if he says &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  What if anything goes wrong with her life?  Of course, the &ldquo;mbeo gan breith&rdquo; must be taken into account.  I find it in 1983 in the month of May appalling that we are not willing at least to grant that little mitigation represented in Senator McGuinness's and Senator Ross's amendment of the horrific uncertainty into which we are putting women and the medical profession.</P>
    <P>I must say that perhaps I will get a better answer tonight.  I do not want people to say to me: &ldquo;In my hospital nothing will change&rdquo;.  I repeat my question of last week: does this mean that some people are writing to the papers to say that they will put a flag up over the hospital so that mothers will know that no matter how the law changes things in this hospital will be by the decision of the master?  Does it mean that the practices will change in accordance with the new wording?  Does it mean that, no matter how the wording is changed, some other practices will prevail and people will break the law?  Does it mean that if they decide on all this subversive activity that the head of the hospital will then invite everybody who works in the ward to join him or her in this great subversion of the law?  Will we say, as I suspect, &ldquo;We went through all this in the Dáil and Seanad and in the referendum and you and I <Col N="1168" /> know that, despite the fact that we had to do it, things will not change&rdquo;?  I believe that that is the most subversive view of all in 1983.  Worse than that, it is not only subverting the parliamentary process in this country at a delicate time.  It is profoundly anti-woman. The proposed amendment says:</P>
    <P>Admhaíonn an Stát ceart na mbeo gan breith chun a mbeatha agus, ag féachaint go cuí...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Cuí&rdquo; has a particular meaning in Irish. In loose translation I suppose the more usual use would appropriately be one formal word.  There are other uses of it. It means &ldquo;cosy&rdquo;.  You can be cosy &mdash; cuí.</P>
    <P>ag féachaint go cuí do chomhcheart na máthar chun a beatha, ráthaíonn sé gan cur isteach lena dhlíthe ar an gceart sin agus ráthaíonn fos an ceart sin a chosaint is a shuíomh.</P>
    <P>Agus a shuíomh &mdash; there is another word. &ldquo;A shuíomh&rdquo; is translated clearly to any linguist as seeking to establish.  I worry about this interpretation in Irish.  Is it, for example, taking an existing right of a woman and suggesting that it has been made tenuous and has to be re-established after the establishment of some right to the &ldquo;mbeo gan breith&rdquo; that has not been defined?  That is the kind of rubbish that we are putting before the people in a referendum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>So when all the indefinites are put up in the sky as by a clown in a circus we will keep hoping that none of the balls will fall down to the ground.  Senator McGuinness used a very good phrase in moving this amendment.  She referred to arcane theological casuistry.  When the Wilkes, husband and wife, re-visited here to give a kind of additional shot in the arm to the pro-life amendment campaign, they decided that the double effect was a marvellous thing; that it would answer the question of the danger to the <Col N="1169" /> mother.  So you had little groups all over the country, some attended by my wife who is a mother, being told: &ldquo;You do not have to worry because of the double effect, you know&rdquo;.  We talked at night about this double effect.  To somebody representing a university constituency in this House it is a disgraceful day when out-of-date, old teaching, which is correctly described as theological casuistry, becomes a principle of justification in legislation.  We live in a world that is defined by our inter-actions with each other and the basis of our legislation must be social, but in 1983 we are reaching backwards and rattling out our old ghosts, old, long neglected, theological dances on the heads of pins and suggesting that these become the basis for our legislation.</P>
    <P>The alternative is there.  I know there will be problems if this amendment in favour of the prior rights of the mother is carried.  Despite any religious beliefs of any Members of this House I suggest that the evidence is all round us in relation to mothers in difficulty that we should use a social basis for our legislation.  If this changes the existing situation &mdash; and I believe that it would and that Senator McGuinness would acknowledge that it would &mdash; I am willing to make that change if it goes somewhat in the other direction. There is the other case that perhaps all the dancing on the head of a pin could take place after this amendment was carried, and people could say: &ldquo;Well, I do not have to because I believe in this, that or the other&rdquo;.  That would be better than if the wording goes through in its present form.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, in a way I feel a little hollow because I am supporting an amendment to put in a word, to delete the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo;.  In my support there is a desperation that I have had in this House for two weeks now at questions that have been supported by a prominent obstetrician-gynaecologist and that nobody in this House will answer.  These questions are not pedantic or academic, and they affect the security at least as a minimum of women who go in difficulties into maternity wards.  I will thank Senator McGuinness then that when the House <Col N="1170" /> disgraces itself, when the larger parties will not give definitions or answer the fears of women, at least in the amendment put down by her and Senator Ross we would have a minimum of security, the damage would be lessened and the medical profession would not be dictated to.</P>
    <P>In a sensitive matter which obstetricians and gynaecologists debated, we are seeking to look at what some will call the most democratic expression that you can get.  We are talking about the right to life, but is it all so simple that you can with a stroke of a pen decide on what will take place in a maternity ward?  The medical profession have begged us to reconsider. I repeat again the words in the last paragraph of Mr. Meehan's letter:</P>
    <P>Give some thought to the fact that it is quite probable that the wording of this amendment could be interpreted as discriminating against conscientious doctors in the accepted practice of modern obstetrics.</P>
    <P>He asks us to think again about the implications of what we do at present for what would be possible in the future by way of treatment and we decide at our peril to blunder on.  I repeat, as a challenge, that anybody who does not answer precisely the fears of women in this regard will in voting against this amendment be voting in an anti-woman way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The positive statement in the proposed amendment acknowledges the right to life of the unborn.  There is already in the Constitution a right to life of the citizen.  If it were left at that it would be up to the Supreme Court at some subsequent stage to balance the right to life which is being proposed to be given to the unborn with the right to life of the citizen.  There would be a clear conflict in this situation.  A subsidiary statement is necessary at least to allow current medical practice to continue.  My views on this have been made clear previously. I believed it was possible to do this without involving matters of principle by a clear, pragmatic statement that <Col N="1171" /> interventions necessary to save a mother's life would not be unlawful.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to what I said on Committee Stage in the Dáil on this matter. I began by saying:</P>
      <P>It is very easy to be misunderstood on an issue like this.  I am very well aware of the fact that people's thinking in this respect can be influenced by the fact that they believe that the right to life in both cases is intrinsically equal. It is no part of the case that I am making that the wording should express a different principle.  In my view it does not need to do so, but I continue to believe that, if it expresses with clarity what its sponsors intended to mean, then, without purporting to express any principle on the matter it should have acknowledged that in certain circumstances certain forms of intervention would not be unlawful &mdash; that is to say, that the law of the State would not intervene to stop such interventions. That would involve no statement to basic principle as to the respective values of the two lives and therefore no conflict with basic principles which very many people hold as sacred.  It is so well known as scarcely to merit repeating that there are many things which in the Judaeo-Christian tradition have been universally regarded as wrong but which, for good and sufficient reasons, the law of the State does not declare to be unlawful.</P>

    <P>I put that proposition and I think the House knows the results of that.  The sponsors of the amendment before us have a duty to answer the questions I raised with the Opposition spokesman on Justice, the former Minister for Health in Dáil Éireann.  If it is not to be left entirely to the Supreme Court to balance without guidance the existing right to life of the citizen with the right to life now being proposed in the Constitution &mdash; the right to life of the unborn &mdash; then there is an obligation on the sponsors of this form of wording to explain clearly why the exception was not made with clarity if the subsidiary statement is meant to be an exception. <Col N="1172" /> If it is simply a case where a court will decide to balance the rights in a subsequent interpretation, then why say &ldquo;with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo;<i>et cetera</i>?  There must be some reason for putting in the phrase and not simply leaving &ldquo;the right to life of the unborn&rdquo; there to be interpreted in balance with the right to life existing in the Constitution for the citizen.  If it is there, it is there for a purpose and it means something.</P>
    <P>I would ask the main Opposition party who now are the <i>de facto</i> sponsors of this form of wording, to explain exactly how the rights are balanced in that subsidiary phrase.  I made the point previously and I will repeat it, that it is possible to put in a subsidiary phrase which says that where medical intervention is necessary to save the life of an expectant mother, alternatively to prevent the death of an expectant mother that that should not be unlawful. There is no statement of principle there.  It is a pragmatic, <i>de facto</i> statement that the laws of the land would not intervene and it is not being offensive to the principles of any religious group in this country.  However, that was not accepted and did not get a large level of acceptance.  Senators know that as do the proposers of the amendment before us, and I accept that the amendment before us, by Senator McGuinness and Senator Ross, represents a further attempt to meet the objections to the present wording. It is not the alternative that I personally would favour and for that reason and the reasons I have already outlined, there is no indication either in this House or in the Dáil of a change of mind on this issue. For those reasons I cannot recommend this amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I paused to allow some official spokesman from the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad to respond not only to the questions we mere Seantors have been putting but also to the very personal questions put by the Minister, but as yet nobody is volunteering.  Perhaps when they have reflected a little on the Minister's questions we may get this yawning, gaping vacuum filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in a somewhat mellower mood <Col N="1173" /> than I was earlier this afternoon for the simple reason that I am fortunate to live close enough to Leinster House and during the break between 6 o'clock and 7 o'clock I was able to get into my car, drive home and go out into the garden to play with my three children.  It is a marvellous experience to get away from the atmosphere in this House.  As you know a Chathaoirligh, as somebody who spends a great deal of time in it, the atmosphere in this House at times can be truly deadful.  There is something wrong with the atmospherics and they are not helped at times by the debate.  There was a point this afternoon &mdash; and I sense this was something shared by my colleague and co-feminist Senator Michael Higgins and also by other Senators who are not getting answers to questions &mdash; when I felt a rising sense of frustration and bitterness and it was cooled and balmed &mdash; if that is the right word &mdash; helped at least, by the sheer sanity of playing in the garden with children but I was necessarily thinking of the continuation of this debate this evening and of the next amendment.  Thinking about this amendment necessarily drew together the threads of the kind of debate that we are having.</P>
    <P>It is important to restate, as Senator Higgins did, that my support for this amendment is the qualified Fourth Stage support of somebody who is still utterly opposed to the kind of proposal we have before us to amend the Constitution, and I am more opposed now than I was at the start of the debate because I have had more time to read and reflect and I have had the opportunity of listening to other people who have made their contributions. As I sat in the garden or ran round and played with my children I was struck by the absurdity of the situation that this amendment tries to redress.  Effectively, in so far as we can understand it, in the absence of any authoritative explanation the amendment of the Constitution which is proposed would equate the mature life of an adult women, or indeed a teenager who becomes pregnant, with a fertilised ovum.  I thought it was about time we had a new movement in Ireland in which we could have all kinds of paraphernalia <Col N="1174" /> associated with it, something like ERA, equal rights amendment in the United States.  We could have something called equality of the fertilised ova, the EFO movement, because that is what we are talking about, equality with fertilised ova.  In a hospital context, where the life of one or other is on the line, neither gets preference.  That is what we are talking about, no preference to the life of the mother.  The Constitution does not express a preference.  It posits the balance as being an equal one.  As has been pointed out by very reputable medical people, by lawyers and by an increasing number of women I am happy to say, that is not really a very satisfactory situation for women.</P>
    <P>This has brought me into a broader context.  I recall not so very long ago in this House in the context of social welfare legislation, objecting, as a married women, to the fact that I am legally the dependant of my husband even though I have worked before and since I married. I am the legal dependant in law of my husband and that has all kinds of consequences in the area of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance etc.  It is a blatant, overt discrimination which by the end of December 1984, if we comply with our EEC obligations, we will have to change.  I object to being the legal dependant of my husband as a matter of law and I object to the way that it discriminates against me and other married women in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I also recall not so very long ago introducing a Private Members' Bill in this House objecting to another form of discrimination against married women, that I automatically, whether I like it or not, take the domicile of my husband.  If my husband decides to go to Australia and live there, I suddenly, by some magical formula, become domiciled in Australia even if I remain in my house which is sufficiently close to Leinster House to be able to go and play in the garden during the break.</P>
    <P>These are aspects of a broad and pervasive discrimination against women that we women try not to get used to, because <Col N="1175" /> it is important that we do not get used to them, that we do not accept them, that we constantly try to change our society, to ensure that it is a richer, fuller life for all citizens in this country.  I think that for the last decade the general movement in our law &mdash; it may not have been moving very fast &mdash; has been in the general area of promoting greater equality, of improving a conditioned role in society which has bred all kinds of legal, social and economic discriminations.</P>
    <P>It did not occur to me ten years ago or five years ago or, indeed, until approximately two years ago, that it was conceivable or possible that we would be faced with a proposal to amend the Constitution in such a way as to put in equal balance on the scales the mature, pregnant women, or the young, immature pregnant woman &mdash; because the statistics show a growing number of teenage pregnancies &mdash; and the fertilised ova.  We still do not know if that is precisely what the amendment means.  The previous amendment put toward in this House did not meet with the approval of either of the main parties in this House.  This must lead to the conclusion, as far as legislators are concerned, anyway &mdash; whatever about the Supreme Court in due course &mdash; they have not accepted the previous amendment which sought to exclude from the scope of this constitutional right to life which is put on an equal footing with the right to life of the woman, and then we are left with two possible alternatives as far as legislators are concerned, the more likely interpretation being that the right to life of the unborn is to be deemed to exist from the moment of conception, from the fertilisation of the ovum.  The other possibility, of course, is that the right to life is much later, either at the quickening or viability at some later stage, and this is still an interpretation which is open to the wording of the text as has been pointed out particularly at Second Stage of this debate.  But it looks certainly as though in the minds of Members of this House, of a majority of those who voted in this House and presumably in the minds of Senators who abstained on that vote, the <Col N="1176" /> intention is that, as far as the legislators are concerned, the vital point in the cycle would be at the time of conception itself and, therefore, we can have a whole new women's movement or anti-women's movement in Ireland.  We can have banners and badges, equality with a fertilised ovum, EFO, which must rank with GUBU as being one of the most absurd, not only legal but also constitutional, proposals that this country has had to face.</P>
    <P>The fact that it is so far along the line without getting far more adverse reaction from women individually and collectively in the country indicates that we do not have as yet in Ireland a sufficiently organised feminist movement to counter this kind of proposal.  It may be indeed that it will emerge in a sense out of this kind of debate and out of this kind of proposal. Finally, there may be a broader based women's movement which will be able to organise and to oppose collectively and with much more structure and stamina a proposal of this kind, because certainly a very significant number of women's organisations have opposed this amendment, organisations like Cherish, and the Rape Crisis Centre and indeed the Council for the Status of Women.  Perhaps that shows the limited power that they have in the country and certainly in the political power structures.  They have a very limited possibility of influencing the way in which a measure like this will take hold and work its way through the process.</P>
    <P>There was criticism of the debate in the other House that there had not been any significant participation by women Members. I think, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, that you would agree with me that that certainly cannot be said about the debate in this House.  The debate has shown a very active and a very concerned participation by women Members.  That is understandable. Men have and are entitled to have a view on these issues, but they do in a very intimate way concern women, especially women of childbearing age.  I would say that if the proposal before the House today were to equate men at that point of possible life chances with a fertilised ovum, the attendance here this evening and the focus on this debate might be a <Col N="1177" /> good deal more acute.  It is not, in fact, men who are on the line in this debate. It is not men whose basic rights and relationship to the foetus and motherhood and all the other aspects of it are under a very direct consideration.  Therefore, it is perhaps understandable that the debate in the Oireachtas would tend to reflect the very substantial imbalance in participation between the sexes.  That is not to say, because it is not true even in this House, that all women representatives would be against this amendment.</P>
    <P>You, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, made a speech, obviously a very sincere and committed speech, in favour of the wording of the text.  The issues that we are discussing and the detail in which it is necessary at Report Stage to discuss them are issues which are of prime social, medical and emotional concern to women. Men, on the whole, tend either to switch off or get embarrassed.  I heard a few jokes downstairs in the bar about my contribution on the other amendment and the medical detail which I had gone into.  They were snigger jokes.  It was a matter for nudge, nudge, snigger, snigger, all that talk about the fallopian tubes and so on &mdash; imagine that on the records of the Seanad.  It causes a certain embarrassment. It is not the kind of thing we should really be talking about in this way.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing in a way about this debate &mdash; and what struck me very much as I played in the garden with my children &mdash; was the absence of full discussion of the issue.  The people who are discussing the issue in this House are the university Senators.  There is a great yawning, gaping silence from most of the Senators in this House on the issue.  They may say they are not lawyers or doctors, but they have both the opportunity, more of an opportunity than Members of the other House, and indeed the responsibility to bring together the information.  The information is there, whether it is in letters that Senator Higgins was referring to or in briefings or in booklets or in factual material that has been made available or in the representations made by the various church groups or organisations.  The information is all there in accessible form but, for reasons that go deep into our <Col N="1178" /> political, cultural psyche, it is not the kind of issue we like to talk about.  It has probably been painful to some Members of the Seanad that there has been quite so much talk about an issue relating to human sexuality and to the fertility cycle. Senator Brendan Ryan developed this to a considerable extent at Second Stage.  I agree with him that we, as a nation, prefer not to have to in any way rationalise or discuss these issues.  When it comes down to being equated with a fertilised ovum, it is time for some rationality, some commonsense and some down to earth reality.</P>
    <P>If the present wording goes through unamended, the Minister for Justice has raised the question that arises again this evening in the House.  He has put that question and we will see whether it will be answered.  He admits that doubt is there.  Some may think it is only a shadow, others, and I would agree with these others, think that it is a real danger and problem for women in a life-death situation and why is the opportunity not being taken to clarify that?  Do we not matter at all?  Is it not at least arguable that if that doubt is there and genuinely felt, that it is a doubt that should be answered. The way in which the Minister for Justice put his question in his brief and obviously well-prepared contribution in the debate this evening is fascinating.</P>
    <P>It is an appalling abdication for a Minister for Justice, but he is caught in a difficult situation.  He said that there was an obligation on the sponsors of this Bill to explain why they have not permitted the inclusion of some formulation which would ensure that in a situation where the two lives could not be saved, the life of the unborn in this context and the life of the mother, that there would be guidance on saving the life of a pregnant woman.  Not alone is there no guidance, but in fact there is an expressed equality of right which prevents preference.  If he as Minister for Justice with the advices that are available to a Minister in his position is as serious as he sounded in putting that question, that in itself is a very worrying reflection on this whole process by which this Bill is going forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> It is incredible that the Minister of a Government who has prime responsibility in this area of law change would in a rather pleading and almost pathetic way ask the Opposition why they will not allow or accept the necessity for a further provision, making is clear that in case of serious risk &mdash; he even used the formulation and I quote from my note of what he said: &ldquo;It is possible to put in a subsidiary phrase that if medical intervention is necessary to prevent the death of a pregnant woman that any steps taken would not be unlawful&rdquo;&mdash; the Minister for Justice thinks that is necessary.  In other words, he accepts that it is not there at the moment.  He accepts that there is a risk to the life of a pregnant woman in those situations.</P>
    <P>Take, for example, the figures the Minister for Health gave a few weeks ago about the number of ectopic pregnancies. There were 500 performed in 1982 in Ireland.  Obviously none of us knows all the details of each of those cases but if we posit that in a number of those cases the situation would arise where there was a possibility of there being a choice between one or the other and under present practice, as indeed present practice blessed by the Catholic Church as an exception, there would be no doubt as to what the medical steps taken would be, but now, because of the constitutional amendment, the doubt is not only there but the constitutional amendment gives no preference at all to a woman in that situation.  Therefore, I believe that a good part of the time in the run-up to a referendum &mdash; since it looks as though there will be a referendum on this proposal &mdash; will have to be taken to alert Irish women to the full thrust of this proposed amendment.  It is not a question of the usual kind of legal discrimination that I was talking about, that women are legally and necessarily and by definition dependent in law on their husbands, or that they legally and necessarily by definition take the domicile of their husbands or that there are discriminations in various aspects of their lives and their economic opportunities.</P>
    <P>This is a great deal more serious.  This <Col N="1180" /> is a situation where they face greater risk, because of this constitutional amendment, to their very lives, where a woman's life is equated to a fertilised ovum and they are given no preference in the Constitution and they are then dependent on speculation in this House, as Senator Higgins has said, about whether or not commonsense will prevail. Commonsense about what?  Commonsense operates in a sensible situation where it is possible to exercise sensible judgments.  We are talking about a situtation where the Constitution and fundamental law of this country are being changed deliberately without providing for that commonsense formulation which the Minister posited here this evening.</P>
    <P>This is not just a step backwards as has been described.  This is a giant leap backwards into obscurantism and the sort of attitudes that must have prevailed when there was very little access to written laws and it was the high priest who decided what the law was and they could pronounce in that sort of way.  We really are doing an extraordinary thing.  There are quite a number of Senators who resent the fact that the debate is taking a bit longer than they had estimated but I wish we had the stamina to debate this for about another ten years without it going through this House.  Then perhaps sanity would prevail and time would have allowed for the necessary reflections, because in a way what we badly need is time.  The Minister for Justice says he wants some formulation to protect the life of the mother if her life is threatened as a pregnant woman.  He wants that; he said he could not get it and he wants an explanation from the party whom he calls the sponsors of this Bill as to why not.</P>
    <P>He then says that he does no accept the amendment put forward by Senator McGuinness in which she is proposing that instead of talking about the equal life the wording would be the prior life.  To a very considerable degree, what Senator McGuinness is proposing is precisely the commonsense that is being sought on this issue, that in a life-death choice situation commonsense would prevail and the mother's life would be given priority over the life of the fertilised ovum.  For <Col N="1181" /> some reason which he did not elaborate or explain at any length, the Minister does not accept that proposal though it appears to be very much in line with his concern.  He admits the problem but does not like the solution to that problem proposed by Senator McGuinness.</P>
    <P>What does he do?  He appears to be going to accept that his group, which is the largest grouping here in the Seanad, once again will heroically abstain on this issue, and let this dangerous text go through.  When this dangerous text, which threatens the life of pregnant women, has gone through both Houses, the Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, has told us that he will make a statement and he will warn how dangerous it is.  I really need to go back to my garden and ponder that some more because I have lost the thread of how this country is being run, when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice are seriously worried about the scope, extent and context of this legislation and yet the party to which they belong, the largest in the House, are heroically abstaining on the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Their leader, Senator Dooge, in a pragmatic contribution at Second Stage, explained that in his perception it was in the public interest at this stage to have done with it, have shut of it, that there had been enough talk about it and the sooner it went to the people the better. That is also very interesting, because either Senator Dooge is of the opinion that the Irish people are more discerning and more alert to the risks and dangers of this text, will be able to sort out the complex issues involved and vote against the amendment and, therefore, avoid this dangerous risk to pregnant women in Ireland or else, despite the expressed concern again here this evening of the Minister for Justice, the expressed concern and language of the Taoiseach that it will put women's lives at risk, they are prepared to allow it to go to a referendum and to become law.  I am prepared to put up with certain legal insults but it is the limit that for political, short-term opportunist reasons, we are not apparently going to do the right thing.  We are not going to put this messy Bill back into the <Col N="1182" /> Dáil, and if there is not agreement in the Dáil on a precise formulation then let it drop or let it go, as Senator O'Leary, the Acting Leader of the House, has said, to an all-party committee or preferably to a non-political expert body to examine all the ramifications.</P>
    <P>I never thought the day would come when the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach would admit that a proposal would cause danger to the lives of women and that where they have a possibility of defeating it in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas they are not taking the responsibility and the opportunity to do that.  Of course it would take up time and of course there are other problems, but is there anything that is more important? Senator Higgins has said that we are relatively insignificant and unimportant in real terms and that although there is a grave danger to women of child bearing age, the necessary steps are not being taken to delay this legislation.  The absurdity is that this legislation is not necessary for any practical purposes.  It is not going to achieve the prohibition of abortion.  That already exists under the criminal law.  There is no external pressure or priority about it.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister's speech was at least a contribution and an indication that as Minister for Justice he still believes that the existing wording of the proposal in the Bill poses a direct life threat to pregnant women in certain circumstances. It comes very close to a kind of licensed murder.  If you know that the text of a Bill that is going through the Oireachtas can cause serious danger and a practical threat to the life of a woman and prevent present medical practices being continued and if you seriously apprehend that and do not use every stage of a parliamentary process to oppose it, you may feel that you are only using those stages to buy time and to let it go back to the other House for further consideration.  Is it not important to buy time?  Getting back to the <i>rationale</i> of Senator Dooge's speech on Second Stage when he concluded, and presumably the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party in the Seanad concluded, that it would not be in the public interest to delay this &mdash; how <Col N="1183" /> can you conclude that?  How can you conclude that it is not in the public interest to delay this if you are seriously concerned that it may threaten the lives of pregnant women?  It seems to be totally irreconcilable.  This is not a pragmatic matter that does not concern life-death issues: this is the most fundamental issue of all concerning the life chances of pregnant women.</P>
    <P>The debate is performing a useful service because it is beginning to clarify with deadly precision the issues that are involved.  Perhaps that is why the Minister for Justice in this House this evening listening to the debate decided to intervene and to signal as Minister for Justice that he is still concerned and to entreat the party that is a sponsor of this Bill to explain why they will not allow the addition of a formulation to ensure the prior right of the mother when her life is threatened. That is all this amendment seeks, the prior right of the mother where her life is threatened.  That apparently is not going to be accepted.  One takes this from the silence of the Fianna Fáil group.  As I rose, nobody from the Fine Gael group was offering.  So far there has been silence from them also and perhaps the women of Ireland should conclude that only the University Senators and the Labour group care.  We are the only ones who are sufficiently worried and concerned.</P>

      <P>Yes, but your contribution to the debate is not as authoritative if, as a result of your contribution, you do not do something about it.  For example, how do I view the present worry of the Minister for Justice?  He said effectively here this evening that he was deeply worried and that he wants a formulation which would protect the life of a pregnant woman in a situation where <Col N="1184" /> there is a choice between her and the fertilised ovum or embryo.  Obviously, this is a matter which is causing the Minister for Justice a lot of pain and worry and yet if he is concerned how can this be reconciled with not using the normal parliamentary process to buy time and afford a further opportunity for consideration by sending this measure back to the Dáil?  Is it not the most incredible expediency that is at the root of the Fine Gael decision to abstain?  The Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs was here this afternoon for part of the debate and she said that she views this measure as being dangerous to women.  One can talk about GUBU and unprecedented situations but this is the first time in my parliamentary experience that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs have said on the record that a particular measure is potentially dangerous to the life of pregnant women; not to their economic outlook, their social standing or to their job prospects, but to their lives and yet they are not going to use the measures available to them as a Government to prevent this particular formulation from going forward to the people in a referendum.</P>
