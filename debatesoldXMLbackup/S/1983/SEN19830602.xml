      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The continuing hunger strike of Nicky Kelly, a prisoner in Portlaoise prison, now in the Curragh Military Hospital.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Ryan's question, it seems to me that the best thing to do is to wait until the lunch break to see if we have reached Committee Stage and we could then make a decision.

      <P>Since speaking here last night on the tax position in the country under this Finance Bill when I outlined that we have so many protests going on that we are putting our country into a dangerous position, I was glad to see that Professor Thomas Rafferty in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> has followed very much the same lines.  I said that I was a taxpayer, a PAYE man, but I understand full well the frustrations of PAYE people.  As against that, having made the point that we are paying too much tax, we can tear ourselves apart.  This is one of the problems we are facing at the moment.  There is the whole question of people bashing one another &mdash; farmers, self-employed and PAYE people &mdash; and it is time we stayed together and tried to keep the country together.  There is no point in having freedom if we are going to throw it away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would criticise two former Ministers in the other House who spoke yesterday, one of whom wanted the buoyancy resulting from the upsurge in the economy to be used in advance.  We learned enough about buoyancy, and the man who played a leading role in buoyancy back in 1977 is listening to me.  He will not remember that I asked him a few questions in Carlow. <Col N="1445" /> At that time he was much more important that I was.  I did not believe in the policy then because from my point of view financial incest just does not work. Pound notes cannot produce little pound notes in your pocket.  It was more or less the idea that money was going to be chasing itself around in people's pockets. Buoyancy is a great trick if it works and if an economy is really booming there is an amount of buoyancy.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister to ensure that there is an economic upsurge and that there will be buoyancy before we start spending in advance again.  I am amazed that a former Minister should have come up with that idea.  We have learned enough about that the hard way.  He reminds me of the advertisement for &ldquo;spring-sprong&rdquo; biscuits long ago where people were bouncing up and down.  He does not seem to be able to sit down in the Dáil anymore.  He is pregnant with ideas, although his own Ministry was not very good at the time.</P>
    <P>It is so easy to oppose all forms of taxes and at the same time we go on asking for more services.  We cannot have it both ways &mdash; I will not use that famous word again &mdash; but it is a contradiction.  We want more services but we are not prepared to pay for them.  People are protesting over everything.  According to today's news one of the leaders of the insurance companies described the 1 per cent tax as being savage.  From his point of view it is savage but other people feel that they are not paying enough.  The banks feel they are paying too much. Everybody is paying too much and wants more services.  We want to make sure that every part of the country is booming.</P>
    <P>There are one or two items in the budget that I am not too happy about.  I worry that at a time when the country has been spending beyond its means we might be in danger of discouraging people from saving.  I worry that the reduction from £70 to £50 in the amount of interest free of tax could be a slight disincentive, or a worry for people.  If people are able to save, and it is not easy with the inflation rate, they should be encouraged to save by every means possible. <Col N="1446" /> There could be two people in the same job getting the same salary, one of whom spends freely and foolishly while the other saves in order to pay for his own funeral.  The second person might pay tax on his savings, having already paid tax on his income, but the other fellow who does not bother his head saving at all will probably get a State funeral at everybody else's expense.  I would like the Minister, in the future, to have another look at the whole concept of encouraging savings.  From talking to people in the banking business, I believe that most deposits are in the form of small savings and large deposits of hundreds of thousands of pounds are rare.</P>
    <P>The other worry I have concerns the question of £65,000 houses and £20,000 salaries.  I am not sure how easy it is to achieve equity as between two houses, one in the city and one in the country. They might be exactly similar in size, and have similarly coloured bricks, but simply because one is in a certain place it might be worth £65,000 while the house in the country would not be worth that much at all.  People usually buy modest houses when they get married but inflation catches up and the value of houses goes up.  It is a completely different position if somebody goes out and builds a house for, say, £100,000.  He obviously has money.  People may start off in a £30,000 house and over the years its value may rise but they are not in a great position to pay anything.  It was said yesterday by one of my colleagues, that a £20,000 salary means that people are in a position to pay a lot of tax but at that stage they are moving into the bracket where their pound is worth 35p or 45p.  They are in the position where they have to pay for everything.  It is doubtful if people in the middle income bracket are able to pay for much any longer because they have to pay through the nose for everything. The position is that we could all find ourselves in houses that are going up in value.  I know it is inflation-linked so perhaps that will prevent my worry from becoming a reality.  However, it is not something that I am happy about.</P>
    <P>There was never more need for patriotism. Patriotism demands of the Opposition <Col N="1447" /> that the opportunity to score political points should, for the sake of the country, be left aside.  If there are to be Dáil committees, one Dáil committee that could do a lot of good for the morale of the country would be a Dáil committee on patriotism where young TDs from all parties &mdash; I say &ldquo;young&rdquo; deliberately because older TDs may be set in their ways &mdash; would be able to rally the people as a unit.  Young TDs may be able to tell them that we cannot tear the country apart, things may be bad at the moment but by pulling together we will get out of this situation and in a few years time things will be better.  We cannot have the normal political carry-on that has continued for years where the Opposition oppose and the Government try to govern. We are at a stage where we need the best of all parties and while national Governments do not work in peacetime we certainly want the most constructive criticism that is possible.  You do not have to abandon criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will even include Senator Lanigan for his third attempt to interrupt me in my speech and I congratulate him on his consistency.  He did not train a hurling team for nothing.  I played football in my day, so I am equally tough. I will include everybody in the criticism. I am genuinely trying to be constructive because we need patriotism in the real sense.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, it is very easy to march to Bodenstown and to Arbour Hill to honour people who did what was good for the country in their time.  We also must do what is best for posterity and we will be judged on what we do.  Futile and useless criticism will not be of any benefit to us and we will not be remembered for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> I would suggest that we try to rally our politicians and get them to urge people to pull together to avoid divisiveness. Perhaps this time next year things will have improved and we will be able to look forward to a better country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have here a Finance Bill that holds many worries for a number of people.  Maybe the Government should indeed read it again and tread lightly at a very awkward time in our history.  I love the line of the present Minister for Finance&mdash;he seems to think he is the greatest thing since the sliced pan and that we never had an honest Government or an honest Minister for Finance until he hit the Front Bench.  Our foreign debt has increased by £370 million purely due to devaluation, £270 million more being owed by the Exchequer and £100 million by semi-State bodies. This should be made clear.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the various provisions of the Bill and he referred to the advance corporation tax which falls due six months after the end of the accountancy period.  He said that following the enactment of the Finance Bill he would then consider representations with a view to determining whether changes in the Act would be appropriate in the context of the 1984 budget.  I do not even pretend to understand finance but he is enacting the Bill and then he is going to talk to people about what he has already put through.  Maybe he does not expect to be Minister for Finance when the budget of 1984 comes around.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is obsessed with the life of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if we could have a balance in spending.  Here my own party in Government made mistakes and I am big enough to admit them.  They are still being made.  We heard quite a lot in the past few days about school transport. I am not going to play politics on this issue but surely that was a dreadful mistake, admitted afterwards by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployment figures when we left office were around 169,000 and they <Col N="1449" /> are now 188,000, roughly 20,000 more since November.  I worry about the leaving certificate students who are sitting for examination this week or next.  God be with the days when you could talk to somebody at intermediate certificate level and ask what he or she intended to do on completion of the leaving certificate. Now there is no place to go.  I pity the school leavers and leaving certificate students and I also feel sorry for the teachers.</P>
    <P>Something that continues to baffle me is this 1 per cent levy for the Youth Employment Agency.  Maybe some of my colleagues know but I cannot get an answer as to where that £80 million is spent.  The workers and the people who pay this levy are quite entitled to crib and ask why they are paying it.  There has been another levy since and there may be another levy coming up.  We are all paying this levy and we should be told how it is being used by the Youth Employment Agency.  Minister Kavanagh put through this measure and at the time, because of my involvement with youth I thought it was good, although I had reservations which I expressed and I still have them today.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne made reference to parading to Bodenstown and laying wreaths and all the rest of it.  We will have to stop vote catching and hammering the employer all the time.  It is a good vote catcher to hammer these people but we must remember that the employers take risks also.  It would be a good thing if we saw some of their bank balances, it might suit the tax man to look at the black side but by heavens he would want to look at the red side as well and see the chances some of these people take.</P>
    <P>This is getting into the area of allowing the tax men from the Department of Finance to go in and look at all that we have and all that we have not.  I do not mind personally if they look at what I have.  The tax is stopped here before I get my cheques so I have no worry.  There was an Ard-Fheis recently where a delegate stated &ldquo;We know they have the money and we want it&rdquo;.  If we are elected politicians we cannot accept that kind of thing.  I see no sign of any help to certain <Col N="1450" /> sectors of the deprived and I have a serious worry about the health cuts.</P>
    <P>The Minister in this magnificent new style is like a robot.  You just push him to the front seat, he tells us there is a Finance Bill before us, that he will listen to all our suggested amendments but that it does not make any difference because he will take out his Finance Bill the way he brought it in.  He really is the best thing yet as a Finance Minister and he will do all the right things that the officials, his back-up boys, tell him.  There is no sign at all of a human side even in his reaction to any of the amendments.  He just had his mind made up and that was the end of it.</P>
    <P>I will make reference here to the health field.  I am a member of a health board, like Senator Ferris, and we rarely agree, but he is smiling at me anyway.  I am sure there are other members of health boards here as well.  I had reservations at the time when we in Government regionalised health and I have been proved right. I opposed Minister Childers bitterly on regionalisation and now I see the end result of it.  I say it here and I do not mind who takes a poor view of me that we have a progressive Minister for Health at the moment and maybe a Minister who is not afraid to take up something when a mistake has been made.  It is crazy to have to cut back his allocation when it means that there is a shortage of nurses and we cannot get the beds to take the people off the corridors of all our hospitals.  That is common to Clare as well as to any place else.</P>
    <P>I would make a special plea to the Minister for Education to take another look at the question of remedial teachers. We did not even have enough of them and now we have fewer.  A letter from the Department of Health dated 30 August 1982 called for a reduction of staff of 2 per cent by 31 March 1983 and a further reduction of staff of 3 per cent by the end of 1985.  The Department of Health have demanded a staff cut of 5 per cent in mental handicap service.  On top of the Government embargo of recruitment this will certainly lead to a weakening of the present position.  It is difficult to accept repressive measures at <Col N="1451" /> a time when we should be trying to consolidate and complete the delivery of a service.  This is the mentally handicapped field in which I serve and there should not be cutbacks in this service.</P>
    <P>I could go on and refer to other cuts but this is a specific cut of which we are all aware.  The health boards are affected by the general embargo on public sector recruitment which stipulates that only one vacancy in three may be filled.  The disabled person's maintenance allowance was increased, as was the disabled person's rehabilitation allowance but two other payments, the domiciliary care and mobility allowances remained unchanged.  I will give credit for an increase of almost 12 per cent in the disabled person's maintenance allowance and the blind welfare allowance but there is no allocation for an increase in the allowance for severely handicapped children.</P>
    <P>The Bill shows a great lack of knowledge about the people in this small nation today such as the unemployed, the business people who are paying their tax, while everyone says they are not, and the industrial sector where the workers and the employers both pay their tax.  We should be grateful indeed to the people who work and pay their enormous contribution when we are talking about patriots.  Surely these are the ones who keep us all going.</P>
    <P>I must refer here to something that does not hit the big shot but hits the ordinary people, that is, the extraordinary new belt at the building societies.  It is a good thing to put on the record of this House the role of the building society in every town and village.  They help people to get homes.  The bigger people can go into banks and get all the money they want for these big posh homes but the building societies help the people in the middle bracket.  They go in and they deposit their money.  It is important to note that there are three-quarters of a million deposit accounts with building societies in Ireland today.  It would be dreadful if this Finance Bill did anything to damage that movement.  There is a great deal of worry among people down <Col N="1452" /> the country who are saving small amounts of money &mdash; their few quid &mdash; and they hear this talk about phone tapping and secrecy, knowing that the Department of Finance officials can walk in and look at post office accounts, bank accounts and building society accounts.  It is really worrying to the ordinary person because people do read the papers in the country. I am not saying that what is in the papers is always the right story.  Actually, looking at the front page of this morning's paper about the £1,000, one can see that they certainly get their headlines wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In all fairness, it is £1,000 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>These people do read the papers and they do listen to the news and we will find that they are not going in any more to the building societies or the post office but putting the few quid under the mattress.  I would ask the Minister to confirm in regard to section 66 of the Finance Act of July 1982, which confirms the budget increase on petrol and road diesel, that this increase will not be passed on to the passenger.  Has the position changed since or is it now about to change?  That is a direct question for him.</P>
      <P>It worries me enormously when I see a prison being mentioned in a Finance Bill.  This is certainly something new.  We have seen it all now when we are talking about putting people into prisons through the enactment of a Finance Bill.  It is an absolute joke because I believe there is a queue at the moment to get into jail.  It is a case of having to get into the queue to get in.  It is a case of one being released and another being told to be ready to come in.  The Minister has a new client ready to join the queue.  Arising out of provisions of the Bill he is going to put more people into the queue to go to prison.</P>

      <P>I suppose that in a peculiar way he is saying he is going to build <Col N="1453" /> more prisons.  We are always told how unimportant this House is.  Having seen the pile of amendments to the Bill on Friday, tabled by the Government and the Minister for Finance, I believe we could describe it as the Alan Dukes (Amended) Finance Bill, 1983.  He has the advantage of having the assistance of officials and a back-up team but we are supposed to understand the amendments such as those referred to in column 266 of the Dáil Official Report of 27 May. There are other speakers anxious to contribute and I will not delay the House but I hope the points I made will be considered although because of my opening remarks they may be ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Bermingham, to this House.  Most of what I have to say on the Finance Bill is concerned with its employment effect or how far it goes to recognise the problem of unemployment.  I have chosen to do that deliberately because as I read the debates in the other House, and as I listened to the opening of the debate here I noticed that Members made what I regard as concerned references to the problem of unemployment. The question I have to ask myself about the Finance Bill therefore is to what extent it is an adequate recognition of the problem of unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Minister's speech many other problems are addressed. There is the whole question of the general state of the Government's finances.  I hope it is not an eccentric view if I say that the problems facing our economy are far from managerial ones.  I have tried to develop this view outside this House without success.  Particularly in the media where I believe there is a growing interest in fundamental economic problems there is a general derision for anybody who wants to investigate our economic problems in a deep or analytical way.  I have stated that economic commentary and social commentary in the media in Ireland &mdash; I have said it outside this House &mdash; has sometimes been much closer to the sports page than it has been to any fundamental economic or social <Col N="1454" /> commentary.  I will give an example of that.  The recent reports from the National Economic and Social Council, two excellent reports, one commenting on the failure to evolve a social policy here &mdash; I hope I do not summarise it too crudely &mdash; and another which addressed our attention to social priorities, drew very little comment and very little analytical reaction.  This is more than anti-intellectualism, it is dangerous ignorance at a time of grave economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>The speeches made here, and in the other House, have been thoughtful and reflected genuinely the feelings of people about problems as they affect them. People have spoken about new tax measures as they will affect businesses, small and large.  Equally, people have spoken about good measures such as the relief in VAT in relation to work in garages which will have an employment effect in the motor industry and which was a correct and proper response to representations by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.</P>
    <P>I must return to the theme on which I began.  I attended a seminar in this House in the last few weeks that was organised by Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Bruton.  At that seminar we had less than ten representatives of the Dáil and Seanad.  Unfortunately, it was at an inconvenient time, perhaps, on a Thursday morning.  Dr. Ricardo Patrella, director of the forecasting and advance scientific technology section of the EEC, made some projections about unemployment that I want to mention in the House to serve as a background to the measures which the Finance Bill takes.  We have at present 12.3 million people unemployed within the European Community and more than one-third of them are under the age of 30.  It is an easy figure to remember.  To restore unemployment by the classic definition of unemployment, 2 per cent, by 1995 the Community would need to create one million jobs a year.  It has, in fact, never created more than 280,000.  Thus if one forecasts on the present rate &mdash; I am not being a prophet of doom in this &mdash; the figure we are likely to go to at the European level, if we <Col N="1455" /> continue the way we are, is from 12.3 million unemployed today to 50 million unemployed people in Europe in 1995.  If one looks at the Irish statistics one sees that, perhaps, the displacement from agriculture is slowing up but certainly the number of young people becoming available for jobs is certainly not.  We will continue to have an expansion in our young population long after the population has flattened out in the other European countries.  There is perhaps one other country: I am not sure whether, for example, Italy might not have some of the same features in relation to population projections.</P>
    <P>What this says is that in the eighties it does not matter whether the Finance Bill is brought in by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour.  The unemployment situation is the greatest problem facing all of us and any Minister who brings in a Finance Bill in the eighties has two choices.  I find it incomprehensible in what I have noticed in the last three or four years &mdash; I am deliberately saying three or four years because I want to include more than one Government in what I am saying &mdash; that there seems to be an acceptance of the notion that one can deal with unemployment on this vast new scale with economic strategies and fiscal measures that were appropriate for other conditions. There is no good in going on like that.  One can do it of course.  It has happened in Britain.  What happened was that people identified that the economy had a problem of inflation, a problem of unemployment and other problems that were not minor but in a secondary category such as trade problems.  The Government in Britain decided to pursue the inflation problem.  They quickly brought it down to single figures and they are now campaigning in the election stressing their achievement in matters of inflation.  They have presented, almost as something which is one of those consequences that cannot be avoided, that there must be such an astronomical level of unemployed people in Britain.  I am not speaking in the abstract.  I have met Irish families who have come back from Margaret Thatcher's ravaged Britain to <Col N="1456" /> Ireland trying to see, in a reverse circular migration, if there are better hopes at home than there are in Britain today where the gates are locked.</P>
    <P>To say, for example, that one can go after the inflation problem and, when ready, to tackle the unemployment problem is madness, a madness that does not affect the authors of these economic policies or their political proponents, the Tories in Britain, but that does affect the families that are out of work.  When I say a madness, I do not mean something that is not simply a political philosophy or an economic strategy, it is something that is badly thought out.  I have seen the figures in relation to the cost of unemployment. Let us not take the direct costs in relation to direct payments to those who in the short-term, medium-term and long-term are out of work.  There is the sickness that comes into families where there is an unemployed head of a household and the impaired usage of educational resources. There is the whole question of the housing surround in which what Van Gogh described as this nest of humans seeks to exist &mdash; what he called the family.</P>
    <P>There is such a cost in social terms that a figure can be put on when we refuse to give a person a job and offer the wife of the unemployed person, or the husband, pills to get over their difficulties.  Their children are less efficient in school and there is one compounded difficulty after another.</P>
    <P>The costs of unemployment are both direct and indirect.  What we have seen in Britain is one of the most savage, appalling assaults on humanity in recent times.  I could be more dramatic by saying that in the cuts in the health services in the Newcastle area we have had, by the elimination of special wards to deal with tuberculosis, members of the staff of the hospital contracting tuberculosis.  There is the return of TB in Britain in certain areas as a result of the cuts in the health service.  That is why I use the term &ldquo;madness&rdquo; for anybody who seeks to divide the unemployment problem from the inflation problem, to suggest that the unemployment problem is something that can come either in time afterwards in one's concern or can be regarded as <Col N="1457" /> subsidiary towards the general question of managing the economy.</P>
    <P>I want a reply from the Minister, and I should like to hear of the thinking of the Department of Finance, to my statement that the problems in the Irish economy, in the British economy and in the European Community, are not managerial problems.  They are not about changing the managers any more.  They are structural problems.  The old version of unemployment in Europe, Britain and Ireland was that we had employment that was cyclical.  We could get shifts in the unemployment figure as we traced it across seasons, we could see it across different trading conditions but we have had longer unemployment that has not lifted in the short-term.  We have had the simultaneous occurrence of unemployment in a number of the economies at the same time.  Uniquely, we have had a large proportion of the unemployment problem being occupied by young people.</P>
    <P>Standing in the shadow of that changed nature of unemployment is something that can represent either a further threat or a hope and about which I have found in this House, and in the other House, insufficient interest.  I am referring to the further application of science and technology. In exactly the same way as the choices of the first industrial revolution could have given us democracy at work or given us the factory system, the manner in which it drove children into the mines to be rescued later by the trade union movement, the choices of the application of science and technology are available to us now.  We can choose to elminate drudgery or we can choose to allow science and technology, if uncontrolled, to add even further volumes to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>What is the point?  I say that with concern for the Senator who said he looked in the speech for work orientated incentive thinking; he found it despairing; he did not find it morale boosting and it did not encourage self-pride, self-reliance and community endeavour.  I will not mention the Senator's name because I am not interested in the business of being partisan this morning about the problem <Col N="1458" /> of the Finance Bill and its appropriate connection with the problem of unemployment. However these are now cliches.  They are not cliches in the sense that they are casually thrown around words that have no meaning.  This kind of language, &ldquo;Let's give an incentive to industry, let's create incentives for private industry which will create the jobs to set up the morale and reduce the unemployment&rdquo;, is wrong.  Where are the figures to prove it?  I can show how much money we have been forking, directly and indirectly, into the Irish private sector since the thirties.  Nobody wants to stand up and say, here are the jobs we got for it.  We are in the curious position that in the twenties we had more people gainfully employed outside of agriculture than we have at present.  We have had intervening social historical calamities probably not experienced by other countries through the draining off of the population through emigration, our problem going away.  We are living with a neighbouring island that regards unemployment as something that is secondary.</P>
    <P>One can go to a slum economy presided over by somebody who is pushing the economics back beyond the thirties way before Keynes, right-wing ignorance, the ignorance that one can afford to have when one is distant from the poor.  Margaret Thatcher is a long shot from people like Richard Titmuss who did the fine work on the London poor and who had the courage to die ten years ago in a public ward in a health service hospital in Britain.  We are accustomed to hearing, even here, people saying she is a great woman, she is tough &mdash; well, Hitler was tough.  What is needed now is not toughness but ideas.  There are people saying outside this House that it is the fault of TDs and civil servants.  It is a mixture of everything.  One thing that is true &mdash; it is as much the responsibility of the media as it is of the people who are involved in public life &mdash; is that we are at a time when we need to make a quantum shift in economic thinking, to making the unemployment problem the single biggest problem facing us all in Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1459" /> There is a marked hostility to people who want to develop ideas.  So there will be the little riddle-me-ree business about 1 per cent or 2 per cent up or down or whether one hires an accountant or not. That will not approach the problem of unemployment.  We have had a celebration of ignorance by the people who should be commenting on economics.  I want to offer my own credentials in this regard.  I lectured in economics 17 years ago and it was more humane economics in relation to financial matters than I am reading about these days.</P>

      <P>I want to turn to the connection between the Finance Bill exactly and specifically and another Member of this House, and this might surprise a few people.  One of the great cultural weaknesses of our people has been their scapegoating tendencies. Instead of looking at the complexity of problems, and trying to understand or develop strategies to solve them, we are always looking for some new strong man or strong woman.  We have this demonology, as I call it, that we use instead of politics, bright angels ascending, once bright angels falling, and on we go.  It is the only thing next to our weakness for equating economics with racehorses that finds space in our papers.  Which bright angel is winning at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have another weakness of blaming people for our problems.  I happen to be one of those people who disagree with the strategy of the thinking represented by then Minister, Martin O'Donoghue, in Dáil Éireann when he had responsibility for economic planning. I should like to place on record my recognition that there was at least this much in his thinking &mdash; I said so in public then &mdash; that at least he made an attempt to connect the unemployment problem to the overall problems of the economy.  I disagreed with the implementation of the investment that followed the borrowing strategy but it is correct and accurate to say that at that time people were saying, <Col N="1460" /> look we have to take risks to seek to do something about unemployment.  Afterwards, when this new anti-social disease of economic rectitude swept over Europe, everyone began flying away from the unemployment problem and thinking maybe we were better off with the old options of balancing this.  We were back to the classic choice of a bankrupt economic theory, will it be public expenditure cuts or increased taxation? The vulgar suggestion &mdash; that is what it is and nothing else &mdash; is that it is a matter of an either-or choice.  I will return to that tedious suggestion again because I believe I know the origins of all that old musty thinking.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation is our single biggest problem.  Our approach to it is not one of managing the economy in financial matters.  We must see within economic and fiscal measures a recognition that the problem is now of a different nature and kind than something we have ever had before.  I want to be very positive about this.  I do not think there will be a return to employment on the old strategy.  There is no way of catching up on the figures by 1995 in the way we did it before.  This is not to throw in the towel because there are immediate implications from what I said.  We need to think in terms of re-defining work.  We will have to face up to the task of looking at how people are active in terms of different uses of their time.  Again, if one looks from 1800 on to the year 2000, over 200 years, and at the proportion of time that people spend simply feeding themselves and sleeping, how much time they spend on education, how much they spend in the world of work and so on, one will see that there are significant shifts taking place.  More importantly, there are significant shifts possible.  What is needed in relation to employment is new thinking in relation to work.  This cannot happen &mdash; now I turn to the measures we can adopt today &mdash; unless we accept some responsibility for minimum income maintenance.</P>
    <P>The problem we have been faced with up to now &mdash; I will put it very simply &mdash; is that it used be put in books, if you do not work you do not eat.  In the United <Col N="1461" /> States they regarded it as so important that I thought at times they would put it on to their flag.  It was a marvellous thing, forcing people to work so that they could eat.  We are now in the position where there are not, and will not be, enough jobs in market related activity for the population of Europe by 1995.  What are we going to do then?  A shrinking work force can get higher productivity from capital investment and no economist worth his or her salt can deny that.  We can get more productivity now from certain kinds of units of capital investment than we can from employing units of labour but what are we going to do?  The only reason people are not going to say let them starve, of course, is that our domestic demand in the different economies would totally collapse.  It is not humanitarian instincts that have stopped the application of technology.  It is precise economic considerations like that.  We have to think then in terms of the needs of families and population.  We have to get new mechanisms of getting income out across populations and, at the same time, re-defining work, getting new forms of activity in which, for example, people of middle years and older years will use our educational institutions rather than artificial single category age populations. What does that mean?  It means that we could in an exciting way get better value from every pound of social expenditure all round.  Instead of closing institutions for large parts of the year, instead of saying to people, if you have not got your third level education between the ages of 17 and 22 you are lost forever, we can, in fact, see educational expenditure as being available to the total population. Equally re-defining work in a new way can have a precise health effect which will make massive savings in relation to health expenditure.  It can be a powerful aid in relation to undoing inequality between the sexes.</P>
    <P>What this means, and it stands behind my first reaction to Finance Bill speeches of all kinds, is that we must have some kind of social policy.  What do I mean by a social policy?  I believe that in the economy.  Finance Bills and other measures, do not, and should not, have an <Col N="1462" /> independent existence separate from considerations of health, housing, education and social welfare.  All economists who were worth their salt, at least as far as the fifties were concerned, prefaced their books by saying that the purpose of the whole exercise was that people might live better.  It goes back to the theory of moral sentiments, to people saying they looked forward to the day when economics would take the back seat in the car.  It was not that one was talking about investment so that people would work.  It was investment so that people might work so that they might live better lives.</P>
    <P>Much of this has gone.  I want to know some precise things about social policy. Have we abandoned redistribution?  We had a seedy kind of exercise in that regard here in the last 12 years.  The poor were discovered in Kilkenny in 1971 by Sister Stanislaus, the late Bishop Birch and many others, particularly Séamus Ó Cinnéide.  We found out in 1971 that one-quarter of a million people were living under a poverty line defined as £1,200 for a man, his wife and two children, £800 for a single individual, an unsatisfactory line but where the line goes does not bother me.  What was important was that people were slipping down into the poverty statistics mostly through unemployment, low incomes and so on and we had a great number of children involved.  All the figures were redone later and it was found that the adults were over-estimated but that the children were under-estimated.  That is the result of the most recent figures I saw in the last 12 months.  Ten years later the Combat Poverty Committee came and went.  We established programmes.  They upset the politicians, the Bishops and the civil servants, in particular, so combat poverty had to go and we had new incarnations, community development agencies in which the spirit came back in a different shape only to last a while and now we are likely to have a poverty agency again.</P>
    <P>We must ask the question which the National Economic and Social Council are asking us in their reports about social policy and which is something very simple: do you want to have a debate about <Col N="1463" /> social policy?  If you do, you have to take the usual indicators of social policy. These are in relation to things like access to social benefits, health, housing, education and &mdash; to his great credit the late Professor Titmuss added &mdash; the question of income.  What progress are we making every year towards equality?  I am entitled, as long as I am in public life, to look to the Minister for Finance of the day and say: &ldquo;Is this a Finance Bill that operates entirely separately from social issues outside of any concerns for social policy?&rdquo; The Minister says that the Deputy or Senator, depending on what misfortune might have visited me on the day, will know well that we are following a definite social philosophy.  I then have another question: &ldquo;Will the measures taken here change the statistics in favour of the categories of the poor or not?&rdquo; The Minister for Finance would have a very difficult time because if he went to the country tomorrow morning and said he is interested in a social policy that believes in equality attainable at some stage, in redistribution every year in some form or another, he might get a very sharp reaction from the public.  We live in a society in which the only mobility that is valued is private social mobility.  Everybody is talking about protecting the house he owns with walls from other people, shifting marginal communities from being near them lest they damage the value of their house; they talk about their children &mdash; possessive pronouns everywhere &mdash; in privatised society.  It is arguable that it will probably take us decades after the rest of Europe to move on towards any concept of the social.  So any politician of the day would have difficulty.  However, we are entitled to ask: &ldquo;Where is the social policy?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach &mdash; a man I have admired over the years for many reasons &mdash; was present in Kilkenny at the tenth anniversary of our discovery of the poor. We had another gathering in 1981, the proceedings of which have just been published. I will describe it for you because it is relevant to the Finance Bill.  It was a kind of new dance; concerned social workers would come in and tell us how <Col N="1464" /> the state of the poor had got worse. Noreen Kearney from Trinity College told us of a family where the husband had no job and is now at home; the mother is worried and would be less worried if only someone would provide an income for her.  She would not need to get someone to look after the children while she goes to the doctor to get pills, and so on, because we will not give the income to the family; we will not give a decent house, a job, adequate education, proper accommodation.  But we will give pills and that brings joy to the pharmaceutical industry and it gives joy to finger-happy people shooting out prescriptions as well.</P>
    <P>That is what I mean by social policy: to have given the income to the family in the first place would have saved you the money far down the line.  But in 1981 when we considered the question of how the poor had fared ten years on, it was &mdash; as I said &mdash; like a black dance.  On would come the concerned social workers and then they would wheel in an economist. We had the head of the ESRI saying: &ldquo;We have all lived beyond our means too long; the time has come ...&rdquo; but who are the &ldquo;we&rdquo;?  Is the woman that Noreen Kearney was talking about, who has not enough to eat or for her children to eat involved in the column &ldquo;Table for Two&rdquo; in the <i>Evening Herald</i>&mdash; this obscenity of a column that is in the evening papers every day?  Of course, she is not.</P>
    <P>Note that those people put remarks into public representatives' speeches such as; &ldquo;We all have to tighten our belts&rdquo;, Who is tightening whose belt?  Is the belt around the necks of the poor or is it around the bellies of the rich?  It is not an academic question: it is insulting language; we have all lived beyond our means.  I have a bundle of those remarks here.  The Taoiseach then, no doubt carried away by the moral occasion on which he was speaking &mdash; there were very holy people there including myself &mdash; decided that he would make a big gesture; of course the poor will not have to wait for economic recovery.  There was a spontaneous burst of applause from the moral missionaries around; &ldquo;We have won.&rdquo;<Col N="1465" /> All right; we have not had economic recovery but what have the poor got?</P>
    <P>I do not want 25 speakers after me telling me we looked after the poor better than you and if we were not there they would not look after them as well.  I am willing to accept the best of everybody's intentions.  All I am interested in are figures and facts.  I want a commitment at the end of the speech as to whether the speech operates in the context of a social policy that exists or not, whether that social policy includes any element of redistribution and if it includes an element of redistribution what indicators have we seen of it?</P>
    <P>There are decent people in this House who do not believe in redistribution at all.  There are people who believe &mdash; I have many speeches here from them &mdash; that you have God-given gifts which make you rich and you have God-given gifts which inevitably make you poor.  I do not believe that.  There are other people who believe it is a matter of prudence in one generation; you save up and give your children chances in the next generation and so on, and you are entitled to do that.  I do not believe that either.  I believe that all the babies in the maternity ward when I visited it on the four occasions when my own children were born were entitled to the same rights as my children.  My purpose in politics is to call the attention regularly of people when they are talking about finances in the economy to how far we are coming away from any concept of concern about equality or whether we are not.  That is the section in which we deal with the whole question of the problem of unemployment.  There is just no point in standing up and saying; &ldquo;If we were not in power there would be no money to pay the Garda, nurses and so on.&rdquo;  We need to get farther than that and we need particularly to say: &ldquo;What are we doing about the problem of unemployment?&rdquo; I hope I have demonstrated that if you provide jobs you not only provide them but you eliminate all the expenditure you have to pay which flows from the secondary social and health consequences of unemployment. Even if one accepted that, we are obviously not running a benevolent society. <Col N="1466" /> Many people would say: &ldquo;This is all very fine; people get attacks like this now and again and the Government are very encouraging.&rdquo;  Every now and again someone turns up to ask me how my own socially deprived background affected me; has it influenced the warp of my mind.  They then go off and compare my 42 year old warped socially deprived background mind with a 70 year old socially deprived warped background mind and say: &ldquo;Is it not great that we put up with them?&rdquo; One column one time said: &ldquo;They are all right really in their social vision, as a kind of eccentric view.&rdquo; I have gone far past that stage, I can assure you.  There are 200,000 people unemployed and all the people dependent on them, none of whom is eccentric. They are people who have the right to hear in the two Houses of the Oireachtas what policies we have to change the society, to get income out to them. to redesign work or to do something about unemployment.  They are not interested in having an argument about VAT.</P>
    <P>When I came in here first, in 1973-77, we had VAT on children's books and we did not have VAT on the sale of racehorses. The services of the now missing &ldquo;Shergar&rdquo; were, of course, free from VAT, and children's books were subject to VAT, which is its own comment on the society we lived in, because it would damage irretrievably the bloodstock industry.  What about the minds of the children who needed the books?  That was a damage that we would not hear about so much.  I have no apologies to make for that remark to the people who went around this House, people who now strike a high moral pose about being the most pure people God ever sent on earth into politics, like hucksters getting VAT off the sale of racehorses.  Unfortunately. they had the temerity &mdash; obviously in a fit of hubris &mdash; to approach me.</P>
    <P>Even if one managed to approach the problem of unemployment within an adequate and coherent strategy one still had the problem of planning the economy.  We heard a great deal over the years about this.  We have had people who were in favour of planning.  I have paid tribute to one man who is in favour <Col N="1467" /> of planning.  He happens to sit in another part of this House.  I believe that the content of that plan was mistaken in some regards.  I would have welcomed it if we were in here discussing the shape of plans if the planning concept was there.  Perhaps some things have happened over in the Department of Finance and in the universities since I was last talking to the economists there but I thought that planning would be identification of targets, the management of resources towards the achievement of stated ends and the measurement of the results over time.  Is that very old fashioned?  Now planning is a committee exercise.  Planning is a sort of committee: we all gather together and we say we are all concerned and we will all hope.  Where is the evidence of planning in the Finance Bill?  Where is the commitment to planning?  I am not asking that for a party.  I am asking for the commitment to planning for the unemployed because they are the people who would benefit from the plan.</P>
    <P>Now, I think, it is time for me to dispel any atmosphere of gloom that I might inadvertently have been creating.  I feel that many of our problems in the economy are caused by the psychological atmosphere which prevails in this country at the moment.  The phrase is used by many public figures who meet me &mdash; being such a charitable person, I am regaled with conversations practically every day &mdash; that it is a matter of keeping your head down, the same as if what we were witnessing was some visitation from the weather, that it was a matter of bad weather, that it would blow away.  Even the Leas-Chathaoirleach's party had a sort of influenza theory of economic difficulties &mdash; it got bad in the world; then it spread to Europe and then it came here; then you threw your hands up in the air.  It was like going to bed with the 'flu.  You waited until it had passed.  That was their version of the economy.</P>
    <P>It is time now for us to begin to bring a little sanity into our economic affairs. We are investing tens of thousands of pounds in institutions every week to produce economic theory, to produce economic strategy.  It is time we saw the <Col N="1468" /> result of it.  It is time we had proper planning mechanisms.  Within that planning mechanism will be the test of the political will of the party in power.  If you say that you are going to have a planning mechanism that deals with levels of capital expenditure and revenue expenditure by Government in the private sector, and that only allocated across different Departments, and you do not put social expenditure on it, then you will immediately have declared your hand.  By default you will have had a residual social policy.  But if you have a meaningful social policy in which you are seeking to pursue objectives in the interests of those who need to be lifted up you will have integrated your social policy into the planning process.  I will be watching whenever the ghost of the plan appears. We should have a national festival day if we ever see a plan again.</P>
    <P>With the greatest respect I have here &mdash; and I do not wish to be partisan &mdash; a navy blue coloured document which speaks about the future.  It is a cross between a mantra and an old catechism hoping that cows would have calves.  It masqueraded as <i>The Way Forward</i> or the way backwards, or the way upwards.  I cannot be bothered wasting my time on it now.  It was an appalling insult to the intelligence in a country that has had universities and second level institutions for a long time.  To think that you had individuals who divided their time between economics and voluntary activity coming on the television and radio, saying that they were willing to stake their professional careers on this document. I thought of buying a ticket to leave the country.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a planning process. When I say planning process I do not want anyone standing up and saying that I am talking about centralisation and statist thinking for its own sake.  I am not.  I have mentioned part of planning definitionally. It should be participatory.  It has no meaning unless it is participated in by the people who make up the different sectors of the economy.  Obviously, the institution or the structure of planning itself is an important topic and one that should be addressed.  Again, there is <Col N="1469" /> no point in having a mumbo-jumbo of language masquerading as a plan.  A now very prominent politician spoke to me about the west of Ireland once.  &ldquo;What would you do about the west of Ireland?&rdquo; I asked, and he said, &ldquo;What you need is a massive injection of capital and the institutional framework through which it would flow&rdquo;.  I thought then that it reminded me of the advertisement for the all round wormer on television, the things that are given to cattle for mastitis and for worms large and small.  It had about the same meaning.  There are people who are being paid enormous salaries to produce these riddles at a time when we have real problems.</P>
    <P>The structures of planning, the integration of social policy into the planning process which is crucial if we are to do anything towards achieving equality in our time, towards lifting the neglected categories of the population out of their real misery, should of course have a regional dimension to it.  The economy differs in regional matters.  I do not intend to develop that point now.  Above all else, I want to give an example of the imagination that is needed at the moment.  If we take the resource of agriculture, can we truthfully say that there is any real plan for the development of agriculture?  For example, we know little bits and pieces of the problem &mdash; massive under-utilisation of land, transfer problems. These are problems to which bodies have directed our attention.  There are other problems in relation to capitalisation. There are problems of indebtedness because the banks became involved in a mock auction.  There was a certain period when agriculture looked good and banks lent money to farmers to compete against each other.  This inflated the price of land and all the money was not handed back to the people they had brought to the door of bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>This reveals another underlying theme in our economy.  I do not see in the Bill very many measures that will draw a distinction between speculative investment and genuine productive investment. What is needed is to make the economy productive.  We have just spent three weeks in this House and three weeks in <Col N="1470" /> the other House discussing a measure that was asked for by people who met people in America.  They all went off to England to organise themselves and we are all told now they are not all of our religion and therefore they are impeccable and honest people.  They asked us to produce an amendment that will cost £1 million.  Producing that paragraph we have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds.  We have a Telesis Report sitting before us.  Where is the White Paper on industrial strategy?  Where is there a plan for the fishing industry?  Where is there a plan for the agricultural industry? Where is there a White Paper on unemployment? Where is the paper on broadcasting options?  Where is the paper on urban renewal?  Where are all the papers on the restructuring of the public service? What about democratic involvement in education?  Instead of what we have just had, where is the White Paper on the pursuit of equality between men and women?  They are all missing because we have been having a debate while the unemployment statistics go through the roof.  Then, of course, we have to keep this Parliament going, with all due respect to people who sit in the Chairs of both Houses and to all of us who manage to come in here one way or another. There is a black character to it all, as though we were living in an unreal world. I question this.</P>
    <P>I will end by saying that I have spoken on more than one Finance Bill in my brief time in politics.  I have the highest respect for all public servants.  I have read Ronan Fanning's book on the history of the Department of Finance.  But I want to tell you what I believe about the Finance Bill and its debate.  We have too brief a time in this House; I agree with the comments of the Leas-Chathaoirleach yesterday.</P>
    <P>This is my concluding point.  I look forward to the day when the resources of the Department and all the public service will be available to the Opposition and will be available to individuals to generate proposals in relation to the matters that I was speaking on.  It is just crazy today to think that all proposals in the matters I mentioned, agriculture, fisheries, <Col N="1471" /> broadcasting, all of these would come through the Cabinet system in its present structure.  There should be nothing wrong with anybody who has particular suggestions to make addressing himself or herself to problems in this country, having access to the talents that exist.  Equally, I find it extraordinary that we are not using the reports that are coming out of the co-operative work of the National Economic and Social Council.  On that council you have all sections of society represented and they are producing reports that they post to people in this House and the other House.  We sit there and we ignore them.</P>
    <P>In time one wonders about speeches. The Finance Bill indeed implements the matters of the budget.  I had deliberately not concentrated on any particular items that had caused what the Minister has correctly called public debate.  I welcome a distinction that was fudged before the election, that it contained in his speech.  That is the distinction between volume of taxation and equity in tax ation.  On previous occasions people made cases against particular taxes on the basis of their yield being low.  Part of the public concern was that they wanted to see fairness even if the yield was low.  It is most important that the taxation system be structured in such a way that it is equitable and seen to be equitable and after that you have the argument about yield. There is just no point either in people arriving home for dinner or before dinner or standing up after dinner or whatever they are doing, making speeches saying: &ldquo;There is no crock of gold out there&rdquo;. That is another ignorant comment and it ill befits the people who come out with these statements to be making them.  The fact of the matter is this: there are published papers available above all else to public representatives, captains of industry and anyone else who wants to read them to show what is going on.</P>
    <P>Even a previous Senator, Dr. Whitaker, hardly a roaring, radical, socialist Red, bringing us off behind the Iron Curtain, was the first to point out in the seventies that the Irish economy was becoming speculative.  We were interviewing <Col N="1472" /> on television and radio and in the papers and admiring people who bought companies, stripped them of their assets and let the employees go.  The State was going to provide unemployment benefit and assistance.  It was supposed to provide alternative jobs.  Meanwhile, the people were finding themselves being interviewed as success stories for activities that in a more moral society would have put them behind bars.</P>
    <P>I must correct myself for this last point. Mentioned here was the suggestion of the inappropriateness &mdash; I think it was by your good self &mdash; a Leas-Chathaoirligh, of prisons.  I have been opposing prisons for most of my life.  Why then would I want to send these new tax evaders off to prison?  May I assure you that I am in favour, in fact, of them getting community service orders, the public vision of seeing people who are masses of raiders and avoiders out doing those things that we want the other people from the inner city to do, the people who steal cars. What is the difference between someone who steals cars in the inner city and someone who evades?  We have had a lecture in the other House from Deputy Sir Oliver Flanagan on the difference between avoidance and evasion, he being one of the leading world experts in casuistry. What is the difference between someone who robs the State of £½ million and someone who steals a car?  You will have to make the case for the person to get out and to get a community service order for the person who stole the car.  I know if you put prison into this Bill that you would never see anybody come within an ass's roar of a prison sentence.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister of State to urge the Minister for Finance to change that and put in community service orders so that we will see the people pulling ivy off the old buildings and looking after the old people, cleaning the houses, the streets etc.  That is what I want done by these people.  Thank you for your patience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to limit my remarks because I know that we have this aspiration to try to conclude by lunch hour.  I will be brief because I know we <Col N="1473" /> can pursue the details of various sections on Committee Stage.  However, I would like to make a number of remarks and in the spirit of Senator Higgins' contribution. I cannot resist responding a little at the outset.  It is relevant to what I want to say ultimately.  My general theme is that everyone has agreed that there are very serious economic and social and financial problems in the country.  Everyone has agreed that something must be done.  The only problem of course is the age old one that people do not agree on exactly what is to be done, the manner or the timing of it.  Therein, of course, lies the perennial problem, especially in a democracy.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Higgins &mdash; I do not agree with him on all things: indeed there are many areas where we disagree, as he made clear with one or two examples: I will probably be pointing up one or two more of them &mdash; I agree that one of the essential ingredients is hope and the belief that we can make a better future for ourselves if we have a reasonable vision of where we want to go and a sufficient commitment and courage to pursue that vision.  After all, if that were not so I presume the historical, record would show that we would still be living in caves or swinging out of trees.  Despite the grave cynicism, doubt, despair and so on which we so frequently come across, I think it is right to continue to assert that there is the prospect of a better and more positive future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take up the point straightaway &mdash; why do we not see more progress in planning?  I would like to feel that I have some competence in this area and perhaps I would like to respond to Senator Higgins.  I suggest that one of the reasons is because as a democracy we have not yet learned to accommodate expressions of difference.  The terrible thing about a plan is that you actually have to say what you are going to do, spell out to some extent how you are going to do it, give some idea of the ways, and the timescale by which you are going to accomplish it. All this will become relevant again even in the context of the Finance Bill.  Being the kind of democrats that we are, you are then in a catch 22 situation because <Col N="1474" /> naturally the future is never going to work out exactly as anyone would expect or hope.  You know before you start that whatever happens the one likelihood is that actual events will not correspond to any plan.  Those then who do not agree with you can promptly jump up and say, &ldquo;Ha, ha, you said you would have 100 or 200 of X; you now do not have 55 or 124 or whatever.  Therefore your plan has failed.&rdquo;  You get yourself dragged down into these numbers exercises which is a great way of confusing the issue.  Senator Higgins is familiar with many areas in which that has been done.</P>
    <P>The real situation emerges if we push aside the numbers and say it is not a question of whether we over-achieved this target or fell short of that number, or that it took us four years to build the road instead of three years or whatever. These are not the important things about a plan.  The important things would be the underlying directions in which you are going and what kind of society and economy you are developing.  This would require you to find some answer then to what you stood for or believed in, whether in the areas of taxation or attitudes towards employment, attitudes towards inflation, and of the course then, the whole litany of specific policy areas, whether they be education, health or housing.  In each of those areas we would expect to come across conflict.</P>
    <P>The conventional wisdom then becomes the application of the old phrase about keeping your mouth shut, then people can only think you are a fool; do not open it and prove them right.  The wise public figure &mdash; I am not including just politicians in this &mdash; is the one who will not commit himself too clearly to any particular policy, ideal or any course of direction because to do so would leave him open to these questions, criticisms and so forth.  We have all seen a lot of that in recent years.  We still have to face up to this sort of problem.  One of the educational problems we will have to confront is to develop a sufficiently politically educated electorate who would be able to see through these superficial smoke-screens and who will look at the <Col N="1475" /> underlying issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne is not in the House at the moment, but I was interested in one little point he made at the outset of his remarks.  He suggested that there might be a case for having a Minister for Finance returned unopposed to the House rather than a Ceann Comhairle, or perhaps in conjunction with the Ceann Comhairle, on the grounds that it is the Minister for Finance who had to do all these unpopular things to set the country right and therefore faced in a very acute form this particular difficulty that if he did what he believed was right, he could find himself up against the wrath of an electorate who would be well informed by his opponents, his critics and other contenders for his seat.  While I can see the underlying merit in that sort of case, I would have to reject it totally for one very special reason.  In making his case the Senator was illustrating this general point I am putting forward.  A budget and a Finance Bill should not be seen as the product of the Minister for Finance.  It is not his Finance Bill.  It is not his budget. It is the product of the Government and the various advisers who influence him. In electoral terms, the responsibility for the budget and the Finance Bill lies with the whole Government.</P>
    <P>In the period between this budget and the Finance Bill we have seen the usual politicking going on.  I recall reading the remarks and some of the exchanges in the Dáil in recent weeks and it was suggested that one or two of the Minister's ministerial colleagues were signalling that they were not happy with the way the budget had worked out, but it was not their fault that they had not got the allocation they wished for their areas, the whole inference being that the spending Ministers, if we may call them that, naturally wanted to spend more to make themselves popular with their electorate and it was that &ldquo;Big Baddie&rdquo;, the Minister for Finance, who held them back and compelled them to spend less.</P>
    <P>This is conventional wisdom and it is very understandable, given the lack of political awareness and sophistication in the conduct of our public affairs, but we <Col N="1476" /> should nail it at every opportunity.  Since Senator Browne got on the record why the Minister for Finance has a headache, I want to put it very firmly on the record that he should not have, because this is part of our responsibility &mdash; especially in the Seanad which, to some extent, is not so pressured with immediate electoral considerations &mdash; and we should say very clearly that this Finance Bill is the responsibility of the Government, not of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We all agree that there is a problem and that something has to be done about it, but what?  It is interesting to hear again the litany of people agreeing that things are bad but are not so bad that we should cut back on spending in this area, or that we should not have made tax concessions in another area.  Not surprisingly, we have heard this in the Seanad, in the Dáil and we heard it from various public representatives. All this is very understandable because our system favours the application of personal or sectoral values: you get your whack first in case somebody else beats you to it.  Go ahead, grab whatever you can for your group.  The only rule is the old law of the jungle; whatever you can accomplish either by might or by guile is acceptable and anyone who is socially responsible, altruistic, moral, or misguided enough to stand back and seek to accommodate others whom he might feel has stronger claims, will simply be swept aside and trampled upon.  While one can sympathise with people continuing to make the sectoral case for more spending or less tax, one has to say that this misses the underlying reality of our financial situation at the present time.</P>
    <P>Many people associate me with what Senator Browne referred to earlier this morning as the buoyancy approach and that we should be able to spend our way out of these difficult situations.  Yes, I did say we should be willing to take calculated risks which are related to some clear programmes of where we wanted to go, but I also said in 1977 that this was the last chance for a relatively painless solution to our then economic, social and financial ills and that if it did not come off there would be no alternative to the very painful, difficult hard slog as a way <Col N="1477" /> forward.  We have all experienced the very severe international recession since 1979.  I am not taking to bed with the 'flu as a justification for it, as Senator Higgins would have it, but one has to recognise that when that sort of a 'flu is going around, even if one stays out of bed one's activity level is somewhat impaired and one is not as vigorous or able to accomplish as much as one would in a more healthy climate.</P>
    <P>Like it or not, the general economic and financial climate has worsened and that has shown up in our situation.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss two aspects: First something has to be done but we cannot agree how to do it and second, the timescale. I will deal with the timescale first. Do we need to be in a hurry to do something about bringing down our level of borrowing, the scale of our current budget deficit and the overall scale of our borrowing?  Some people suggest that we can afford to take a more leisurely approach because of the impact of this international influenza, but I would have to disagree with that because if you look at what has been happening to our budgetary performance in the last few years with monotonous regularity we appear to be having an actual result every year which is worse than the prospects that had been put before us at budget time. Even the prospects at budget time in the last four or five years have been pretty grim.  Since the second oil crisis of 1979, the prospects were grim and the actual reality has proved worse.</P>
    <P>Last year, 1982, the actual budget out-turn meant that the Exchequer borrowing figure was £300 million more than had been envisaged.  Even after the corrective measures had been taken last December, and even after the cuts in public spending had been made, borrowing was £300 million higher at the end of 1982 than we had aimed for because of the collapse in tax receipts.  If we are borrowing on the scale of last year or this year, we have to ask what is that doing to our future.  If we look at the 1983 budget, we find that this year a figure of £220 million is quoted as being the increased interest cost for servicing Government debt.  The Finance Bill mentions having to borrow something <Col N="1478" /> like £1,700 million this year.  We can assume that the interest on that will add something over £200 million next year, unless of course there is a remarkable reduction in interest rates in the meantime. If we go on borrowing on this massive scale year after year, we are piling up a real headache for future Ministers for Finance, future Governments and future societies.  One way or another they will have to cope with it.</P>
    <P>Some people would say this can be shrugged off because inflation will take care of it.  We all know if we borrow £100 this year and if inflation is high enough, by the time we pay it back in five, ten or 15 years time it will not be worth very much.  I do not think any of us would want to commit ourselves to the notion that the only way we can cope with our financial headaches is to start learning to live with South American style inflation rates, because they too bring their own social tensions.  If we are saying we want to get our financial house in order and if we hope to reduce inflation and do something about unemployment, I argue, as I argued in the past, that we must see all these as being related.  Like Senator Higgins, I reject the Thatcherite approach which is simply saying that in order to reduce inflation we must accept higher unemployment as a necessary consequence. That kind of approach implies that we are going to assume there will be this continuing social conflict and that we are operating in a society where each group is going to have its elbows out, fighting its own battle and ignoring the problems, aspirations and rights of other groups and individuals in society, especially the problems and the rights of the weaker groups.  If we go for that conflict approach to society, then we will have to accept a Thatcherite-type of attitude. That is one of the things I find very unwelcome about this Finance Bill and this budget.  It is very much in the style of saying things are bad, times are hard, we are going to get a nasty dose of medicine and we must not complain about it because we have no alternative.</P>
    <P>I am willing to be tolerant of this very heavy-handed approach this year on the grounds that there was an election very <Col N="1479" /> late in 1982 and the Government came in very late in the day and could reasonably claim that they had very little time to bring forward any developed financial, social or economic strategies of their own.  They promised us that these developments would take place over the coming months, therefore we must have a conditional opposition to that approach. Because of the limited timescale one might accept reluctantly and grudgingly the manner and shape of this budget and Finance Bill.  If the Government intend to pursue that course over the coming years &mdash; on the assumption that they are still in office to do so &mdash; then it is my conviction that they are doomed to failure. Why do I say that?  Because I do not see how everything can add up.  If they are talking about putting the Government finances in order either by increased taxation or by cuts in Government spending and if they are talking about inflation coming down very rapidly and at the same time they are going to be committed to fairly heavy borrowing for at least a number of years to come, the numbers will not fit.  I am not talking about playing around with numbers; I do not want to attempt to put precise numbers on it but we have to ask what would happen if inflation was to come down to 4 per cent or 5 per cent next year?  Even if the budget works out completely successfully this year, and there are cuts next year, how much are the Government going to borrow?  Will it be £1,500 million, £1,200 million or £1,000 million?  Will that not give rise to its own burden of extra interest payments?  There will not be any extra buoyancy in tax revenue to meet that because if inflation is coming down there will not be this purely cash increase on the tax side of the budget.  The Government have an acute problem of working out a combination of budgetary and economic policies that can take them out of the very serious circumstances in which we now find ourselves and help us work towards a better future.  That is just a combination between inflation and the budget itself.</P>
    <P>What would happen to unemployment if the Government try to solve, consciously <Col N="1480" /> or otherwise, their budgetary problems by continued high inflation?  If they do that our prospects of being able to do anything worthwhile on the employment front will be that much weaker.  This is one of the areas where I would disagree with Senator Higgins.  He seemed to feel that inflation was not that important when looking at unemployment and that we could tackle unemployment in its own right, but for any small country like Ireland which has to trade successfully with the outside world, we can only hope to make a go of our affairs if we are able to pay our way in the world. The rest of the world will not solve our problems for us; we must solve them ourselves.  That means we must reduce our levels of inflation and therefore our levels of price and cost increases to those levels being experienced by some of our trading partners.  Since we are a member of the European Monetary System if we are to be successful in that context we will have to start to think, look and aim for the West German type of inflation rates, and not continue the double figure inflation which we have suffered for a number of years past.</P>
    <P>The general approach in this year's budget is very much of a stop-gap nature. The size and enormity of our purely financial and budgetary problems are such that we cannot lose time dealing with them.  I support the Minister and the Government in rejecting any approaches which say that we should take a more lenient line with requests for spending or for tax concessions.  The type of concessions that can be accommodated, and which I would like to see being given, are similar to those granted to garages and, to a lesser extent, hotels, that is, changes to allow the cost to be met by some alternative tax or method of raising revenue. I do not see how we can afford simply to give away any revenue either by tax reductions or by worsening our borrowing figure by adding to spending. We have to be more realistic in facing up to the need to bring down the overall borrowing figure.</P>
    <P>To my mind, there is too much concentration on looking at the current budget deficit.  Of course that is important and it <Col N="1481" /> is right that we should eliminate it, but that is by no means the whole of the problem.  If the Government borrow money for capital or current purposes, they have to pay the interest on it.  One of the misguided beliefs in this country is that capital spending is &ldquo;a good thing&rdquo;. A lot of capital spending does not give rise to any financial return.  Therefore, for all practical purposes in framing a budget, it is as much of a burden on the taxpayer as current budget spending, and it should be looked at in that light.  The only capital spending that should be singled out for separate treatment is capital spending which is going to pay for itself by giving some return in the form of profits, dividends or whatever you want to call them, through successful trading or commercial activity.  It does not matter whether we spend money under the current budget for education or under the capital budget for building colleges or schools in which to educate our young people, no direct financial return comes back and therefore it is just as much of a burden in terms of future interest payments and so forth.  For that reason I think the Government were right to cut back on some of the capital spending this year; it was regrettable but necessary.  I want to emphasise as clearly as I can that our problems are severe and they are not going to get any better by pretending that we can adopt a more leisurely approach to solving them.  That only makes matters worse because the longer we perpetuate the notion that something will turn up, the harder it is to get people to accept that we must assume some responsibility for the conduct of our own affairs.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the other point I wanted to develop a little.  Many people who lament the extra taxes, cuts in spending and so on, say that there must be a better way but I do not see anyone coming forward with an alternative policy. The only attempt at an alternative policy which I have seen has come from The Workers' Party who argued for a sort of spend-your-way-out-of-it approach. They want a programme of increased Government spending geared to some plan for expanding agriculture, industry and so forth.  That strikes some familiar <Col N="1482" /> chords with me, as I said, going back to 1977 and earlier, but it is not on in our present circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have spent large amounts of money in recent years on investment.  One need only look at the hundreds of millions of pounds which have gone under the heading of investment in the last few years and one sees there is absolutely no increase in output associated with that investment.  Thus, we are driven to two conclusions: either there is an enormous amount of unused capacity lying around &mdash; this means that if there is any increased demand for Irish output we can supply it without having to invest &mdash; or if there is not this spare capacity, we can only assume that an awful lot of that investment has been wasted.  Whichever conclusion we arrive at, there is no basis for saying that what we need is a massive spending programme to provide capacity, unless we see some justification for it.  The first step would be to use whatever capacity is there.</P>
    <P>We have to come at the problem in a more unconventional way and &mdash; no surprise &mdash; the line I would take is that if we are going to do anything about unemployment we will have to adopt a totally different attitude.  I repeat the views I put forward and which were accepted by the Government in 1978 in the proposals published for a programme to aim for full employment over a period of five to seven years and I still think that is the right approach.  It was said that we must try to get away from the conflict approach of dealing with these issues.  We must try to get away from the notion that whoever holds a job, or whoever is going to get a pay rise, will do so as a result of exercising their muscles or their bargaining power. In other words, people fortunate enough to be employed by the ESB or on the docks have relatively secure employment, they are the people who will get the pay rises and hold on to their jobs, but people unfortunate or unlucky enough to work in trading firms, firms which are vulnerable to competition from outside or inside, are the people who will be squeezed out, who will become redundant and who will join the dole queues.</P>
    <P>We must try to break down this conflict <Col N="1483" /> approach; we have to go for a consensus approach.  That was attempted in the national understanding developed in late 1978 and early 1979.  The important thing was that we were trying to bring home to trade unionists, employers and especially to the farmers as well as the industrialists, that at the end of the day they were frustrating their own best interests by this partisan approach to the conduct of their affairs.  My recollection is that the first very large PAYE protest march in early 1979 was a reaction to the refusal of the farmers to participate in any of the discussions designed to bring about some fairer contribution by the farmers to the overall tax bill.  The farmers protested very violently against those suggestions, which included measures like the resources tax on land and so on, and they refused to participate in the discussions leading to the first attempt at a national understanding.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, the trade unionists said, &ldquo;If they are going to exercise their bargaining power we will show that we have some as well&rdquo;.  That brings home the point that, of course, we can all beat one another over the heads and force one another into accepting purely temporary solutions and decisions which we do not like, but that is not the recipe for long run development, that is not the recipe for success as a nation, that certainly is not the type of conduct, ideal or behaviour we should be holding out to our young people as an example.  I believe we had to show that a mature responsible democracy is capable of bringing forward representatives from all sections who can sit down, negotiate and develop solutions to their various problems, which they will accept, and which will work not only because they will help other people but because, ultimately, they will be in their own best interests also.</P>
    <P>Therefore what we need is to revive some approach along the lines of the national understanding.  We need to get back to the sense of involving major groups in discussions and examinations of these various issues of an economic and social nature.  Under that national understanding working parties were set <Col N="1484" /> up for trade unions and others to look at these questions: what would represent tax equity, who was or was not paying their fair share of taxes and was there or was there not massive evasion?</P>
    <P>Is not this our only hope of putting an end to the various forms of protest and conflict?  It does not matter what tactics are brought in or what changes are made in the law if large sections of the relevant taxpayers are excluded from having access to reasonable information.  If they go on believing that somebody out there is fiddling the system and getting away with blue murder, then of course they will go on protesting, they will go on believing that they are the ones who are being hard done by.  If we are to arrive at some general acceptance of a tax system as being equitable, we will have to work towards some form of national understanding approach.  That would be my formula.</P>
    <P>My final point is that part of that national understanding formula was to introduce a levy on all incomes, beginning at the rate of 1 per cent a year, and rising by 1 per cent a year for a number of years thereafter, to finance the employment necessary to accommodate the growing numbers of young people leaving our schools and colleges.  I take the view &mdash; I still hold it very firmly; I will have to develop it again another time &mdash; that this is an essential step for the years ahead.  I do not see how we can expect any form of lasting social peace, or lasting acceptance of tax burdens or anything else, if we are holding out nothing better than the prospect of large-scale unemployment, especially among our young people, for years to come.  The whole point of that levy at the time was that it was to be used specifically to create various forms of desirable social and community projects until such time as there were sufficient employment opportunities in productive industry.  Many people sneered and scoffed at that type of approach.  I remain totally unrepentant and will argue its obvious merits on other occasions elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The one thing I regret and which I find annoying is that the initial idea was taken up and the 1 per cent levy was used for <Col N="1485" /> the Youth Employment Agency &mdash; although in fact only a fraction of it is being used for the Youth Employment Agency.  The bulk of the money has gone into financing already existing Government services and, of course, now in this Finance Bill we have another 1 per cent, bringing it up to a 2 per cent levy on total income again for purely general revenue purposes.  I have to say that I am very annoyed and unhappy about a vehicle which was put forward in a very specific context, for a very specific purpose, being abused and therefore giving rise only to further resentment and tension because, of course, a 1 per cent levy on all incomes, as such, is a very arbitrary measure.</P>
    <P>If we wanted to get into a discussion on tax equity we would find it very hard to say why that form of levy is equitable just as a general tax.  You can defend it if you say it is for a particular social purpose, and if people can see that their acceptance, so to speak, of a smaller pay rise, the handing over of 1 per cent of their pay for a number of years, could give employment to those who have not got it.  You can argue that that is the kind of equity we should be promoting in the interests of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, to the House and wish him continuing success in his important role.  I should also like to pay tribute to the Minister for Finance on the excellent job he has been doing in his extremely difficult position as Minister for Finance in recent months.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  The Finance Bill gives statutory effect to the budget introduced last February.  None of us will deny that the budget introduced last February by the Minister for Finance was an extremely severe budget.  I personally subscribe to that notion.  It was one of the most severe budgets we have experienced for a long time.  It is important that we acknowledge that the severity of that budget was due to the extremely serious economic position confronting the Minister and the Government when the budget was introduced and, unfortunately, that serious economic position remains with us.  There is no point in <Col N="1486" /> thinking otherwise.  It did not arise overnight, and, hopefully, we will make progress towards its solution.</P>
      <P>There is no point in trying to delude people into the impression that there was any choice open to the Minister for Finance or the Government last February when the budget was introduced.  It was a question of facing up to a problem then, or running away from it.  Unquestionably the Government could not consider running away from the problem.  The Coalition Government inherited &mdash; and let us be frank about it &mdash; an extremely serious financial position from the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government last November and had little or no choice but to take harsh and stringent measures in February. As was ackowledged by Senator O'Donoghue a few moments ago, the Government had little time to prepare the sort of budget they might have prepared if time was available.  That is an important point.</P>
      <P>A balance of payments deficit of the order of £1,200 million in the last financial year, coupled with a borrowing situation of £1,700 million needed quick and positive action from the Government and the Minister.  Of course it would have been more popular, more acceptable, and politically more expedient, to take an easy course, but that is not the way to face a serious matter.  It is relevant to mention in passing that the Minister and the Government set as a target £900 million, or thereabouts, as the deficit for the current financial year, while the Opposition party set £750 million as the deficit for the current year.  One could ask where would the other £150 million have come from had Fianna Fáil been in Government after the last election.  That is a fair question.  It has never been fully or clearly answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our Government and our Minister did not shirk their responsibilities and it would have been irresponsible of them in the extreme had that happened.  There was a problem which could not be allowed to worsen because the short-term as well as the long-term effects were detrimental to the whole situation.  We had gone to the absolute brink, and beyond that we could not go with regard to borrowing <Col N="1487" /> and so on.  Action was needed. Action was taken, unpalatable steps were taken.</P>
    <P>I should like to have it placed clearly on the record that the 1973-77 Coalition Government handed over the finances of this country in a very healthy condition to the then incoming Fianna Fáil Government. People may tend to forget this was less than six years ago.  Our economy and finances were in a very healthy condition having been managed by a Coalition Government between 1973 and 1977.  I am loath to mention this point but it is relevant to the reason why we are in the position we are in at the moment.  People in the Fianna Fáil Party in 1977 who were concerned with the economic area and were leading Fianna Fáil at that time under Jack Lynch, went out recklessly to buy the support of the electorate.  They succeeded very effectively in doing this with the abolition of car tax, the abolition of rates on dwellings, and so on.  They gained a 20 seat majority in Dáil Éireann through these popular measures.  In spite of what Senator O'Donoghue has said, from 1977 onwards we went downhill. This must be clearly borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Our position declined steadily and when the present Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, became Taoiseach in late 1979, the position had become acute.  There is no point in our saying otherwise.  Deputy Haughey went on national television and national radio and clearly identified the problems.  He would have been supported by everybody in measures to correct the problems.  He identified the problems very positively and for this he is to be saluted, but he stands condemned for having done nothing about the problems from January 1980 until he left office in June 1981.  In fact, rather than doing something to resolve the problems, the various economic measures introduced aggravated them.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government were appointed in July 1981 and in their very short term to January 1982 they addressed themselves to the problems. They did not have sufficient time to achieve any significant and worthwhile <Col N="1488" /> results.  I make these points to demonstrate and record that our serious problems did not come down suddenly like a fog.  This brief resume I have given of Fianna Fáil Government inactivity from 1977 to 1981 and from February 1982 to October 1982 sets out clearly why we are in the position we are in today.  We acknowledge that unemployment is at a most unacceptably and alarmingly high level and, unfortunately, is likely to rise in the short term.  This cannot be sustained. We cannot allow it to continue. The Minister for Finance and the Government will be addressing themselves to this very vital question, because unemployment is basic to our social and economic problem.</P>
    <P>Inherent in the budget and in the Finance Bill is the question of equity in relation to taxation.  I do not think anybody could argue against an attempt by the Minister and his Department to cope with tax evasion and to broaden the whole tax base so that eventually the strain on people who are now over-taxed will be eased.  There has been hysteria on the part of people who believe tax evasion measures will affect them left, right and centre.  People paying their fair share of tax have nothing to fear from the Finance Bill and the budget.  Only people who are blatantly evading tax have any reason to be concerned.  I do not think anybody would be very sympathetic towards them.  In my estimation most people pay their just and fair share of tax.  We are talking about a relatively small number of people who do not, but we must ensure that they pay their fair share.</P>
    <P>The question of expenditure must be taken in conjunction with taxation because the application of an equitable taxation policy coupled with positive steps controlling expenditure will go a certain distance towards resolving the problems to which I have referred.  There is no point in taking one aspect in isolation from the other.  As we progress further, in so far as progress can be achieved through these measures, we must strive to stimulate growth in the various earning and producing areas of our economy. Reference has been made to that by some <Col N="1489" /> speakers but it needs to be stressed and emphasised.  We have certain earning areas in our economy such as agriculture, industry in its various forms, and tourism. If there is an opportunity in the future to make certain that these areas are helped in whatever way possible it must not be lost so that jobs can be generated and our serious problem can be alleviated.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that the Government will explore every avenue to secure more jobs emanating from a greater buoyancy in these productive areas.  I ask the Minister very specially to involve all concerned &mdash; and I know he has been constantly addressing himself to this vital question &mdash; in exploring the various possibilities for employment opportunities in these areas.  We must have productivity if we are to have more employment.  This is a fairly simple piece of logic.  If we do not have productivity we will not have employment.  It is also important that the whole structure of our economy should be improved to put us in a position to avail of the upturn in a favourable direction in the world and European economies which, hopefully, may not be in the too distant future.  It is important that we now plan and develop our economy along those lines.</P>
    <P>Much was said yesterday and today about planning to which I totally subscribe. Planning is an absolutely essential ingredient in making headway.  We must plan for the future to ensure that our economy can provide assistance in the areas of health, social welfare, housing, education, crime prevention, infrastructure and many other vital areas.</P>
    <P>As indicated by the Minister yesterday, 90,000 extra farmers are coming into the tax net for the first time.  This is a very good step.  It is very good that all persons in our community should be treated equally for taxation.  There is no point in talking about equity unless we are seen to achieve it in a very positive manner. Up to now 35,000 farmers have been assessable for tax.  Of the 90,000 farmers now coming into the tax assessable area for the first time, a high percentage will not have a tax liability.  A good deal of ridiculous mileage has been made out of this point.  People are trying to scare the <Col N="1490" /> daylights out of farmers and others about tax.  The fact that farmers are being assessed for tax does not always mean they will actually pay tax.  That is not clearly understood.  I estimate that 70 per cent of those 90,000 farmers will not be taxable this year.  This tax assessment will help to build bridges, which badly need building, between town and country. There is a total lack of understanding between people in towns and cities and people living in the country, people who are farming and those who are not farming. One of the main bones of contention in this area has been taxation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donoghue mentioned that in 1979 farmers refused to pay the resource tax.  I was amazed to hear him refer to that because that resource, tax was a 2 per cent tax on turnover.  Anybody who understands economics will realise &mdash; and Senator O'Donoghue ought to have realised &mdash; that a tax on turnover is totally meaningless.  It was not surprising that people refused to participate in the operation of that resource tax at that time.  That resource tax introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, caused much harm and damaged the farmers' perception of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained to the House yesterday that there was no way the standard results per enterprise per region, which were referred to and agreed to in a joint programme for farming, could have operated.  He gave a very good explanation of that.  Perhaps next year a certain monitoring of the farm profile may be undertaken by the Minister and his Department to see if it is the right system, and if any other system would be better.  It is important that people who obviously have no tax liability are not asked to pay significant sums of money to establish that they have no tax liability.  That is not the Minister's intention.  People should not be asked to pay hundreds of pounds to prove that they have no tax liability.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the social welfare area which is relevant to this question of equity which has been a theme of the Finance Bill.  Equity in the area of social welfare payments is urgently required.  The Government and <Col N="1491" /> the Minister are addressing themselves to that area.  The Government have been in office for a few short months, but they have committed themselves very fully and have set about introducing the necessary machinery to achieve equity in taxation, social welfare, and so on.  The Minister and the Government are to be commended for their determination and courage in endeavouring to tackle these major problems.  The problems did not arise overnight and they will not disappear overnight.  With the full and undivided attention of our Government, significant improvements can be achieved in a very short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Every year when the Finance Bill comes before the House I am struck by one positive thought, that is, that the brains of the country are occupied completely with tax problems, interpretations of Finance Bills, and advising people on how to reconstruct their business to avoid tax in a legitimate way.  Every year it seems to be getting more complicated.  That splendid source of brain power could be used to advise people on setting up in business, or used in a more productive manner.  However that is not the Minister's fault.  I have often wanted to express that thought, and I have taken the opportunity to do so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man running a small business created that business because he had the talent for one thing.  It might be in manufacture, or it might be in sales.  If you have reason to visit these factories you find that the time of the man with a talent for manufacturing or for sales is taken up in his office dealing with matters relating to taxation.  He is seldom able to get somebody as good as himself to improve his business.  Again the Minister is not to blame for that.  I hope that sometime some Minister will sit down and work out a system of taxation that is not as complicated as the present one.  Perhaps it is as complicated or maybe more complicated in other countries; I do not know. This is the country where I pay my tax with great reluctance and with great hardship <Col N="1492" /> and every year it is getting worse and I am getting poorer.</P>
    <P>Everybody wants to see a fair tax system. There is always wide support for any action that will bring into the net people who are not facing up to their national responsibility.  There are those who do not want to face up to their responsibilities, who will do everything in their power not to face up to them, and there are those who have the responsibility of paying tax and are not able to pay their tax.  Each year is different for a businessman. The successful businessman is not always the shrewd, cautious, careful person that we hear about, having the touch of an entrepreneur or a gambler.</P>

      <P>The businessman, I think, would resent me if I ever described him as a gambler, but that is what he is in many respects.  Each year is different and it is not always easy for him to pay the taxes due from the previous year because he makes investments and sometimes these investments do not work out. We are not in a vacuum here where one can predict all that is going to happen in business the following year.  One makes what might appear to be a very wise decision to invest one's money and something that might happen 3,000 miles away, or even further, can actually affect that business.  Such is the world we live in today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> This happens particularly in cases of capital gains where the money may not be due to be paid for 12 months, legitimately, and a business decision is made, something happens and one finds that the investment goes wrong, one cannot get out one's money and one has to meet one's commitment.  I would hope that the Revenue Commissioners would understand matters such as this.  I always felt over the years that there was understanding on the part of the Revenue Commissioners, that they were not quite the hard, faceless people that we often thought they were, that there was always an understanding of business problems.</P>
    <P>Recently there seems to be an obsession with tax.  For a while every morning I picked up the newspapers and read scare headlines about tax evaders, tax avoiders being put in jail, deposits having to be disclosed in building societies.  It must have frightened an awful lot of people who had legitimate savings but had not an accountant or a solicitor to tell them they were OK, that they did not have to worry.  There are a lot of people in this country who are frightened.  Everybody is not able to read a Finance Act.  I am one of them.  I always have to take advice from an accountant and solicitor.  My time is taken up talking to an accountant and his time, which is more important than my time, is taken up explaining to me about tax.  There are a lot of people who are scared about measures they feel might be introduced, or who have misunderstood what has been said or have been influenced by scare headlines.</P>
    <P>I know it is not the Minister's intention to frighten anybody, he wants to get on with the job.  The Minister is doing the right thing but I believe he is doing it the wrong way.  I would hope that at some stage he would give a little comfort to people around the country who are frightened of these kinds of measures and frightened by scare headlines.</P>
    <P>Anything that would affect savings in building societies actually frightens me, because the building society is to me the most important institution in this country. Building societies have money available for people to buy their own homes. I am aware that on the Continent home <Col N="1494" /> ownership is not a big thing with people, because they think in terms of houses while we think in terms of homes.  That is the very big difference.  They are content to pay rent.  That is not within the Irish person.  They always want ownership and their home is the big thing.</P>
    <P>I remember during the debate in the Dáil I read that the Revenue Commissioners would have the power &mdash; I am trying to remember the exact words and I hope I will be near enough to them &mdash; to enter one's home and examine its contents at their convenience.  If that is so, it is frightening to me because a man's home is his home.  Other people might regard it as a house but we regard it as a home.</P>
    <P>Property tax is very unfair for a variety of reasons.  Most people in this country take pride in their homes and rightly so. Home ownership has always been encouraged.  It reminds me somewhat of Poyning's Law which teachers tried to teach me about when I was going to school.  People spend an awful lot of money on their homes.  That is a very good thing because they recognise that the home and the family are so important. The family is the big thing in Ireland and God forbid that attitudes should change about that.  They are showing their respect and their love for their families by the amount of money they spend on their homes.  At present £65,000 is not a very big sum for a house.  The people who work hard and save and put the money into their homes are now going to be taxed on their homes.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to be taxed on anything else bar my home, in case it would ever reach the stage when I would have to say to my wife, or anybody else say to his wife, that we cannot afford our home.  I would rather say to her I cannot afford my car, that I cannot afford to go to Dublin, that I cannot afford to do anything else rather than say I cannot afford my home.  That is something I would like the Minister to take into account.  It is a strong and sincere view of mine.  The home should never be touched.  If this provision still stands and if it is the intention under this Bill that the Revenue Commissioners can call at any time at <Col N="1495" /> their convenience to the home, that is a terrible invasion of privacy.  I no longer feel secure in my home if anybody has the right to walk into my home.  I would like the Minister to clarify that.  I thank Senators for allowing me time.  I could continue but Senator Dooge wisely restricted me to five minutes.</P>

      <P>The idea of the State taking tax in a compulsory way is nothing new and everybody recognises and accepts it as a charge imposed by a public authority, in this case the central authority.  They know that it is used for external and internal protection and the provision of national services, health, education, administration of justice and the upkeep of other services such as the Army.</P>
      <P>The question then is not whether people agree or disagree with taxes or whether they march against taxes; the question is whether they should be taxed according to the principle of taking as little as possible from their pockets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I can speak better on an empty stomach.  I do not mind the Minister not being present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle is that you take as little as possible from people's pockets and whether that principle is being adhered <Col N="1496" /> to or not in the sense of taking over and above what is necessary is always a matter of argument.</P>
    <P>Secondly there is the question of whether taxation is just or equitable.  In this case because of the scene that has been created arising out of the budget by trade union and other forms of protest the question seems to be whether there is equality of sacrifice.  Therein lies the kernel of the trouble.  People are not accepting that only what is needed is being taken.  There is a belief that the principle of taking as little as possible is not being adhered to.  I do not share that view but that is the general feeling.  There is a feeling that other ways and means could have been used to raise these taxes and that it may not have been necessary to tax to this extent.  I do not share that belief but it is expressed in the pubs, on the streets and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This leads to the next question.  Is there equality of sacrifice?  For example, was it not possible to look in a different way at capital gains, corporation tax, capital allowances, a comprehensive property tax or the straightforward direct wealth tax that has been abolished?  I will come to the figures on that later on.  Everybody accepts that because of the mishandling of our household affairs over the years, we got into debt totally over our heads. The ironic thing is that generally speaking the public accept this.  Despite this acceptance, there is a great ambivalence because the Irish people do not want pain or ache in the pursuit of any solution. That is because it was never imposed on them and no-one ever faced up to it until now.  The other thing is that the Irish people want change, but they want change that affects the other person, not change that affects them.  They agree to change so long as it does not affect them. This is another problem.  If you are looking for a solution that is the kind of attitude that will obtain.</P>
    <P>Regarding equality of sacrifice, it seems that there is a feeling abroad, and there is justification for it, that this and all other budgets in the recent past &mdash; we have had a lot of changes of Government &mdash; have been non-runners in the sense of equality of sacrifice.  Before I go into deep <Col N="1497" /> criticism of the budget or the Minister's handling of the budget, it is only fair to say that there has been an effort made to try to bring about some form of equality of sacrifice.  We in the Labour Party will watch this very closely.  We saw it as a non-runner in the past and it is not actually up to what we would have envisaged in the Programme for Government. It has not measured up to that but at least it is a start and it must be welcomed, whatever else we might say about it.  We see it as a beginning.</P>
    <P>One can talk to working class people about the question of redistribution and about taking money from the rich to pay for the education of the poor and if that were true then it would be fair enough. But the poor do not get educated.  People in the inner city do not get educated.  I myself am of the inner city.  I was born and reared in it and I know that to be a fact.  It was a fact in my day as a boy and it is still a fact.  You do not take money from the rich to educate the poor.  There are very few of the poor running around Trinity College or UCD.</P>
    <P>We were talking earlier on about providing services.  Taxation does look after the police in the sense of raising sufficient money for the police system, the system of justice.  By and large it is fair to say that it looks after the question of equality before the law &mdash; certainly not equality, but equality before the law.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the wealth factor.  We can point to the fact that there was a wealth tax introduced in a straightforward way.  It did not yield a lot at the start but like everything else we in the Labour Party hoped that it would be gradual and progressive.  There was a lot of scaremongering at the time that people would run away and bury their money elsewhere.  I do not think that was the case.  It has been said about this Finance Bill that people will try to hide their money elsewhere because of some measures contained within it.  I do not think it was correct in regard to the weath tax and I do not think it will happen now.</P>
    <P>While the property tax is part of the Labour Party thinking, I believe on reflection &mdash; and I do not mind saying it &mdash; that it might have been a better proposition <Col N="1498" /> for the Labour Party to go after a wealth tax in a straightforward way.  If you get somewhere in the region of 4 per cent from a wealth tax you are talking about £80 million.  In the case of the property tax I do not know exactly what the figure will be.  I left school when I was 12 years old and I am not that good at figures, but my guess would be, and all my instincts tell me, that an amount between £3 million and £10 million is about as much as will be raised from it. While it is our own policy, I feel it might have been better to stick to the wealth tax.  However, the property tax is an effort to get money from people who can afford it.  It will assist or make less acute the problem of redistribution.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax had a crucifying effect on the poorer sections of the community but no Government had difficulty in bringing it further into higher percentages and then eventually turning it into VAT.  There would have been no problem, in my view, about the wealth tax being gradual and progressive but it was dropped and I do not know if the property tax will result in the State getting the equality of sacrifice that is desirable.</P>
    <P>Some Senators felt there was a lack of serious intent by the Government on the question of tax evasion.  That may have been the situation in the past under Fianna Fáil administrations but there is a genuine effort in the Finance Bill to have equity throughout the tax system. In the course of the debate on a Bill dealing with social welfare I expressed the view that it would be a good thing for the working class people who are forced to pay their taxes if evaders were jailed. I do not know if the measures in the Bill are adequate enough to capture those who are evading paying their fair share of tax.  While I accept that an effort is being made we must go a long way if we are to have equality of sacrifice.</P>
    <P>If the Minister proposes establishing a special committee from the Revenue Commissioners to watch for evaders I urge him to have that group operating on a continuous basis.  There is little point in referring to it in the Finance Bill and not pursuing the matter further.  The Minister must monitor the situation and bring in <Col N="1499" /> further legislation to deal with the matter should that be necessary.  I hope we will see results from that committee in the coming months.  It should not be necessary to wait for the publication of the Finance Bill to deal with such problems. When tax loopholes are discovered they should be plugged immediately.  I have no doubt that while we are considering the provisions of the Bill the wide boys who have managed to evade up to now are thinking up ways of continuing to do that.  That is another reason why the Revenue units should monitor the situation continuously.</P>
    <P>On the question of equality of sacrifice, I am aware of one journalist who has been hitting particularly hard about the use of State cars by Ministers.  He has a go at the Government on a regular basis about this matter.  I accept his point about the use of State cars but I suggest that that journalist should become more investigative on the question of cheap loans to company directors and senior executives.  He should look into the question of company cars, payments to separated people, off-shore tax havens, exchange controls and investment procedures. Many other areas could be investigated by that journalist.  I am looking forward to reading the newspapers from now on to see how constructive journalists can be on the question of equality of sacrifice.  Another matter that needs to be investigated is the question of subscriptions to professional associations. I am not referring to all journalists but the person who harps on one aspect of State expenditure.  Instead of being preoccupied about State cars he should put his thinking cap on.</P>
    <P>On the question of tax evasion, I would not exclude those on the lump, the self-employed, the moonlighters, professional people or those who inherit wealth. The information gathered in connection with VAT should be used in connection with those people.  It is important that the PAYE sector can see that the Government are serious about equality of sacrifice and that there will be a follow-up to the provisions of the Bill.  Instead of encouraging people to join tax marches <Col N="1500" /> and the like we should be asking them to make submissions for examination that may help ease the burden on the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>As a person from a working class background I am anxious that the burden on the PAYE sector is eased but, at the same time, I do not believe they are all playing their proper role.  I should like to remind my trade union colleagues that there is a great distinction between trade unionists and people who are members of a trade union.  Trade unionists have an interest in job creation and the economy and do not confine themselves to seeking better wages and conditions.  On the other hand some people who earn up to £20,000 a year and are members of trade unions join in such protests as tax marches and do not mind change as long as it does not hurt them.  They are not interested in the economy or equality of sacrifice.  They participate because they are being hit. My colleagues in the trade union movement should understand that this is what is happening in regard to the tax protests. The tax marches are exploited by all types of people, including militants from left wing groups and malcontents.</P>
    <P>I would be pleased to discuss this matter with trade unionists to see if I could be of any assistance to them.  I accept that tax reforms are under consideration but public spending is too great.  It would be desirable if we could introduce tax reforms and at the same time cut public expenditure, but I do not think that is possible.  I understand the Minister's dilemma but he must try to coincide the question of public expenditure with reform of the tax code.  If that is not done we will not have the massive redistribution of wealth that the Labour Party are seeking.  That should be our target.  The targets for employment and redistribution of wealth in the budget are not adequate. There is no planned programme to deal with this.  The Labour party did not enter Government on the basis of having their policies implemented in the first year.  They entered Government for the purpose of having implemented as many Labour Party policies as possible during the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>I share with my trade union colleagues <Col N="1501" /> the fears for the unemployed but, irrespective of what party or parties form the Government, I do not think anything else can be done.  Before the budget we had difficult economic problems and that had a bearing on the thinking of the Minister for Finance.  The Fianna Fáil plan, <i>The Way Forward</i>, relied totally on the private sector, cutbacks and other bookkeeping acts.  Fianna Fáil cannot accuse the Minister for Finance of engaging in a book-balancing exercise.  I do not think the private enterprise system has the capacity to create full employment.  By full employment I do not mean that everybody should have a job.  From my youth when I lived in the tenements of Dublin I have always understood that there was a tolerable level of unemployment. Over the years the private sector had many opportunities to deal with unemployment but it was not successful. I accept that there is a world recession now but that was not always the position. I can recall seeing unemployed people lying on O'Connell Bridge at a time when there was not a world recession.  We have relied too much on the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing that school leavers and those who have been made redundant do not have much hope of obtaining employment but it is the desire of the Labour Party to rectify that.  We will assert ourselves in Government and work for the creation of more jobs.  Fine Gael also consider the creation of employment to be a priority.  It is unfortunate that there is no provision for a fast expansion of the Public Capital Programme which would increase employment.  I do not think the budget will help to create jobs; it is an effort to correct the books and I accept it in that spirit.  But I do not expect those who will be hit hard by its provisions to accept it in that spirit.</P>
    <P>I hope a long-term plan in relation to employment is produced.  That should deal with the private and public sector. Investment expenditure is the key and investment priority projects should be drawn up.  I do not accept that those who are economically liberal are liberal in their social thinking.  We must have a balance between economically productive projects and socially desirable projects. <Col N="1502" /> The question of the State capital budget deserves closer attention.  The State should be in a position to make up the difference between the level of private investment and what is necessary to create jobs.  It did not happen in this budget and I doubt if it will happen in the next budget but it must be given serious attention.  I will look into this matter and my party will press for comprehensive policies and structures to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation should be provided for in a better way.  I will not be dogmatic about my figures but it is adequately provided for in the sense that the budget relates to the Finance Bill.  There have not been any great encouraging signs so far although the idea is good.  One thing which I am worried about in regard to the National Development Corporation is that it was given 1.2 per cent of the outlay for the adjusted capital programme.  A total of £220 million was originally reduced for the Public Capital Programme and that may have the effect of making the National Development Corporation appear like a token gift rather than an agreement in programme. The National Development Corporation was allocated £7 million operating capital and that was to be a supplement to the £3 million previously allocated to the national enterprise agency.  That is not in the region of what the Labour Party desires or what was expressed in the programme. I am concerned about that. When we debated this question within the party we envisaged a strong National Development Corporation with investment powers of up to £200 million in equity capital borrowing and borrowing powers.  So far the National Development Corporation has little to work with and it will find it hard to accomplish very much.  I do not know if it has commenced operations but, for example, there are no plans for the food industry as yet.  This is something we will have to press for and hopefully, our desires and ambitions will be realised in the next budget.  Some can be advanced and we will keep up the pressure over the next four years to realise some of the objectives I have mentioned. The corporation has not got a <Col N="1503" /> high level of investment.  If it does get a high level of investment and it is possible to bring it nearer to what our people desire, I have no doubt that it will reach the situation when it can advise the Government on the levels of investment necessary to provide for a rising level of employment, the public investment programme, priorities for investment projects, co-ordination between public and private investors and projects which might be the subject of research and experiment.</P>
    <P>Since it is the taxpayers who pay this money I would like to be able to tell them that the board is representative of economically essential bodies throughout the country.  I do not know what the qualifications of the members are but they should be from agriculture, banking, State bodies, Government Departments, trade unions and financial and scientific fields.  We may have to seek the advice of foreign experts on specific problems. That cannot be done on an allocation of £7 million, even with the other £3 million in reserve.</P>
    <P>The idea of the NDC is a very good one but can we afford the funds for it.? We are satisfied it will go a long way towards creating a rising level of employment. Most people are individualistic and want to know exactly how things affect them.  At the same time a substantial number of people are very concerned about employment.  If we are not able to move quickly we will suffer grave ills because we might find ourselves in a position of stagnation.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with national savings. A national savings drive would bring in capital but, because of the way savings are dealt with in the budget that is not on at the moment.  Capital taxation fell from 11.2 per cent in 1974 to 4.7 per cent in 1981.  Another look should be taken at those two matters.  I do not know what the situation is with regard to external assets.  Is there anything worthwhile there on the question of taxation?  If there is, we will not get anything by an appeal because it does not work any more.  We should consider a special tax on the income from such investments.  Governments <Col N="1504" /> can only appeal to the banks to assist the national economy.  The banks can make decisions.  The main credit creating sources are completely controlled by the banks.  The Government need a further push on credit and banking policy. Otherwise we will only get the assistance they decide to give by way of credit or investment.  That must be looked at in the next budget.</P>
    <P>There is not, in my view, a great national sense of social responsibility shown by the banks compared with the power they exercise.  If there is, it is not always in evidence.  They have a position of influence, they credit greatly in excess of what the deposits are and they are in a unique position to utilise privately owned financial resources.  The State should start looking into this area.</P>
    <P>The PAYE worker, possibly through lack of communication or understanding, does not see any burden on the wealthy. In many cases he has an argument.  I will make some suggestions later.  He believes that there is no great extra yield from capital taxes.  Whether equality of sacrifice that I set out to discuss exists or not is a puzzle to ordinary working class people.  They are naturally going to be satisfied that efforts are being made. Apart from the fact that the efforts are being made and reforms are now being attempted, despite the arguments going on for five or six years past, the people now can come to a recognition of this fact but they must be shown and it must be explained properly by Government information services that taken all together the new proposals on tax can be a good contributory factor towards bringing about this equality of sacrifice.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget that will generate work.  It seems that the exercise is to try to have some equality of sacrifice so that we can start balancing our books and try to get the people at long last to realise that pain and ache are part of the problem of getting over your difficulty and try to explain to them the implications for the whole economy.  It may be slow in getting across and a lot more may have to be done about it.</P>
    <P>Earlier I said that if the people who are <Col N="1505" /> on the tax marches could really see some person being locked up for dodging his tax or for not living up to the terms of the Bill I think things in that area and elsewhere would begin to calm down.  As regards other areas in which to look for tax I do not know whether the question of a levy on derelict sites has been considered. I do not know what it would realise.  I do not mention this purely for the amount of money it might realise but in the sense that it can be seen as equitable. If you got only £1 million from this guy, £5 million from another source and so on, workers would be in a position to say, &ldquo;Look, taxes are going to be collected; maybe they will not be heavy taxes but they are actually spreading the net to catch those who have been getting away with it and are now being drawn into the net&rdquo;.  That is a very important idea that has to be propagated.</P>
    <P>If the capital gains tax had been abolished and the gains treated as gains of income it would bring in more than we are realising at the moment.  Some estimate has suggested that it can bring in between £2 million and £10 million.  The corporation tax, for example, may appear to be abnormally high for most companies but in fact the true position seems to be that many of them are nearer to zero tax than they are to paying any sort of tax.  If a minimum of 10 per cent was put on all companies it might be a more effective way of realising anything between £50 million and £300 million. The commentators have not been able to check out the figures but there is a feeling amongst some of the commentators that that in fact could be the position.  On capital allowances which allow companies to write off the cost of plant and machinery against tax, here again the Government may be too generous.  They may give the anticipated life of the assets a little bit more than they should get. Cuts were made in health and education everywhere.  Cuts in capital allowances might have helped to realise more money than we are realising otherwise.</P>
    <P>I suppose wealth tax at 4 per cent would yield about 80 per cent against the property tax which I doubt very much <Col N="1506" /> will realise a lot.  Probably in the case of property tax if we had gone for £55,000 houses with something else we might have been able to go up near the £200 million mark.  In 1974 2 per cent was realised from inheritance tax.  In 1982 it was up .3 per cent.  These are the figures I have been looking at: whether they are accurate or not I do not know but if they are true, something must be examined there.  That beast of burden, the PAYE worker, naturally would look at many of these things.  I want to thank the Minister for coming in when we had the tax motion down.  He gave a very useful explanatory breakdown of the real situation in regard to the question of outstanding tax, whether there was a crock of gold or not. That goes into the records of the House; I do not know whether it gets across to the nation as a whole.  It is a difficult matter.  Perhaps the Minister confused it a little in one sense.  I am not blaming him for this one; the others are general references in the 1982 report.  He said that there was £962 million taxes due. When the working class people read £962 million taxes due that is what they believe is true.  They do not allow for the crazy system that exists at the moment that you can go on appealing and so on and use all sorts of good bookkeepers and solicitors. This is the system that applies with the self-employed.  That is a problem.  But the statement was there and the workers read it and in view of the additional burdens on them nobody can blame them for reacting as they did.  I do not agree with it; I think they should in fact go as I suggested.</P>
    <P>The Minister on 1 March 1983 said that there was £690 million outstanding in various taxes; £260 million pounds was clearly due and payable and £424 million was under appeal and much of it would not become due and payable.  I hope I am quoting correctly.  Let us take a third of that and it would realise £141 million. Suppose it does become due, plus the £268 million clearly outstanding for other years, it would mean we are talking about over £400 million.  This is the kind of thing that gets into the minds of the working people and if they cannot grasp it <Col N="1507" /> somebody puts it into their minds in a different way and in a distorted way.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit has fallen from £988 million or 8.4 per cent of GNP to £897 million or 6.8 per cent but again there is no anticipation of national growth and this is another area in which trade unions will be very interested.  I mentioned the question of the crock of gold: I hope we can get some more information from the Minister that I will be able to pass on.  If I am incorrect I will gladly accept correction and pass on the information as I get it.</P>
    <P>Whether the crock of gold exists to the extent that people believe it exists is another matter.  For example, we were talking about £1,200 million when we discussed the motion on taxation and about £730 million being under appeal. I think the Minister also mentioned on that occasion or it emerged somewhere that about one-third of that £1,200 million was in fact owed by local authorities. I could not see much hope of getting money out of them.  All of this is fuel for the PAYE worker who considers himself as the beast of burden.  It does not give any evidence of the promotion of equity.</P>
    <P>Again, there is not a lot in the budget on the question of unemployment but it could be said in fairness that it may provide the proper prescription for longterm employment and economic growth. It is a very trying period.  In the meantime how do you protect workers from getting the heavy end of the stick?  This is a really disturbing thing.  That is why it is essential that the communication process be right, that things are said in the simplest of terms.  My experience of life is that when you are dealing with people you just do not talk to the middle classes as something else.  There are people called working classes here; there are people who never got any education beyond primary school and many people in their phraseology and their terminology forget this and consequently when information is being imparted you have to cater &mdash; without being derogatory &mdash; for the thickest man in the squad.  That is the fellow you want to understand it. Upper and lower middle classes have a <Col N="1508" /> chance of articulating very well but basically the working classes do not.  Some sort of understanding has to be given to them in a much simpler communication process.  I do not know how you would do it.</P>
    <P>The Marketing Institute of Ireland completed a study immediately after the release of the budget and it concluded that there was a real possibility that unemployment could reach 250,000 or 20 per cent of the work force.  That is a very frightening prospect if there is any validity in it and if I am right in my argument that there will not be enough time or money to put into things like the National Development Corporation before the next budget to start redressing the problem there.  I am a little worried about that.  I think it is going to be taken in the context of the world recession. With my own limited ability to grasp the situation I do not see any great prospects there.  The budget does in fact seek long-term solvency but I must keep reminding people that I always walk into the right lobby.  I am part and parcel of the Government: I stand by my responsibility and I fully support the situation but I reserve the right to be critical.  I want it to be clear that for example, on this matter of budgetary solvency, I do not think it parallels the intentions of the Programme for Government.  It may not be possible to implement this at present but I explained earlier that possibly the intention of the Labour Party would be to have as much as possible of their policy in that programme given effect to in the lifetime of the Dáil.  At the moment I cannot see the parallel and that is something the Labour Party will have to keep pressing their colleagues and the Government about.</P>
    <P>One of the worrying features of it is whether the budget itself leads to privatisation at the expense of the public because if it does, budget actions like that are alien to the Labour Party.  They are more geared to unemployment in my view and that of many of my colleagues. I do not believe that it is within the capacity of the private sector to create a rising level of jobs.  They can talk about it; they have been talking about it for years but <Col N="1509" /> without the public side of it, I would be rather worried.  Therefore if the question of unemployment is not seriously tackled by the time we get down to the next budget, we are going to run into all sorts of problems.</P>
    <P>The Government programme does in fact recognise unemployment as the most urgent problem and therefore we in the Labour Party will be pressing very hard in this area.  There will be calls from the Labour Party for the public sector to be drawn into participation in job creation. Otherwise, I can see the unemployment becoming dire.  We must get all the people I suggested, or the areas that I suggested, roped into the Natural Development Corporation and get them into action.  Then I could see possibilities of job creation taking off and a rising level of employment coming about.  Our difficulties arise from the historical fact that we did not keep and look after our own household over the years, also from the reckless attitude we had, and because not only the working class people but all the Irish people are not directed towards realising pain and ache are necessary to cure problems that have been let grow over the years.  If you get something into someone's mind over a 30 year period there is no way that you are going to get that out of his mind in a couple of months' debate.  Consequently, the attitude for a while to come, unless we can develop some other sort of communication process, will be: &ldquo;All right, have your change so long as it affects the other fellow but do not put it on me&rdquo;.  We must devise a way to get that out of the minds of people. It is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not experience this attitude as much as I do because I knock around in the type of areas and I drink in the pubs where you are likely to get it.  I go to social gatherings where you regularly get it.  In fact, as a former trade union official, I found it was not unknown if somebody wanted to introduce a means of increasing productivity nobody objected to it provided the other guy was going to be affected &mdash; and so with the tax.</P>
    <P>While I do not agree with all of the contents of the budget, I recognise the <Col N="1510" /> difficulties the Minister was faced with. I would be prepared to give him all the co-operation it is possible to give him in trying to communicate with my type of people, to indicate clearly that there is genuine goodwill there on the part not only of the Minister for Finance but the Government as a whole, to get around to this question of dealing with people in a more equitable way even if it means taking in small amounts of taxes rather than going on to big amounts so long as it is equitable.  I would also encourage my people to realise that there is an effort by the Government, even though it is not fully in evidence at this time, to bring about this equality of sacrifice that is necessary to put the country back on the road towards creating a higher level of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a man of compassion and I promise the Minister I will not keep him too long.  I think he has suffered enough on the Finance Bill over the past four weeks.  The Minister has obviously taken Senator Harte's words to heart and believes in enduring the pains and the aches for a while longer.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a tradition that this debate on the Finance Bill is almost infinitely wide ranging.  I will not range infinitely widely but there are a number of areas that I think have produced assumptions in this country which are almost popularly and universally accepted now.  The appropriate one to start on, since it is the Finance Bill we are talking about, is the question of taxation &mdash; taxes being necessary to finance public services.  The Minister in his opening address stated the equation to be that if you want to achieve equity in taxation there must inevitably be an element of cuts in the level of public services.  He more or less postulated the axiom that the only way in which equity can be achieved is through cuts in public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The realities of Irish taxation, as distinct from the popularly preceived myths which are well and truly ingrained particularly in the thinking of the media and national commentators, is that we have an enormously high level of taxation in this country.  I am grateful to the Minister <Col N="1511" /> for a written reply to a question in the Dáil on 1 March furnishing information on the relative levels of taxation in various countries in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Tax revenue in this country represented in 1981 38.1 per cent of gross domestic product.  For a range of other countries, the UK figure was 36.8 per cent, France 42.9 per cent, Germany 37.2 per cent, the Netherlands 45.8, Luxembourg, a smaller country than Ireland, 48 per cent, Denmark 44.9 per cent.  I acknowledge that Italy and Greece would have lower figures than that.  We are not in an excessively different position from any other country in terms of the level of taxation and taxation as a percentage of gross domestic product.  Where we differ from every other country in Europe is on our dependency levels and our dependency ratio.  Our proportions of population which are below or above the productive age are vastly in excess of those in every other country, probably by an order of 50 per cent.  So how, in a country with that level of dependency, can you reduce taxation or reduce public expenditure without penalising the two groups who are not in a position to produce, the old and the young?  That is what we are going to do.  We will inevitably have to have high levels of taxation because of the structure of our population resulting from the fact that virtually two entire generations who would be producing if they were here, have emigrated and therefore we have a large population of old people &mdash; and a large population of children &mdash; who are dependent on the productive and tax-paying sectors for their incomes.</P>
    <P>If we are to talk about reductions in public expenditure and reductions in taxation then those who are dependent of necessity on public expenditure will be the victims.  We have a higher level of dependency than anywhere else in Europe.  Therefore, the implication of the fairly widespread assumption now that we must cut public expenditure will inevitably be, if there is to be any significant cut in public expenditure, that the victims will be those who are dependent on taxation for their incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1512" /> The solution lies in a fair distribution of the tax burden, not in any overall reduction in the level of taxation.  There is a political job to be done by all politicians in making this position perfectly clear, that if we are, as we claim to be, a caring society with a commitment to those who cannot earn for themselves, then there is nothing but mythology involved in the pretence that there can be substantial reductions in the level of taxation here in the immediate future.  There are adjustments and changes that can be made in the structure of taxation and I am sure successive speakers from the Labour Party have gone into this, but it is a fact that we have an extraordinary situation.  We are probably one of the few countries in Europe that have had a substantial reduction in capital taxation in the last seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>Again, I refer to written questions answered by the Minister on 1 March in the Dáil.  In this country in the period from 1974 to 1981 capital taxation dropped from 11.2 per cent of revenue to 4.7 per cent of revenue.  In France, in the same period there was an increase from 2.3 to 3.6; in the Netherlands from 3 to 3.7 per cent.  One of the things that confused me is that on two separate questions on the same day the percentage of revenue attributable to capital tax given by the Minister's Department on these questions was different.  So, I do not know which set of figures are correct. There are two different sets of figures for the percentage of revenue from capital taxation.  I suspect one includes rates and the other one does not, but it takes a lot of searching through the footnotes to discover that.  We seem to be unique in Europe in the fact that we reduced capital taxation while other countries were either holding it steady or increasing it.</P>
    <P>The Minister, to his credit, has been very forthcoming with his own ideas on cutting public expenditure.  I am grateful to the Confederation of Irish Industry for providing me with excerpts from a speech the Minister made, which was controversial at the time, about reducing public expenditure.  The Minister mentioned a <Col N="1513" /> number of things.  On social welfare he is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that great strides are being made in removing the scope for unjustified claiming of benefit.  Two main courses remain for further reductions in the real levels of expenditure. An adjustment in the basis in which the annual increase in benefit is calculated and the re-examination of the basis on which eligibility for some payments is established, notably payments available universally irrespective of need.</P>
    <P>On the second one, the Minister is probably, among other things, referring to the universal availability of children's allowances. On that particular issue I agree with him.  There is a serious inequity in somebody with a large family and £25,000 a year getting the same level of children's allowances as somebody with a large family and £100 a week.  Quite obviously, there is a case to be answered there.</P>
    <P>I am much more concerned about the reference to an adjustment in the basis on which the annual increase in benefits is calculated.  That seems to me to be a roundabout way of saying that we should find a way of giving smaller increases for social welfare in the future.  Apart from being wrong in principle, from my point of view that philosophy implies an ignoring of the level of dependency in this country and hence the necessity for high levels of welfare expenditure and there is no way you can get away from that.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed every time I hear somebody like the Minister make references to removing the scope for unjustified claiming of benefits since we have no concrete, tangible, objective evidence that there is any widespread unjustified claiming of benefit.  There is a massive prejudice; there is a considerable amount of hostility, but there is no detailed evidence that such widespread unjustified claiming of benefit exists.  In fact, the only proper scientific study that has been done in this matter is in the area of health benefits or of pay-related benefits or people on sick leave.  That was done by Mr. Hughes from the Economic and Social Research Institute and his conclusion was that there was no significant <Col N="1514" /> abuse of the scheme.  That is an area which this Government have decided to tackle contrary to the objective evidence of independent researchers that there is no significant level of abuse.  We need high levels of welfare (a) because it is right and (b) because it is a major contributor to social consensus and social cohesion.  I will be coming back to that later on.</P>
    <P>There is another side to social welfare. How would the Minister's party and the other parties in this House react if it was proposed in the interests of equity that anybody, but particularly a self-employed person, given a tax assessment which the Revenue Commissioners decided was appropriate, was told he must pay the tax, and if the assessment was incorrect all the tax paid would be refunded?  That would produce howls of protest and howls of pain, and probably quite justifiably.  This is the position of somebody on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  If an anonymous report is presented to the labour exchange or to the social welfare authorities that an individual is working when he is claiming unemployment benefit, the first thing done is that that person's benefit or unemployment assistance is stopped and the second is that the claim is investigated.  Apparently we have one level of justice for those who are dependent on the State for their income and another level of justice, totally different, for those who are paying tax to the State. The enormous amount of hardship that can be inflicted on families by that sort of attitude to welfare speaks for itself. Therefore it is unworthy of Government Ministers to further add to the level of prejudice by implying, even indirectly, that there is substantial scope for cutbacks because of inappropriate or unjustified claiming of benefits.  It is unworthy and it does enormous damage to people who are living on very limited incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister further identified housing subsidies as an area of concern.  I would like to quote the National and Economic Social Council Report No. 20,1982, page 103:</P>
    <P>Subsidies to local authority tenants, <Col N="1515" /> £62.1 million.  Subsidies to the owner occupied sector £89.2 million.</P>
    <P>I am probably being unfair to the Minister but I suspect he was talking about subsidies in local authority housing, and a major question arises here.  Which subsidy are we talking about?  Are we talking about the subsidy which provides shelter for those who cannot afford it?  Are we talking about the subsidy which provides the better off with shelter and with increased wealth, since the subsidy has the effect of enabling them to build up wealth in the form of an asset, that is a house?  If the Minister is concerned about housing subsidies he should start with the second choice which is greater in cash terms and produces, as well as a subsidy to shelter, a subsidy which enables people to accumulate wealth.</P>
    <P>Then there are what I can only describe as the idiotic cuts in public expenditure. There is, for instance, the proposal that the courses in regional technical colleges aided by the European Social Fund should be reorganised in a way which would reduce the level of assistance to people living close to the regional colleges.  It sounds a fine idea and is supposed to introduce equity but the consequence is that £270 per student will be saved by the Exchequer.  That scheme attracts substantial funding from the European Community.  For every £270 saved by the Exchequer there will be a reduction of £300 in EEC aid available to the same student.  This seems to represent a net loss of £30 per student in this country. That does not make sense.  I do not understand why it was done and, as a member of the board of a regional college, I am somewhat flummoxed at it. The whole attitude to education must be called into question.  Education is a productive investment.  It may not suit economists to define it as such, but it is an investment which produces a return which increases the capacity to produce further wealth.  If that is not a productive investment I do not know what is.  It may not meet the requirements of economists for defining a productive investment, but it is a productive investment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> It is pertinent here in the context of public expenditure generally to ask why we devote 1.6 per cent of our GNP to defence while Austria, a small country at the border between East and West, devotes only 1.3 per cent of GNP to defence, and Finland, which is also in a rather vulnerable position in terms of the East/West divide, spends only 1.4 per cent.  In other words, two major neutral countries in much more vulnerable positions and much more effectively neutral than we are, manage to survive on considerably less public expenditure on defence than we do.  Incidentally, both manage to maintain far larger standing armies, even in proportion to the population, than we do.  They also manage to maintain a much larger second line of defence in terms of the capacity to call up further forces in cases of emergency.</P>
    <P>I raised this point before when the Minister was here and he did not answer it with particular clarity.  He said that, bearing in mind all the considerations and so on, it was regarded as the appropriate level.  I repeat that we are spending well over £200 million a year on defence and we do not know why that is the appropriate level.  It does not bear much comparison with similar countries.  It does not bear comparison with Japan, which spends substantially less on defence than we do.  All we have is a couple of thousand idiots parading around this country in paramilitary uniforms doing a lot of damage.  I do not believe we need to spend 1½ per cent of our GNP to deal with that problem.  We have a slight willingness to indulge certain people who want to play toy soldiers. Perhaps in times of prosperity that is good for some people because it gives them an outlet for their aggression, but in times of recession and hardship that is over £200 million at a time when the spending of every single penny needs to be scrupulously scrutinised.  Why do we have to spend more of our GNP on defence than other countries with a similar population who are admittedly wealthier but who are in vastly more vulnerable positions than we are and who have much more positive policies of neutrality? This is an area in which a substantial <Col N="1517" /> 25 per cent cutback in expenditure could save the sort of money that would enable some of the rather ridiculous cutbacks in education to be avoided.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of public expenditure that need to be reviewed.  If as has been asserted by independent experts, in the area of agricultural production a 40 per cent increase in milk production could be achieveable without any increase in the cost of inputs, then the whole structure of the financial assistance to agriculture must be looked at.  If, in spite of the enormous financial assistance that is there, people cannot be persuaded even to produce the maximum that is consistent with the level of input they are making, then a question must be asked. If it is true, as has been asserted, that in or around £100 million extra in beef exports would be generated if calf mortality rates which would be acceptable in any other country were achieved here, then again the whole area of expenditure on agriculture needs to be assessed.</P>
    <P>Assistance in the area of public expenditure to the private manufacturing industry sector needs to be reassessed fundamentally.  A report appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on May 26, on the finance page, under the heading &ldquo;Irish Suppliers under Fire&rdquo;.  The implications of the report were that a high proportion of foreign investors in this country found Irish industrial relations to be good, Irish productivity to be good and return on investment in Ireland to be good.  The figures were of the order of 80 per cent. There were a number of areas in which reservations were expressed.  One was in the area of availability of skilled labour, and it is in that context that the proposed reductions in public expenditure in the area of education are highly questionable. If one of the major constraints on industrial development is a shortage of skilled labour then cutbacks in the area which produce a skilled labour force are obviously self-defeating, pointless and nonsensical.</P>
    <P>Another area of major constraint was in the area of telecommunications and transport.  The interesting thing about those areas is that they are exclusively under the Government's control.  In the <Col N="1518" /> areas of return on investment, profitability, productivity and industrial relations things were all right.  Perhaps it behoves the Government to spend less time lecturing the trade union movement and trade unionists about their obligations and more in getting their own business in order in the areas of infrastructure, training and education.</P>
    <P>The most serious allegation contained in a report produced by the British based organisation, The Annual Investment File &mdash; I do not know their authority but it was a survey of the views of industry &mdash; was in relation to the view of foreign companies of native Irish firms as suppliers of materials and components.  Only 16 per cent rated Irish firms as good in this area, while 48 per cent said they were fair, and a large 37 per cent said that native Irish firms were poor in terms of their capacity to supply goods and materials to foreign companies which had invested here.  That is a serious indictment of the capacity of native Irish enterprise to meet international deadlines and international standards in terms of quality of products and so on.  There appear to be two different economies and two different types of manufacturing industry developing here: one based on foreign capital and foreign expertise but involving Irish work forces who obviously can compete with the best in the world in terms of productivity, industrial relations, etc. and the other a native Irish enterprise which seems to be incapable of meeting the standard required and expected by international agencies and international corporations.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the authors of this report are that the figures offer no consolation at all.  Nearly 40 per cent of American companies think Irish products are poor; 43 per cent of the Scandinavians agree, and only 8 per cent of British companies have a good opinion of Irish supplies.  That is the conclusion of an independent agency looking at the performance of native Irish manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>There has been too much tendency, first to look at Irish manufacturing industry globally and to attribute the problems in certain sectors to all sectors.  There has <Col N="1519" /> been too much willingness to attribute all our problems to excessive wage costs, so called, and there has been too much willingness to attribute our problems to low productivity by the Irish work force. There are two different sectors, one, the foreign investment based area where productivity is obviously acceptably high and there is another area where there is a serious problem.  The same working people are employed in both areas.  The same trade union movement represents the people in both areas.  The only conclusion one can come to is that native Irish entrepreneurs are incapable or unwilling to produce goods and services of a quality and at a cost that is required by international corporations.  That is a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>The particular issue brings me to what I have described before as the new great national aim which has supplanted the restoration of the language and the reintegration of the national territory, that is, the restoration of competitiveness.  It seems to be the primary and almost exclusive concern of both economists and Government Ministers of varying groups and varying parties.  It is interesting to consider the views on competitiveness taken by the Confederation of Irish Industry.  In their February newsletter they said that the level of income and employment in the Irish economy depends critically on one factor which is totally within our control &mdash; the cost competitiveness of industry.</P>
    <P>In response to a couple of people's pointed comments, a somewhat different view was being expressed: competitiveness is a function of relative unit costs, quality, design, marketing skills and the application of up-to-date technology and efficiency.  In two months we have come from an idea when it was simply a question of cost competitiveness to a recognition of the realities of the international market place, which is that an awful lot more than cost competitiveness is involved and that we have a lot more to do than just reduce the level of wages to produce the sort of competitiveness people are concerned about.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a reasonably <Col N="1520" /> eminent economist, who is also a journalist, Paul Tansey, who writes for <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i>  In an article he makes the point that attributing our problems in competitiveness exclusively to the problems of wage cost inflation is naive.  It may be convenient for economists but it does not reflect the realities of Irish life. Since, he says</P>
    <P>there is a great variation in the relative importance of wage costs between firms, it is clearly inapplicable to set a specific target for pay increases. In the traded sector, pay increases should be determined by individual companies' financial circumstances and their ability to pay.</P>
    <P>He goes on to discuss the other areas which affect competitiveness:</P>
    <P>Many Irish firms are too concerned with producing a commodity rather than a product.  The commodity itself is only part of the product required by a customer.  Adherence to delivery dates and the provision of adequate servicing and after-sales service are part of the product sold.</P>
    <P>Referring to the comments of foreign investors on the production of Irish goods and services, it is interesting to note that Paul Tansey and many other economists are beginning to identify the distinction between a product and a commodity, and that most Irish native industrialists and businesses are not capable of producing commodities or products which are acceptable to the other section of the Irish economy, that is, the foreign investment based high technology, high efficiency area.  Where do we go?  As has been suggested for agriculture in recent times, we should revamp the whole structure of industrial incentives to identify companies which are capable, willing and able to produce products which are internationally competitive in the broad sense, as defined by the Confederation of Irish Industry, and that includes not just cost but things like quality, design, marketing, skills, the application of up-to-date technology, etc.  That is what real competitiveness means, and it is not <Col N="1521" /> inherently or even initally related to labour costs which are one contributor and only one contributor.</P>
    <P>There is the question of infrastructure, again identified by most foreign investors as one of our major problems, entirely under Government control.  There is the question of telecommunications, again entirely under Government control.  We need to open our eyes and look a little further than our nearest neighbour for models of how to organise society and how to organise ourselves.  Before anybody starts worrying, I am not going to leap across into Eastern Europe.  There is a very interesting report, with which I am sure the Minister is more familiar than I am, on the Irish economy, policy and performance from 1972 to 1981, produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  One chapter has to do with what is called cross-country perspectives. The authors look at a number of countries, including Ireland.  In particular they identify two countries which in the period 1970 to 1980 have been particularly successful in dealing with the problems of that decade &mdash; Austria and Germany.  I will refer briefly to Germany, but Austria is particularly important because it is comparable in size with this country.  In the period from 1970 to 1980 Austrian real GNP grew at an average rate of 4.2 per cent, our rate of GNP grew at a rate of 3.7 per cent; unemployment in Austria in the period of 1970 to 1980 actually decreased, from 2.4 per cent in 1970 to 1.9 per cent in 1980.  In this country it went up from 6.4 per cent to 9.5 per cent.  In Austria the average increase in the consumer price index was 6.1 per cent in that decade and in this country it was 11.7 per cent.  In any parameter that can be used to measure economic performance, Austria out-performed this country consistently in the decade 1970-80, as did Germany, but Germany is regarded as a major international and economic power, and therefore it might not be altogether fair to make comparisons.</P>
    <P>In the case of Austria, a country of comparable size and with no enormous resources, this extraordinary out-performance of this country by a small country needs to be examined in some detail, <Col N="1522" /> and that is what the authors of this report did.  They also identified the fact that, even though increases in wages and salaries in that decade were less in Austria percentage-wise than they were in this country the actual real gain to the work force was substantially greater because prices rose at a substantially lower rate. Austrian productivity increased by 35 per cent in that decade; Irish productivity increased by 22 per cent.  What is interesting and needs to be said, because it is neither popular on the radical left nor in the huge mass of the centre and right which dominates Irish politics, is that political and social circumstances were the cause of that level of success in Austria.</P>
    <P>I read a document produced not by any left wing organisation but by the Economic and Social Research Institute and by three of its most eminent staff.  They said:</P>
    <P>What existed in Austria was a solidaristic orientation between Government and the trade union movement based on a long and strong tradition of left wing politics, and where feelings of class solidarity are resilient enough to supplant sectional interests on the part of individual unions as the overall guiding principle of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>It is a pity to have to apologise for introducing the idea of class solidarity into a debate on the future economic performance of this country.  It is a pity to have to introduce the idea of left wing politics as some sort of extraordinary phenomenon that is unworthy of the Irish people. But what I repeat is that facts are there, that the best performance of any European economy in the decade from 1970 to 1980 was that of the Austrian economy.  This was on every parameter &mdash; including all the ones that those who would be obsessed with the national accounting would choose to look at like budget and trading deficits and so on and, above all else, in the area of unemployment. That was based on the fact, which was not coincidental, that in Austria during that period there was a Social Democratic Government and a well-organised, efficient trade union move-organised <Col N="1523" /> ment which saw its role as a partner in government with the political wing of the trade union movement.  That is what we lack in our country and that is what our two major parties have not faced up to: that there is a need for the trade union movement to be a major political party, not just in what the authors of that report would call econometric concerns but in the whole area of social policy, social development and economic development.</P>
    <P>What we need in this country, if we cannot have the sort of socialism which perhaps I would prefer, is the sort of European social democratic consensus which is best typified by both Germany and Austria.  In both of these countries there is a concept of partnership which is totally different from the sort of partnership people talk about here.  We do not have social partners in this country.  What we have are confrontationist tactics.  In that context it is the function first of all of Government and secondly of those who run and manage and organise industry to bring about the consensus.</P>
    <P>The sort of tactics the Minister uses &mdash; this is why I referred earlier to the Minister's comments on welfare &mdash; will not create a social consensus.  He will not create a social consensus by singling out wage costs as the major problem in regard to competitiveness.  He will not create a social consensus by singling out a one-sided Commission of Industrial Relations report and suggesting, as employer organisations have done, that that is to be implemented, irrespective of the fact that there was no trade union participation in it.  That is not the road to social consensus, and not the road this country should be taking.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, not just an economic problem.  We have before all else a social problem of organising a small country with a sense of consensus.  In Austria, as I said, there was a highly solidaristic trade union movement which was regarded as a major partner and which worked as a major partner because of a tradition of left wing politics and class solidarity &mdash; and I emphasise those two words because they are not popular <Col N="1524" /> in this country.  In West Germany, on the other hand, at a local level they have a very highly-developed level of participation because of the highly sophisticated industrial democracy that exists there. The Government can have either model if they wish.  But there is no point pretending we can develop the sort of consensus that this country needs while at the same time pursuing economic and social policies which are divisive, because they attack welfare, identify disproportionately wage costs as the cause of our lack of competitiveness, and fail to identify the failure of native Irish enterprise in particular to meet international standards as specified by international investors.</P>
    <P>We have had an attack on welfare.  We have had little consensus, and what is left is in the process of collapse.  We have had dishonesty about, for instance, profit in industry.  I am an engineer, not an economist, and I recognise that the function of industry is to create wealth.  Therefore, if we are talking about profit as the creation of wealth by industry then I, for one, am quite happy to recognise profit as a major function of industry.  But there is a difference between profit created for reinvestment and profit created to line the pockets of investors.  One is an admirable and necessary increase in the sum of wealth in a community; the other is a benefit to one group and one section of society, and like all other sections should be subject to regular review and constraint.</P>
    <P>That is what people are dishonest about.  They talk about the profit motive on the one hand being the need to create wealth, but on the other hand they say that the profit motive is effectively an attempt to persuade investors to invest. You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot issue long lectures to working people about the need for wage restraint and in the next breath talk about the need to create a climate of investment based on incentives, because if incentive is the model for society then everybody is entitled to material incentives and there is no point asking for solidarity consensus and patriotism from one section of society if the other section is being recognised as <Col N="1525" /> lacking all those qualities and, therefore, must be presented with material incentives to invest.  If, on the other hand, by the profit motive you mean the need to create wealth which can be used for further investment, who is against that?</P>
    <P>At the end of it all we have to remember that, although economists are important, and engineers are important in society, it is not an economy that we are running: it is a country populated by people.  It is people who run countries. But it is politicians who run countries, because they are elected by the people to represent them, to do that job, and ultimately it is a matter of developing the sort of political leadership which can achieve the sort of consensus which existed in Austria &mdash; social, political and economic consensus based on a common analysis of the problem and an attempt to reach a common solution.  This cannot be achieved with the old fashioned conservative politics which have dominated this country.</P>
    <P>I might have a personal view about the future.  What I know is that there is a realistic model of a future already in existence in some countries in Western Europe, but it is based on a totally different perspective of what a country is about and it is based on a totally different perspective of what is important in society. I refer again to the model of one country in Europe, Austria, which has achieved more economic growth, lower unemployment, lower inflation and well balanced budget, and so on by a political structure, a social structure and a role for the trade union movement from which this country is moving further and further away.</P>
    <P>That is the way forward for this country, based &mdash; in the short term at least &mdash; on some attempt to reach consensus and away from the simplistic economic myths which try to pretend that one aspect of industrial costs, that is, wages, is the source of all our problems.  We have a problem about the ineptitude of Irish industry.  Irrespective of one's views on its future, it is inept, and we have the evidence of foreign manufacturers to that effect.  We have the evidence of low productivity and we have the evidence of <Col N="1526" /> their failure to export.  That is the problem and the solution will not be in terms of economic models based on numbers but on political leadership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused by Senator Ryan's suggestions that more progress would be made if trade unions were seen to be more involved in the running of the State.  I am fully convinced &mdash; I say this with sincerity as a trade unionist &mdash; that too much emphasis is being put on the question of whether or not trade unions should be so much involved.  The difference between a person who is a trade unionist and a person within a union who is politically motivated must be questioned.  I do not think it is right to say we would have a better society if trade unions were politically motivated. We have an example of that at present in the run-ins between our three or four bigger unions.  Senator Ryan said that because of the run-ins between unions and Governments in Austria and West Germany there are fewer problems.  On that point I would have to agree.  In those countries if problems are created by unions or management the law says one or other must be fined.</P>
      <P>As a trade unionist I feel that if problems are created here by management or trade unions &mdash; and problems have been created by bad management and by bad trade unionists &mdash; those people should be brought before the courts, and those found to be wrong should be fined accordingly.  There is proper motivation in countries like Austria and West Germany.  The number of unions here must be questioned in the long term interests of our country.  The vast majority of our trade unionists are really concerned about the way the unions are going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to what the Minister said about the way he thinks the country should be run over the next 12 months, and what the priorities are.  I will start on the question of priorities.  He mentioned the frustration of the PAYE sector and how they are showing their concern.  I suppose I would be wrong to say as a trade unionist that they are showing it in the wrong way, or that they are being <Col N="1527" /> unfair to the Government.  For far too long that sector has been expected to pay the vast majority of taxes collected.  I appreciate that the Minister is trying to get money from other sectors.</P>
    <P>I also appreciate the amount of credibility we have lost over the years, nationally and internationally.  Our borrowings are costing us more because of this.  That is very important, and will be very serious in the years to come.  We must build up our credibility.  The Minister is trying to do that.</P>
    <P>In recessionary times like these, questions must be asked as to whether we are going the right way about it.  We must try to appreciate what the Cabinet and the Minister are trying to do.  They are trying to create a proper and fair society.  Are we creating a despondent society?  Are we providing the right incentives?  We must get our priorities right.  I know the problems were not created by this Minister or this Government, but that is irrelevant now.  If we had acted correctly over the past eight to ten years, we would now be riding out this recession much better than we are at present.</P>
    <P>Are we being fair to the people who are prepared to pay their fair share, and by that I mean the PAYE sector and the self-employed sector who are now being branded wrongly as people who are not paying any tax?  How do we ensure that the right people are paying the right amount?  How do we create incentives? How do we motivate people to do more business and to try to employ more people?  The view I get from the people I represent is that there is no incentive for the self-employed to employ even one more person each.  That is a pity.  If a self-employed person wants to employ somebody and pay him £100 a week &mdash; perhaps he is a married man with two children &mdash; he must be prepared to pay him in the region of £170 or £180 a week. How can he do that?  That is an area in which more can be done.  Unfortunately the incentive is not there.  Unfortunately throughout the past few months the impression has been given that the self-employed are contributing nothing.  That is most unfair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> I read in the newspapers yesterday that more companies are ready to close.  Are we giving the priority to the right people? Some people are prepared to say: &ldquo;We did not make any money this year.  Our profits are down, but we will try to ride out the storm.&rdquo;  It would be wrong to say the Government are not helping people who can weather the storm with a bit of help.  Unfortunately the impression is given to the vast majority of small employers that this help is not available. The impression is also given that in the long term no light is to be seen at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>An employer of two or three people must consider what his profit will be at the end of the year.  The name of the game at the end of the day is to show these people that it is worthwhile working here.  It is important for the Government to say to them: &ldquo;Get on with it.  Help is here.  We have the ability.  The priority of the Government is to give people a fair standard of living.&rdquo;  I read a report which said 30 per cent of our society are under the poverty line.  That is one in every three people.  That is very serious in our society today.  Where do we draw the poverty line today as compared with 25 years ago?  We are giving the impression that if we do not provide proper recreation centres, or dual carriageways, we are not in line with everybody else in modern Europe.</P>
    <P>We are now paying for mistakes made over a period of 12 years.  They started in 1971 with decimalisation.  We started to roll and forgot that one new penny had the value of two old pennies and two new pennies had the value of four old pennies. A bar of Cadbury's chocolate which cost sixpence suddenly cost four new pence. Senator Ryan forgets that when he compares us with Austria or West Germany. If we had introduced one coin at a time rather than changing over in one day, inflation would not have run so high.  We lost the value of our money.  The whole problem started at that time.  Since then we have gone at such a rate that all hell has broken loose.  We started spending money at such a rate that it was frightening.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1977 our current deficit <Col N="1529" /> was in the region of £204 million and by the end of 1978 it was £680 million due to bad spending.  We must pay for that. Unfortunately, now that we are trying to put our house in order we are in the worst recession for 40 years.  The people expect motivation from the Government.  The Government must be seen to be creating motivation and, unfortunately, I do not see that motivation.  How can we provide it?  In their annual reports within the past month two banks showed profits in the region of £50 million to £60 million.</P>
    <P>I am not a financial wizard, but is there any way the Government can tell the Central Bank to give incentives to people?  Our interest rates should be dropped in comparison with those of other countries.  The cost of money here is frightening.  No incentive is given to anybody to create employment.  The amount of money we owe to the international banks may be the cause of our high interest rates.</P>
    <P>I was in a bank the other day and if you invested £5,000 in this bank you would get in the region of 8½ per cent interest on it.  They said they were also prepared to lend money at the rate of 15 per cent but, in actual fact, it was nearer to 29½ per cent.  At the moment, the vast majority of people are on their knees trying to hold on to employment and trying to save &mdash; and that includes the Government.  At the same time we have groups within our society who are not prepared to tighten up.  They want to make the same amount of money.  They do not want to tighten up and take less while others are trying to ride out the storm.  People who are prepared to invest get 8½ per cent for their money, while the banks lending money to people who need it want a total rate of 29 per cent.  That is very serious.  Serious questions must be put to these people by the Government.  I would like to know who is governing.  The Government should tell the banks to drop their rates. What is the interest rate in Britain as compared with here?  I would say there is a difference of 4, 5 or even 6 per cent.  A few people here are getting the profits and the vast amount of profits going to the few must be seriously questioned. Can we blame the masses for asking <Col N="1530" />&ldquo;What is going on?  What is in it for me?&rdquo; We should be starting at the top and not at the bottom.  People at the top must show example.  I speak on behalf of a particular party, and I am very proud of it.  After one month in Government we took £5 million from the banks, and after seven months we took another £20 million. I make no apology for that.</P>
    <P>The people who have been making the money, and in particular the big banks who have made a lot of money from this State, must now be seen to be giving a little back to the State.  It can be said that there are bad debts, that businesses are going into liquidation.  There are bankruptcies, and so on.  Over the past few years the banks handed out money and the impression was created that there was no shortage of money.  It was the people in the banks who did this.  Yet, we get a six-weekly report from the Central Bank stating that we must do this and we must do that and nobody is prepared to say that banks caused many problems. People's expectations about the values of properties went so high that it was frightening. The impression was given that there was no problem, and that everybody could get what they wanted.  Now look at the situation we are in.  There is no incentive any more.  Between 1977 and 1979 when things were going well banks were handing out money at such a rate that neighbours were fighting each other for the same bit of land.  We must begin to motivate people.</P>
    <P>The people drawing the vast amounts of profits must be the first to tighten up. They should be made to help out since they made the profits over the years.  Why are not serious questions being put to the banks?  Why can they not drop their interest rates?  Why can they not take less profit this year in comparison to other years?  Everybody else must do that. People are asking &ldquo;Who am I working for?&rdquo; If I owed £100,000, which is a very small amount today, I would be paying back something in the region of £16,000 or £18,000 to faceless people.  Where is my incentive?  Will I get any help anywhere? How am I to be motivated?  These are the questions I am putting and perhaps <Col N="1531" /> I am not putting them strongly enough.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that these are recessionary times.  In comparison with other western countries, we are not fully developed. We should be constantly developing our country.  We are not doing that and I want to know why.  Particular areas in which moneys are spent may not be the right areas.  Are our priorities right?  We want everybody to pay the piper.  We want everybody to pay more taxes, and yet we create no incentives.  I do not like that.  We must be seen to be giving an example.  Where is the example, when we saw a report last month of a profit of £52 million &mdash; and even at that they said they had bad debts.  Is that not a pity?  At £1 million a week they had bad debts.  The country is on its knees.  It is very unfair to our society that people should say that.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the question of the PAYE sector and whether the rumpus being caused by this sector should be questioned.  Is it true that 79 per cent of all the tax collected is paid by the PAYE sector?  I would like to know whether that is right or wrong.  I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do but it is little consolation to the person who is now bringing home less than he had months ago.  The other night a person on a monthly cheque told me he got £100 less this month than he got last month.  How can I explain to him why he is getting £100 less?  I hope he will be better off within the next two or three years.  I hope the Government's policies will improve the situation of all the people throughout the land.  I cannot blame the PAYE workers for their feeling of frustration.  It would be wrong to say they have no right to argue.  The difference is that the PAYE worker is working.  Many people who are not working say to me: &ldquo;I wish I was paying taxes&rdquo;, and they are right. The vast majority of people are prepared to pay their fair share of taxes.  At the same time, it is only right and proper to say that the PAYE sector are carrying too much of the tax load.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged by the fact that the Minister is trying to collect taxes elsewhere. An impression is given that, <Col N="1532" /> because of the diversification of tax collection, people who must pay more taxes are losing the incentive to work.  The motivation of the private sector is not there.  That is very serious.  The question is how do we start motivating these people?  We must tell them that they will be on their toes every other day.  They are paying too much.  The Central Bank should tell the other banks to &ldquo;knock it off&rdquo;.  I am convinced that the amount of money ordinary people are paying to the banks is far too high.  It is not fair.  To give an example, if we said to a person owing £100,000 with three or four people employed that he would get 5 per cent off his interest rate, that would mean £100 per week to that person.  That might employ one more person.  If 3,000 or 4,000 more people were in that position we would create more work.  We are not doing that, so how can we say that our priorities are right?  I fail to understand that.</P>
    <P>I am confused as regards tax on property over £65,000.  I am convinced that it will not bring in the amount of money that we think it will bring in.  It will be very hard to implement but I do not see any reason why any person with property to the value of £65,000 or over should not pay something on it.  It is a very small amount.  The people with that standard of living must be seen to be paying more. Why not?  I do not see any objections from anybody.  I spoke to people in that area and they did not object to it.  It will show that there are people with other incomes.  I make no apology for saying that persons with a joint income of over £20,000 a year should pay something on a property of over £65,000.  I emphasise that the property must be valued over £65,000.  They can still earn over £400 a week between them and have property worth £60,000 and they do not have to pay anything.  I think they should.  Serious questions must be asked as regards the number of people receiving an amount of money into one home and not paying enough on it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is hammered every day of the week as regards this budget.  It has been a very tough budget and small blame to people if they are discouraged <Col N="1533" /> by it.  At the same time there are a lot of areas throughout our society where something can be created.  In particular I say this about the public sector and I question whether moneys are being spent in the right way.  I am not the first and I will not be the last to say this.  Serious questions must be asked about it.  If it was explained to the vast majority of people where their money was going there would be a revolution.  Questions should be asked whether these moneys are being spent in the right way, whether we are getting proper productivity for the amount of money we spend in the public sector.  I know the Minister is questioning this.  Again it is a question of priority whether so many people should be in a particular sector when we could do with 10,15 or 20 percent fewer.  If we go out to the public sector, the PAYE sector and the self-employed people and say that to them, they will ask what is this or that fellow doing and ask: &ldquo;Why do I have to do something when he does not have to do it because he has a handy job?&rdquo; Enough is not being done in that area.</P>
    <P>We in Government should say to the people that they are paying a lot more this year but we are giving the commitment that certain things will be done.  I do not see any commitment coming from the Government.  I do not hear anybody saying: if we are going to get this, this is our priority.  I can appreciate that manifestos have been put before the people on election day, but a manifesto is a manifesto of a day.  Governments of the day should say to these people that if they raise a certain amount of money, that is what will happen to it.  The impression is given that we want everything but we do not want to give anything.  Why is this impression given?  I do not understand it. If moneys are being collected from the PAYE sector, from the private sector and the self-employed, we must say where we think it must go.  We are not doing that.</P>
    <P>In the educational sector we were looking for a minimum cutback of 5 per cent. The impression was given that we were closing down the whole educational system, yet something in the region of £900 <Col N="1534" /> million a year is spent on the educational system.  Maybe we went the wrong way about it as a Government but let us be realistic about it.  If proper recognition was given by everybody within the educational system to the fact that there must be a cutback of only 5 per cent, why is it not recognised for what it is?  I do not understand why the impression was given that everything was happening throughout the educational system and everybody was going to be less well-off.  That was not true at all.  If we said to anybody in the private sector that to save his neck he would have to cut by 5 per cent, would he say it could not be done?  It should be said to the people that we need a cutback of 5 per cent here and we need a 5 per cent cut in the health boards' allocations over the next three years.</P>
    <P>It is only right that questions should be asked about the public sector and the amount of money being spent that the majority of people do not see.  The incentive is not being given to the private sector where we can create productive employment.  I emphasise productive employment because for far too long we gave the impression that anybody who was servicing anybody else was in a productive job.  That is not so.  We need productivity.</P>
    <P>Serious questions should be asked as to whether or not our priorities are right as regards forestry.  Why is there not more work being created from forestry? A million acres of land are under forestry in this country yet we sell an amount of timber at £1 a ton to some other country. Are we saying that that timber cannot be used for more than a £1 a ton in this country when we import coal at £110 a ton?  Where are our priorities there?  Are we saying that we are not low enough? Are we saying that 30 per cent of our people that are supposed to be in the poverty sector cannot burn timber?  Is that not a matter that must be questioned?</P>
    <P>Is it not true to say that there are many people throughout the agricultural sector getting a lot of money for doing nothing? We know there are.  There are areas in the agricultural sector that must be seriously questioned and why is it not being <Col N="1535" /> done?  Is it not true to say that there are areas throughout local authorities that can be seriously questioned?  Why not?  Is it not true to say that we are spending moneys which we could be putting to better use?</P>
    <P>I was reading yesterday about the amount of money being spent throughout the land on local authority housing.  Why is that not better used?  Why are we not motivating people to do more for themselves? Why are we not saying something in the region of about £22 million in the Cork area alone is being spent this year on housing?  That £22 million could be better distributed.  I am convinced there are a lot of people within our society who are being housed by the State and should not be housed, although I accept that there are people who cannot provide their own houses.  There are people who with a little more motivation could be seen to be doing something for themselves.</P>
    <P>When we were last in Government the then Minister for the Environment brought in a Bill setting up the Housing Finance Agency.  That gave some motivation, but I do not think we are going far enough.  The sum of £25 million will be spent by two local authorities and about 700 families will be accommodated for that.  Divide that accordingly and it works out at about £35,000.  At least half of these families with some little bit of help and motivation could be doing something for themselves.  Just imagine the amount of money that could be better used in that area alone.  If we in Cork city and county had £12 million to help people under the Housing Finance Agency Act, just imagine the number of people that we would accommodate.  Instead of giving them local authority houses we would give them Housing Finance Agency loans which do not put too much pressure on these types of people.  People with a little bit of help and by using these loans can be motivated to buy their own houses.  If we are giving Cork Corporation £10 million for housing, why do we not say that £2 million should be divided between people who want to do something for themselves and use £8 million on building <Col N="1536" /> houses for people who are under the poverty line?  How many people at £5,000 a head would you motivate with £2 million? Correct me if I am wrong it is 400 families. Yet the £12 million or something in that region last year only housed 400 families.</P>
    <P>We should be seen to be doing better things with our money.  I want to know why we are not saying to the general public that if they are prepared to give us the money over the next few years we are prepared to be seen to do specific things with it.  We are not doing anything in that line.  We are not saying to the people who are giving us the money that their money is being spent well.  People are now asking very serious questions.  I know a man who is now paying £100 more tax a month because of this.  Why would he not ask questions?  He is admitting that he is less well off this year than he was last year or the year before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is questionable.  On the question of change of Government I would like to emphasise that the problems have not arisen since a particular Government came into office.  I would hope that we would be constructive.  Let us not give the impression that this happened seven years or even two years ago. The facts are that our current deficit in 1977 was £204 million and in 1981 it was in the region of £1,250 million.  Why was that?  The question must be asked but it is past tense whether we like it or not, irrespective of who was in office.  I do not want to knock anyone in particular but I do not think we had a good Government then.  They were not doing the right things for our country, and I do not think anybody should say otherwise, irrespective of who they were.</P>
      <P>The Minister emphasised in his speech that he is concerned about the collection of taxes.  We all have to pay taxes.  More questions must be asked about the public sector.  The vast majority of people are now asking questions as to whether or not we are going to put our house in order and if we put our house in order they are prepared to pay their fair share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> I am sorry for staying so long on my feet.  I felt it had to be said.  I do not think I was unfair to anyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that what I would have to say would be taken into consideration by the Minister.  I doubt if he intends to accept any amendments, judging by the way the Bill was put through the Dáil, but I would hope that he would see the reason for having a further look at our finances.</P>
      <P>The budget introduced by the Minister in February will have very serious consequences with regard to the productive section, the section which we would be hoping would take us out of this present recession.  From what I can see of the Bill, the Minister has decided mainly to tax the old reliables.  He may state that he has brought in new capital taxation but the sort of capital taxation that he has gone for is of a smokescreen type and will not yield to the State any considerable amount of finance.  His actions in the Bill will have a very damaging effect, especially with regard to industry and the farming community.  I feel that his decision to bring all farmers into the tax net is a very retrograde step.  A lot of farmers who are in the more productive and more ambitious side of farming have decided that it would now be in their best interests to scale down their operations rather than expand.  We know that if the economy is to be taken out of this recession the agricultural sector will have to play a major role in that achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of farmers that have been brought into the tax net for the first time is 90,000.  I wonder if the Minister could tell us how much money he hopes to get from these people.  If we take it on the basis of what is being received from the 35,000 bigger farmers who are already in the tax net, he can expect to get very little.  The only people who will gain from this will be the accountancy profession. Not alone will farmers have to keep accounts for the first time but even farmers whose income entitles them to social welfare will now be forced to present accounts.  We know that many of them will not be in a position to prepare <Col N="1538" /> accounts themselves but must go to an accountant and be charged quite a large sum to prove that they do not owe any revenue to the State.  It will mean that the moneys paid for the preparation of this documentation will reduce the farmers' income for the year.</P>
    <P>The decision with regard to a factual assessment of all farmers as far as unemployment assistance is concerned is a retrograde step because we are going back to the stage when the ducks and the chickens are going to be counted by social welfare officers and we know that many a duck and many a chicken died in debt.  The only ones who did not die in debt were those who came from the deep litter end of the fanning business.  We see the small farmers who are not likely to pay any tax having this further worry placed on them.  I know that the Minister may have done this in order to prove to the PAYE section that a lot of these people are in fact living below the poverty line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>The system is designed to make sure they do not come into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The system may be designed to prove that they do not come into it but I know that there are small farmers in the west who are shivering at the thoughts of receiving the profile forms from the Revenue Commissioners because they fear the tax form more than the people who are dealing with it every day, such as PAYE workers or the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting to hear what Senator Cregan had to say with regard to the self-employed because the incentive for people to expand, especially those who are in small business, is being totally wiped out by the various regulations that have been imposed on them.  The Minister should also ask the Revenue Commissioners to examine the possibility of small traders and small business people with very small numbers of employees &mdash; I am talking about people with fewer than ten employees &mdash; being allowed to pay PAYE and PRSI on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis, which sometimes can create additional staff problems and can often mean that they have to <Col N="1539" /> employ extra people or pay extra to some of their accountants.  It is something that he could examine.</P>
    <P>With regard to the changes proposed in the regulations governing the amount of interest which may be earned by people before they become liable to tax and the reduction from £70 to £50, it now appears that if you have enough money in the bank to pay your funeral expenses you will already have to pay tax on it before you die.  The annoying part of it is that a lot of this money which would be invested in small sums with the commercial banks is money invested by people who already have paid tax on it, such as PAYE workers.  Those are the main small deposit account holders in the commercial banks.</P>
    <P>I would be worried also about the amount of money which has left the banks recently because of people becoming frightened of these proposed changes in the tax system.  The tax system is showing a disincentive to people to save.</P>
    <P>The Minister may take heart at the amount of extra VAT which has been received in the first months of this year by the Department, but the traditional areas of high VAT returns are showing a large drop, namely the licensed trade and cigarette sales.  This is a dangerous sign because the drop in the sales of alcohol is going to have a drastic effect on employment within the licensed trade. We can see that and also the amount of illegal imports of alcohol is frightening. The Minister in imposing such savage increases should have realised the effect they would have on revenue intake.</P>
    <P>The effect on tourism of these increases will be felt very hard and, while the Minister might have agreed to a reduction from 23 per cent to 18 per cent in VAT for hotels and restaurants, I find it annoying to think that people have only to pay duty at a very low rate when leaving the country to go to the Canaries or elsewhere compared to what they would have to pay if they stayed at home.</P>
    <P>No changes have been made in the PAYE tax allowances and we all know that with inflation running at approximately 15 per cent people are going to be <Col N="1540" /> 15 per cent less well off.  The failure to give any extra allowances will mean a considerable drop in their standard of living, much more than they would possibly be able to stand.  It was interesting to hear Senator Cregan mention the worker who found himself approximately £25 a week worse off.  That has become common with regard to people who are in employment.  The proposals of this budget are not going to do anything for the unemployed.  They will not do anything for the young people seeking employment.  The proposals will not give any incentive to expansion.  We would be hoping to get expansion in industry and in the agricultural sector, but these two sections have been hit harder in this budget than they have been hit for quite a number of years.</P>
    <P>The lack of finance for local authorities annoys me as well because we see that there is at present another Bill being introduced in the other House with regard to the imposition of charges by local authorities.  Central Government have a responsibility to provide the necessary finance for a local authority.  Let none of us play it around as a political football because in 1977 it was agreed by all parties that local authorities would eventually be financed from central funds.</P>
    <P>The local authority of which I am a member, Leitrim County Council, will be very short of finance to provide the basic services this year.  Even with the imposition of charges there will be a tremendous shortfall.  Our roads are getting into a bad state of disrepair.  The system of allocation of finance from the central funds militates against counties with low valuation rates such as Leitrim.  In fact, the amount of money available to that local authority for county roads is approximately £412 per mile, half the national average, and that is due to the low rateable valuation base.</P>
    <P>The number of public capital projects that have been delayed or deferred also annoys me.  Work on a number of hospitals throughout the country has been deferred although it is agreed that the provision of these facilities is necessary. <Col N="1541" /> The Minister, by his imposition of rates of duties and road tax, especially with regard to private cars, has hit the motorist very hard.  Not alone did he hit petrol but the increase in the rate of taxation being paid on cars is very serious.  Cars are no longer a luxury.  In fact, 90 per cent of cars are used by people for going to or coming from work or by farmers going to or coming from the creamery and for pulling trailers.  Those farmers use high horse-power cars which are necessary because of the work they do.  Yet they are being forced to pay exorbitant taxes. A 16 horsepower car will cost anybody £176 per year to tax and that works out at £3.50 approximately per week.  That is a very serious charge on them and more than they can afford.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to reconsider the position with regard to the imposition of tax on all farmers irrespective of their valuation.  He should also examine the position with regard to the levy of 1 per cent which he proposes to collect from everybody.  The Minister knows that the cost of collecting a considerable amount of this levy will not be justified by the return he will get.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have a further look at the finance being made available to local authorities.  Having looked at the figures and the Minister's estimates for the year it appears that he is hoping his revenue will exceed the proposals in his Budget Statement.  The Minister has gone for a budget deficit of approximately £750 to £800 million rather than the figure mentioned in the budget estimate. He should tell the House in the course of his reply if that is a fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan in his opening remarks said it was a tradition in the House on a Finance Bill to make a very general contribution.  I hope, with the consent of the House, to depart from that tradition and confine my remarks to the specific matters in the Bill, namely taxation matters.  The purpose of the Bill is to implement the taxation proposals contained in the Minister's Budget Statement. In so far as this is part of the Government's overall economic strategy I welcome the proposals in the Bill for <Col N="1542" /> that reason only.  There are many things in the Bill which everybody finds unpleasant but there are many things in every Finance Bill which people find unpleasant. One must accept the overall situation that existed when the Government came to office some months ago.  At that time living here was like travelling on an economic <i>Titanic</i>&mdash; we were heading towards disaster.  I am glad we have berthed safely and that the economy is being captained by somebody who is not afraid to take unpopular decisions, or to implement measures which may be unpopular but which ultimately will achieve the kind of situation economically we all desire.  I was surprised to hear the last speaker say that the budget did nothing to help to secure employment for young people.  Only by following the line adopted by the Minister in his broad economic strategy, of which this Finance Bill is only part, and adhering to that policy as a whole, can we ensure that our young people can have some hope of a secure future here.  The most important thing which the Coalition Government of 1981-82 found, observed, and secured an acceptance among the Irish people for, was the need for economic independence. If we follow the line now being adopted by the Minister and the Government, that kind of independence can be secured and our young people can be happy in the knowledge that they will find employment in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that there are certain things that are unpleasant in the budget, but one must accept that for many reasons we are living in a time of economic uncertainty.  As far as taxation is concerned, we are also living in a time of uncertainty.  That is because a former Minister for Finance decided that a commission should examine taxation generally, and the method used to tax our people.  That commission has furnished one interim report.  I do not believe we can make any absolute comments on taxation, or on taxation measures, until we have received all reports from the Commission on Taxation and until the Government of the day have decided to implement certain of those recommendations in a way that is meaningful and <Col N="1543" /> definite for the future.  One of the problems we have had is that sectional interests are at war with one another.  I appreciate the difficulties which the PAYE sector are experiencing but listening to some speakers today one would think that the PAYE sector is our sacred cow. One often forgets those who are not on PAYE, the people involved in professional interest, those in small businesses and farmers who will shortly be assessable for income tax purposes.  One forgets the people who have made a very substantial investment in their business, their farm or profession in order to secure an income which is taxable.  That should not be overlooked.  That sector of the community protest in a very minute way but their claims should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>Another situation that should be examined is the fact that taxation has developed over the years.  We have moved from the window tax, and the tea tax to the residential property tax.  There are certain things in the Bill which we all find unpleasant but they must be looked at in the light of the uncertainty that exists and in the belief that in the very near future we will have a complete taxation system which perhaps, will remove from the existing code of taxation some existing measures.  I should like to welcome a number of provisions in the Bill such as those to deal with tax evasion.  The Minister and the Government are committed to ensuring equity in the tax system and towards this end many loopholes have been closed.  The new measures, and the Minister's commitment in this regard, will help to achieve the kind of equity we all desire.  I should also like to join Senator Daly in welcoming the relief granted to garages.  I welcome the relief in the Bill in so far as hotels and allied tourism services are concerned.  That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some matters which are of concern to me.  One matter which got very little publicity is the question of stamp duty.  That needs to be examined.  One must ask the question, in the day of capital acquisitions tax and a lot of new taxes, if stamp duty is a relevant <Col N="1544" /> form of taxation today?  Section 81 withdraws relief from stamp duty in respect of conveyances or transfers where marriage is the consideration.  That should be looked at in the future because as a Member from rural Ireland and a lawyer by profession I have come across many situations where people realised that in passing on a farm or land to somebody who is getting married no stamp duty was payable.  That encouraged the easy and speedy transfer of land at a time when it was most suitable, on marriage. It also helped to ensure that land was not retained for an exceedingly long time in the hands of elderly farmers.  The provision makes very little for the Exchequer &mdash; it is estimated it will yield about £500,000 in the full year &mdash; but it could have the effect of ensuring that many farmers will retain land for a period that is unreasonable.  Many young farmers, in their attempt to get custody and control of the family farm, may not find that situation arising.  This follows on provisions made in last year's Finance Bill where in the case of transfers within a family the relief formerly available was considerably reduced.  This should be looked at again because it ensured the development of agriculture in a way that was meaningful.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to mention briefly is the question of deposit interest.  This got a lot of unreal publicity. I do not know whether it is wise to reduce the threshold in respect of bank deposits from £70 to £50.  The provision has unreasonably frightened many people because they feel they are now going to be taxed on deposits which the Revenue may be made aware of, whereas in fact that is not the situation.  It simply means that the Revenue will be advised if interest exceeds £50.  It is an area where people need a little reassurance and a little PR work is needed because people are genuinely frightened.  I have had practical and professional experience of this in recent weeks.  Many people, small farmers, and those with small assets, are very frightened and deserve that kind of reassurance.</P>
    <P>I am worried about section 18 which gives to the Revenue powers if an authorised <Col N="1545" /> officer makes application to a judge of the High Court.  Does such an application have to be made after notice is given to the other party or can the Revenue make it <i>ex parte</i> when applying to the High Court?  It is a matter on which the other side should be heard.  One accepts, naturally, that the Revenue will always tell the truth when the Revenue say that they have good reason to believe that that is the case.  However, the other side is entitled to be heard in relation to such a matter in case the Revenue are confused.</P>
    <P>The residential property tax is another measure which has got a lot of publicity. In some ways it may be good and desirable, but it is a measure which in time and experience may need a little modification. I refer to the situation where a person may have an income exceeding £20,000 and a house which is worth more than £65,000 but is mortgaged.  That person may not have the full unencumbered value to the tune of £65,000 and that may cause certain difficulties.  It is something that may be considered as the operation of this tax is observed.</P>
    <P>Another situation can arise in relation to this tax where a person is living with somebody else.  For instance, if an adult child is living with parents the combined incomes can exceed £20,000.  That adult child may be living with parents purely for supportive purposes or other purposes or simply to prevent loneliness. However, unintentionally, through doing a good act the family may find themselves in a situation where this tax must be paid. That aspect should ultimately be looked at.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes little reference to the whole area of capital taxation, something which future Finance Bills may refer to more specifically.  One area the Minister might look at for taxation purposes, something which will be beneficial nationally, is where articles such as paintings or antiques of historical value leave the country.  The proceeds of such sales are paid to individuals and the country does not gain anything but loses a lot. There should be more careful control on items of value leaving the country and a <Col N="1546" /> very penal rate of tax should be payable in respect of such dispositions.</P>
    <P>I support the general thrust of the Bill. There are certain aspects which I find a little unpleasant but the general thrust I fully support.</P>

      <P>I am not clear about the amendments which have been incorporated in the Bill since it was initiated. Senator O'Leary has referred to this problem also but I am sure we can sort that out on Committee Stage.  There is always a difficulty in looking ahead in a situation like this.  It would be easier to look back and I am sure next year we will be in a better position to look at the picture in a global sense.  The general impression that has been created by the Bill is that the profit and savings are in the category of crime and that those who indulge in making a profit or save are criminals.  There should be incentives to get people to save and invest.  That is not helped by the Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote two short articles in this week's issue of <i>The Meath Chronicle</i> which will explain my point.  The first article, headed &ldquo;Auctioneer Slates Finance Act&rdquo;, stated:</P>
      <P>Trim auctioneer, Mr. Aidan Heffernan, has hit out at a provision in the new Finance Act and declared that it now seems to be &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; to be involved in a private business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Heffernan, a director of Royal Auctioneers, blasted the Government last week over the controversial <Col N="1548" /> Finance Act which will allow the Revenue Commissioners to investigate individual's bank and building society accounts.</P>
    <P>An irate Mr. Heffernan declared: &ldquo;We have to do something.  It's crazy. It is almost a mortal sin being in business. You're looked upon as being immoral&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Heffernan's remarks came at the annual meeting of Trim Chamber of Commerce at which he called on the organisation to support their counterparts in Cork who recently denounced the move.  He said the self-employed were &ldquo;sick to the teeth of being used as the panacea for tax evasion&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The confidence among the business people is sadly lacking.  I know people who are returning to England.  There was a time I could bring people over here from England and they were sure of getting a business started.  But now the reverse is happening&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Referring to the PAYE protests, Mr. Heffernan said everyone was paying taxes while businesses were being hit by corporation tax and VAT.  &ldquo;I would suggest that 15 per cent of any businessman's post today is some sort of correspondence from the Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Heffernan declared: &ldquo;its about time that we people began to protest. It is the trade unions that are running this country and not the politicians.  Its almost a mortal sin to make a profit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Heffernan added: &ldquo;we can criticise that woman, Margaret Thatcher, across the road but by God she has got the stuff&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Local solicitor, Mr. Jim Martin, backing what Mr. Heffernan said, told the meeting: &ldquo;If you're making a profit you're to be screwed&rdquo;.  Mr. Martin said the new legislation would mean that money would &ldquo;flood&rdquo; out of the country from the State's financial institutions.</P>
    <P>But the newly elected Vice-President of the Chamber, Mr. Charles Flattery, said the Commissioners would need a High Court order to inspect someone's account and that they would have to suspect the individual of fraud.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> As somebody who has been self-employed for a number of years, and has experience of manual work and working in the civil service, I suggest that there are many people who do not understand the problems of the self-employed.  Senator Harte described himself as a working-class person and I hope I would be classified as a working-class person, because that is what I have been all my life.  I am not sure that there is any other type of person at present.  I would have thought that that appellation would be obsolete.  However, the self-employed have a difficult time.  They spend many sleepless nights, in many cases work long hours and do not enjoy the holidays that other people have.  In 15 years I have had one week's holidays and am typical of the self-employed.  There are very good financial incentives for those who would want to go into business on their own and become self-employed.  People are inclined to look at those who have succeeded and not at those who have failed. Many have failed and gone by the wayside.</P>
    <P>With all the pressure groups that have mushroomed over the years it is not inconceivable that at some stage because of this Bill we will have a tax evaders association.  It does seem that because of this Bill, and its approach to profit and saving, that in years to come it will be dangerous and expensive to be born into any kind of well-off family.  It is possible people born in the future will, perhaps, regret that the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was ever passed.</P>

      <P>The next article I should like to quote from <i>The Meath Chronicle</i> is headed, &ldquo;Tax Decision Hits Factory in Ballivor&rdquo; and states:</P>
      <P>There has been as drastic drop of 50 per cent in orders to a Ballivor factory as a direct result of the removal of tax concessions at the beginning of April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1550" /> The Government's decision not to renew a tax concession scheme, first introduced in 1979, has meant that one of the showpieces of small industry in Meath has experienced a dramatic reduction in orders in a little over a month.</P>
    <P>Last year Norman Pratt Sons Limited, the major conservatory and greenhouse manufacturers at Carnisle, Ballivor, were hailed by the IDA's small industry division as one of the great examples of local enterprise in Meath.</P>
    <P>But as a result of the removal of the tax concession to customers allowed under the Finance Act of 1979 and renewed each year since until last April, Mr. Pratt says he has suffered a dramatic reduction in orders and in the future months he may not be able to sustain the number of employees he has at present.</P>
    <P>The scheme of tax concessions was introduced in 1979 in an effort to assist businesses such as Mr. Pratts with a high labour content.</P>
    <P>The construction and erection of conservatories, garden sheds and greenhouses has a high labour intensity and because of this the Government of the time offered tax concessions to customers.</P>
    <P>For instance the purchaser of a £2,600 glasshouse would be entitled to a tax rebate of £900 and this incentive proved extremely popular with the public.  Double glazing and the fitting of aluminium windows and other labour intensive home improvements carried out by &ldquo;registered persons&rdquo; also qualified under the provisions.</P>
    <P>But now Mr. Pratt, who employs a total of 36 people, including his four sons, says the future is not so bright. &ldquo;I maintain that I blame that (the removal of the tax concession) directly. In the long run it might affect my employees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Pratt says that 60 per cent of the business he was engaged in was labour intensive, but now that his orders have fallen and he is no longer going &ldquo;full steam&rdquo; his position might have to be reviewed in relation to employees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" /> Mr. Pratt said the scheme had proved popular with the public, particularly with people who were paying a large tax bill.  &ldquo;I know of one woman who was paying £8,000 a year to the tax man and this scheme gave her the opportunity, for once in her life, of getting something back&rdquo;, he said.</P>
    <P>He added that he had lobbied sitting Meath TDs including the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to the Bill.  The approach with regard to tax collection is ruthless.  While I agree with previous speakers, Senator Ferns in particular, I would be more in sympathy with the poor people or those below the poverty line.  Speaking of the poor, I do not believe we have the number of poor that we had in my early days.  Indeed, poverty as we know it now has no relationship to the poverty as I knew it some years ago. I mean poverty and all its implications, not simply what Patrick Kavanagh referred to as poverty in the mind.</P>
      <P>I agree that we must have a property tax, that people who have the wealth in property should pay their fair share of tax.  Whether the mechanics of this section are right or not is another matter.  Is Senator Ferris right when he refers to all these people as privileged, because as another Senator said, there may be situations where houses would be unpaid for and people would be on a big mortgage? It would seem to me there should be some kind of arrangement in the Bill to cater for people who had big loans which they were repaying for their property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Browne was very sympathetic to the self-employed.  He did say that people do not seem to understand farmers <Col N="1552" /> and I agree with him and with Senator Cregan that farmers, indeed, have had a bad time.  I also feel that when farmers are doing well the country is doing well. It is important that farmers do well.  In relation to problems farmers have encountered in the last few years, we must remember that the price of land has gone down from about £4,000 an acre and over a few years back to less than £1,000 now and some farmers were left in a pretty bad way.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned with the construction industry and housing.  This is an area in which we have many operators in a very bad situation.  We have small builders who, have worked hard, who are experts in many spheres of building and over the years they have kept small staffs of skilled craftsmen as the nucleus of their operation and in the last year they have been forced to let men go. I would like to see housing grants increased to help to ease the situation. Perhaps also the possibility of loans could be looked at again because the qualifying limit for SDA loans could easily be increased and perhaps, maximum amounts could be increased to try to help this particular sector.</P>
    <P>The situation in education has been very well covered.  Senator Ryan said this was an area that could be regarded as a productive investment.  We are all concerned about the schools.  I attended a meeting recently where the parents met because of their concern about this problem in the schools.  The three major problems were the pupil-teacher ratio, career guidance counsellors and transport.  The point was made at the meeting that a certain amount of money was provided for education and that in this context money could only be taken from one at the expense of another.  I felt that this was a cause for concern because something more imaginative should be done in this area.  Otherwise, if money is going to be decreased, eventually we will have a major problem.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked so many times: do we go on educating people who can reasonably have expectations of jobs that never materialise?  I made the point before that boredom was a big problem <Col N="1553" /> at present, and in our institutions we should deal with leisure and train people to deal with their leisure time.</P>
    <P>The problem of unemployment has been discussed by most Senators.  When the Seanad on 24 March was dealing with the Social Welfare Bill, I referred briefly to this matter but I was unable to give it the time I felt was necessary.  The Minister at that time, Deputy Barry Desmond, stated what we all knew: that the single biggest element of social welfare expenditure is the mounting cost of unemployment.  We all know that it has other serious implications as well as financial implications.  He went on then to state that in this year provision has been made for £473 million for unemployment payments for an estimated 203,000 unemployed, a quarter of all expenditure on unemployment and more than half the amount to be borrowed to meet the estimated overall current budget deficit of £879 million.  These are horrifying statistics particularly when we calculate on a rising graph and it is imperative that a solution be found without delay.  This calls for an immediate and radical approach to the problem which is not included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>To eliminate any misunderstanding, I want to make a few brief assertions.  As I said before, everyone is entitled of right to an input consistent with the minimum acceptable standards of comfort and human dignity.  I also said that chanty is out of date.  Handing out free money in the face of economic reality is not a solution. On the other hand, work for work's sake is not acceptable.  I think it would be true to say that to the nearest point 100 per cent of the employable force in this country want to work.  Industry has been geared over the years to the reduction and even elimination of labour in the interests of profits and even it would be claimed in some cases, viability.  The question then is: keeping all this in mind, is it possible to reconcile full employment with the utilisation of modern science and technology?  I believe it is, because, if not, the pessimistic forecasts of the political pundits are inevitable.</P>
    <P>Where do we start?  It would be my <Col N="1554" /> contention that shorter working hours are unavoidable, and that training to deal with leisure time, as I have said before, is an important consideration for our teaching establishments because work as we have traditionally known it is gone and the problem of boredom is all too evident.  With that proviso I believe the State should set up the framework to provide work for all those unemployed and I underline the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;.  The question is how?  I would suggest by devising productive schemes that would absorb this force without being in competition with private enterprise.  Using purely notional figures, say, in a particular region, £50 million is paid out in unemployment benefit at present.  If £25 million were added to this for the same number of people so that the recipients would be well remunerated to work on productive schemes, a return of only £26 million of this £75 million would be an improvement on the present position whereby there is no return for £50 million.  I see no reason why the return could not equal the full amount.  Many productive schemes could be undertaken, such as afforestation, quarries and gravel pits, roads, bridges, housing, turf and industrial projects.  What is needed is a radical approach.  The system which we have could be compared to an old thatched house; for ages the roof is thatched and thatched, until in the end the structure of the roof collapses.  A new approach is imperative but, with a commitment to providing solutions that would yield immediate and long-term results, I would be entirely optimistic.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I would like to make a brief reference to the itinerants.  In that context I would like to see them established in a settled community and we would then devote more time to them.</P>

      <P>I do not want to fight with the Cathaoirleach.  This is a very short story and I am using it to illustrate a point.  In my own parish in County Meath, in Kilbeg, there was a small farmer who disliked the gentry.  He was out one day working in a field along a gripe when the hunt came along.  The fox came first and he jumped across the gripe.  The came the hounds.</P>

      <P>Eventually the first huntsman, who was a wealthy gentleman whom the farmer disliked &mdash; he had no time for wealthy people &mdash; shouted across to the farmer asking &ldquo;Has it a bottom?&rdquo;, meaning the bank on the far side.  The farmer shouted back &ldquo;It has, a bottom like the road&rdquo;.  So the huntsman went back and came cantering to it, jumped across and within a few seconds all that was above the surface was the horse's head and the man's head.  He had got bogged down.  He shouted to the farmer saying, &ldquo;I thought you told me it had a bottom&rdquo;.  The farmer shouted back &ldquo;So it has, if you go down far enough&rdquo;.  In relation to this Bill, I feel the Minster has not gone down far enough.  He has not felt the bottom.</P>

      <P>I propose to carry out my intention to speak briefly on the Finance Bill at this rather late stage of a long debate.  I want to discuss it and come <Col N="1556" /> at it from two very different perspectives. First, I want to make some general observations about the intentions of the Bill and the general economic climate and then I want to refer to some specific sections and raise a number of questions that I hope the Minister will respond to in his reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>The first general observation that I would like to make is to comment &mdash; as other Members have done &mdash; on the extraordinarily depressed state in which the country finds itself at the moment. This is evident in individual responses of people that you meet in the street or in the work place.  It is evident in comments made by the media.  It is evident to a considerable extent in our general outlook and psyche as a nation at the moment.  It is a matter that we ought to take stock of and note as being itself a negative factor and something which can be quite damaging to us.  It is possibly worse in an Irish context than it might be for some other countries because as a people we have, possibly, a tendency to suffer from depressive aspects in our personalities. We are easily depressed and if depressed we go down as a nation and find it difficult to respond positively to difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for couching my observations in such a broad way is to ponder how a Government and, indeed, leaders in the country can ensure that the reaction and the response that we make to difficulties at the moment is one which will help us to cope with and surmount those difficulties.  It is important that the leadership that is given is a positive and rather more optimistic and purposeful leadership than we are perhaps getting at the moment.  The emphasis is on the problems.  The emphasis is on the extent to which, through over-borrowing, we have got ourselves into difficulties.  The emphasis is on the extent to which, through heavy taxation, we must try to resolve those difficulties.  There is not sufficient attention being paid to the human factors involved, to the depressing effect this has on people, individually and collectively, individually in their families and collectively in their communities <Col N="1557" /> and even in a more general national sense.</P>
    <P>The approach to surmounting our problems is part of the way in which we surmount them.  It is part of the way in which we devise the programme and action plan to get ourselves out of our difficulties.  I have noted, as other contributors to the debate have &mdash; indeed the Minister himself made reference to this &mdash; that the Finance Bill is receiving very close scrutiny.  It has received close scrutiny both in the media and in both Houses of the Oireachtas which is understandable because of the difficult times and because it is seen in a sort of punitive light.  It is seen as being a measure which will worsen the immediate situation for a very broad number of individuals and which is deemed to be necessary at the moment because of the overall plight in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Finance Bill is one of the major fiscal measures by which a Government can direct and can move in a policy direction and can try to generate a sense of action and of purpose in surmounting our problems.  Therefore, I believe that it is going to be extremely important from now on this year and in the difficult years ahead that measures which are brought forward, particularly measures of important fiscal and economic policies are part of a coherent and constructive plan of action, of where we are going and how we are going to get there, devised in such a way as to lift people to an aceptance of hard measures because they are leading to a better deal for the individuals involved, for their children and their children's children and so on.  It is possible to bring people to an acceptance of the particular difficulties that require to be surmounted. But this is not done in a negative and punitive and pejorative context so that the people feel weighed down, hopeless, depressed, fed up and then alienated from the Government which is bringing forward or deciding on these particular measures.</P>
    <P>I believe that great care requires to be taken by any Government in a country such as Ireland at the moment, with a young and insufficiently employed population. I agree with my immediate predecessor <Col N="1558" /> on the problem of people having no real stake in the country and having a great deal of leisure without the possibility of an involvement through employment in the structures and the general economic and social life of the country. Therefore any Government seeking to lead and seeking to devise a programme and plan of action over the next few years should have as well as actual measures high in its priorities a necessity to communicate a positive framework, to communicate in a much more constructive and inspirational way which will enable decisions to be both taken by the Government and broadly accepted in the community so that we do not have a continuation of a certain appearance of social disintegration which is evident in certain aspects of the political and social life in Ireland at the moment and which is worrying a great many people.  We do need much deeper and better communication, two-way communication, listening at the top level as well as pronouncing but also that all this would be in a cogent and coherent plan of action, as I said.</P>
    <P>I believe that the kind of leadership which the Government must offer at the moment is one which involves as broad a range of people within the community as possible in reacting to and coming forward with suggestions and being listened to in those suggestions about how we resolve the problems.  That leadership must be concerned with explaining, again as I say, in a more optimistic and purposeful way the reasons why it is necessary and, indeed, vital, to the broad security and coherence of this country that we do maintain a high level of taxation over the next few years.  The necessity for that is quite inevitable particularly with the demands of a young and growing population but the way in which that fundamental message is communicated is almost as vital as the message itself.  How we spell it out, how we involve and include people are almost as important as the actual steps that are being proposed.</P>
    <P>I say this because the wide focus of attention on this Finance Bill has very largely regarded it as a punitive and negative measure which has imposed certain degrees of burden on individuals and <Col N="1559" /> which is doing very little to redress the overall problem.  I do not think that this is in fact a fair or adequate comment on the Finance Bill of 1983.  The interesting aspect of the Bill is the extent to which it is not a radical overhaul of the taxation system.  Indeed, I would make that a qualified criticism of the Bill.  I would qualify the criticism because I am of the view that there was not adequate time between the change of Government at the end of last year and the necessity to finalise the budgetary provisions and publish the Finance Bill for a radical overhaul.  This is by no means a dramatic shift in regard to who will carry the tax burden over the next few years.  It is by no means a radical step in achieving equity in the bearing of the tax burden. It is by no means a measure which is substantially hurting the better off in our society.  Therefore it is interesting to view the extent to which its measures are nonetheless being protested about and criticised as being punitive.</P>
    <P>It certainly is a serious attempt to control and curtail tax evasion and perhaps the extent of the outcry is some indication that it was not before time that we had a serious fiscal measure to curtail and control tax evasion.  It does not have substantial proposals for wealth tax.  It does not have substantial proposals for broadening the tax base in the community.  It does not have some of the far-reaching measures which may well &mdash; and hopefully will &mdash; become part of our approach to tax reform over the next few years. Yet it has been greeted with a level of dismay and regarded as being a very punitive measure.  At least part of the way in which the Finance Bill is seen is because of the context and the manner in which it has been presented, because of the negative and depressive approach that has been adopted, not, I am sure, deliberately and presumably unconsciously in the way in which the Minister himself and other spokespersons on behalf of the Government have argued the need for this measure.  It is not seen in the context of a way of getting our acts together, of a productive plan of action for this country which will help in a concrete <Col N="1560" /> and constructive way to resolve our very intractable problems.  It is seen in isolation, subjectively and selectively and, therefore, certain aspects of it are singled out for particular criticism which, as I say, is not in fact a balanced and fair comment on the kind of problems which we have in this country at the moment.</P>
    <P>Like a number of other people I am concerned that the Finance Bill has been a further incentive to a kind of tax revolt, a determination by those who are employed and holding jobs, particularly those who pay what they correctly &mdash; broadly speaking &mdash; regard as too heavy a share of the tax burden, the PAYE workers, to revolt against paying any more tax.  It is extremely important that the overall needs and balance in our society be presented in such a way that the message is not only received but is accepted that we must maintain over the next number of years the high level of Government revenue which will ensure that we provide the services and the general structure for a large dependent and a young growing population, for the old dependant, the infirm and those who need the special services and care provided by State agencies and also the health, welfare, education and other needs of a young, growing population.  It is a matter of concern because it is part of this negative spiral that I have been describing that there is this selective revolt against paying taxes and a narrow perspective in which that revolt is being examined and discussed and being commented on in the media.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why this is a fairly destructive and divisive internal debate that is happening in Ireland at the moment is because there is not evidence of this constructive plan of action.  We are not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel of four or five years of fairly severe restrictive measures in this country.  We do not see the possibility that there will be a better, fairer and more equitable and more positive future either for the individuals themselves in the pipeline or for the young population coming on to the labour force each year.  It is the lack of vision and imagination and the lack of leadership of that sort which has very <Col N="1561" /> substantially aggravated our immediate problems and given rise to a level of dissent and social disharmony far greater than anything that I certainly have witnessed in my time in public life.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would hope that the future fiscal planning and policy of the Government will be carved and moulded in a more positive and constructive framework and that we will see greater access to the information on which these policy decisions are based and greater involvement of sectors of the community in economic and tax planning over the next few years so that people will feel that they have been involved in the process themselves and that the measures being taken are part of a very substantial overall plan.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now briefly to two sections on which I would be pleased to have comments from the Minister in his reply.  The first of these relates to the improvement in the position of separated couples in the income tax assessments and the maintenance provisions of separated couples.  That has been widely recognised as a useful reforming measure in this Bill.  However, I read with interest an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> dated 27 May 1983 by Donal Dorcy precisely on this provision pointing out that, although it is an improvement on the pre-existing situation which was undoubtedly very discriminatory against separated couples, it still contains a certain difficulty for couples who have not got the degree of co-operation requisite to file a joint assessment and who do not appear to be able to avail of separate assessment.  If I may refer to a passage in this article where the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>You will be pleased to know that I have not got any substantial second wind just because we had a break and I am going to stick to my resolution to be comparatively brief.  I had moved to a couple of specific points on sections of the Bill that I was seeking clarification on and I was hoping that the Minister might refer to them in his reply.  I had raised the issue of the improvement in the provision for taxation of separated couples but the lingering problem that may remain is whether a separated couple would be able to apply for separate assessment.  I was about to refer to a useful article compiled by Donal Dorcey in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 27 May 1983. There are two passages which set out the problem very clearly:</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill gives separated couples a choice: to be taxed as if they were still living together, or to be taxed as single people but with recognition of maintenance payments.  The system of taxing seperated people as if they were no longer married is to be ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One ironic anomaly remains under the first option: separated couples will not be allowed to claim separate assessment <Col N="1564" /> for income tax.  Whether one or both are working they could be taxed by single assessment &mdash; as if they were two single people &mdash; or by joint assessment as a family unit.</P>
    <P>The writer goes on to analyse the situation where there may not be a problem and then he deals with the area where the problem may arise.  It is to that passage I want to refer and invite the Minister to comment on in his reply.  I quote:</P>
    <P>If only one of the partners is employed, then that partner gets the full allowances and tax bands for a married couple.  In such a case, joint assessment raises no problem for a separated couple.</P>
    <P>Nor is there much of a problem if their taxable incomes are exactly equal, provided they are on sufficiently good terms to fill out a tax return together and to agree on a division of allowances.  In nearly all cases, of course, their incomes are unequal, so that one will pay tax at a much higher rate than the other.</P>
    <P>How to divide the allowance to yield a fair result can cause argument.  The system breaks down if both have incomes and are not able to agree on a joint tax return, or do not want each other to know their financial affairs.  If they could agree to that extent, they would probably not have separated in the first place.</P>
    <P>There is one method of tax assessment which all married couples with two incomes should adopt: separate assessment.  Yet this method is not even mentioned in the advertisement published by the Revenue Commissioners in all daily newspapers after last February's Budget.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the Commissioners assured me then that separate assessment was not being abolished.  He could not explain why it was not being advertised.  The explanation appears to lie in the extra work the system entails.</P>
    <P>Each of the partners completes a separate return of income and allowances. At the end of the year a balancing statement is drawn up by the tax office combining these two returns so <Col N="1565" /> that the couple will wind up paying exactly the same tax as they would under joint assessment.  In most cases, this means that one of them is entitled to a refund.</P>
    <P>But PAYE offices do not issue balancing statements unless they are requested.  Since 1979, they have not even been issuing tax returns forms but simply continue taxpayers' allowances from year to year.</P>
    <P>It appears to be for the administrative convenience of tax officials that separate assessment is still being denied to separated couples under this year's Finance Bill.  Consequently, most separated couples can be expected to opt for single assessment and avail of the new provisions for allowances for maintenance payments, which take up a large part of the Bill and amount to nothing in real terms.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the problem.  I would like the Minister to clarify whether, despite the absence of reference to it in the advertisement in February, the separated couples can avail of separate assessment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there is recognition of the particular difficulties and discrimination which existed prior to this in the case of separated couples.  It is part of a legal neglect.  It is a fair comment on our law that we are more and more seeing inadvertent, but nevertheless very serious difficulties and discriminations against couples who do not fit into the totally happy mould of a married couple living together with their family.  Once partners are outside the context of a married couple living together they encounter all kinds of impediments and barriers in our legal and taxation systems.  I welcome a step in the right direction and would like to have the position fully clarified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to refer to is in the section dealing with an issue which has received a great deal of publicity &mdash; the residential property tax.  This proposal has generated the kind of outcry, parsing and analysis which is generally reserved for measures which are going to achieve a certain amount of effective balancing <Col N="1566" /> within our tax system.  In other words this measure is going to succeed in taxing those who, both by reference to their income and family home, are, in Irish terms, in a substantially better position to pay that additional taxation.  They are people who are very articulate and have access to the media and probably include a fair helping of journalists who will find themselves met with the liability to pay residential property tax.  In my view, as a member of the Labour Party, it is a modest step in the right direction. It is, if one looks at it selectively and on its own, anomalous but if it is, as I believe it is, a constructive effort to bring more equity and fairness into the system, then it is a perfectly reasonable and acceptable measure.  The reaction to it is only a comment on the overall inequity of access to the media in our society because those at the lower end of the scale who are suffering from far greater discriminations and deprivations simply do not have the airing of their problems.  Poverty is not a matter that gets aired in the property columns of the newspapers and discussed at great length in editorials.</P>
    <P>I support this measure in all its modesty and I would like to see a more comprehensive structure of equity in our tax system.  I ask the Minister for specific clarification of an aspect of it which is of concern to me because I have learned through my spouse of the particular difficulties that a measure of this kind can pose for heritage properties in Ireland, for particular properties which, by reason of their historic, architectural, aesthetic value, are of particular concern to all of us.  The heritage properties I talk about are on public access and are part of the rich heritage of all Irish citizens.  There is in fact a provision in section 95 which is specifically geared to ensuring that the difficulties and needs of heritage properties are taken into account.  Section 95 defines residential property but does not include an approved building within the meaning of section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982.  This is a reference to a property which satisfies standards in relation to its importance from an historical, architectural and aesthetic point of view, which has been properly approved through the <Col N="1567" /> Office of Public Works and by the Revenue Commissioners, and is an approved building for those purposes.  I understand from my own inquiry in the Office of Public Works that so far there are no approved buildings under section 19 of the 1982 Act, that the system, like all these systems, works rather slowly and although there have been some inquiries and forms filled, as yet there is no approved building as such, although it is my understanding a number of properties are anxious to achieve the status of being approved.  Therefore, the question that I have to ask the Minister is whether the word &ldquo;approved&rdquo; is flexible enough to include buildings which will be approved in the course of this year and therefore which would be excluded, as is the intention, from the provisions of this Act.  If, for example, they were approved in the latter part of this year, would they then be liable, as other occupants of properties which fall within this section would be liable as of next October, to pay the amount of tax for the year 1983?  If not, is it possible at this stage to make a provision that if a property is either approved or is in the process of being approved, or would be approved before such date, say, April 1984, there would not be the liability for this particular residential property tax?  The clear intention of the exclusion is to recognise the acute problems being encountered by the large publicly accessible heritage properties in Ireland. There is no doubt that we have to be very concerned about the number of properties that have been sold or lost to the Irish nation, even in the period of four or five years, and it is a matter of acute concern that a measure of this kind does not aggravate that situation, that the exemption granted will take effect from day one, and will achieve the purpose which the Minister sought by having that exemption in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a further matter to which I would draw the Minister's attention in relation to section 19 of the 1982 Finance Act, that is, the fact that heritage gardens as such have not been included in the category of property which can potentially become approved for the purposes <Col N="1568" /> of section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982. There are heritage gardens, for example Powerscourt, where the building is no longer a building accessible to the public. It is only a skeleton of a building now, yet the gardens are an immense resource for our citizens and for visitors and they are very frequently visited.  There are other very fine gardens which are not necessarily part of any substantial architectural property as such.  The studies that have been carried out in this country and the work of bodies like the Irish Heritage Properties Group and the Heritage Trust have shown that it is through fiscal measures of this kind that we can, and must, preserve and conserve our architectural and historical heritage.  It is utterly vital that we do that and the benefit of so doing is to ensure that there is full access for citizens, educational groups and people who want to learn more about the skills of Irish craftsmen or Irish horticulturists, or the way in which the particular structures were erected.  I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify that point.</P>
    <P>My final comment on the Finance Bill is on the more general area.  It is a specific urging that the kind of measures we have seen &mdash; this one and a measure which we will deal with shortly in relation to the charges for local government services &mdash; should be seen, communicated and discussed in the context of an action programme for the disbursement of the revenues collected.  The worst aspect of the present discontent about the high level of taxation is a feeling that it is not geared to a sufficiently radical plan of action to redress the very serious problems which face us as a nation, and in particular and specifically, the problem of recognising the irreversible trends in employment and of devising a structural scheme which would ensure, apart from the level of commercial and industrial jobs which may become available, that we provide a constructive and worth-while future for our growing young population and that that involvement is recognised as dignified, is given status, security and binds the young population in their allegiance, loyalty and commitment to this State.</P>
    <P>The necessity for a strong and radical <Col N="1569" /> plan of action to cope with our present economic difficulties is of the utmost urgency because at the moment what we are seeing is a very negative disintegration of our social cohesion and an oppressive leaning on the national psyche.  We do not respond well to being done down and to being burdened.  As a nation we respond to inspiration, to vision, to challenge and to a hope that the tough measures being taken are leading on in a planned, coherent and concrete way to a better future for ourselves and for our children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The real characteristic of this Bill is that it has eroded the confidence of the Irish people.  No incentive is built into it for production.  It is merely what I would call a mathematical exercise.  There is a fear and a frustration felt by taxpayers, not alone the existing taxpayers, but the 90,000 small farmers who will be brought into the tax net.  My main criticism is the subtle and serious divisions it has caused between our PAYE sector, our self-employed and our social welfare recipients.  If a son or daughter is a PAYE taxpayer the first people they are going to look at are the self-employed and the social welfare recipients.  They think the budget is being used as a smokescreen to cover tax avoidance and tax evasion.  The PAYE sector feel they are getting less money in their pay packets because of social welfare recipients and the self-employed.  It has been admitted from both sides of the House today that a person could get £100 a month less in his pay packet as a result of this budget.  The most serious aspect is that our youth could take to crime &mdash; and such a step is not far around the corner because the number of unemployed young people is almost at breaking point. Crime is the most serious thing I can see coming out of it.  I cannot see the division between the PAYE versus the self-employed and the social welfare recipients being healed as a result of this Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Minister say accountants have been in touch with him recently. This is a decade for accountants.  Never before did we have an age of accountancy. <Col N="1570" /> The reason for this is the additional taxes under different headings.  If a person has a sizeable business he will require a financial expert to deal with the taxes, to keep up with PAYE, pay-related and the various measures and returns he will have to make.  These budgetary measures will not produce the finances he expects from the extra taxation imposed under the different headings. I do not think there is any balance in the budget.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;any time we are in Government.  I will let the people judge the Minister on his merits and on his programme, and they will give a fair assessment.  There is no job creation in this budget.  Curtailment of services is the keynote.  If he curtails services he reduces the numer of job opportunities.  Cutbacks increase fees to county councils and increase fees for attendance of ACOT instructors to the fanning community. There has been a cutback in school transport, the farm development services and the farm modernisation scheme.  I do not know how the Minister will quantify the amount of money from Brussels that has been lost as a result of the discontinuation of the farm modernisation scheme.  The agricultural industry need a capital injection. Since last February under the farm modernisation scheme we have been getting grants on a pound-for-pound basis for agricultural development.  I am not able to quantify the amount of money we will lose, but perhaps the Minister will put a figure on it.  Not alone have we lost money but we have stymied development. Many farmers are not applying for farm development schemes or programming their future because of the discontinuation of that scheme.  That is unfortunate at a time when we need development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> No progress has been made in the eradication of animal diseases.  There is a go slow because sufficient money for accelerating that scheme has not been made available to the Department of Agriculture. We were supposed to have a disease-free herd by 1983, but in my view we are far behind that target.</P>
    <P>Western drainage is almost at a standstill; this budget will result in cutbacks in housing, health and job creation in CIE. There will be no replacements when people retire, and all this against a background of almost 200,000 unemployed. That is the Coalition's programme for development.  We have had a population explosion of half a million over the last decade.  We should build into our budget and into the Finance Bill a development programme that would provide employment for people on the unemployment register, and provide all the necessities for the many school children who will be coming onto our rolls.  There is also a curtailment in the capital building programme. There is no capital development in this Finance Bill which is to give effect to the budget.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about the small farmers, the 90,000 people who have been brought into the tax net.  Medical card holders will be asked to pay tax under this system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read every bit of it.  Widows and old age pensioners are included in that 90,000.  These people are frustrated by this measure.  They will have to make returns, and fill up this screening form which will decide whether they will have to pay tax.  If a medical card holder or a woman in receipt of a widow's pension, has a small holding in the west, receives a cattle headage payments grant or a sheep subsidy will these pensions and grants be taken into account?  The only way such a person can get off the hook is by filling in this screening form.  Most of the small farmers in my area go to the post office to pay their rent and their ESB charges.  They do not have <Col N="1572" /> phones.  Their ordinary day-to-day financial commitments are paid either through the bank or through the post office.  They have no system of accountability.  They know nothing about accountability. These are the people who are frustrated as a result of bringing these 90,000 people into the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not bring them in. The farmers brought themselves in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The same case was made here by the Minister for Social Welfare that the PLV system has been found to be unconstitutional.  That is what the Minister means.  I do not go along with that.  Some day that will be questioned in a much higher court than the High Court. The Minister is changing over from the notional system to the accounts system for the supplementary allowance people were getting to increase the productivity of their small holdings.  I do not think that is constitutional.  Money for cattle headage grants and sheep subsidies should not be accountable because they are a disadvantaged area supplement. They should not be taken into consideration but the Minister is providing that they will be taken into consideration in assessing the incomes of small farmers in the west of Ireland and throughout the country.  Under this Bill most of them will have to pay tax and they may also be medical card holders.  They may be widows or old age pensioners who own their own little holdings.</P>
      <P>These are the people the Minister has frustrated.  They will have to go to an accountant.  He may not be an official accountant, but they will have to go before him to have their forms filled in and will have to pay for the filling in of these forms.  Time will tell whether they are in the net, whether they are taxable. The Minister's guess is as good as mine. I assure him that they will have to go to an accountant for financial advice on how to get out of the plight they are in at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to talk about the small farmer who has his wife and family working round the clock.  He will be assessed on his income, notwithstanding the fact that <Col N="1573" /> he works a seven-day week, 24 hours a day at times, at lambing time, at calving time if he has a dairy herd.  If the Minister assesses him on his working hours that is all right, but if he assesses him on the income he derives as a result of this input by himself and his family, he will not be assessed on equal terms with the man who works a five-day week.  That disincentive to that family unit will have a disastrous effect on the economy of this nation, and on the production of farms like that unit.  From surveys today it appears that cattle and sheep numbers have been dropping considerably at a time when we should be giving incentives to production.</P>
    <P>Increases in prices for alcohol, petrol and tobacco have not the effect the Minister thought they would have.  Figures out today show that from January until 25 May the amount recouped under these three headings was £111 million as against £115.5 million in the same period last year.  This must prove to the Minister that increased taxation causes a drop in consumption and does not bring in the amount he felt it would bring in.  These three commodities are over-taxed.  They are taxed to the extent that there is a reduction in employment.  I know many licensed premises owners who are not opening their premises until 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the evening.  I asked them why and they said: &ldquo;We do not have to pay staff.  We do not have to pay for heating.  We do not have to pay for lighting&rdquo;. What they would make during the day would not justify them in opening. Many owners of licensed premises have ceased to open their premises at 10 o'clock in the morning.  Along the Border where there is an imbalance between the price of petrol and drink trade is almost at a standstill.  This continued policy of increased charges will put many small traders along the Border out of business.</P>
    <P>Production is not mentioned in the Finance Bill.  There is no realism about production, and that is something we need at this time.  As I said at the outset, the budget was a mathematical exercise to collect tax.  That is how I regard it.  It is not like the old traditional budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not have collected the tax in full.  We would not go about collecting it in one year.  We had a programme, &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo;, which had a developmental plan enshrined in it.  We put that to the people and it was rejected.  We did not get the opportunity to put it into operation.  That was the purpose of &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo;.  It was a development plan to create jobs and to create a balance.  In this budget the Minister has not got that balance.  For that reason it will not have the effect the Minister thought it might have.  The end result will be failure, and possibly for the tax evasion people jail and heavy penalties which were not the norm in this country. I believe that people did not try to avoid paying tax except through carelessness. That will happen more often in the future because of the many taxes they will be required to pay.  Unless they go to accountants they will not be able to have their taxes processed.  You would need to be well aware of the tax system if you have any kind of a business.  The Minister will be remembered as Richie Ryan is and perhaps Gorgeous George as well.  I can assure him that he will be remembered after this budget.  It will not have the desired effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on the Bill and I promise I will not delay the House.  I know the Minister is anxious to resolve our problems but the cure may be worse than the disease. I realise he is anxious to achieve high levels of Government revenue to cater for the growing population and to ensure tax equity.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to a paragraph from his speech in the Dáil.  It is important that I give the reference as I was chastised before for not doing so.  As reported at column 417, Volume 342 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently described the farm profile form as being like a radar screen where the profile itself would be the sweep, <Col N="1575" /> and in particular cases the sweep would identify cases where there might be a tax liablity.  These cases would then be further examined by tax inspectors...I consider that the profile fully meets the Government commitment to a system which will deal simply and fairly with the large number of small farmers newly liable for income tax.</P>
    <P>That means the tax inspectors will be calling on the farmers and asking them to submit audited accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should read the rest of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The general opinion is that fanners will have to get audited accounts to ensure that they do not pay more than they should pay.  We have the standard of assessment of accounts or the production unit accounting system.  Farming organisations have already said they should have a choice as to whether they should have to employ an accountant. We are all looking for an equitable system. Everyone should pay their fair share of taxation.  Farmers are a vital productive community and should be given a choice.</P>
      <P>Each year the Agricultural Institute through a scientific survey calculate the net income earned on a large number of representative farms.  This is called the farm family income because it recognises that the efforts of several members of the family are involved in earning the income.  The family farm income is calculated for the different enterprises &mdash; milk, tillage, crops, cattle, and so on &mdash; in different regions to take account of varying soil types and for different sizes of farms.  For example, in 1981 the Farm Management Survey by the Agricultural Institute showed that the average family income for all full-time dairy farmers was £145 a cow.  Of course variations up and down would occur for different regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreed Fine Gael-Labour Programme for Government published in December 1982 makes reference to the replacement of the poor law valuation system.  Because of the poor law valuation <Col N="1576" /> decision this system of taxation is being introduced.  The poor law valuation system currently used as a basis for assessing many farmers' eligibility for certain Benefits and liability for certain contributions must be replaced.  It will be replaced by a system based on standard results per enterprise and per region taken from the Farm Management Surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais. These gross results would be adjusted to take account of capital depreciation, interest payments and other factors, in order to calculate the taxable income.</P>
    <P>At this stage we are rushing into a system which I doubt will be fair and which will be a disincentive to production. That is my opinion, and it is definitely the opinion of the farming organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They said to the contrary. They have all accepted the profile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not think they should be entitled to a choice? I did not hear that they have all accepted it.  That is a matter for debate.  The Minister and the Government must ensure that farmers are not taxed to such an extent that there would be a disincentive to production.  Increased production in the agricultural sector is vital to our economy.  The input of the family into production should also be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should realise that, unless he devises a simple method of assessing a farmer's taxable income, he is imposing on the section of the farming community who do not have a taxable income an auditing expense of sizeable dimensions which the farmers can ill afford.  Surely there must be somebody who can devise a fair share of taxation production.  Are the Government so far beyond hope that they cannot wait, in their panic, to see what the overall situation will be in putting the country back on its feet?  The Government should not rush into making decisions which will be unfair to the farmers. The farmers form a very sizeable section of the self-employed.  The idea that they are retaining vast hoards of money that <Col N="1577" /> could be put to Government use is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>On the question of the taxation of farmers it is important to make the point that these taxes must be considered in the light of bringing about equity in the entire taxation system and that farmers will play their role in bringing about that equity. The State must bear in mind the matter of incentives for production.  Failure to provide incentives for the expansion of agriculture would lessen the importance of agriculture to the Irish economy.  It is most important that, whatever taxation system is imposed, we do not have a lack of incentives to production.  I appeal to the Minister to consider on future occasions imposing a fairer system of taxation on the farmers.  The Minister has made several amendments.  I welcome the fact that he reduced the rate of VAT on motor repairs to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The youth of today are most vulnerable especially in the society we are living in. The voluntary organisations who are catering for our youth need every help and support.  An association of which I am very proud to be a member, the Gaelic Athletic Association, are playing a vital part in developing our youth, especially in providing physical recreation and other amenities so necessary for the development of youth.  In these times of vandalism and drug abuse, it is important that the work of these voluntary organisations is helped and not hindered in attracting our youth, so that they will develop in the proper atmosphere to ensure that they grow up to be a credit to the community.  The Gaelic Athletic Association and other organisations, through their promotion, and especially the GAA in the promotion of the game of hurling, are of immense value to our present day youth.  Recently a former Taoiseach, when he was unveiling a memorial to the great hurler, the late Christy Ring, asked how could we commemorate him.  He said: &ldquo;First of all by ensuring that hurling, that noble field game that is truly ours, is cherished and developed to strengthen the fibre of our people.  Next year, the centenary of the GAA will, I hope, see special attention being paid to hurling so that the hurley <Col N="1578" /> will be seen right through the land in the hands of our young people&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Imposing a 35 per cent VAT rate is definitely hindering the promotion of this fine game.  It must be recognised that the GAA are doing great work in promoting hurling.  They are catering for our youth to prevent vandalism and drug abuse. After VAT at 35 per cent, a £5 juvenile hurley will sell at £6.75.  The Minister might say that he could not abolish tax on hurleys because he would have to do the same for other sports goods, but he has done so on other commodities.  Hurling is different.  You can buy a hurley and it can break in a couple of minutes. Representations have been made to the Minister by the association to consider removing this tax completely, or at least reducing it.  It should be removed completely, because it is a great hindrance to the association in their work to promote this game among our youth.  As we approach the centenary of the association next year, it would be nice if VAT were removed from hurleys so that the association could commemorate their foundation without this penal imposition on them in promoting this ancient game of hurling.</P>
    <P>Any organisation working voluntarily for the development of our youth should get help and should not be hindered by such things as VAT on commodities which they need.  I hope the Minister will keep these matters in mind, especially the provision of an equitable system of taxation for the farming community, and for everyone.  Voluntary organisations, such as the organisation I mentioned, should not be hindered by the imposition of VAT on things which are not luxury goods.  Hurling is not a luxury as far as I am concerned.  It is a necessity and other games are a necessity for the development of our youth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt that there has ever been a Finance Bill that did not come in for some share of criticism.  I doubt that there is any way of producing a budget and a Finance Bill based on it which will not in some of its aspects displease some groups, or worry other groups, or make people feel they <Col N="1579" /> are being got at in some way or another.</P>
      <P>This year there has been a certain accent on dealing with the problem of tax evasion.  I am bound to say that those who have criticised this year's Finance Bill for its alleged effects on incentives, for its alleged effects in terms of intrusion on privacy, have, by accident or design, themselves given rise to the very feelings they claim come from the provisions of the Bill.  We have heard it here this evening. In relation to the farm tax, for example, a number of the comments might as well have been made without the Bill having been read at all, without any consideration having been given to the discussions we had in Dáil Éireann, and without any consideration having been given to the discussions that went on with the interested groups before the budget was drawn up, in the first place, and before the Finance Bill was even published.</P>
      <P>I take that as one example.  It is one example of many, where it seems to me that the normal process of adversary politics has been distorted to create the very effects people claim some of these measures would have.  That is a great pity, because it seems that much of the time that is being spent in debate on these measures, which are important in themselves, which are important in their objectives, is spent not in discussing the effects of the measures but in making claims and counter-claims about the effects of what it is said the measures are, without any direct reference to the measures themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same goes for the provisions in relation to farm taxation, provisions in relation to tax evasion, provisions in relation to property tax, and a number of other provisions.  I invite Senators on that side of the House to reflect, and to ask themselves whether they are not creating the very problems they claim are inherent in the Bill.  They are running a very real danger of cultivating a degree of hysteria which is not at all warranted by the provisions of the Bill before us.  I will come back to that in relation to specific measures. It is something we can get back to <Col N="1580" /> in even more detail when we come to look at the individual sections.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this year's budget was a difficult one.  There is equally no doubt that this year's budget was, in many respects, a less difficult one than the one promised last November by our predecessors in office.  I want to get this point out of the way at the very beginning of my remarks, because it is a very interesting one, and one to which I would like to hear some answers, not perhaps this evening but over the next few weeks.  This budget we are talking about, which is being implemented by the provisions in this Bill, will produce a current budget deficit of £900 million, give or take £1 million or £2 million.</P>
    <P>We were told the programme published by our predecessors in office was the way forward and that would have resulted, we are told, in a current budget deficit of some £750 million this year.  I had the honour of being told I have an obsession with figures, and I understand that the Leas-Chathaoirleach likened me yesterday to a robot.  It was very kind of you to do that, but if I am a robot and if I am obsessed with figures, the obsession would have been magnificent had I been trying to get the other £150 million of which Senators on the other side now disclaim all knowledge.  Where could they have got £150 million?  We should consider that.  Where would they have got £150 million in extra taxation?  Let us ask ourselves that.  I shudder to think what we would have to do to personal tax-free allowances to get that amount of money, what we would have to do to farm taxation to get that amount of money, what we would have to do to any part of our taxation system in order to produce that much extra revenue.  Perhaps it would have come on the expenditure side and we would have been talking about taking another £150 million off the Public Capital Programme, for example, off our housing programme or our infrastructural development programmes, or perhaps out of current spending on education or on health services.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill and the debate on this year's budget are lacking a very <Col N="1581" /> important part of substance because Senators on the other side of the House and their colleagues in the other House have failed to say one word about where they would have made up the difference, how they would have found their way forward, if indeed it was a way forward. I remember many years ago when one of our very large neighbours in the East launched a new programme.  It was called then the great leap forward and one of the weekly newspapers had a picture of the then chairman on the cover and the motto they put underneath it was &ldquo;the great leap sideways&rdquo;.  I wonder which way we would have been going if we had to find another £150 million in taxation or in reductions in expenditure.  The kind of criticism of this budget and of this Finance Bill that we have heard from the other side to me totally lacks credibility because it makes no reference whatsoever to that particular difference.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> The anti-evasion measures in this year's Finance Bill have come in for a great deal of attention.  Much of it has Been exaggerated in terms of the claims that have been made in relation to the effects this will have on the taxpayer.  An examination of the measures will show very clearly that the taxpayer who is paying his taxes, as the vast majority of our taxpayers are, making returns more or less &mdash; I say that advisedly &mdash; in time in the proper form, has absolutely nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>It has been made very clear that the measures are aimed at those who, intentionally and deliberately, set out to reduce their tax bill by delay or by concealment, by not revealing the total amount of their incomes, and who know quite well what they are doing when they start out on that road.  I would think, on all sides, that we would agree that we need to take measures to deal with that particular problem, to deal with the people who know what they are at, who know what they set out to do and whose purpose is not to make the contribution that the rest of us make almost without questioning the reason why.</P>
    <P>I am not pretending that any of us particularly enjoy paying tax or that any one of us would rush out and volunteer to pay tax.  It is human nature to feel that taxation, however fair we might think it is, is an extraction that we do not particularly like, but the vast majority of us, in all walks of life, and however we pay our tax, whether it is through PAYE, as self-employed persons or as contractors or any of these activities, pay our taxes, more or less willingly, more or less grudgingly, but we do it according to the accepted form.  The people we have in mind in the anti-evasion measures in this Bill are the ones who deliberately set out not to do that.  To say that the vast majority of our taxpayers, who adhere to the rules and who pay their taxes, are in any way under threat from these measures is not only a gross exaggeration but I would consider it quite an insult to the vast majority of taxpayers who have nothing to fear and who conform, broadly speaking, to the best of their abilities to the requirements of our system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> Senator Smith described the Bill as punitive, negative and unimaginative. Those were the words he used.  They are words that have been frequently on the lips of those on that side of the House.  I must say that I find them rather glib. When we go into the discussion of the particular measures in question we find that there is no intention of being punitive. As I have said, as far as tax evasion is concerned we are setting out to deal with a problem, widely recognised, of people who deliberately set out not to pay their taxes, to defraud the rest of us, to defraud the community.  I do not think we can regard a Bill that does that as punitive or negative.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives effect, as has been pointed out, to the provisions of this year's budget.  This year's budget aims to do several things.  One important thing that it aims to do is to start us back on a course which will get us away from the biggest single financial problem that we have today, that is the simple fact that one-third of all of our tax revenue this year will not be available for any constructive purpose in our own country, for the benefit of our people this year because we have to use it to pay the interest on our debts.  We cannot use it to build a single new school, we cannot use it to build a hospital, we cannot use it to build a road, we cannot use it to provide health services, we cannot use it to provide social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>One pound out of every three of our tax revenue is just not available to us this year.  If we were not to take action on that this year it would not be just one pound out of every three next year or in a couple of years time.  We would gradually lose control over more and more of our revenue, over more and more of the income produced by our own people. That is the objective that we have.  That is why we want to reduce the total borrowing requirement and the current budget deficit, not from any concern with books, not from any concern with balancing the figures, but out of a real concern to regain control of the fruit of our own labours, to regain control over our own tax revenue so that we can use it in <Col N="1584" /> the way that suits the needs of today's population and particularly of our young generation coming up, of tomorrow's population, so that we can use more of our revenue to provide for the needs of our young people.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith called it unimaginative. That is rather an easy word also.  The kind of imagination that is required to envisage a situation if we did not regain control of our finances is fevered, to say the least.  What would happen if we were talking about more than one-third of our revenue that escapes our control, that we cannot use?  That is where you need imagination.  I would rather not have to put my imagination to the test to see if it could stretch out to encompass that kind of situation.  I do not mind being unimaginative if it means that I take the kind of measures that are going to avoid getting us into that kind of situation, that are going to avoid a continuation of that particular problem.</P>
    <P>What it boils down to is that we are recognising &mdash; and this is becoming increasingly the case throughout our community &mdash; that there is a direct link between the total amount of public expenditure and the total amount of taxation we have to levy on our community. At the end of the day we here in this country are the only people who can pay for the services and the investment we want.  We can bide time by borrowing, but we still have to pay for it.  We must decide ourselves where our priorities lie, particularly as between the levels of service we want today and the provision we want to make for our young people. This year's budget, and therefore this year's Finance Bill, represent a first step towards redressing that balance, a first step along the road making it possible for us to make the kind of provision for our young people, for the coming generation, we all want to make.  It is in recognition of that that we are taking the kind of steps we have set out in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith spoke of a provision in the Bill frightening money out of banks and building societies.  Which measure was he talking about &mdash; there are two he might have in mind &mdash; and we will have a specific discussion on these when we <Col N="1585" /> come to the sections?  There is one provision giving a choice to building societies. Under present legislation we have a very convenient system of collecting tax from our building societies.  We have a composite rate of tax that is paid on the interest payable on building society deposits.  It was set up some years ago with the proviso that the amount of tax collected under that system, as far as we could make it, should be the same as the total amount of tax that would be collected; were that system not in operation &mdash; in other words, the same as the total amount of tax that would be collected if we required every depositor in a building society to make a separate return of the amount of income he or she received in interest from that society.  The intention was to find a convenient arrangement under which we would get the same amount of money as we would get had we full disclosure of all the interest paid by building societies on their deposits.</P>
    <P>What has happened since that measure was announced?  Has it frightened money out of building societies?  I invite Senator Smith to look at the inflows into building societies, which in the first four months of this year were over 30 per cent higher than for the first four months of last year. I would invite him to look at what they did with the money.  According to figures supplied by the building societies themselves the number of mortgages written for second-hand houses in the first four months of this year was 40 per cent greater than the corresponding figure for last year.  The number of mortgages written for new houses was just over 3 per cent greater than the total number written in the same period last year.  I do not think that is evidence that money is being frightened out of building societies.  I would ask Senator Smith and others who made this point just to consider that evidence and ask themselves whether in making that kind of claim they are not going to bring about the kind of result they claim to see happening but which is not in fact happening.</P>
    <P>The other measure to which the Senator might be referring is that in the Bill &mdash; and again we can discuss it when we come to these specific sections &mdash; which <Col N="1586" /> provides that where there is reason to believe that a taxpayer is not disclosing all of his income, and that in particular he is not disclosing an account he might have in a financial institution, a Revenue Commissioner may apply to the High Court and, on satisfying the High Court that he has reason to believe that that is the case, get a direction from the court to the financial institution.  I would invite Senators to reflect on the number of cases in which that might happen and to ask themselves seriously if that kind of examination will be the kind of thing that will make a lot of small savers all over the country ask themselves whether they are secure.  I would make the point &mdash; and I think it is a reasonable one to make &mdash; that the vast majority of small savers all around the country, whether their money is in bank accounts or in building societies, will quickly conclude, when they see what is involved in this, that it relates to very different kinds of people.  Certainly it does not mean small savers.  It certainly does not mean the kind of people who are now being frightened by the predictions that they should be frightened and who are now being frightened by the kinds of statements that are totally unjustified when compared with the measures being referred to.</P>
    <P>I come now to the subject of farm taxation on which we have had some discussion here this evening.  I would ask Senators to consider why it was necessary this year to make a new provision in relation to the taxation of farming income.  Some short while ago a group of farmers decided they would contest the constitutionality of the PLV system as a basis for taxation.  We all know that there was a threshold, that people whose rateable valuations were over £40 came into the tax net.  They then had to produce accounts in the form decided by the Revenue Commissioners.  A case was taken in the High Court and that court decided that the use of PLV for that purpose was unconstitutional.  I shall not go into the reasons because there are people here better qualified than I to say that.  But the terms of the decision made it quite clear that we could no longer use the level of PLV to distinguish between one person <Col N="1587" /> and another and to use that distinction as a means of deciding whether or not that person should come into the tax net.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government appeal to the Supreme Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That being the case it was necessary to find a means of replacing that.  Indeed, the Senator knows quite well where that appeal is because it was taken by a different administration.  We had to find another means of distinguishing between farmers in order to decide who had to pay tax and who did not.  In particular we had to find a way that would not be attacked as being unconstitutional, that would be effective, that would allow us to decide who should be in the tax net and who should not.  Therefore, we have a situation now in which 90,000 farmers who up to now were outside the tax net have to be brought into it, and have to be brought into it as a result of a case taken by farmers themselves. And we must if we can do it, find an efficient, cheap, and administratively convenient way of doing that.</P>
      <P>The passage that I think it was Senator Kiely read out from the Government programme was one approach to it.  I am very familiar with that passage because I wrote it myself during the summer of last year.  I put a certain amount of thought and work into it.  At that time it seemed to me that that was a reasonable way of going about the job.  But I am bound to say that, whether it be a vice or a virtue I do not know, I do not like freezing my thinking at one point in time.  I am bound to say that it did occur to me afterwards to keep on wondering if there might not be a better way of doing it; and we found it.  I would say to the Senator that that is creativity, that he should try it some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say why it is better because that is important when we are discussing this Bill.  It is a new <Col N="1588" /> departure in our tax system.  We have found a better way.  That particular solution, as well as the other solution which has been referred to &mdash; the production unit accounting system &mdash; is a notional system of taxation.  What happens in a notional system?  You ascribe an income level to people on the basis of certain criteria.  You find that people whose incomes are below the average if they are taxed on the basis of the average results will be systematically over-taxed.  As Members of this House know, that is probably the case with regard to many people in the west of Ireland.  A notional system could produce a situation where those in the west would be systematically over-taxed and I am not so sure that Members of this House would want that hung around their necks.  There would also be the situation where people whose incomes were above the average would be systematically under-taxed.  I know many people would be happy to see that happen but I do not think it would be the proper action for me to produce such a system.</P>
      <P>We have had notional systems before. Many Members will agree that the experience of notional systems, both on the ground and in the Revenue, has not been the happiest.  Many people would not want to go back to notional systems for different reasons.  That was why I thought we should adopt a different system if we could find something better than the notional system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We found something better than the notional system.  The farm profile form which we have produced and which will be going out to farmers in the near future is a simple form.  It asks for simple information that can be provided by the farmer himself without having to hire an accountant to fill it in.  I think Members would agree that most farmers know how many acres of land they have, how many cows and bullocks they have and how many sheep they have.  They know how many haysheds they have built in the past ten years and most could tell nearly to the last penny how much they paid for them.  That is the kind of information that will be asked in the farm profile form. That will be returned to an inspector of <Col N="1589" /> taxes.  He will examine the form and if he finds, on the basis of the information in the form, that it is likely that Farmer X has a taxable income, then we will send him the simplified form and we will start in the same way as is provided for in the current tax system.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely or Senator O'Toole reminded me that I had recently made a few remarks about accountants.  However, the Senator did not finish the remarks.  The representations made to me by accountants have been to the effect that I am putting them out of business by bringing in a tax system that does not require all the farmers to produce audited accounts for the purpose of paying their income tax.  I am quite happy about that. I do not want to put an excessive burden on the farming community or on the Revenue Commissioners to operate this tax system.  Obviously it will come in on a phased basis.  There is no secret about the fact that we will not get to the point of being able to send out 90,000 farm profile forms this year.  We will start at the top of the list.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulties experienced not only by farmers but by other small business people in providing some of the information requested of them.  I think Senator Kiely forgot to read out of the Government's programme that for that reason recently I set up an inter-departmental group which is inviting submissions from people in the small business sector and in the farming community. If they have suggestions to make as to how their tax accounting can be simplified, they can make them.  We will all be happy if we can find a simpler and more straightforward system of tax accounting for small businesses.  It is not in anyone's interest to make the system heavy and difficult to operate.  If Members of this House have ideas on the subject &mdash; and one or two of them seem to have &mdash; perhaps they would let us have their suggestions for a simplified form of accounts that will achieve the desired objective.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan has an interest in the simplified accounts.  He referred to the PRSI contributions of employers.  He said he thought our rate of contribution <Col N="1590" /> to PRSI must be one of the highest such rates in Europe.</P>

      <P>Reference was made to a number of changes made in the Bill during the course of discussions in the Dáil.  One of the changes was in relation to the rate of VAT on hotel accommodation. I am bound to say this was one measure the Government considered to be justified on the grounds that there is a particular situation here, namely, that it amounts virtually to an export industry in many ways.  The Government considered that if there was a way in which we could treat it like an export industry we should do that.  Of course the measure we adopted does not go the whole way but it goes some of the way.  It will help in some degree to relieve the problem that arises in an industry of that kind from our present levels of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had another case in relation to the motor industry where we found a way of reducing VAT on workshop services. That is a different type of measure.  Its distinguishing feature is that it is self-financing in that we have compensated for the loss of revenue on the VAT side by an increase in the rate of excise duty on new cars.  I commend that measure to the House as being an imaginative approach &mdash; if Senator Smith will allow me to use that phrase &mdash; which redistributes the weight of various kinds of taxation <Col N="1591" /> on a particular industry in a way that will allow those who are legitimately registered in the industry to even up the conditions of competition between themselves and those who are not registered. For that reason, the measure commended itself to the Government and to the industry.  Incidentally, I compliment them on the imagination they showed in putting forward the solution.  Of course, it should not be regarded as a precedent for any other sector where the same possibilities do not present themselves.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary regretted that we had introduced a new rate of income tax of 65 per cent.  I know that he is very much aware that I am rather regretful about that myself, but in looking at a measure like that we come back to the basic equation of which we cannot lose sight when we are talking about a budget or a Finance Bill.  We must cover our expenditure from the revenue that we can raise and in raising the revenue we must have regard to where it is to come from, to the ability of people to make that contribution and to the contribution that will be made by that new tax band which is going to be made on the whole by people with higher incomes.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves the Government consider that it is reasonable to ask people at higher levels of income to make a somewhat higher contribution than they have been making up to now.</P>
    <P>I want to go into some remarks that are attributed to Senator Lanigan in my notes.  I could not be here during all of his remarks, and since he was perhaps rather sensitive about remarks I made earlier, I will discuss it with him later on and perhaps we can come to those remarks on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch during the course of his remarks asked if Revenue could not take a more sympathetic approach to small family businesses where for one reason or another things had been let slip a little in relation to the provision of tax returns. I will come back to that because it is important to be clear on this.  Section 94 of the Bill deals with the approach to revenue offences.  I want to make it absolutely clear, as I have done already in <Col N="1592" /> Dáil Éireann, that first of all that section does not invent new offences but it provides for new penalties in cases where, as I have said, there is clear, positive intent on the part of the taxpayer to defraud.  It provides for penalties which will be applied in the more serious cases and where the size of the offence makes it one which we should sanction heavily.  In our existing legislation we already have provision for penalties in relation to tax offences and those penalties will continue to apply in the smaller cases.  However, we have already in our system a degree of tolerance of the situation of small businesses which I think is perfectly normal and which possibly has resulted in giving people the idea that perhaps they can be a little lax and creates the very kind of situation about which Senator Lynch spoke.  I take the point that he made that on the whole it is a difficult enough matter to run a business and there are so many prescriptions to which one must conform that it would be very useful if our tax administration could adopt the most open and helpful approach possible to dealing with people who are, after all, trying to fulfil their obligations, and to the extent that it is possible we will certainly do that.  We are engaged at the moment &mdash; as I suppose Governments are constantly engaged &mdash; in efforts to improve the administration of our tax system, to streamline it and make it more effective, and as part of that I will take up consideration of how we can make the system, and encourage the people who work the system, to be more open and helpful with people who are trying to conform to their legal obligations.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins expressed some reservations about the social impact of measures in the Bill and he asked about the effect it would have in terms of its redistributive effect.  I would point to two aspects of the Bill and ask him to consider them.  The first I mentioned already a few moments ago, the introduction of the 65 per cent tax rate which will have its own effects on the distribution of taxation.  I would ask him to consider also the effects of the measures that we are taking on tax evasion and avoidance because they also will have an effect on the distribution of <Col N="1593" /> the tax burden in the community.  Both would have a very positive effect in relation to redistribution.</P>
    <P>He also asked &mdash; and other Members of the House have referred to this &mdash; where the concern was with planning. This brings me back to one of the central features of the budget and of the Government programme.  I am glad to see that there has been such a wide readership of the Government programme.  Members on all sides of the House will have noted that there is a commitment in the Government programme to phasing out the current deficit over a specified period. That is the central part of an approach to planning.  It is one of the objectives that we must set ourselves.</P>
    <P>The second part of that concern is shown in the decision taken some time ago by the Government to set up the national planning board, who will have as their function the drawing up of proposals relating to a medium-term economic and social plan for our economy. We have done that very deliberately because we did not consider particularly that the document drawn up and announced shortly before we came into office provided an adequate basis for a medium-term plan because it contained aspirations without policies rather than the kind of policies that we need in order to direct our efforts to meeting the very real problems that we have which must centre around a feature of our society to which Senator Ryan drew particular attention, that is our high dependency ratio.  Therefore, we have set up a national planning board who will advise the Government on the elements which should be included in a medium-term programme and when we have the suggestions from the planning board we will marry them with the more general budgetary targets so that we can match our resources with the kind of programme that we need to deal with our social structure and our economic requirements.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donoghue, I understand, adopted a fairly positive approach to the provisions of this year's budget and to the Finance Bill, but he pointed out what he seems to regard as an inconsistency, if I understood correctly what he said.  He <Col N="1594" /> seemed to see an inconsistency between the concern with the more strictly budgetary aspects of the measures that we have taken and the concern with employment. This brings me again to one of the central features of our problem, one to which I referred in the very early part of my Budget Statement on 9 February.  In the normal course of events a responsible Government who found themselves dealing with conditions of recession and conditions that were producing unemployment and pressure on real incomes would try to compensate for that by increasing the level of public spending.</P>
    <P>Equally, if a Government found themselves in a position with a strong recovery in course with employment and levels of output recovering, they would normally tend to respond to that by reducing the current deficit.  Since we have run large deficits for so many years the option is not open to us now to increase total expenditure in order to try to deal with the effects of recession because we do not have the resources from which to increase current spending.  It would be unwise to borrow those resources because, as I said earlier, we would be hanging an even greater weight around our necks for future years.  We are in a situation where Government intervention in a general way in the economy is almost forced to be of a kind that reinforces the cycle rather than going against it.  That is probably the most dramatic part of our economic problem today and one with which we must come to grips as quickly as we can in order to have any hope of getting back to a condition that would allow us the normal reactions that Governments should have to deal with the situation created for them by the external environment.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House if my remarks are somewhat scattered but they are more or less in the order of the interventions during this debate.  Senator Hanafin asked about the residential property tax. He wanted to know if the provisions of this Bill would mean that the Revenue Commissioners could enter one's home at any time they chose, have a look around and see what they could find.  Of course, that is not the case.  Again, when <Col N="1595" /> we come to the section it will become clear that that is very definitely not the case because the conditions in which the Bill provides for any kind of a visit to a household require that there be a disagreement as to the valuation that is put on the house and specify that one of the means that might be used to resolve the disagreement is the sending by the Revenue Commissioners of a qualified person to value the property.  There is not in any sense a provision in this Bill that provides in any general way for an intrusion into the privacy of the home.  For those who are afraid that that might happen I invite them to consider that particular provision of the Bill.  For those who have considered that provision of the Bill, I invite them to stop frightening people by saying things that simply are not borne out by the provisions of the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan put some words into my mouth.  He had the impression that I was making the claim that equity equals cuts in public services.  That, of course, is not the case.  I think he was referring to the fact that I remarked in my introductory speech to this Stage that in our circumstances part of the concern with the equity of our tax system arises from the volume of taxes: the heavier the total burden of taxation the more concerned people will be with equity.  That is one statement with which it would be difficult to disagree.  The other statement, which Senator Ryan tacked on to that and got a rather erroneous equation, is that in our present circumstances to talk realistically about substantial reductions in taxation, we must look at reductions in expenditure because I do not think there are vast areas where new forms of taxation will raise large amounts of extra revenue. I should like to make the point to Senator Ryan that I was not making that equation and to the extent that any of his other remarks about the Bill were based on that I would ask him to reconsider them.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the provisions of this Bill suggest that profit and enterprise are not good things and are to be criticised or penalised in some way.  That is a <Col N="1596" /> gross exaggeration and is not borne out by anything contained in the Bill.  I ask Members of the House to consider what is behind that.  Are we criminalising profit when we say that we want to stop tax evasion?  I do not think so.  You do not have to make large profits to evade taxes, neither do you have to be in a situation where you are making no profits.  If you are not making profits there is not much incentive to evade taxes in the first place. They are two completely separate and distinct things.  There is always an incentive to make a profit.  There is always an incentive to get on with whatever business there is in hand and I cannot see how the feeling that people who are evading tax are going to be brought properly into the net is in any way a disincentive to making profits.  It is a disincentive to evading taxes but I do not think that any Member of this House would say that making profits equals evading taxes.  That is not the view that most of us have and it is certainly not a view that underlies the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked some questions about the taxation of separated spouses.  We can have a more detailed discussion about this on Committee Stage, but where separated spouses follow the provisions set out in this Bill the separate assessment provisions can and will apply.  There is a technical point in that but it is covered in the provisions of the Bill.  With regard to the other question raised by Senator Robinson about the heritage properties and particularly about the gardens, the gardens are covered in the Bill on page 80, lines 33 and 34.  The passage in brackets provides for gardens, but we can discuss that in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to take up one or two of the more general points that have been made.  Again, I ask Members of the House to consider what foundation there is for some of the claims that have been made.  It has been said &mdash; and it is as well that we should confront this &mdash; that the provisions of this Bill have eroded confidence. That is the kind of claim that is made with the normal hyperbole of political discussion of a measure like this. What has actually happened?  The provisions <Col N="1597" /> of this year's budget, far from eroding confidence, have increased confidence in our economy and in our ability to manage our affairs both here and abroad.  It is particularly important for us that confidence abroad in the Irish economy should be strong, because it is very clear that we are going to need inflows of funds and investment from abroad in order to carry out the kind of programme we want to carry out.  I am glad that at this stage of the year we have pretty well completed our foreign borrowing programme for this year and are now in a position that from here on we will be able to make provision to start laying the groundwork for next year's borrowing.</P>
    <P>That is a very strong indication of the positive effect of this year's budgetary strategy on confidence in this economy. We can see it within our own economy also.  It is a very positive response to a very wide perception that budgetary policy has now been taken under control. <Col N="1598" /> There has also been a positive response to measures that we have taken since then.  I give one example, which has been criticised, that is our course of action taken in the recent realignment of the EMS currency, which again has met with a positive response in the agricultural sector, in industry and will certainly show up in export performance.  Far from, as is claimed, having dented confidence, our budgetary strategy &mdash; which, after all, is the basis of this Finance Bill &mdash; has tended to build up confidence and shown both people here and those with whom we deal abroad that we now have a very determined programme based on getting our destinies under our own control again and putting our own people back in control of more and more of the income that they themselves produce and a part of which they provide for the running of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has demonstrated to us tonight his rare imaginative capacity in that he was unable to widen the 35 per cent tax band so that people would not enter the 45 per cent tax band so quickly.  We are disappointed that the Minister found it necessary to introduce a top rate of 65 per cent.  There should have been some provision in the budget to lighten the load of the PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal which was made in the Dáil and rejected would have cost £50 million, which is half of 1 per cent of the total expenditure in the budget.  The Minister should find a way to give some encouragement to the PAYE sector.  We did not put down recommendations to this section because we are mindful of the overall financial position but I ask the Minister to see what he can do to reduce the burden on the PAYE sector.  The fact <Col N="1600" /> that the proposal made in the Dáil represents half of 1 per cent of the total budgetary provision must leave him in a position to make some adjustment.</P>
    <P>As regards public expenditure, is it true that there are a number of State Departments and semi-State companies who have leased office blocks and have not occupied them?  I believe there is a considerable sum of money being spent on this by the Government which should be avoided since they are cutting back on public expenditure.  Has this anything to do with the developments in relation to disturbance money?  In the last few years we have seen major scandals in relation to agreements being reached on the question of moving from old dilapidated premises into luxurious offices.  These agreements have cost substantial sums of money.  Taxpayers feel a sense of grievance that such luxurious offices are only occupied after strenuous negotiations which sometimes take years to finalise and cost substantial sums of money which cannot be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has referred to an amendment which was proposed during the Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil in relation to the tax bands which would have cost £50 million.  I do not criticise his arithmetic in comparing £50 million with the total of public expenditure but that is only part of the question.  There is no doubt that £50 million is only a small part of the total current expenditure for this year, but to make the change that he seems to have in mind in relation to tax bands and replace the revenue from another source would be quite a different matter.  I just underline that by pointing out that the introduction of the 65 per cent tax rate will produce extra revenue of £7 million this year.  Members of the House will appreciate the magnitude of what would need to be done in order to replace £50 million as a result of widening the tax bands.  I appreciate the basic point being made by Senator Smith about the tax bands and about the effect of our present tax bands and rates on the ordinary taxpayer.  There is no doubt that it is a difficult situation.  As I said on Second <Col N="1601" /> Stage, we have to meet these problems and in fact we are meeting only a part of the underlying problem this year.  I regret that we do not have the flexibility to make a response of the kind that Senator Smith has in mind.  He went on then to make some statements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to raise some questions in relation to the occupancy of buildings, some of which I might add are owned by public authorities and some of which are rented by public authorities.  I am not sure if that arises specifically on the section.  I think he was raising the question in terms of making a point about the £50 million to which he referred.  Of course it is rather out of proportion with the particular problem he has raised.  He raised also a question about disturbance allowance.  His specific question was whether the fact that a number of buildings have not yet been occupied by a number of Departments arises directly from the fact that there have been agreements on disturbance allowances.  There are one or two cases where there has been a delay in moving into buildings, partly because negotiations have not been completed in relation to the conditions of transfer but I do not think it would be true to say in any general way that disturbance allowances have created that particular problem.  A number of them have already been negotiated and I make the point that Senator Smith's concern about disturbance allowances comes a few months if not a couple of years too late for the particular cases that have been negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first time I have referred to this matter.  I merely wanted to indicate to the Minister that I appreciate the financial constraints in which the budget had to be framed.  I was rather looking to situations within public expenditure where savings could be made or where there is waste.  I do not want to call it deliberate waste but it is very close to it in some circumstances that have been indicated to me.  This area should provide an opportunity for the Minister <Col N="1602" /> to meet some alleviation of the kind that I suggested.  I understand from what he has said that the amounts may not be very significant though a figure of some millions of pounds has been indicated to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point made by the Senator, there is a well-documented file on the matter he has raised.  I would ask him to consider this fact: we do not have just one kind of situation where a building has remained unoccupied for some time.  There is a series of different situations.  Without going into all the details here I would say that I share Senator Smith's concern with making sure that we get value for the expenditure that has been incurred in relation to these buildings.  There are a number of different situations.  There are cases where we have leases, one of the terms of which is that the tenant, that is, the Department concerned, agrees to take over a building and to pay the rent on the property while the interior of it is being fitted out in accordance with the specifications of the Department who are to move into it. That has given rise in some cases to an expenditure on rental without our having the benefit of the space itself.  That is one kind of situation that has arisen.  Another situation that has arisen in some cases is where a building for one reason or another has been acquired on particular terms and the Department who were to move into it have not been ready to move on the date that the building actually became available, either because of organisational problems in the Department or because negotiations with the staff have not been concluded on a particular point.  There is a range of situations but I agree that we should try as far as we can to match the availability of buildings more immediately with the readiness of Departments to make the move, if a move is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has suggested that the cost of widening the tax band from what is done in Part I here would be about £50 million and that the loss of revenue by not raising the upper limit to 65 per cent would be about £7 <Col N="1603" /> million.  What worries me about this is that this is a withdrawing from the free economy of about £7 million in the Minister's terms.  I wonder if that £7 million would be better left in the economy rather than being dragged into the tax net and used within the public spending area. One of the constraints we have is that there is a lack of spending power right throughout the economy and what is suggested here is a narrowing of the tax bands on the one hand and a raising of the upper limit on the other hand which means that there is a withdrawal from the economy.  The Minister mentioned the cost of, leaving the bands wider on the one hand, the cost of not applying the 65 per cent rate at the higher level, and to me it would appear much better at a time when the economy is slack if this money were left to people to spend.  We have the constraints at present on spending because of people out of work.  We have constraints on income.  We have constraints all over the place.  If this money were left to the economy to spend the Government would get revenue back by way of direct taxes.  There would possibly be more jobs, but as it is this money is being dragged into the taxation net and nobody knows where it is going to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I just make the point that the amounts of money being raised in the various forms of taxation are not being withdrawn from the economy.  As Senator Lanigan says, they are coming into the Exchequer and then being used for the purposes which the Exchequer sees fit to spend them on.  They are not being withdrawn from the economy.  The question that Senator Lanigan is raising is a wider one.  I think basically the question he is asking is this: is it necessarily the case that governments are more efficient at spending people's money than the people themselves would be were the choice left in their hands?  We might all have our own ideas about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in which we find ourselves, however, is that if the Government do not take tax revenue on the scale we are talking about this year, without changing the expenditure side, they will <Col N="1604" /> inevitably be forced to borrow the rest and if they are not going to borrow it, then they must bring about changes on the expenditure side.  Borrowing creates the problem that we are building up a repayment commitment, so we are landing ourselves with the same problem in future years.  Further reductions of expenditure, on the other hand, create their own difficulties for the buoyancy of the economy.  In essence what I am saying is that the overall balance of the budget as presented is the one which in the circumstances we think is best adapted to the situation in which we find ourselves this year and is best adapted to the kind of programme we see for the next three or four years for making progress with the central budgetary problem, that is, regaining a greater extent of control over our own resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says that it is a matter of choice as to whether the people use the money themselves or are dragged into the taxation net and the Government spend it. The choice should be left to the people. The Minister is going against the principles or the conclusions of the Commission of Taxation which stated that the income tax bands should be at a single rate, lower than at present, and on all types of income.  The conclusions of the Commission of Taxation have not yet been discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred in my Second Stage speech to some difficulty about the 65 per cent, not from the point of view of any personal obligation to pay it.  The combination of circumstances will ensure that I will not go anywhere hear the 65 per cent bracket in respect of last year's income with the amount of time that I am spending in politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether he has given any thought to the level of income taxation that he would like to see.  I am not suggesting that we can reduce from 65p in <Col N="1605" /> the £ this year.  I recognise the necessity for having the 65 per cent rate this year and probably next year, until such time as we have got our finances under control. Where are we going?  What is our objective?  What do we consider to be the maximum reasonable rate for income?</P>
      <P>Much of our problem &mdash; and this has applied to all Governments &mdash; is that Governments have not set themselves objectives.  They have never told the people where they wanted to go and therefore the people have never been able to criticise them when they did not arrive there.  That is politically very wise, but we are not here in the Seanad to get involved in political arguments.  We are here to try to expand the general information available to the public; that is one of our important functions.  Therefore I would like to ask the Minister where he wants to go, allowing for the fact that we are not going to get there this year or next year.  Where in four, five or ten years time does he want us to go in terms of taxation on the top rate of a person's earned income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>From remarks I made earlier it would be fairly easy to conclude that my personal preference would be to arrive at an overall rate of taxation, both income and general taxation, lower than we have now.  I do not think anybody here would disagree.  There has been quite a deal of discussion both here and in the Dáil about the perceived disincentive effects of our present level of taxation. It is a purely personal view that in the first instance I would like to see over the medium to longer-term a move towards lower rates of taxation.  That is only a part of the picture because we would have to look at the surrounding circumstances of a lower rate of taxation and we can conceive of several different situations.</P>

    <P>If we had again a period of rapid economic growth, for example, we might be able to conceive of a situation in which we had a lower rate of taxation and a steady or even increasing real level of public expenditure.  With a lower rate of economic growth a lower rate of taxation would inevitably mean some reduction in <Col N="1606" /> the real growth of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>To reply to Senator O'Leary's question, if we talk only about taxation my own preference would be to move towards a situation when we would have a lower rate of taxation, but taxation is only one part of the picture.  The rest of the picture depends very much on what rate of real growth in the economy we can achieve because that, plus what we feel about the level of taxation, will be conditioned to a large extent by the surrounding real growth in the economy.</P>

      <P>I would not wish my colleagues on both sides of the House to run away with the idea that I feel we should abdicate our responsibility to the poorer sections who are dependent on people in a privileged position with taxable incomes of £10,000 and £20,000.

      <P>The Minister has told us that the yield from the 65 per cent is approximately £7 million.  Whatever about the difficulties of raising £50 million, it would be an exaggeration to say that finding £7 million elsewhere would be an impossible or very difficult task. The real fact is that the 65 per cent band was not introduced, strictly speaking, for the purpose of raising tax.  It was a kind of a sop given by the Minister to his socialist colleagues, if that is not too imaginative a term by which to describe the Labour Party, a sop to show that his <Col N="1607" /> heart was in the right place and so on.  It merely comes within the category of window-dressing to show that everybody, including the very rich, will be hard hit. To that extent, of course, it will be irresponsible because anything that is merely window-dressing, that is merely giving a sop to somebody, is irresponsible if the cost of doing it is a serious cost.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that the disincentive which results from this 65 per cent is a very serious disincentive.  It will have a very bad effect on the economy in general because there is a kind of psychological barrier up to 60 per cent for anybody.</P>
      <P>Senator Ferris was talking about the very rich but some of the people who will have to pay the 65 per cent will be earning salaries as low as £10,000 or even lower. What we are having is an income tax band now which will have a very serious disincentive effect for people right down to quite low salaries.  That is going to have a bad effect on the economy generally. If it was really necessary, that is one thing; but I am afraid it was not really necessary.  It is just a window-dressing, an effort to show that everybody had to suffer.  In the long run, if we balance one thing with the other &mdash; the amount raised on the one hand, a comparatively small sum, and the harm that is being done on the other hand &mdash; it represents a feature of the budget which will be difficult to justify.  It is unfortunate that it was introduced not to raise taxation but for window-dressing purposes to give a sop to the Labour Party, and certain other people, the unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, with the permission of the Chair, to give some of my time to Senators Michael D. Higgins and Lanigan on this issue.  I have no desire to exacerbate a serious situation but it would be a failure in the responsibilities of this House, as a House of the Oireachtas, if we did not attempt to discuss a serious issue.  I should like, therefore, to put some of the salient points of Nicky Kelly's case on the record.  I am sure the Minister will adequately and ably put the contrary case.</P>
      <P>Among the agencies that are concerned about Nicky Kelly's case are Amnesty International.  They say they do not sit in judgment.  They are not interested in a verdict of guilty or not guilty but concerned with the standards of a fair trial.  They ask if it is in line with international standards of fair trial to accept certain standards of evidence; is it in line with the standards of a fair trial to hold someone <i>in communicado</i> for days after his arrest without a medical examination or without access to the solicitor of his choice?  It was, after all, after prolonged questioning, almost three days questioning, that Nicky Kelly signed a confession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is that on Monday morning, 6 April 1976, at 9.55 Nicky Kelly was arrested under the Offences Against the State Act and brought to Arklow Garda Station.  He was then brought to Fitzgibbon Street Garda Station in Dublin.  From 12 noon to midnight he was interrogated by gardaí.  He was then transferred to the Bridewell where he spent the night.  Questioning resumed in the morning and continued until 1 p.m. He was interrogated again from 3 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and from 11.30 p.m. throughout the night.  It was in the early hours of Wednesday morning that he made verbal admissions of guilt.  He signed a written confession at 5.15 a.m.  That was the only evidence that existed against him: the written confession signed after about 60 hours in Garda custody.  He was convicted and sentenced to 12 years along with two co-defendants.  He was not in court; he had absconded while on bail. <Col N="1609" /> He subsequently withdrew the confession, or tried to withdraw it, and alleged that he had been ill-treated in Garda custody.</P>
    <P>The situation is that the three defendants were admitted to Mountjoy Prison and were examined by the prison doctor. He found on Kelly extensive bruising on the arms, shoulders and buttocks.  During cross-examination that doctor admitted that it was, of necessity, a cursory examination and that he might have missed other marks.  Later that evening two doctors were brought in by Kelly's solicitors to examine him.  Their examination was more thorough and they found more bruising, some around and in the ears.  The following day another doctor examined him and found the left shoulder and scapula area had extensive bruising going from the top of the acromion towards the scapula.  There was linear bruising measuring five inches by two inches and three inches by one inch.  Suffice to say that there was ample evidence that somebody had inflicted some physical damage on Nicky Kelly.  This was obviously argued in the courts.  The prosecution argued that since (a) the gardaí denied assaulting him and (b) since Kelly had spent some time alone in his cell and some time in company with another prisoner he had the opportunity either to inflict the injuries on himself or to have somebody else inflict them on him.</P>
    <P>The Special Criminal Court accepted the prosecution case that the confession was entirely voluntary and had not been extracted under duress.  In the case of his co-defendants, when the case was appealed the courts found that, in fact, there had been breaches of the rules under which evidence was taken.  They did not accept that they had been beaten but they did accept that there were breaches of normal practice which would constitute oppressive questioning and the other two defendants were discharged and are now free.</P>
    <P>It was at this stage that Nicky Kelly returned from the United States where he had been in receipt of psychiatric treatment.  That is where the present saga began.  He attempted to appeal his case. May I say that in the factual account the <Col N="1610" /> Minister has presented on this case there is nothing I would dispute.  The factual account is quite correct.  I am not alleging or suggesting that there was anything which was factually incorrect.  Both the Court of Criminal Appeal and, ultimately, the Supreme Court did not concede his appeal.  That is the source of our present dilemma.  The Minister has said that he cannot do anything about this case unless fresh evidence is presented.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, evidence which is acceptable to the courts, a particular form of evidence governed by a lot of principles of which I would not claim to be an expert.  There is the other kind of evidence that public opinion takes note of.  In particular, there is the climate that prevailed here in those years of 1976 and 1977 of which I can give personal testimoney. I, as a totally innocent citizen, was followed home by the security section of the Garda.  My flat was observed by the security section of the Garda.  They changed shifts at midnight and continued the observation of my flat into the early hours of the morning.  A friend of mine, again totally innocent, was confronted one night, asked where he was going and asked would he not be better off at home in bed at that hour of the night.  We were totally innocent.  Fortunately we were reasonably articulate and, therefore, not particularly oppressed by this.  But that was the atmosphere that prevailed.  There was international concern about allegations of ill-treatment of prisoners in custody. Amnesty International were concerned. A major Irish newspaper published, and never found any reason to withdraw, a series of articles about ill-treatment of prisoners.  We eventually set up a committee of inquiry to look into the question of how we could best look after both the interests of prisoners and the interests of the Garda so that unfounded allegations could not be made against them.  It is regrettable that a number of the major recommendations of that commission were never implemented. I, for one, very much doubt if there would be any problem about the Nicky Kelly case if those proposals had been implemented, because either there would have been no doubt that his <Col N="1611" /> confession was voluntary or there would have been no confession, and that would be a far more acceptable situation.</P>
    <P>The major consideration is that the Minister has some obligation to face up to the fact that there was at that time widespread public concern about certain activities of certain members of the Garda and that there were in addition expressions of concern from various eminent and independently-minded agencies and individuals.  A major aspect of this case is that it happened at a time when there were serious public reservations. That is one of the reasons I am convinced there is so much public concern about this case, because of how it happened, and because of the climate of attitudes to security that prevailed in the country at the time.  That is not evidence that can be presented to a court but it is evidence that can be adjudicated upon by a politician.  That is the reason I feel the Minister ought to look at this question again.  That is the reason why I think there is great need for consideration of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is mistaken in thinking that to make a concession under these circumstances would be interpreted as weakness.  I do not believe that to be flexible and humane is anything other than to be strong and courageous.  I do not believe there would be a succession of other hunger strikes if Nicky Kelly were to be released, or if some progress were to be made towards achieving that goal.  I do not believe there is a conspiracy behind Nicky Kelly in the way that has been alleged to me on occasions in recent times.  Therefore, I appeal again to the Minister, as I have done indirectly before &mdash; and I regret that, because I would have preferred to have raised this matter first in the House before it was raised anywhere else, as that is the way I think we should do out business &mdash; to reconsider his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Ryan for sharing a couple of minutes of the time allocated for this discussion of this sad topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very mindful of what has been said in the other House, both in stating <Col N="1612" /> the case and in the Minister's reply, that it is important that any statements made by public figures have not the wrong effect of endangering even further Mr. Kelly's life.  For example, to be fair, the Minister has replied completely and at length giving the basis of his decisions to date, and I am very anxious to be responsible in what I say this evening.  In the history of this case I found the article by Barry McAuley in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 2 June 1983, page 12, very instructive and helpful.  It ends with the principle that is the nub of what I have to say this evening: &ldquo;Running through the Minister's statements to date has been the suggestion that if he was to review the circumstances of the case he would be setting himself up as a further court of appeal on top of the judicial system&rdquo;.  Mr. McAuley, a lecturer in criminology in University College Dublin, ends his point by saying that in a democracy no one branch of government enjoys absolute power and the right of the executive to pardon those who have been wrongly convicted has long since been regarded as a fundamental constitutional principle.</P>
    <P>Apart from Mr. McAuley's opinion, it would be highly inconsistent for somebody like myself, who has gone abroad appealing to executives to exercise compassion, clemency and to issue a comment on what were often judicial proceedings, not to make it in the case of somebody who has, unfortunatley &mdash; and I am not condoning it &mdash; gone on hunger strike to assert the principle that he has been wrongly deprived of his liberty.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kelly has been asked by different people to come off his hunger strike, but it would help if the Minister at this stage was willing to suggest that he was reconsidering the circumstances which led to Mr. Kelly's present position.  I must confess that I was a Member of the Seanad from 1973-77 when some of the legislation was going through, and I was worried about its application and the history of legislation like it in this country.  I have had letters from people who were arrested by some of the people who figured in the case.  Some of these people had their views sustained in one court to be reversed in another.  There is more <Col N="1613" /> than a reasonable doubt about the procedures and circumstances in which statements were obtained in this case.  I know many will say that the obvious suggestion &mdash; and perhaps it is an avenue that should be explored &mdash; is that Mr. Kelly has not exhausted all his options in terms of appeals to courts in other places, but what would be useful and valuable at this stage would be if people urged Mr. Kelly to think of his position, and if the Minister was willing to say that, as an executive act, and reflecting back on all the information available to him as of tonight, and in view of the suggestions that have been made about the executive's comment on the whole history of this period and these procedures, he was thinking again and would be willing to respond to a review of the case.  That might be helpful to many people who may be seeking a resolution to this difficulty.</P>
    <P>My prime concern is the saving of a life.  I am not commenting on the detail of the case, I do not have the time and it would be wrong for me to do so in a debate of this length.  In my view everything possible should be done to save Mr. Kelly's life.  It is important not to impose too rigid a model of rationality on Mr. Kelly's position.  He was ill before he took this decision.  He has claimed that he is asserting his innocence.  These human circumstances call for compassion and make a case for an indication that at least clemency might be considered in the event of Mr. Kelly coming off his hunger strike, or more than that, that the whole case might be looked at again.  It is in that sense that I support Senator Ryan's appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am joining with other Senators to ask the Minister to review this case as a matter of urgency because this person, rightly or wrongly, asserts he is innocent.  He has stated that time and time again.  I am not too sure whether he is or not.  The evidence in court would suggest that he is not.  If the Minister looked again at the case he would not be considered a weak Minister.  Perhaps the Minister could promise to review Mr. Kelly's case if he comes off his hunger <Col N="1614" /> strike.  There is enough violence in this country at present, and violence can be aggravated by judicial decisions.  I am not suggesting there was a wrong decision made in sentencing Mr. Kelly, but I do not think the judicial system, this House, or this Government, would be in any way weakened by the Minister reviewing this case immediately as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I appreciate the compassion and concern which have caused Senators to raise this subject here tonight, and I certainly appreciate the right of the Seanad to debate such a matter which concerns us all.  I do not agree that it is wise to debate it, however.  There has been public concern, and we are told that there has been public concern tonight. One problem here is that it is fair to say that, for the most part, the public have heard one side and one version.</P>
      <P>Senator Brendan Ryan began by saying he wanted to deal with the salient points of the case.  He said the Minister would be putting the contrary case, probably. I have not put the contrary case on any occasion.  I have said it is not the function of the Minister to adjudicate on guilt or innocence.  I have not conducted the debate in the other House, and will not do so here, on the basis of adjudicating on guilt or innocence.  That is a function of the courts.  It is not a function of a Minister.  The difficulty is that, because I am not in a position to debate one side rather than the other, the public have not got at all a full version of what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Wednesday of last week I issued a fairly detailed statement about the case. I sent a copy to every Member of the Oireachtas, but the general public have not had access to it.  No daily newspaper published the statement in full, and only one published a substantial part of it.  I am not complaining about that and, in particular, I could not expect that much space would be given to my statement by any newspaper that had not been giving much attention to the case being made by supporters of the prisoner.  All I am saying is that there is a problem of communication. We have had radio programmes with commentaries on my statement, but <Col N="1615" /> the great majority of the listeners would not have been in a position to know what was in my statement because the radio programmes did not carry my statement.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday of this week I made a statement in the Dáil supplementing what I had said in the earlier public statement, and I spoke again on the Adjournment debate.  Generally there was more publicity for that, but it was of its nature only supplementary material.  In my Dáil statement I made a special appeal to people in all walks of life, supporters of Mr. Kelly, people in public life, people in the media, and so on, to take account of the grave risk that continued agitation would be a factor in encouraging Mr. Kelly to continue on his hunger strike. Senator Ryan has chosen to ignore that tonight.  I need hardly say I could not and would not wish to question his right to raise the issue here, but I question again the wisdom of his action.</P>
    <P>I have already explained my position at considerable length.  I dislike intensely the spectacle of a young man on hunger strike for over a month and, if I could legitimately have helped by any action I could properly take, I would have done so before now.  No good but only harm can come from a continuation of a campaign for his release, a campaign which has been categorised not only by sloganeering, which I suppose is inevitable, but more significantly by a willingness to bend the facts to breaking point, and at times well beyond it.  I am sorry to find today that one of our daily newspapers has also joined in with an editorial which, while being reasonable on first reading, in fact does not stand up on examination. Again I accept their good faith.  Indeed, an earlier editorial by them on the same issue not only pointed to the difficulties posed for me as Minister, but did so in language more forceful than anything I had said myself or that I said since.</P>
    <P>Today's editorial takes issue with the judgment of the Supreme Court where the court said that the court of trial, having heard the witnesses and observed their demeanour and so on, found that the statements of admission were made voluntarily.  The editorial says very forcefully <Col N="1616" /> that that is not so, as the accused man was not cross-examined.  The writer is mistaken.  He was.  I am authoritatively informed that he was in fact cross-examined at considerable length, that the cross-examination extended over a period of several days.  The court rejected his allegations and declared the statements to be admissable.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the fact that it is really no part of my function as Minister to correct factual errors about court proceedings.  I am aware that such errors are going uncorrected and unchallenged. Furthermore, in saying even what I have said, I am conscious of the fact that I could easily be taken very wrongly as some kind of spokesman for the courts, somebody explaining and defending their decisions.  I must again emphasise that I have no such role, and that the fact that I do not challenge this or that statement about the court hearings or the evidence, does not mean they are true.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked: am I seriously suggesting the courts cannot err, that they are infallible?  I am not sure that that question is meant seriously because, of course, I have never said anything that would imply that I am suggesting that the courts are infallible. What I am saying is a very different thing and it is this.  I, as Minister, have no right to take an action that would imply that my assessment of the evidence that was before the courts is better than theirs and that they were wrong in their verdict. Above all, I am not entitled by my actions to call into question, in a serious way, the truthfulness of the sworn testimony of a substantial number of gardaí.</P>
    <P>No amount of talk about other allegations in or about that time can get away from the fact that we are here dealing with specifics, specific allegations and specific denials.  It would be an absurdity to suggest that a verdict could be under any kind of cloud because of other allegations, unless the implication was that there was reason to believe something of the kind alleged had occurred in this particular case.  That is precisely the issue, or at all events, the principal issue, that the courts had to deal with before reaching their decision, and it is also precisely the <Col N="1617" /> issue that brings into reckoning the question of the testimony of the gardaí.  Those questions cannot be evaded or brushed aside by any formula or any rhetoric.</P>
    <P>There may be those who speak without having considered this point, and there may even be people who genuinely cannot grasp it, but I am afraid that there are also those who see it very clearly but are not prepared to concede that they do. However, they do not carry the responsibility for the consequences of what they do.  I cannot put the matter further.  The House is fully informed of my position and of the impossibility of my taking any action at this stage.  I understand that there is a report in a newspaper today that Senator Ryan is one of those due to address a protest meeting tonight.  I am sure that has already taken place at this stage.</P>
    <P>A difficulty arises.  Senator Higgins referred to the fact that Mr. Kelly had not completed the appeal procedures open to him.  This is, of course, correct. He had the right to appeal to the European <Col N="1618" /> Commission and to seek to have his case adjudged in Europe.  Certainly, I, as Minister, would put no barrier in the way of Mr. Kelly proceeding along those lines.</P>
    <P>The issue now is that the hunger strike has been taking place since 1 May.  Mr. Kelly is now in hospital.  We are coming to a crucial stage, and I again appeal to everybody who is concerned.  I am aware that the vast majority of people are seriously concerned about this.  I appeal to them: if you have any influence over any support group who are influential with Mr. Kelly, appeal to him to come off hunger strike.  If he continues much further, and then discontinues his strike, there will be serious injury to his health. I appreciate the opportunity again to restate my views and I appreciate the concern of the Senators who raised this issue here tonight.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 3 June 1983.</P>
