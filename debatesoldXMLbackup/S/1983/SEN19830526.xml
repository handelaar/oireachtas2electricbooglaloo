    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1983  [  Certified Money Bill ]:   Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the House for agreeing to take this Bill now.  There may have been difficulty about it.  It is important that the Bill should pass all Stages and be enacted before the end of the month and before the limits on the various financial headings are reached.  It is the Government's wish that whatever moneys are required for the company would be provided without any delay.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited by increasing the limits in existing legislation and also to give statutory authority for SFADCo's small industries promotional activity in west and south-west Offaly.  Specifically, the Bill provides for:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  an increase from £80 million to £120 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company;</P>
      <P>(ii)  an increase from £40 million to £60 million in the aggregate amount of grants which may be made to the company;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1189" /> (iii)  an increase from £22 million to £25 million in the aggregate amount of advances which may be made by the Minister for Finance to the company; and</P>
    <P>(iv)  statutory authority for SFADCo's role in the promotion of small indigenous industry in west and south-west Offaly by the amendment of sections 2 (1) and 4 (1) of the 1970 SFADCo Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill is purely enabling in so far as it concerns the raising of SFADCo's financial limits.  I am pleased to note that this Bill received such a warm welcome from all sides of the House when it was discussed in the Dáil last week.  This is not surprising when one considers the success which SFADCo has achieved since its formation in 1959.  It is the type of success story that other State agencies should endeavour to emulate.</P>
    <P>As Senators are no doubt aware, SFADCo discharges a wide range of statutory functions.  I regard its two most important functions as the intensive promotion of small indigenous industry on the one hand and the development of air traffic and the industrial estate at Shannon on the other.</P>
    <P>SFADCo's role in small industry is not solely concerned with the mid-west region and west and south-west Offaly. It has the far broader and more vital national task of developing and testing concepts and systems which would lead to dramatic growth of small indigenous industry and to do so in a manner which would pioneer future national programmes. This national role is very important.  It entails the devising, testing and assessment of new approaches and programmes for the intensive development of small indigenous industry in such a way as to influence the content and direction of national policy in this sector, and leads to the application throughout the country of the approaches and programmes found to be successful.</P>
    <P>Two of these programmes which are proving to be particularly successful in <Col N="1190" /> this regard are the Innovation Centre and the Microelectronics Application Centre. The Innovation Centre which is a division of SFADCo and is located in the Plassey Technological Park is currently assisting over 80 projects in places as far apart as Donegal, Waterford, Dublin and in the mid-west region.  This availability nationwide of the services of the centre is made possible because SFADCo, rather than duplicating Innovation Centres all over the country, uses the existing network of agencies and institutions which are available locally.  The National Microelectronics Application Centre, which was established in 1980 by SFADCo in consultation with industrial firms in the mid-west region as an independent commercially oriented private company, is also assisting firms throughout the country in the very important work of redesigning existing processes and developing new ones related to the technology of the eighties and micro-chip.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and the Minister for Industry and Energy will shortly be announcing details of a new guide designed to help small industries to identify and tender for Government contracts. A new booklet is being published by SFADCo in an effort to stimulate greater awareness amongst industry owners and managers of the potential for public sector business.  Total Government purchases now amount to £3 billion a year.  The booklet entitled &ldquo;Tendering for Government Business &mdash; a Guide for Small Firms&rdquo; will provide detailed information on various aspects of Government contracts tendering.  The attractions and advantages of such business for small firms will be outlined. These include stable demand, secure payment and savings on direct marketing costs.  The booklet will also contain information on Government contracts tendering procedures, contract conditions and guidelines on the awarding of contracts.  The booklet will also list all key public sector purchasing organisations and the main purchasing areas and products within each agency.  This booklet will add to the impressive list of initiatives already taken by SFADCo to aid small firms.  These include a range of <Col N="1191" /> advisory services for small industry in the areas of finance, marketing, industrial relations, production and materials management as well as the provision of training courses specifically designed and developed for those establishing, managing and working in small firms.</P>
    <P>When SFADCo was first given its small industry role in 1978, the total number of small firms operating in the mid-west was 300; the company had increased this number to 650 by last December.  The number of people employed in small industry increased from 3,480 to 4,800 and the company expects that by the end of 1987, 7,000 will be in full-time employment in small firms in the mid-west region and in west and south-west Offaly.</P>
    <P>When SFADCo's financial limits were last amended in 1980 its responsibility for the promotion of small indigenous industry in the mid-west was extended into west and south-west Offaly.  The extension of SFADCo's mandate into Offaly was effected by way of an administrative arrangement whereby SFADCo operated as consultants to the IDA in the area.  This arrangement to date has worked very satisfactorily.  However I consider that, consistent with the procedure of accountability to the Oireachtas and, given the temporary nature of the Offaly assignment, the amendment of SFADCo's financial limits should be availed of to put SFADCo's role in Offaly on a proper statutory footing.  The work already begun by SFADCo, particularly in the development of client and local community relations, requires a number of years before it can produce lasting and worthwhile results.  Therefore, I would envisage SFADCo continuing to have statutory responsibility for small industries in this area in the foreseeable future. SFADCo has been operating in Offaly for two years now, and in that time, a total of 25 projects with a job potential of 250 has been approved.</P>
    <P>In the case of the mid-west region, SFADCo acts under statutory delegated authority from the IDA.  Delegated authority will now also apply in respect of west and south west Offaly.</P>
    <P>On the Shannon Industrial Estate total <Col N="1192" /> employment at 31 December 1982 was 4,300 which was slightly down, 6 per cent, on the 1981 level.  It is worth noting that this was the only year since 1975 in which a net growth of jobs has not been achieved.  SFADCo is confident that a return to job growth will be achieved in 1983 and is re-allocating its resources to meet this challenge head on.  Despite the decline in employment on the estate last year, SFADCo approved facilities for expansions in 16 existing industries at Shannon in 1982 which plan to create 430 new jobs at full production.  1982 was the first year which the 10 per cent rate of tax for new service companies locating on the estate was promoted and, while competition from abroad to attract these international service industry projects is intense, SFADCo is confident that the marketing efforts in the US and Europe, which were intensively carried out in 1982 will result in the programme making a significant contribution to the industrial estate job numbers in 1983.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned in the Dáil that a study to chart the future of the industrial estate over the next 20 years was being undertaken by the company.  The findings of this study will determine the kind of industry that Shannon will endeavour to attract over this period and the promotional strategies which the company will need to use.  It is expected that the new strategies will be implemented in early 1984.</P>
    <P>Moneys are provided to SFADCo for the following purposes: First, there is share capital which is used by the company for capital expenditure on the industrial estate at Shannon, in other locations throughout the mid-west region and west and south-west Offaly.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, factory construction and main infrastructural works in Shannon town.  A small proportion of share capital is also expended on aviation-related tourism projects of a capital nature.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are grant-in-aid moneys which are used to meet the company's running expenses and to provide financial aid to industries on the Shannon Industrial Estate.  Part of the company's running expenses relates to the development <Col N="1193" /> of traffic through the airport.  Expenditure for this purpose is met by a special grant-in-aid for which the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is accountable but which comes within the overall limits being amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The third item is repayable advances which are used to finance expenditure on the provision of houses and related services for Shannon town.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of houses, community buildings and the provision of house loans under the company's tenant purchase scheme.  Repayable advances, together with interest charges, are repaid at six-monthly intervals to the Exchequer by way of annuity.</P>
    <P>Expenditure by the company under the headings of share capital, grant-in-aid and repayable advances to 30 April 1983 are as follows: share capital &mdash; £77.3 million; Grant-in-aid &mdash; £38.5 million; repayable advances &mdash; £19.1 million.  The existing limits for share capital and grants will be reached shortly.  It is, therefore, necessary that these statutory limits be now increased to enable the company to continue its operations.  The limit of repayable advances will be reached during 1984.  On the basis of estimates of expenditure available, the proposed new limits will be sufficient until 1987.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am pleased to say that air traffic through Shannon Airport showed a substantial growth in 1982 over 1981 with an overall increase of 11 per cent and a throughput of over 1 million passengers. This significant growth was due principally to an increase of 25 per cent in transit passengers.  Terminal traffic on the North Atlantic route, which accounts for half of all terminal traffic &mdash; 590,000 passengers in 1982 &mdash; increased by 10 per cent last year.  The 1982 total level of 20,000 tonnes of airfreight, most if it industrial, represents an increase of 10 per cent over 1981, and a cumulative increase of 80 per cent over the ten years to 1982.  The company is continuing its work on the development and implementation of new tourism projects which will assist in generating traffic through the airport and consolidate Shannon as the country's North Atlantic gateway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and sincerely wish him well in a most important post at a very crucial time for this country.  I must explain to the House why I annoyed Senator O'Leary yesterday when I asked why this Bill was not being taken.  He said the Government had decided we were not taking it.  The reason I continued to press this matter during the afternoon and evening was the cost to the airport and to development at Shannon if we did not deal with the matter now.  I cannot put a figure on the cost but the Minister is aware of it.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome this Bill.  Any finance to Shannon Free Airport or to any part of the region is to be welcomed. The airport has played an important role in the development of the neighbouring counties.  I am in a position to speak on this matter because &mdash; I must be careful here because I was elected in the Twenty-six counties &mdash; Derry and I have served Shannon for over 30 years.  This is something I feel strongly about and I welcome any finance given to SFADCo.</P>
      <P>The staff from top to bottom are well directed, have initiative and enthusiasm and are effective.  We find it easy to criticise but we do not often enough pay compliments to people who succeed in the areas in which they are serving, whether they are senior officials or the general work force.</P>
      <P>We must now get value for the money we pour into State organisations.  We are in a developed world and will have to be constantly moving up the scale in technology, in design, in quality and in value for money or else we will just not make sales.  The personnel in the factories in Shannon are more than aware of this.  It is essential that our goods be of first-class quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We made dreadful mistakes in the past &mdash; I say this about my own Government as well as the Minister's Government &mdash; by giving grants to fly-by-night operators. Governments and politicians may pay the price in criticism but the greatest price of all is paid by the worker on the factory floor.  We are now taking a closer look at <Col N="1195" /> this and we are making fewer mistakes in these grant-aided factories.  I have always had a strong feeling about small industry. At one time we were heading for the bigger unit but now we have found that the smaller unit is the best for us.  In the small industry you have less trouble, the owner is nearer to the worker and there are less staff upsets.  I have seen family units being a great success and they do not get the publicity that they deserve. We seem to be talking about big impersonal operations all the time.</P>
    <P>I am going to make reference here to a specific factory because I know how it runs.  I know its success and its commitment to the workers.  If anything goes wrong the owners have to stick with it and cannot walk out.  I am a very strong advocate of more of that kind of factory. It was sad that at one time it was considered that an Irish person did not have the credentials to be a good industrialist and my party were as much to blame as anyone else.  I want to make reference here to a factory which the Minister knows.  I am not going to name it.  The factory is run by the two brothers and the younger brother drives a Mercedes out of the gate of that factory at six o'clock in the morning on his way to Dublin to go out into Europe because he heads the sales side of the business.  He may be criticised because he drives the Mercedes.  That is rather sad.  I think the attitude of the begrudger is something not to be condoned. I say this sincerely because I know the hard work and the long hours that those two brothers have put in to make that factory the success it is today.  They have a good track record.  They have a workforce of 300 and they just cannot walk away if there is a problem.  They just have to get in and solve it.  Except for one upset in a long number of years there has been a marvellous relationship between worker and owner.  This attitude probably exists in Shannon also.  The owners of the business I mentioned do not adopt a boss attitude all the time to the people on the factory floor.  This is a very important thing and perhaps we should have spoken about it more often in the past.  I will not have to mention it <Col N="1196" /> again to the Minister because I think the attitude of Irish management has changed course.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave figures of imports and exports.  I do not think that the factories in the industrial estate use the airport enough in the transport of the goods which are made and produced on the industrial estate.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain this to me.  There may be cost factors involved; there may be easier, cheaper transport and this may have directed the factory owners or the directors to decide not to use the airport. I ask the Minister here this morning to take a closer look at the cost of transport of products out of the factories.  If that could be reduced perhaps the owners would use the airport to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>I note that exports in 1981 were £153.54 million, up 16 per cent and in 1982 they were worth £165.4 million.  Imports in 1981 were £62.1 million and in 1982 were £71.8 million.  Again I am asking for more use of the airport.  The Minister referred to the role SFADCo played in traffic promotion.  I agree with everything said in the other House in praise of Shannon and SFADCo.  One would have to live in the area to appreciate the disastrous effects on the region if anything happened to Shannon.  Let the critics have their criticism. You have to live near it and know that if anything happened to Shannon what it would mean.  There is a great commitment and dedication of workers from the top to the bottom.  The Minister should ask SFADCo to do a new promotion drive to get more traffic through the airport.  I recall that this was done with a very forceful team in the sixties. Perhaps it is going on now but I am not aware that hard promotion is being done by SFADCo to promote more traffic through Shannon.  I am sure the Minister understands what I am trying to say.  It is important.  Figures have to be kept up and we do not want any false figures, which we never had from Shannon anyway.</P>
    <P>I will refer to customs clearance.  I again appeal to the Minister to do all in his power to re-open this if all the talk <Col N="1197" /> has stopped.  I understand that Americans are less interested now than they were when we were in Government.  It would mean an enormous amount of money to the region.  I ask the Minister to take another look at this for me.</P>
    <P>I have already talked about the 9,900 people in the airport.  The credit I have given them was given by my husband before me.  I am not just saying it to plamás anyone.  If I felt otherwise I would also give them the stick.  I must give credit to Clare County Council for the role they played because it is rarely seen anywhere.  It is a very significant role. They have just recently finished 78 houses.  Housing is mentioned in the Bill by the Minister.  There are 42 more houses now gone out to tender.  One of the most magnificent fire stations in the country was put up by Clare County Council.</P>
    <P>The new library is a total Clare County Council project.  It has one of the finest collections of books for children and adults.  Indeed &mdash; I am not being political here &mdash; it is most appropriately called after Seán Lemass.  That was a very good choice and all parties in the region would agree with me.  Clare County Council are totally responsible for refuse collection and for the maintenance of all the roads. Indeed, the county council have complete responsibility for environmental control of all Shannon under the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  This should be put on the record of the House because we do not often enough pay tribute to the people who play a very important role in a specific area.  That is only a small number of the things that come to my mind about the role of dare County Council in Shannon.  I rarely see it noted in print.  Some reference could have been made to it in some report.  I am making it now.</P>
    <P>There are figures in the Minister's speech about small industry programmes and Laois, Limerick city and county, Offaly, South and North Tipperary are mentioned.  Did Clare get the 474 jobs that were in this report?  Have County Limerick got the 240 jobs in this report? Have Limerick city got the 14 jobs in this report?  Have North Tipperary this morning <Col N="1198" /> got the 101 jobs committed in this report?  Have Offaly this morning got the 123 jobs in this report?  Perhaps I am not too good at English.  Those are the figures given.  Are those jobs filled this morning?</P>

      <P>What report is the Senator talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the 1981 annual report of Shannon Development.  You confused me there for a minute.  I thought I was making myself quite clear.  That will not deter me.  I will keep going.  I would like at this point, while we are talking about factories &mdash; I am not going to become political and I think the Minister will appreciate this &mdash; to ask if there is any chance at all of Interton in Ennis being given any help.  It is closed.  I wonder if SFADCo could do anything at all to help us out there.  There were 43 male, 76 female, 119, put out the door a fortnight ago.  Interstretch have also gone with 40 more jobs lost.  I ask the Minister to take a look at that.  Perhaps SFADCo could help us out.</P>
      <P>Is there no report from the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies?  The latest one I got on Aer Lingus Teoranta and Aer Rianta Teoranta was 16 December 1980.  Is that the latest report of this committee?  On page 67 of that report regarding the North Atlantic problem, they say they have noted at a number of points the extremely competitive situation on the North Atlantic routes that has existed for several years now and that it is a major factor in the poor financial results of Aer Rianta Éireann Teoranta. On page 69 the question naturally arises as to what steps Aer Lingus can take to limit losses on the North Atlantic or whether it might even be better to abandon these routes altogether.  I will keep coming back to that all the time.  It is frightening even to see that in a report of 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is still in somebody's mind to overfly Shannon.  One aspect of the North Atlantic cost, which is a specific disadvantage for Aer Lingus, is the compulsory double stop in Ireland.  Aer Lingus indicate that a saving in the order of £700,000 a year might be made if a single <Col N="1199" /> stop is made.  Of course the stop is to be Dublin.  Perhaps there is an up-to-date report.  Perhaps they have changed their mind because I am talking about a report of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies of 18 December 1980. While traffic through Dublin Airport presently amounts to 2,800,000 per year as against 1,000,000 for Shannon when I look at the US traffic to Ireland a much different picture emerges.  Over 60 per cent of all the traffic between Ireland and North America either embarked or disembarks at Shannon.  We had an Air Companies Amendment Bill in the House some time before 29 April with the Minister for Transport present.  I asked him to communicate with me because we differed on the figures for landings at the two airports at the time.  He wrote to me on 29 April and stated that he was right that the carryings by US airlines are brought into the reckoning and the ratio in favour of Shannon is 65:35.  He still insisted that the ratio in relation to Aer Lingus flights serving both points is now 50-50.</P>
    <P>The scheduled carriers involved are Aer Lingus, Trans America and North West Orient.  The Aer Lingus traffic alone is split about 50-50 between Dublin and Shannon.  We are all pontificating and talking about decentralisation.  Here is the Government's greatest chance to decentralise and bring the whole unit of Aer Lingus and the North Atlantic activities down, base them in Shannon and feed them with smaller planes to Dublin. When the 60 to 65 per cent have got off at Shannon a small plane would take the remainder to Dublin.  Let us be sensible about it and stop talking about decentralisation, building massive units of office blocks and moving people who do not want to move.  Let us just turn the planes around and base this operation once and for all at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus staffing is very Dublin orientated with about 6,000 people working in the capital for Aer Lingus and its auxiliary activities and only 300 in Shannon. Aer Lingus talk a lot about the loss on the North American route because of the service all the year round.  This is <Col N="1200" /> unfair because it seems to be changing and there is very little comment about it. Each winter the number of flights drops. They had six flights per week in the winter of 1980, five flights in 1981-1982 and last winter they had only four flights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some problem about curtailment of charter flights to Shannon which irritates some of the airlines when operating to Ireland, for example, Global and Capital Airlines.  It is making it difficult for Shannon management to encourage these and other airlines to use Shannon even as a refuelling stop between Rome and Athens on to New York.  I ask the Minister to look at that.  <i>Business and Finance</i> of 5 May 1983 stated that scheduled flights were up from 222,018 in 1977 to 429,445 in 1982 and charter flights down from 224,543 in 1977 to 55,000 a reduction of 75 per cent. At times all major carriers using 747 planes average between 10 to 15 hours utilisation per day.  Are we using the right planes?  Is this the cause of the loss rather than Shannon Airport?  I might be putting too much emphasis on the upper part of the airport but Shannon is a unit.  I am not too pushed about who has to deal with the comments I am making about maintaining Shannon.  SFADCo, who are such experts at other things, might pay more attention to the upper part of the airport with its excellent personnel. Perhaps the Minister would take a look at the 747 aircraft and see if we should have smaller aircraft as well.</P>

    <P>I was not aware that the AGM took place yesterday.  It took the wind out of my sails a bit when I heard on the 7.30 news this morning that all the figures of profit were out before I had made my speech.  Perhaps Senator O'Leary knew it was coming and he decided to let the radio have it before his colleague in the <Col N="1201" /> Seanad had it.  Even though it is old news now I am still going to refer to it.  It is encouraging to have good news because there is nothing but bad news these days. If some people are prepared to throw in the sponge, give up and say, &ldquo;We are finished as a county, we are finished as a region, we are finished as a nation&rdquo;, there are enough of us here to say: &ldquo;No way. Let us take the rough with the smooth and maybe it is a little bit rough at the moment but good days will come again&rdquo;. These good days may even come, amazingly enough, under a Coalition Government. Despite the recession Shannon was back in profit in 1982 and they have had a huge increase in profit, from £19 million to £33 million.  That is all old news now but I am anxious to put it on the record of the House.  I intended doing that yesterday before the AGM took place.</P>
    <P>I have already made reference to the people who have made Shannon and those who have stayed and lived there.  In the early days of the airport &mdash; this applies very much to the people working in the factories &mdash; I know how hard it was to go into a blank unit of houses that had no community atmosphere, churches or schools.  Those pioneering people deserve enormous credit for having encouraged other people to follow them to set up home in Shannon and making the town what it is today.  I must pay tribute to the workers and to the middle grade people.  I do not wish to distinguish between grades, but I must comment on the top personnel who decided to go to live in other organised towns.  For that reason there is great credit due to the people who stayed and helped to make Shannon the happy town it is today. Another good improvement has taken place in recent times.  It is the decision to appoint town commissioners for Shannon and that body has proved very successful in all fields.  Nobody knows better than the Cathaoirleach all the fields of local government, for example, in health and housing.  Of course, it could not but be a good body because Fianna Fáil have a majority on the commission.  For that reason it has to be right.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a plea to the Minister, through the Cathaoirleach, to <Col N="1202" /> ask SFADCo to make a more vigorous drive to sell Shannon again to get more traffic.  I am specifically asking the Minister to ask SFADCo to do this because anything they have undertaken has been successful.  I am glad Minister of State Collins, another Munster man, is putting this Bill through both Houses.  He should ask his Department to spread the activities of SFADCo further into other counties. I strongly welcome the Bill.  I thank the Minister, and his staff, for this tremendous amount of money for Shannon. I will do anything I can, leaving politics aside, for the good of Shannon and that region and other further constituencies that may be included under the administration of SFADCo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Repeated reference has been made by Senator Honan to what happened yesterday.  Examination of the record of yesterday will show that the Order of Business had been completed when I was asked about the SFADCo business.  The attempt to raise it as an additional matter on the Order of Business was not, in my opinion, in order. That was why I responded as I did.  There is one aspect I should like to mention.  I do not think it is necessary that Members of this House, on either side, should be lobbied by people who represent SFADCo to ensure the speedy passage of this Bill.  It is not wrong but it is not necessary.  To do so is an implied criticism of the Department, of the Minister and of the manner in which the Minister is putting the Bills necessary to preserve the situation through the House.  I do not think it is necessary for an official of a semi-State body to lobby Members of this House.  I have total confidence that the Minister will, as appropriate, consult with the Leader of this House from time to time, and with all sides of this House, to ensure the speedy passage of legislation that is necessary to ensure the continued successful venture which goes under the general title of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister to the House.  I assure him that he has come with a Bill that will receive a very warm welcome from this side of <Col N="1203" /> the House.  It will receive a warm welcome because it deals with a company whose success story has been well documented in previous discussions here and in earlier parts of this debate.  For that reason the subject under discussion is welcome.  It is also welcome that the Bill seeks to increase moderately the amount of money available for disbursement to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company under three headings as outlined by the Minister.  It does so in a sensible and sufficiently moderate fashion to ensure that there will be regular reviews of the performance of the company, which there should be, to ensure that its present and past success rate will be maintained.  Constant public scrutiny is one of the ways of ensuring that comes about.</P>
    <P>The increase in the share capital from £80 million to £120 million is welcome.  It is important that the money which is being provided for the establishment of items of a capital nature should be done by the subscription to the company by the Minister of a certain amount of share capital.  This increase is, therefore, to be welcomed.  The increase in the grant-in-aid is also welcome because the Shannon Free Airport Development Company has a number of quite separate and distinct though related activities, and the one in relation to the development of the airport and the surrounding infrastructure has been well documented by Senator Honan in her speech, one which we share in its entirety.</P>
    <P>The advances to the company by the Minister for Finance are also to be increased.  This is very important.  The infrastructural development of the area is an important by-product of the activities of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  One need only travel in the area generally under its control, particularly around Shannon Airport, to realise that a lot of that money has been well spent.  It has provided an infrastructure which is valuable.  Under this heading it is to be noted that this money is repayable.  That is also welcome.  Repayable advances show that at least portion of the development within the area is <Col N="1204" /> being funded by people by their own efforts and that they are willing to make repayments for the provision of houses and related services which are an essential part of Shannon town.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with regard to the extension of the area under SFADCo. SFADCo has been so successful because it concentrated on a particular area.  I would not like to see that diluted too much by expanding it to too many areas. Its success has been that it has been given a job and the people involved in it are able to do that job in a single-minded fashion.  Therefore, while it is tempting to say we should expand it to this or that area, I do not think that is really the best long-term strategy.  I have no objection whatsoever to the expansion into the southern and western part of Offaly because that is a real fact.  There is no point in going back there, but I am talking about new additional areas.  I do not think it is in the best interest of SFADCo that that should happen.  If it is necessary other development companies should be established for other areas rather than try to dilute the effort of the SFADCo people into too large an area.  One of the things we are inclined to do if somebody is successful in a particular area &mdash; we are inclined to do it in business, in politics and everywhere &mdash; is to load that person, or that group of people, with so much work that eventually they are not even successful in their original objective.  We should be very restricted in what we give to SFADCo and they will do that job properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a reference to the publication of a report and document which deal with helping people to tender tor Government business.  That is an excellent idea.  There is a lot of doubt in this area.  Many small business people do not know how to attack this problem and the kind of information which is available in the back of the post office telephone directory is not of much use because it lists what eventually the Government will be buying, everything from a needle to an anchor, every sort of thing one could imagine.  That is not of much use to the small businessman who wants to know the nuts and bolts of it. <Col N="1205" /> Obviously, our approval of the booklet will have to await our examination of it but the principle is excellent and I am quite sure the booklet will be excellent. Helping people especially small firms to tender for Government business has two beneficial effects.  First of all, it is good for the small firms and helps them to overcome the troughs of recessions and establish a good relationship with Government agencies and Departments. Secondly, it brings Government that bit closer to the people.  That is a good thing. It is something which should be welcomed and I congratulate the Minister, the Minister of State, the Department and SFADCo for this initiative.  It is a very good approach towards making Government more real for the small businessman. For this reason, and for the reason that the company in general is a successful one, and that the amounts of money being sought are reasonable, this provision in the Bill will have the full support and co-operation of this side of the House for its early enactment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill which provides for the further financing of Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I welcome it also because it affords the House an opportunity at a time of deep recession when the difficulty of providing job opportunities for our young population and, indeed, for those made redundant in recent years, of taking a searching look at a company which is a model regional development organisation.  It behoves Members when looking at the development there over a number of years to analyse critically how our over-executive style Government have lost out because local initiative becomes frustrated in the links of control that wind their ways from outlying areas to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many discussions here, in the other House and in many other places, about how overcentralised our Government have become.  Criticism has been levelled at politicians, at both Houses of the Oireachtas, on the basis of their irrelevance to problems outside.  I do not want to be misunderstood or to be likened to those, like Dean Griffin, who <Col N="1206" /> from their lofty thrones seek opportunities to pass snide remarks about people in public life, but the kind of face to face situation which has developed in politics here requires politicians to be in touch with every minute detail in their own constituencies.  That, obviously, militates against the kind of relevant Government that could be provided if we transferred, as was done in this case, men of ability, giving them discretion and the finance, such as we are providing today, to make decisions in their own areas and to pilot and pioneer developments without the day to day executive control of Government.</P>
    <P>There are very few models of regional development to compare with the developments that have taken place in the mid-west region by SFADCo.  That is not to say there are not areas in great need of further advancement and development, but it is to say that the powers which developed through SFADCo, the developments that have taken place in the educational sphere, in NIHE and other periphery areas, demonstrate how important it is to dislocate many of the centralised services which have cluttered up this city.  With a third of the country's population it now has 65 per cent of our crime and traffic chaos, and the many other problems which follow allowing the decision making processes to remain in such a concentrated form in the city. A debate on a Bill such as this should, perhaps, as Senator O'Leary said, involve us in a situation, not of asking SFADCo to expand its activities in a wider geographical area but rather to concentrate more within that region.  We should be asking that other powers, such as powers to local authorities, educational and agricultural committees, and other developmental organs be handed over.  SFADCo should be allowed to make decisions about their own areas. Politicians should be afforded a greater opportunity in the Seanad and the Dáil to concentrate on matters which are more relevant and which will encourage the public &mdash; all of the public &mdash; to support to the fullest possible extent the democratic system we have, and have enjoyed and should long continue to fight for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> The pride that communities take in their own areas is only enhanced when they contribute fully to that development. The fact that we are directly involved in these developments means that the work is more rewarding.  The community structures and people of all walks of life can see a part of themselves in their efforts and production and in the way these schemes are financed.  Inevitably, developments of this kind for the future may involve schemes of local taxation and, perhaps, we should not shy away from such opportunties where we want to provide jobs at present.  Those who had an opportunity of looking at &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; last night could not but have been shocked.  We have been aware for a long time of the problems of drug addiction, crime and the frustration that is enveloping our young population. Whatever the cost today in financial terms we must make the effort necessary to try to cure many of these ills before they become endemic in Irish society.  We must tackle them with greater imagination and local and community drive. There are far greater possibilities for us even in this recession than we are exploring. Many of us have been caught up in discussions on equality and tax problems, all of which exist but there are more radical and necessary areas that must be looked at.  Discussion on this Bill gives us an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I should like to ask him, and his Department, to encourage initiatives where possible to cater for those growing problems. In the mid-west region a local industrial co-operative was established in a mountainy area which has suffered from the haemorrhage of emigration for more than a hundred years.  It has been depopulated and has very poor soil.  In fact, an analysis by An Foras Talúntais indicates that it is somewhere around 30 per cent as good as the best land in the country but, in the course of a couple of years, a group of young farmers assisted by Shannon Free Airport have begun to see new life and new possibilities in an area where they were remote only a few years ago.  It has taken a lot of energy and <Col N="1208" /> dedicated enthusiastic effort but the pride it has built up in that community in such a short time with limited prospects and resources indicated to all of us how much more can be done in such areas by local initiative, and if the State encourages, through its agencies, more local involvement in the day to day running of developments it is better to have that rather than having the situation where a housing engineer travels to see if one qualifies for a local authority loan and is followed by a housing inspector from the Department of the Environment to see if one is entitled to a grant.  People must use the political system to try to get grants and that takes up the time of politicians. I am not objecting to that because it is necessary if the public cannot penetrate the system.</P>
    <P>Surely when we have systems like that we ought to think again about how we are flooding this system.  Those who want to be directly involved in the developments of the kind I mentioned should have time to give local leadership.  Politicians have the oportunity to study local developments and are aware of current problems.  Now is the time to look at this. There are many obstacles that stand in the way of such advancements.  In this recession we have mental and physical fatigue among many of our unemployed. The old system where people survived for themselves because the social welfare system was not as advanced as it is now, was in many ways healthier because people had to do certain things particularly in relation to the provision of food. That is not necessary now.  I am not saying that we should change that developed social code but it has to be linked to initiative, perhaps in the provision of marginal industrial development for young people in the many factory bays that are lying idle in our own regions or elsewhere during the summer months. Manufacturing projects and marginal economic developments could become economic in a mix between the social welfare code and the AnCO training schemes.  They would have the advantage of getting these people involved in doing something productive for themselves and their families.  Our greatest wealth is our <Col N="1209" /> people but if they cannot be usefully employed in developments in their own areas there is not much hope for the future.</P>
    <P>There have been references this week to food imports.  When we hear that we import £800 million worth of food the time for talking about it should be over. I am not saying this is an easy matter to deal with.  We emphasise that our strengths are in climatic conditions and disease free environments but many other changes will have to take place in the pattern of farming, in the seasonality of supply and the quality of our produce. I sympathise with farmers who feel that the solution to their problem is to pour oil on imported potatoes but it is far from a solution.  We compete in an aggressive market with well presented goods that have been well washed and packaged. We compete on those lines or we do not compete at all.  I should like to encourage SFADCo, the financial institutions, the banks, insurance companies and the co-operatives to get involved because this is not an isolated job.  I regard this as the central issue for all of us.  We all have a vested interest not in having £60 million or £80 million profit in a certain bank but in ensuring that these funds are diverted to the fullest possible extent into self-financing productive enterprises which will use the talents of our people.  Profit on paper is a sad recipe for the problems that face us today.  I am not interested in profit.  Many people in public life, as was indicated in yesterday's newspapers, are not interested in money either in spite of what is said about us.  As one who fought four elections in one year I ask any respectable authority on any ecclesiastical throne, dean or otherwise, to swap that kind of trauma.  I should like to pay a tribute to the wives and families and the people who support politicians.</P>

      <P>Yes.  They know what it is to have to look after families when others are involved in public life.  There has not been any defence of them and it is a pity that has to come from people involved. <Col N="1210" /> I am not ashamed to make it and I avail of this opportunity to do so.  I want to concentrate the mind of the House on a few of the broader questions.  I hope all of us, with the opportunities we have, will try to emulate what SFADCo has been doing up to now.  SFADCo should get involved much more in the food processing area.</P>
      <P>I know that it may require fairly heavy investment in pilot centres and perhaps processing units of a very small kind in an attempt to tailor new products to the market situation.  There is a very interesting development in University College, Cork, in this area.  I am not asking for duplication of that but rather that we bring together these developments that have gone so far in all-out attack, not just in words, to try to use that material asset that we have to provide greater opportunity everywhere possible for SFADCo and for the Government in the climate of Clare to provide the funds and to give to the fullest possible extent to local areas, regional areas and county committees the power and the say in so far as the activities that they conduct in their organisations are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, to the House and I compliment him on this legislation which has, and should have, our full and total approval.  I would like to wish Deputy Collins well in his very important and challenging portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally support this Bill for a number of reasons which, stated already, need restating for the purpose of emphasis. Firstly, I do not think that we can exaggerate the very fine job of work that SFADCo have done in the whole mid-west region and I welcome the decision to extend that into other fringe or peripheral areas.  I feel quite strongly that SFADCo should be allowed to develop their potential to its fullest in the area that they serve at present.  The mid-western region has not been developed under the aegis of SFADCo to the extent that it can be developed.  We compliment SFADCo and all those under their operations, <Col N="1211" /> and the IDA as well for whom SFADCo act in the mid-west region, on the great job of work they have done, but in the area of small industries in particular there is a great deal of potential for development.  No matter how small the development work or project might be, a sufficient number of small projects can make a massive impact on the overall scenario <i>vis-a-vis</i> employment and, as has been alluded to already, no problem at present is more serious for us as a nation than unemployment, which not alone brings very serious economic ills day after day but also, as has been stated and I stress again, its social implications are extremely serious.  We all have a responsibility to make certain that unemployment is not allowed to continue.  I do not think any sane person could oppose anything that would help to alleviate the serious cancer of unemployment.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have done a great deal.  Their potential in the immediate future in particular lies in the securing of jobs in the small industries area and I am aware that moneys are available from the EEC, provided that worthwhile ideas emanate from persons or groups of persons, to proceed with certain projects in the Shannon Free Airport Development area.  It is incumbent on everybody to assist in the bringing forward of ideas of one sort or another and any idea that has viability prospects will certainly be considered extremely favourably by SFADCo.  That is important.  Sometimes unemployed people do not realise that even a very small project will gain not alone very sympathetic hearing from SFADCo but help of a very positive nature.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of decentralisation I stress again how important it is that we do not add to the number of persons in this city in proportion to the total population in our country.  It is extremely important that we have decentralisation. SFADCo are one example of where decentralisation has been successful, and the same principle applies right through the country.  It is not confined to the mid-west region.  A number of things need to be done, under the aegis of the <Col N="1212" /> IDA, right through the whole country, and under the aegis of SFADCo in their own area of operation.</P>
    <P>As Senator Smith has said, the area of food imports is one that we must tackle positively.  I have stated in this House on previous occasions the absolute need for some national development agricultural authority who will take account of the whole area of food production, processing and marketing right from the beginning to the consumer stage.  I do not propose to go into detail on that area now.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation because it is progressive.  We must all see very clearly the good work that SFADCo have been doing and examine as fully as we can what and where potential exists for SFADCo to develop in the time ahead. Other areas of the country also could benefit enormously by organisations similar to SFADCo.  What has been done effectively and successfully in one place by SFADCo under the aegis of the IDA can be done very well elsewhere.  We look at this situation in a local context in this legislation to a certain extent, but also we must take account of the national scene and the effect this development has on the national economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and will give it my full support.  It deserves support from everybody.  Furthermore, I urge that each and every Member in this House would devote his or her attention to the whole question of the development of small industries because small industries, be they on co-operative lines, private lines or a combination of both, provide a definite answer to our very serious unemployment position at present which I believe earnestly we cannot afford as a community to allow to continue further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him success in his new and very onerous position.  I join in the welcome for this Bill.  By any standards SFADCo must be regarded as a success story among our much-criticised semi-State agencies. Against a background of severe recession, it is heartening to note that the promotion of small indigenous industry, <Col N="1213" /> a role assigned to SFADCo in 1978, continues to be fulfilled with remarkable success. Not alone has the overall employment level in small industry been maintained in the very difficult year of 1982 but, since 1978, 2,000 new jobs in small industry have been created and sustained in the mid-west region for which SFADCo have statutory responsibility.</P>
      <P>Total employment at the end of 1982 on the Shannon industrial estate was 4,300.  This was down by 6 per cent on 1981.  However, given the recessionary conditions both nationally and internationally which adversely affected employment in the industrial estate, it is worthy of note that this was the first year since 1975 that a net growth in jobs was not achieved.  Notwithstanding this fall in employment in 1982, it is worth underlining the fact that there was a volume increase in that year in terms of output from the industrial estate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the imminent publication of a guide to small industries which the Minister mentioned in his statement and which will help small companies to be identified and tender for Government contracts. Against a bleak employment picture nationally, SFADCo are in the van of recovery efforts in 1983.  The company are confident, with justification, that a return to job growth will be achieved this year.  By keeping in the closest possible contact with the companies on the industrial estate, SFADCo have been allocating their resources to attract more international service industry projects to Shannon.  The indications, based on company orders, are that both employment and output will be up this year on 1982 levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of new technology, the Minister has highlighted the work of the Innovation Centre, which is a division of SFADCo, and the National Microelectronics Application Centre established by SFADCo in 1980.  From time to time we hear fears expressed about the impact of new technology.  The siliconchip technology is new; it is revolutionary and it is inevitable.  As I see it, far from being a threat to jobs in our manufacturing industry, this new technology is essential for the re-design of existing processes <Col N="1214" /> and the development of new ones.  This, in turn, means that our manufacturing industry will be more efficient and competitive. In other words, we need the micro-chip to sustain and create jobs in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The National Microelectronics Application Centre is playing a vital role in creating an awareness of the possibilities of the micro-chip in modernising our manufacturing industry and is following up this awareness by assisting firms not alone in the mid-west but throughout the country in re-designing existing processes and in developing new ones.  The Centre is, therefore, helping in a very real way to save and increase industrial jobs that otherwise would be lost through obsolete equipment and processes.</P>
    <P>The seeds of considerable development are now firmly sown by linking the Plassey technological facilities and the NIHE in Limerick to the needs of our industrial development.  These technological and educational services are available to both small and large industry throughout the country.  This marriage between educational facilities and our industrial development needs is a resource of immense potential.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the question of industrial strategy.  Our industrial strategy for the future needs very careful attention and very careful thought. Labour is no longer cheap.  We do not have the industrial structure to engage in heavy industry like ship-building or the refining of crude oil.  However, we have a highly educated labour force which has more to offer by way of brains than brawn.  With the advent of micro-processors and the pool of expertise that is now available we have the opportunity to apply decentralised technology throughout the country.  In other words, we have the competence in Ireland, in Irish institutions with Irish experts to adopt ideas and to apply them to the development of new products.  The challenge is to carve. out market niches for these products.  I welcome the Bill and wish to congratulate all personnel in SFADCo on the excellent work they are doing.  This Bill is a vote of confidence in SFADCo and I heartily support it.</P>

      <P>I rise to welcome the Bill and to wish SFADCo continued success in the tremendous work they have done and the great contribution they have made to industrial development in the Shannon region over the last 20 years. I should also like to express my satisfaction that they have included in their area some territory in a portion of County Offaly.  I look forward to tremendous energy being expended by them in that area which is in need of it.</P>
      <P>When SFADCo came into being they were looked upon as pioneers of the work that they were undertaking.  At present with so many companies in the country under pressure and some perhaps failing, when one of those hits the headlines the vast majority of companies who continue on in profitable commercial activity seem to go unnoticed.  Perhaps the Minister, instead of paying grants to some of the foreign companies who come in here, would consider providing the interest on loans taken up by these companies.  Thus the Government would finance for a period of years &mdash; whether it be three or five years &mdash; the loans necessary to establish the companies.  This might not look as bad from the point of view of the public who in the main do not seem to care what is done.  They complain when things go wrong but they conveniently do not see the excellent work being done in so many areas.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that the Minister has decided to bring in this Bill which places this proven organisation in a better position and provides for its continued activity. In conclusion, I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and to wish him success with the tremendous burden of work that he has to undertake if the economic situation in the country is to be turned around.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming the Minister of State here and congratulating him on his appointment. I welcome this legislation which will increase the finance to SFADCo. SFADCo are doing wonderful work for the mid-west region.  When Deputy <Col N="1216" /> O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce he introduced legislation to give responsibility to SFADCo for providing indigenous small industries in the mid-west region.  He was criticised at the time for taking some powers away from SFADCo but it has been proved that the legislation was good.  At that time Senator Howard in his contribution said:</P>
      <P>I sincerely hope ... that some time in the future I will be able to concur with the views expressed by Senator Hillery now.  They were confident and optimistic and I hope they will be proven to be correct.</P>

      <P>During 1982 a total of 135 projects with employment potential of 1,362 jobs were approved for the mid-west region and west and south-west Offaly.  Firms being assisted for the first time accounted for 62 per cent of the jobs approved.  There was a wide dispersal of projects throughout the region, about 50 per cent being located outside the Limerick-Ennis-Shannon triangle.  Eligible fixed asset investment in the 135 approved projects is estimated at £6.4 million with approved capital grants of approximately £3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the job approvals for the year were 10 per cent down on approvals for 1981, the out-turn for the year was considered satisfactory when viewed against a background of escalating costs, high interest rates and depressed markets. During the year the company vigorously pursued conversion of job approvals into actual jobs.  A large proportion of available manpower and resources was also directed towards the maintenance of existing jobs.  This helped to minimise the effect of the recession on small industry employment.  A total of 564 jobs were <Col N="1217" /> created during the year in grant-aided firms.  They were offset by 433 job losses resulting in a net gain of 131 jobs in grant-aided industry.  Employment in non-grant-aided small industry contracted by 169 jobs, resulting in an overall loss in small indigenous industry of 38 jobs.  This is great progress in a time of very serious unemployment, and SFADCo must be congratulated on the great progress they are making in this area.  Existing small firms have shown great resilience in the difficult economic climate of recent years.  To survive and develop they have had to learn how to improve their scarce resources and improve the marketing of their products. As a result these small industries should be in a strong position to expand and create additional jobs when trading conditions improve.</P>
    <P>The company's field officers are doing a great job and must be complimented. They are situated in Limerick servicing the city and county, Ennis serving County Clare, Nenagh servicing Tipperary north and Birr servicing west and south-west Offaly, for the purposes of generating and servicing small industry inquiries and providing an aftercare service aimed at removing the barriers which hinder the progress of grant-aided firms.  During the year a comprehensive programme of industrial clinics was held in the majority of town and villages throughout the region.  These generated an additional 150 new small industries.  We must acknowledge the co-operation and support of the county development teams and officers in that great work.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to an Innovation Centre which was established by the company some time ago and is located in Enterprise House, Plassey Technological Park, Limerick.  It provides a comprehensive product development service for small industries not alone in the region but throughout the country with a strong bias towards products of advanced technology and with export potential.  In 1982 a total of 20 new products were developed in the centre and all of these are scheduled to commence production in 1983.  This compares with a total of 12 <Col N="1218" /> products in 1981.  At the end of 1982 a further 50 product ideas of commercial potential were at various stages of development at the centre.</P>
    <P>I read in the local paper recently about planning permission sought for the provision of a food centre for small firms. This is a welcome venture, especially in view of the significant potential for job creation in food processing.  In 1982 the company focused special attention on the development of this sector for small industry.  During the year a successful food and drink exhibition was organised at Limerick together with a conference on food processing, which attracted 230 delegates from small industry throughout the region and county.  This new food centre will be specially designed for food processing and will be of enormous benefit to exports maintaining international standards of hygiene.  It will help Ireland too to compete effectively in the world processing markets.  I am delighted that planning permission is sought for it and I am sure it will be granted and that the centre will be in operation soon.</P>
    <P>The company must also be complimented on their area development.  In 1982 they continued to encourage and support a number of self-help projects in the region.  Existing area development projects at Southill in Limerick city, Anglesboro and Kilfinane in County Limerick and Sliabh Felim in north Tipperary all progressed during the year. Management grants and additional aids towards the establishment of community co-operatives were made available towards the end of the year and have since been incorporated in the area development programme.</P>
    <P>Legislation was introduced, &mdash; the Minister referred to it in his speech &mdash; to give autonomy in west and south-west Offaly to SFADCo.  A map of the mid-west region reveals it as a concentrated, compact area.  North Kerry is at the other side of the estuary, Clare goes out to the end of the estuary and the mid-west region extends as far as the Kerry-Limerick border.  I do not think that there would be any difficulty in including north Kerry in the SFADCo area as <Col N="1219" /> north-west, west and south-west Galway were included in it.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Malley, the former Minister, introduced this legislation he stated that he and the Minister for the Environment were discussing the prospect of giving town commissioner status to Shannon.  Shannon town has been granted town commissioner status since then which is another recognition of the role of and development in the Shannon area.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by welcoming this Bill. It is providing further finance to SFADCo to ensure that they continue the good work they have been doing.  I would like to compliment all these small industries in the mid-west region and the SFADCo region for the great employer-employee relations that exist.  There is very little industrial unrest.  It is an example to many big industries and others where there is industrial unrest.  I welcome the Bill and wish SFADCo every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers I should like to welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in the present very difficult situation.  His application to the job will be more appreciated by people who know him than by others in his own area who have apparently given up on the role of this House and the other House in the organisation of matters of the State.  It might appear out of order for somebody from outside the Shannon Free Airport Development Company region to be speaking on this Bill but it gives us an opportunity to discuss the role of the State in the private enterprise area.  It also gives us an opportunity to discuss whether the marriage between the two can be successful or unsuccessful.  Shannon Free Airport Development Company have proved themselves in that they have married State resources and the resources of the people of the area they are working in and that marriage has proved very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many areas at present there are lacks in private enterprise and in general there is a lack of capital.  The State has the <Col N="1220" /> opportunity to put capital into development enterprise.  The resources of the State in the case of Shannon Free Airport are being used to the best advantage of the State and the people in the region. The industries which are being set up under the aegis of Shannon Free Airport Development Company in general have been successful.  In terms of set-ups they have been more successful than enterprises which have been started on a purely commercial basis, in other words set up by private individuals with good ideas but without the resources to back them up.  This is where I see the development of Shannon Free Airport Development Company and other State companies. The role of these State promoted enterprises together with the ideas which can come from industry are very important.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about Shannon Free Airport Development Company we cannot get away from the fact that, as a resource organisation, they are involved with CTT, the IDA, semi-State and State organisations.  They are also dependent on the Department of Finance, the Department of Industry and Energy and the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  There are so many State involvements in SFADCo that even though it is under the aegis of one Department it is dependent on other Departments for finance and other resources.  When we are speaking about SFADCo, should we not now be discussing the setting up of a national resource agency where all the abilities, expertise, energy and historical experience of the IDA, CTT, SFADCo, KDW should be brought together as a national resource agency so that their expertise can be used?  There is a lot of energy being put into the development of export businesses by SFADCo, the IDA and CTT and CTT sponsor groups to go abroad to look for contracts.  If there is a major contract going say in the Middle East or America, CTT will sponsor perhaps 20 or 30 individual firms to go out and look for contracts within that major contract area.  In many cases they pay fares to executives of companies who are competing for the same contact.  These people <Col N="1221" /> come back; they do a feasibility study, they then get down to tender and perhaps in the Irish context you might have 20 Irish firms contracting for sub-contract in a major contract abroad.  SFADCo, CTT, IDA and the Minister should be addressing themselves to this dissipation of a national asset.  Why not set up a national resource agency which could, if there is a major international contract going, identify the areas in which there could be an Irish input?  They could then do a feasibility study and contact the firms here who could deal with that contract.</P>
    <P>The food processing, industry and the input that SFADCo have made into this area was mentioned.  In the food industry hundreds of people sponsored by CTT go abroad to do feasibility studies mostly at their own expense apart from a little help from CTT but they just have not got the expertise in setting up the package which will enable them to get into the market in which they are interested.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have identified projects and markets and helped to set up small firms to deal with the market potential.  One of the problems when semi-State or State companies get involved with small industries is that they secure the availability of capital but they do not spell out how much it is going to cost to pay back what is borrowed.  Semi-State or State bodies should spell out to industrialists how much per £1,000 per week, how much per £1,000 per month or how much per £1,000 per year they are going to have to repay on their borrowings.  When you have a 33 per cent or a 35 per cent rate of tax, how do you specify what your actual turnover is?  That is not spelled out in the magnificent brochures that are put out by SFADCo, the IDA and CTT.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that SFADCo are now bringing out a new brochure setting out their aims and objectives and the availability of their resources.  The first SFADCo booklet detailing the grants, the area and what was available to SFADCo was the first one could bring to a foreign country as an example of what is available in a particular region in Ireland as regards set-up, capital availability or grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> I am glad that the South-Eastern Regional Development Organisation took up the challenge that SFADCo offered at the time and produced a magnificent information booklet on the south-eastern region.  But, unfortunately, glossy booklets are not what people need.  They need to know how much they would have to put up themselves, how many grants are available and the rate of repayment of loans.  I stress again that it is not the percentage&mdash;you go to a hire purchase company and they will quote you a 14 per cent interest rate and you suddenly find out that the 14 per cent interest rate is 14 plus 14 less one or you go to a bank and it is 16 plus 16 less one.  People should be told that you will have to pay back approximately £1,000 per month on £50,000 over three years. It should be spelt out so that they will know that each week they will have to put by £100, £200 or £300, or whatever the amount is to repay their loan.  One of the problems in helping to set up industry by SFADCo and by other semi-State bodies has been that the repayment of the loans has not been spelt out in greater detail.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous potential as between SFADCo and the Kilkenny Design Workshops in the industrial design area because industrial design has become a very important element only recently.  When industrial design or the Kilkenny Design Workshops were mentioned originally, people thought of arty crafty elements of design but the design of an air pump sells that air pump just as does the design of a perfume bottle sell that perfume bottle.  The difference good presentation of a good product can make is amazing.  That product will sell better than bad presentation of a good product.</P>
    <P>I can see a marriage between KDW and SFADCo and I understand the Department of Finance were asked by SFADCo and KDW to underwrite, set up costs or set up losses for an initial few years of a KDW retail cum showroom cum KDW enterprise in the Shannon Free Airport Development Company's area in Limerick.  The potential of this would have been enormous but KDW could not get from the Department of <Col N="1223" /> Finance the nesessary guarantees that their set up costs would be met, that their set up losses would be met or SFADCo could not get, from within their own resources, the necessary funds to ensure that the enterprise would be set up on what would be considered a normal commercial basis.  Since the State was going to be the innovator, since KDW have proved themselves a huge success and since the enterprise that they considered setting up with SFADCo in Limerick would also have proved a success, the State should have got involved in that project because it would have been selling Irish design and Irish expertise; it would have been selling Ireland in a commercial sense.  The amount of money that would have been involved was small by State spending standards.  There should be more liaison between KDW, CTT, IDA and SFADCo.</P>
    <P>We had an enabling Bill here towards the end of last year to give KDW an extra £500,000 and this money was used to develop KDW on a commercial basis.  It has proved successful because KDW, at a time of recession, have a retail outlet in Nassau Street in Dublin and are making a profit.  SFADCo have proved themselves, just as KDW have, but I should like to see a marriage of the resources available to us and this marriage could take place even in a recessionary period.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of setting up a national resource agency to see if we can marry not alone the State agencies but also the resources that are available from outside the State.  Then we can get into the export and industrial markets to a much greater degree than we do at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Members for the personal welcome which they have given me here this morning.  It is always a pleasure to come to the Seanad.  I want also to thank them for partaking in the discussion on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sums mentioned in this enabling Bill are the largest sums ever allowed to <Col N="1224" /> the Shannon Free Airport Development Company since its establishment by the Oireachtas in 1959.  This shows the commitment which the Government have to the company and to the continuing development of SFADCo.  The praise which I have heard today for the company and their employees is to be welcomed and indeed the company have shown themselves to be very forward looking in their operations and involvement with industry, with the airport and with the community which they serve.  I wish to mention that, because it is worth noting that the Government have every confidence in the company and in the future development of the mid-west region as a whole.</P>
    <P>The last review of the company by the Oireachtas was in 1980 and it is estimated in this Bill that the funds being provided will be sufficient for the next three or perhaps four years.  I think that this is a good way of providing funds to State bodies because it means in effect that there is a need for a Bill every three or four years which must be processed through both the Dáil and Seanad.  This, therefore, allows an Oireachtas debate on the activities of the company on, say, a three yearly basis.  This leads to good accountability to the Oireachtas and gives an opportunity to Members to express their opinions on the company on a periodic basis.</P>
    <P>I should now like to reply briefly to some of the points raised by the Senators in the debate.  Senator Honan, showing her obvious native knowledge of the area, in a long and very constructive speech made a few points which I should like to reply to.</P>
    <P>In relation to factories using the airport, SFADCo make every effort to provide air transport and indeed are looking at new projects.  One of the main considerations which the company takes into account is, of course, the capacity to develop air transport.  SFADCo cannot dictate to companies the manner in which they operate their own commercial undertakings.  Circumstances and relative costs change in time and in various industries. Ultimately, it is up to individual <Col N="1225" /> companies to decide how and in what manner they wish to transport their goods.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of customs clearance arrangements, there are ongoing negotiations with regard to this matter. SFADCo will be asked again to continue these negotiations thoroughly and sympathetically.  I fully appreciate the point made and I can assure the Senator that the negotiations will be carried on.</P>
    <P>SFADCo's co-operation with local authorities in the region which they serve is essential, indeed vital.  To date, the relationship between the company and the local authorities has been excellent. It is only fair also to point out that the local authorities concerned have been most anxious to co-operate and the relationship on both sides should be mentioned. The establishment of Shannon Town Commissioners has been achieved. The elections have been very successful &mdash; at least for the Opposition Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant that as the Town Commission as an authority matures, I am sure we will see a reflection in the representation.  In the 1981 annual report the question was raised about jobs on the ground.  It is fair to point out that, since 1978, SFADCo have created and sustained almost 2,000 jobs in the mid-west region.  I will communicate privately with Senator Honan regarding the breakdown of the job creation success of SFADCo and the IDA in the mid-west region as well as the Shannon Free Airport area.  This may be of benefit to the Senator, as it would take too long to give the details here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding two companies to which the Senator referred, Interton and Interstretch, they are not directly within SFADCo's remit.  They are within the IDA'S remit but I assure the House that the IDA are making every effort to effect <Col N="1226" /> the take-over of the company.  In that connection, I am pleased to note that the sit-in in Interton has ceased.  I should say quite clearly that where factories stop producing and go into receivership or liquidation, sit-ins militate against the take-over of a factory.  There is nothing to be achieved by sit-ins.  They are a most negative form of protest.  In fact they ensure the factory closure and many people who are inclined to think that sit-ins are a good way to protest should bear in mind that sit-ins are a positive disincentive to the re-opening of factories. Members of the Seanad will appreciate the need for me to state that here on this Bill.  It refers to the country in general, but it should be stated and, where necessary, re-stated.  The Government and the IDA are trying to re-open factories and it is my responsibility to condemn any action that will militate against that.</P>
    <P>The question was raised regarding Aer Lingus's activity.  Senators will appreciate that Aer Lingus are not the responsibility of a Department.  Their management and decisions come within the remit of the Minister for Transport.  However, I will bring to the attention of the Minister and to the attention of SFADCo the point made with regard to the commitment of Aer Lingus to Shannon.  Again, in relation to the charter flights I will ask SFADCo and Aer Rianta to discuss the matter further.  I understand, according to an article in <i>Business</i> and <i>Finance</i> that a suggestion has been made that the Boeing 747 is perhaps not the best aircraft for the trans-Atlantic route.  I am not able to comment on this assertion.  I have flown in a 747 and found it very comfortable, but I could not comment on its economic efficiency.  It is really a matter for Aer Rianta and the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>Regarding a further Bill to enhance Shannon, at present SFADCo employ five people directly in promoting air traffic in North America.  These people work closely with Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte representatives in the promotion of traffic to Ireland and particularly to Shannon Airport.  In addition, there are three people working for the company in <Col N="1227" /> this regard in Europe.  They are aware of the need for promotion and have staff on the ground in the marketplace to promote the area, especially Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are introducing a short haul aircraft service through Shannon shortly. I understand that SFADCo are finalising negotiations with a small private airline company for a Shannon-based short haul air service to Dublin, Cork, Manchester, Bristol and so on.  This is a good development and it may facilitate many people who might fly on to Dublin with the intention of flying to further destinations, of getting off in Shannon and taking a short haul plane to their destination.  The development of this type of short haul service will enhance the prospects of Shannon Airport and the prospects of people actually disembarking and embarking at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary in his contribution referred to the need for regular and fundamental reviews of the company's operations both in the company itself and in consultation with the Department of Industry and Energy and other Departments. These reviews take place on a regular basis.  It is fair to say in the light of what I said earlier about the three-year reviews which take place in the Oireachtas that the company is open to scrutiny in a very welcome and clear way. Oireachtas Members have the right to discuss State companies in the House where it matters.  In regard to SFADCo, this review does take place both at a professional and staff level.  In addition, every facility is given to Members in the House to review its activities on a periodic basis.  Any question of the spread or increase of the company's regional responsibility would be examined very rigidly.  Senator O'Leary's remarks were very interesting and will certainly be borne in mind.  There is no intention at this point of extending the territorial responsibility of SFADCo and I would not like to build up hopes in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith made a number of points to which I would like to refer.  He made a plea for decentralisation and the <Col N="1228" /> need to remove power from Dublin.  We can all agree that there is a need for decentralisation.  It is fair to say that the existence of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is a reflection of the wish in this House and the Government for decentralisation.  The success of SFADCo is also a reflection of the success that can be made in industry outside Dublin.  Dublin is becoming over-populated. Its traffic problems are increasing year after year.  This will make it very attractive for industry not to locate in Dublin but to locate in other areas.</P>
    <P>It must be said that the preferential treatment which SFADCo has in regard to Shannon must be a very attractive incentive for industry to locate in the area.  Its record in job-creation and industrial creation is something that has been acknowledged in the House and is an indication that Shannon is an attractive industrial location.  The Industrial Development Authority have taken serious steps to regionalise their activities in particular in regard to their small industrial operations.  They have been regionalised in a very professional way.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the Senator in regard to the importance of local and community involvement.  This is what SFADCo is all about and has been very successful in promoting.  It was very encouraging to hear Senator Smith's remarks about the success of the rural industrial co-operative.  Regarding food imports, I am glad to say that SFADCo is developing a major initiative in high quality, high value-added food products. This is one of the company's greatest challenges and I look forward to developments in this regard and the plans which they have on hand to develop a food centre.  It is something that the House and the Industrial Development Authority would welcome.</P>

      <P>Senator Hillery referred to industrial strategy.  I am sure the Senator is aware that a White Paper on industrial policy is in the course of preparation and, hopefully, will be published shortly.  That would be a more appropriate document on which to have a broader discourse on industrial strategy. I am sure that the House will have an opportunity of discussing the White Paper when it is published.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald can be assured that Offaly will be given attention.  Since SFADCo took over <i>de facto</i> responsibility for south and south-west Offaly, they have been very successful in promoting small industry in the area.  The question raised by Senator McDonald of guaranteeing company loans rather than grants will be covered in the White Paper.  I think the Senator will see some developments in that area.</P>
      <P>Senator Hourigan raised a question on the scope for development of small industry. This matter is receiving constant attention by SFADCo, the Department and by the IDA.  SFADCo is not in any way complacent about the potential for small industrial development in the area. SFADCo's track record on the development of small industries is impressive by any standards.  This has also been emphasised by Senator Hillery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Senator Lanigan's contribution <Col N="1230" /> and the relationship between State agencies, the best way to organise the activities of these agencies has been and is a matter of concern.  It is being closely examined and will be addressed in the White Paper.  His suggestion about a national resource agency will be fully taken into account.  I am sure there is merit in what the Senator has suggested but there is also a need in discussing these matters not to create a monolith and not to remove local powers to a national organisation.  We must be careful in this area.  We must be careful when we are discussing the need for a national resource agancy that it would not be creating another Dublin-based monolith which we would not like to see, given the success of the agencies that are based around the country.</P>

I appreciate that it might be a desirable development.  Perhaps when funds are more readily available or generated from the Dublin retail outlet the board could review its position and make a decision to establish in Limerick.  I am not sure if the development is in the granary rather than in the industrial estate.</P>

      <P>Last night I was attempting to assess the significance of the brief intervention made by the Minister for Justice on Report Stage.  I am glad to welcome the Minister back in the House for the resumption of the debate. The reason I think it is important to try to assess the significance of the intervention is that the Minister for Justice repeated again what is clearly his grave concern at the inadequacy of the wording of the amendment as it exists.  During Committee Stage debate in this House the Minister referred to this question of balancing the rights of the pregnant woman and the foetus, the fertilised ovum or the unborn at whatever stage is being considered, whether it is a possible threat to the pregnant woman and some choice must be made between the woman and the unborn.  The passage where the <Col N="1232" /> Minister intervened on Committee Stage on this point is in Volume 100, No. 9, column 955.  It is worth referring to that passage because it shows the important issue which the Minister raised then and came back to last night on Report Stage. The Minister said:</P>
      <P>On the question of balancing the rights of mother and child, there is the right to life of the citizen in the Constitution and obviously that includes mothers as well as other citizens but, again, if we simply had a statement giving a right to life to the unborn child and did not attempt to allow for current medical practice by some form of subsequent or subsidiary phrase, we would be leaving it open to the courts to balance the existing right of the citizen in the Constitution with the new right which we would be giving to the unborn child.  Maybe that would be a way of doing it but we would not be establishing a situation where the Supreme Court would not have a major role.  We would be saying we will put a right to life of the unborn child into the Constitution, that a right to life of all citizens exists already and that in cases &mdash; as at times in current medical practice &mdash; where there appears to be a conflict, it would be up to the courts to decide.  I felt I needed to make a comment on those points because while what the Senator says is interesting, for those reasons it does not help the situation, and I would not advise an amendment along those lines should go back to the Dáil.  I doubt that it would have the prospect of acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the way in which the Minister raised this issue on Committee Stage. Then last night he came back to it in the unusual situation, almost a role reversal as I was saying last night, when he continues, as indeed I do and those other Members who are still participating in this debate do, to ask the question what the risks to pregnant women will be in a situation where the Constitution confers a constitutional right and does so in the language and in the manner of creating an equality of rights and indicates and <Col N="1233" /> allows on the face of it no preference to either in case of conflict.</P>
    <P>I understand from the intervention of the Minister, on Report Stage, that he is concerned to highlight this grave omission, this grave problem with the existing text.  Senator O'Leary on Committee Stage also drew attention to this problem. He asked what he called the sponsors of this amendment, the Fianna Fáil Party, to explain why they would not accept the addition of some formulation to the effect that where there was a definite threat to the life of a pregnant woman that medical steps could be taken and any steps taken would not be unlawful, would not be in breach of a constitutional right and would not be contrary to the Constitution and law of the State.  This concern for women and for the risks inherent in this amendment, in so far as it may affect pregnant women, has also been expressed publicly by the Taoiseach.  He has drawn attention to this and he says he will make a public statement when the Bill has been passed by both Houses and he will warn of the risk in this amendment to the lives of pregnant women.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, in a contribution during the debate in this House, said that she believes this wording is dangerous and she will advise that it be rejected if it goes to a referendum.  We have very clear and very concerned statements by the highest political authorities in our system on this issue, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs warning us that this text is dangerous to the lives of pregnant women. When I went home last night I reflected further on the matter.  It occurs to me that there is a kind of analogy, it is like the Government warning on cigarette packets.  It says that cigarette smoking is dangerous for your health.  Will there be some Government warning on the ballot paper if this goes to a referendum?</P>
    <P>This proposal places at risk the lives of certain pregnant women.  The mind boggles. Surely it is in the public interest that we take more time to consider this.  Let it go back to the other House and there will be a proper debate on the extent and <Col N="1234" /> scope of that risk to pregnant women. Surely it is not a situation, even at this very late stage, where the stance is that of abstaining, because there has been enough talk about this it has to go to the people, it is an uncomfortable political situation, it is the mood that prevails in the Fine Gael Party.  It is simply incredible and the deepest insult that I know to women that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs would draw attention to the fact that this text is dangerous and poses risks to pregnant women and yet that they would not use every resource of our parliamentary process in order to ensure that further time and consideration was given to the text before it was the one submitted to the people.</P>
    <P>On the wording of the text as it stands there is no preference given to pregnant women in a situation where a choice has to be made between the lives in that life threatening situation which occurs.  The purpose of this amendment on Report Stage is to give a prior right, which is current medical practice here.  That is what the Minister is referring to.  In his contribution on Committee Stage the acting leader of the House, Senator O'Leary, invited new thinking.  He asked us to come forward with possible alternatives to improve the situation and not simply put forward the amendment which Fine Gael had put forward in the Dáil which had been rejected.</P>
    <P>This is the second new thinking on this that has come forward on Report Stage in the House.  It is not too late at this stage for the warnings which are given at the highest level by the Taoiseach, the Minister of Justice and the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs to be carried through into action, as Senator Bulbulia said.  It is part of her philosophy that if she believes in something, if she states it, then her actions follow her words.  I thought she said this with great simplicity and great authority in her contribution on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>It is not too late to have an influence and to make a constructive contribution in this debate because, as was pointed out yesterday, by Senator Higgins in particular, <Col N="1235" /> the medical profession are broadening and deepening their awareness of the difficulties.  There were some members of the medical profession who from the very beginning pointed to the difficulties and dangers in this proposed text. The wheels of every establishment structure in Ireland move slowly.  It is only now that some very senior members of the medical profession have been alerted, are becoming aware, are writing letters to the papers and are calling meetings to consider the implications.  Many of us might say they should have done it a year ago.  They should have woken up.  They have the expertise.  They know the problems and the practical difficulties.  Their contribution would have been more helpful if they had intervened at an earlier stage but that is precisely what I understand the balances in our legislative system to be.  The whole purpose of having a second run of legislation right through its five Stages in the Upper House &mdash; it having passed through the other House &mdash; is so that it can act as a means of public information and education so that those who are in a position to make a contribution in the media or in the public forum because they have some expertise &mdash; of course the medical profession have &mdash; can do so.  There is no rush about this. Nobody has been able to put forward any credible reason why we have to dash into setting a date for a referendum.</P>
    <P>In view of the very strong disquiet that must be felt by any reasonable citizen when such authoritative voices point to the risks to life implied in this proposed text there is a very direct responsibility and challenge to us in the Seanad to consider the matter carefully.  This was something on which I dwelt at considerable length on Second Stage and I do not intend to dwell on it at great length now. It is not too late, the subject is not a boring one, it is about life-death chances in certain instances and about how we effect the change.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his contribution last night, looked across at the Fianna Fáil benches and asked whether, at this late stage, some explanation could be given as to why the sponsors of the constitutional <Col N="1236" /> amendment will not accept some formulation to clarify and to avoid this risk to the lives of pregnant women. There was an attempt to answer some of those questions on Committee Stage from the Fianna Fáil benches, particularly in the contribution made by Senator Eoin Ryan.  I want to refer to the two brief passages in his contribution where he attempted to meet some of these problems. We are now on Report Stage and, in my submission, the problem is still as acute and difficult as it was and no answer has been provided.  We are not reassured at all.  On the contrary, I am all the more alarmed that somebody who is as senior in the legal profession as Senator Eoin Ryan can brush aside the difficulties that have been raised and repeated in the contribution by the Minister last night.  I refer to the contribution by Senator Eoin Ryan, reported in the Seanad Official Report, Volume 100, No. 9, column 990. He dealt first of all with the scope of the concept of the unborn and then afterwards with the balancing of rights.  Both passages are relevant to the amendment we are considering.  Senator Eoin Ryan said:</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raised a second aspect of this which, of course, is a much more substantial one, what does &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; mean, at what stage would the child have to be to be &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; to be covered by this amendment.  That is certainly a very important point but it is so complicated that it would be quite impossible to define it in such a way that no doubt would be left.  It would be necessary to put some sort of medical dissertation into the Constitution to deal with this matter, to put the pros and cons and to finally come down.  Of course, that is clearly quite impracticable. What has to be done is to put in a word and allow the Supreme Court &mdash; if the matter ever arises &mdash; to interpret that in the light of medical, moral and legal opinion at the time, to have regard to the climate of public opinion. If the point arises as to exactly what stage the foetus is covered by this then they may have to interpret it.  There is nothing wrong with allowing that kind <Col N="1237" /> of interpretation to the Supreme Court.  That is one of the very useful things the Supreme Court does, to interpret Articles of the Constitution as time goes on, having regard to the climate of public opinion, medical views and developments at a particular time.  It is a very proper function for the Supreme Court to define what exactly that means in the light of opinion, legal and other opinion, at a particular time.  That is the only way to approach this matter.  If we did attempt to put in a medical definition into the Constitution it is quite possible that in a relatively short time further views and opinions would become acceptable which would mean that the definition in the Constitution would no longer be valid.</P>
    <P>There are several different ways in which that is a most interesting contribution. First of all, Senator Ryan admits that the text is not clear as to the point at which we are conferring the constitutional right oh the unborn.  He says that it may vary from time to time.  That is very interesting because, in fact, that could be an indication that if public opinion were in favour of legalised abortion the Supreme Court should interpret the point in time as being a much later one.  I have not seen many other interpretations of a similar kind put on this by spokespersons on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  I do not know whether this is the authoritative interpretation of the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad, that the interpretation of the Supreme Court should vary in the light of public opinion. I had thought the whole idea was to stop any possibility of a varying definition in the light of public opinion, that the whole philosophy and approach was to halt any possibility of a development in public opinion along those lines.  And yet this is what Senator Eoin Ryan appears to be suggesting and stating clearly in that passage.</P>
    <P>One would get the impression from the reference made to the Supreme Court that somehow the Supreme Court would be there in the maternity hospital sitting beside the doctor able to give an answer. Senator Ryan knows as well or for longer <Col N="1238" /> than I how long it takes to get a case to the High Court and then on to the Supreme Court.  Even if it is done with the greatest urgency by way of some sort of injunctive relief it is a matter that would certainly take weeks.  If it is a normal declaratory action it would take years.  Therefore, in this situation where we are pointing to grave risk to the life of pregnant women it is no consolation to the woman on the line or no help to the doctor trying to remain within the law &mdash; which, presumably, doctors like every other citizen are required to do &mdash; to know that somewhere, sometime somebody might be able to mount a long and complicated case that would go to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I thought the whole purpose and thrust of the amendment was to take this out of the realm of the unpredictable Supreme Court.  There was a great deal of Supreme Court knocking in the lead up to the urgency and need for this constitutional amendment.  In so far as there are some attempts to answer they confirm the wide gaps in our understanding of this amendment. They confirm that the dangers that have been pointed out are not only present but are real in seeking to understand the scope of the present text.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the second passage in the contribution by Senator Eoin Ryan where he refers to the problem of balancing between the constitutional rights, the constitutional right which we are proposing to confer on the unborn at some stage in the cycle and the constitutional right to life of the woman as a citizen, the existing constitutional right.  In his contribution he referred to the questions posed by Senator Higgins to define what exactly the position would be in various medical situations in which the life of the mother and the life of the child would be in jeopardy.  At column 991 he said:</P>
    <P>I am going to attempt to give an answer to that.  I am not answering it because I have any pretensions to any medical expertise, but I am going to give an answer on the basis that I can at least, like Senator O'Leary, express a legal opinion which, of course, could be wrong.  Senator O'Leary said that <Col N="1239" /> he could be wrong.  I accept that I could be wrong.  I would also like to mention that the Attorney General could be wrong and the Director of Public Prosecutions could be wrong.  Legal opinions are merely opinions.  In these very complicated medical situations which were brought before us, the position will be, if this amendment is passed, exactly what it is at present.  No change will be made in the law by this amendment. This is an amendment of the Constitution.  It will not <i>per se</i> make any change in the law.  The law which will be applicable to this kind of situation is the law under the 1861 Act which exists at present and which, presumably, will be there in the future until such time as some other law takes its place, and in that case the Constitution will ensure that that new law will be similar, basically, to that which is there at present.  So the answer to these complicated questions that are asked about medical situations is that what has been permitted up to now will be permitted in the future.  There will be no change.  The purpose of this Bill is not to change the law, to do the exact opposite: it is to ensure that the law will not be changed in such a way as to allow abortion in the future.</P>
    <P>That is where I disagree fundamentally but, obviously with respect for a colleague, with Senator Eoin Ryan.</P>
    <P>This amendment will necessarily change the law and the position.  It will not affect the criminal law except to confer a constitutional right on an entity, on the unborn.  That is a very substantial change.  Legally that is a very specific, concrete, important, practical change. We are conferring a constitutional right, we are not sure just exactly when it is going to date in the fertility cycle of reproduction, but we are conferring it. Once a constitutional right has been conferred then, as the amendment itself says, the State must endeavour to defend and vindicate it.  It is a right which can be asserted in our courts.  Because the fertilised ovum, or the embryos, cannot assert that right, it can be asserted by a <Col N="1240" /> third party on behalf of the addressee of the right, the beneficiary of the right. There is by necessary consequence of having a written Constitution, of having a whole jurisprudence on the protection of rights under the Constitution, a change from the pre-existing position. The conferring of a constitutional right on the unborn may well change the interpretation of the 1861 Act.  It may well be that there could be a challenge to the 1861 Act on the grounds that it was in some way incompatible with the constitutional amendment so that the law is changed significantly in a number of ways but in particular by the fact that we create beneficiaries of constitutional rights.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has stated quite clearly in, for example, the case Byrne v. Ireland in 1972 &mdash; when Kathleen Byrne brought an action against the people of Ireland and succeeded in recovering damages for injury caused to her &mdash; that for every constitutional right there is a remedy.  There is the possibility of asserting that right and the courts will be open to the assertion of that right.  We are not doing something abstract and illegal by stating that we are going to confer a constitutional right to life on an entity.  We may be doing something very vague and hard to determine.  Nonetheless the legal position is that the entity on whom we have conferred that constitutional right has a constitutional right to life and therefore has the right to have that right asserted in court, has the right to have that right defended and vindicated as far as practicable, and has the right to have that right given equality with the right of the pregnant woman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Na mbeo gan breith. That is a very serious situation indeed. As Senator Higgins in his contribution last night made clear, unsatisfactory as the English text is, the Irish text is less satisfactory, is less clear and more open to posing a very real and serious threat to the life of a pregnant woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am back to the problem on which I reflected overnight and came up with this analogy of the cigarette packet.  We <Col N="1241" /> have a very clear warning on cigarette packets that smoking is dangerous, no equivocation of maybe, smoking is dangerous to health.  The only honourable stance for the Minister for Justice would be to seek to ensure that the ballot papers which we will be discussing in the next Bill will carry a Government warning that this amendment is one which will endanger the lives of certain pregnant women.  If that message is not got across there is a danger that a very significant number of people who do not like the whole debate about this amendment, who are alarmed and depressed at how divisive it has been, will say they will not vote for this amendment because they do not like, for various levels of reasons, the way in which it has been brought forward, the tactics used and the unnecessary taking up of parliamentary time.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to make sure that the message gets across that they should not abstain on this issue, that there is a very specific concrete reason why they should vote against, why all women in Ireland should vote against this measure, because it poses a direct risk to certain pregnant women.  Whatever about the distance that male politicians can put between themselves and that reality &mdash; I do not suggest for one moment that all male politicians, or the majority of them can distance themselves &mdash; it is important for women to stand together on this and realise the very real risk which is one that their attention is being focused on by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, that it poses a risk because it does not in its wording specify that in a situation where there is a life-threatening problem, either the life of the mother or the life of the unborn, where the choice must be made between them, there is any preference or guidance on any preference.  There is nobody to say in those circumstances that it would be lawful to exercise a choice between the constitutional rights which have been given a status of equality.  That is why this one word amendment is, in fact, a significant improvement on that situation.  Certainly, I have no objection at all to recognising a constitutional right of the unborn <Col N="1242" /> but I believe it must be one which is not going to pose serious risk to the very life of a pregnant woman which this text poses.  That is one of the most serious criticisms of the constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the insult posed to women by the fact that we could have a measure to amend our Constitution which poses risks to the life of certain pregnant women, we are so close to the debate now and have had so much of it, that it is difficult to stand back from it and see the awful reality of how the proposal, and the blackmailing pressures that were brought to bear, have led to this sorry pass.  For observers outside the country, people in Northern Ireland, for people who know Ireland well but are viewing it from a certain distance, it must be very difficult to try to understand how any Government, even in present difficulties, could possibly allow a text to go through a House where it could be defeated and delayed, which poses a serious potential threat to pregnant women.  I suppose the reality is that it is part of our Irish way of doing things.</P>
    <P>Up to two years ago when this movement for a constitutional amendment started we did not concern ourselves once in this House with the reality of the problem on the ground, with the serious social problems, loneliness, guilt, distress, economic pressures, housing pressures and emotional pressures on women.  We still are not really concerning ourselves with the front line problems in these areas.  It is only another dimension that we are prepared to take a risk in relation to the very life of certain pregnant women.  I only draw attention to it because I do not know any other way of expressing my total disgust with the possibility that a political party who have the voting strength to delay and have further discussion on this measure would adopt a stance of abstaining.  I have to say that it really does pass comprehension.</P>
    <P>Just as I have already expressed the view that this whole debate has been, and will continue to be, very counterproductive. I believe it has in a way that was unthought of a few years ago made the whole discussion of abortion not only <Col N="1243" /> respectable but widespread so that it is much more likely to spring to the front of the mind of any woman or girl who finds herself pregnant and is in difficulty as to how to cope with that pregnancy. It is more likely now that not only will the option of terminating through abortion occur to such a woman or a girl, but that she will know where to go to find a clinic or doctor to terminate the pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Once the risks of this constitutional amendment are fully understood by the medical profession, if this amendment is carried, we might also see a possibility that pregnant women would go abroad to have their children.  It is possible that pregnant women would say: I am not going to be in a situation where, in a choice, I am at risk as to how the doctor is going to interpret this vague provision. It may be that husbands will say that they would not like their wives to be placed in this situation of serious risk.  I repeat, it may well be that it will remain a point of fundamental difference between the interpretation I place on this and the interpretation Senator Eoin Ryan placed on it on Committee Stage and may seek to do on a later stage in the debate this afternoon, that there is no doubt at all in my mind that if we are conferring a constitutional right on an entity, however we define or say how the right becomes real and is conferred on the beneficiary, on that entity, on the unborn, once we confer that right that has changed the position, that itself has changed the law. There is no need for legislation after that. That is a right which the courts must uphold.  That is a right which the courts must recognise.  That is a right that can be asserted and which will be protected by our courts.  It must also be defended and vindicated by our Legislature and by every law abiding citizen in the State. That right has been placed on a footing of equality with the right of the woman.</P>
    <P>The value of the Committee and Report Stage debates in the House, and the amendments put down and discussed, must be to publicise as widely as possible the very serious questions that have been raised by Senators, the very serious question <Col N="1244" /> which the Minister posed last night as to why the proposals of this constitutional amendment will not allow that doubt and that worry of the risk to pregnant women to be removed.  The message must go forth from this Chamber and, hopefully, will be carried into any constitutional referendum debate that there may be that this is not an abstract issue. The amendment is not only unsatisfactory for all the reasons people had thought but also poses a serious risk to certain pregnant women and, therefore, must be rejected.  We can still hope that the people will save us from our politicians and that they at least will have had the time to become alert to all the difficulties, apart from all the political price that we would pay for decades if this amendment becomes part of our law.  We know we will pay that price.  We will pay that price on the 30th of this month when the Forum comes together for the first time.  We will pay it for decades when anybody wishes to put forward progressive social legislation or to open up ideas here.  We will wear it around our necks like an albatross but, nevertheless, this debate, and the amendments put down, will have helped to clarify and to focus on the dangers which more and more leaders of opinion, including medical opinion, are drawing attention to.  For that alone the time we have taken has been very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I still have some hope, given the reasonable and modest approach of Senator O'Leary, acting leader of the Fine Gael group, on Committee Stage that there may have been a change of mind, a change of heart, a change of attitude. There is no doubt that Senator O'Leary shares with me the worry I have.  I gathered that from his contribution on Committee Stage.  I hope I am as modest as he and can admit that I too can be wrong. Nevertheless, there is no doubt at all that the conferring of a constitutional right changes the law and changes the responses of the courts and the responses of the medical profession in coping with pregnant women, coping with difficult problems of choosing between the life of the pregnant woman and the life of the unborn.  Therefore, at the very least this <Col N="1245" /> constitutional text should carry a Government warning that it is dangerous to certain pregnant women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to contribute again to this debate.  I spoke on Second Stage and I indicated my support for the proposal to amend the Constitution. I stated that I believed that such an amendment was necessary in order to guarantee the right to life of the unborn. I outlined why I felt such an amendment was necessary and I stated I was quite happy with the proposed wording.  At the outset I should like to say that nothing I have heard or read since has altered my views in any way.  Having listened to or read most of what was said on Committee Stage, and listened to the debate yesterday, I decided to make a brief contribution today.  I am not a lawyer nor have I any medical qualification or expertise.  I am certainly not a theologian.  Furthermore, I know I cannot express myself as articulately as the Senators who have dominated this Stage of the debate.  Why then do I feel I should become involved in the discussion again?  It is because I want to express, and put on record, my views as a lay person, and as a public representative in relation to two points in the proposed wording which have been raised repeatedly during the debate. Again and again the meaning of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; has been questioned.  I believe very few words are absolutely precise in their meaning.  The meaning of any word is determined by the context in which it is used and by the generally or publicly accepted meaning of the word when it is used in that context.  I am satisfied that the meaning of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is not in any way ambiguous in the context of the proposed amendment wording.  In fact, its meaning is very clear.  It means the new life that exists within the mother during pregnancy.  It cannot mean anything else.  I am satisfied that it is the ideal word to be used in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Higgins said that the originators of the word were the moral majority in the United States.  I am not worried where the word came from as long as it suits the purpose for which it is required and <Col N="1246" /> the context in which it is used.  Some Senators made the point that &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is an adjective and should be used to qualify a noun.  This would be a very good point to make if we were students writing grammatical notes on the wording for the leaving certificate or some other examination. However, I believe that to use any noun with the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; would raise more problems than it would solve. For example, it was suggested that to insert &ldquo;child&rdquo;, &ldquo;person&rdquo; or &ldquo;human being&rdquo; after &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; would improve the wording or make it more correct or precise.  The question could then be raised what would be the position of a mother who was expecting twins, triplets or quads or even Siamese twins.  In my view the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; on its own embraces all new life irrespective of whether that new life is a single foetus or twins or any number of foetuses.  There is nobody in this country who is not quite clear on what &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; means in the context of the proposed wording.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is in the connection with the expression or the phrase &ldquo;the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo; in the wording.  To refer to the equal right to life of the mother is not the same as saying that the mother and the unborn baby or, as Senator Robinson said, the fertilised ovum, are equal.  We are not discussing the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; in a mathematical sense.  We are not talking about two triangles, yet Senator Robinson set out in the best Euclidian style to prove that &ldquo;the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo; will make the 25-or 35-year-old mother and the fertilised ovum equal, as Euclid would say, in every respect.  The only thing she left out was the QED at the end.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the phrase &ldquo;equal right to life&rdquo; could be construed as meaning any such thing.  If we look at the right to life of the citizen which is guaranteed in the Constitution we can say in the same way that all citizens have an equal right to life, yet a situation can arise where the right to life of citizen A is seriously threatened or put at grave risk by citizen B. Citizen A in order to preserve or safeguard his right to life causes citizen B to die.  I submit that there are many such <Col N="1247" /> situations in which we would have to agree that no guilt attaches to citizen A because citizen B died, and yet the right to life of each was equal.  This is why I do not accept that the phrase &ldquo;the right to life of the mother&rdquo; means what Senator Robinson says it means, or that its inclusion in the Constitution will have the effect of interfering in any way with existing medical practices or procedures in the treatment of pregnant women.  I am not saying that Senators should not be raising these points or asking these questions or looking for as much clarification as possible on these matters, but I am satisfied it would be possible to do the same thing with the wording of any other Article of the Constitution as Senators are doing with the proposed amendment wording.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal that the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; should be substituted for the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; in the wording I am convinced that such a change would facilitate the introduction of limited abortion into this country and so I am opposed to any such change.  I make these points to put on record why I as a lay person and a public representative will have no difficulty in supporting and recommending support for the proposed wording.</P>

      <P>I will be brief.  During the course of this debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas and on a larger scale outside we have heard many people say that they, were against the amendment and yet they were not in favour of abortion, and I accept that as genuine.  However, I would like to know if anyone is in favour of legalised abortion.  I believe that somebody somewhere feels sincerely that abortion should be legalised, that people who go abroad to have abortions should be facilitated at home and there would be no danger to the morals of the rest of the people in providing for that, but nobody has stood up to say so. Instead they say that society with its moral and social pressures is to blame for those abortions, but I do not accept that. Ambition or selfishness may be involved, practical reasons or sensible reasons may be offered, but I do not accept that the <Col N="1248" /> guilt, blame or responsibility can be offloaded on society in this way.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuinness referred to pronouncements of some medical men who were Protestants and she said they did not represent the voice of the Protestant Church.  Without being critical I want to state that I find difficulty in deciding what is the unified voice of the Protestant Church.  The Senator also said that the courts would be concerned with interpreting the wording of this amendment and not with the contributions of Senators. The Senator is a noted lawyer and what she says must be so, and yet I have read of a case where the judge quoted a contribution in this Seanad in deciding a case.</P>
      <P>I regret very much the unfair attack on Senator Higgins.  I would say in passing, not as a justification but as an excuse, that we can all be carried away if we feel very deeply about something.  I am sure Senator Higgins will understand this and his shoulders are big enough to carry it and to be forgiving.  Senator Robinson referred to sectarianism.  She gave it more meaning than I would.  She referred to it as the views of one Church.  It is generally accepted that the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; includes an element of bigotry and bigoted denominationalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not contradicting the Senator, I am simply saying that in my view the normal meaning that is taken from the word &ldquo;sectarian&rdquo; is bigoted denominationalism.  There is nothing sectarian in this, and I have stated that before now.  It is a question of human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan also referred to not knowing for certain.  There is only one thing that we are all absolutely certain about.  We cannot be absolutely certain about anything else but we can have reasonable certainty.  Senator Robinson said that questions are being asked and are not being answered.  They are being answered and they have been answered <Col N="1249" /> to my satisfaction.  She also spoke in glowing terms about the university Senators and she was entitled to enthuse about them, but I feel she was unfair to others.  All of them who spoke have made a very important contribution to the debate and I would describe them, in the phrase of Charles Dickins, in the superlative degree of comparison only.  In my experience on housing schemes and in various situations often somebody who is doing the most menial task comes up with the solution, not the intellectuals.  When this goes to the people they will be well able to assess the situation and they know what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson expressed concern about equating the fertilised ovum to a woman.  My understanding of the matter is that the same applies to the aged and the senile.  The Senator also referred to the substantial natural wastage in lost fertilised ova.  I have no answer for this apparent problem in nature.  I cannot talk about a useful productive factor because the aged and senile would have to be considered under this category, but when the Senator referred to risks to mothers and deaths she was unfair to doctors and to the medical profession.  I am satisfied from what the medical experts say that the risks which the Senator talks about are not there.  When Senator Robinson says she is not reassured but more alarmed by what Senator Eoin Ryan has stated, I cannot attempt to make any meaningful contribution in that area.  We have a notice on cigarette packets to the effect that smoking can injure health. Childbirth can be dangerous to health.  I hope it will not be considered facetious of me if I say that sex can seriously damage your health.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; has come up repeatedly here and I define it exactly as I understand it.  The Constitution deals with people.  That is clear.  I did state that &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; was an adjective qualifying a noun.  What is the noun?  Is it babe, baby, child, being or human being?  I said that the noun was left out for some obvious and sound reason.  The &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; refers to the gestation period of the human being.  This period ends at birth.  When <Col N="1250" /> does it begin?  I have asked before now when is this new life switched on?  A new life is switched on at the moment of fertilisation, in other words at the time the female ovum is fertilised by the male sperm.  This is a scientific fact and nobody on the other side of the House has proved that it is not a scientific fact.  This gestation period lasts normally for 266 days. This question is being put to me, and rightly so, to answer as I understand it and I am doing that.  The question is: do I consider it wrong to do something that would terminate this life at the stage between fertilisation and implantation? I must answer honestly, yes, I believe, it is morally wrong.</P>

      <P>I want to be clear on this because this is important.  I am prepared to state exactly what I understand. From the moment of fertilisation it is morally wrong to interfere with that life. The legal question is quite different.  I have been reassured that existing practice will not be affected by this amendment. I am so assured by experts and I am quite satisfied about that.</P>
      <P>The question was asked did the husband want to stand there and see his wife killed.  These are emotional terms and I do not think that this situation would arise.  Indeed, it is a reflection on doctors and on the medical world even to suggest that this situation could arise.  This referendum is not about contraception.  It is simply to ensure that abortion will not be legalised in the future except by a vote of the people.  Finally, when all this smoke is blown away we will not see the monster that all the Senators on the other side have told us about.  What is on the other side is a helpless, unborn baby.  All we are trying to do here is to give the constitutional right which at the moment is enjoyed by the citizen to the human being for all of the period from the moment of fertilisation to birth.  I see no reason why the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; should be deleted and substituted by the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; as in this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very refreshing to hear Senator Fitzsimons talk because it is quite obvious that his contributions are his own, are carefully prepared and he has made a really excellent contribution to this debate.  He is prepared to put his thinking on the line and to express what he believes in.  I disagree with him in about 95 per cent of what he says, but that is the way it goes.  He has quite clearly raised the moral question of the effect on fertilised ova of this suggested amendment, but he has failed really to distinguish between the moral situation and the legal position.  You cannot just get rid of the problem by saying that there will be no change in the present practice. That is the result rather than the means to the result.  You cannot jump from an examination of the text before us to that conclusion without going through the intermediate process which I honestly feel that he has not gone through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment before us this amendment has not been argued by the proposer in the detail which I would expect for such an amendment.  It is not sufficient for the proposer to promise to deal with points that will arise at the conclusion, because the conclusion is the conclusion and nobody else has an opportunity of expressing a viewpoint at that stage.  I contrast the way in which the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; has been generally referred <Col N="1253" /> to but not subjected to detailed analysis in the way each and every other word has been subjected to analysis here, and the contrast is quite startling.  If you say you are in favour of putting a new word in, well then it is only right and proper that you should subject that new word to the same degree of critical analysis to which you subjected the word it is replacing and the other words within the amendment itself.  That has signally failed to be done. Those who contributed have failed totally to examine and to say what they think. They have stated what they do not mean by &ldquo;equal&rdquo; or what they think &ldquo;equal&rdquo; might mean, but they have not examined properly what positively they think the new wording with the insertion of the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; and the deletion of the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; would mean.  The problems that that would create have not been fully learned.</P>
    <P>Establishing a two-tier structure in the Constitution &mdash; unconnected as it would be with this amendment taken on its own or with any definition of the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;&mdash; would create an imbalance which would be unacceptable in the other direction.  It is not only a question of what one does if there is an unborn person, child, foetus, and the mother is in a life-threatened situation.  There is no point in not recognising the reality, and there are a number of other situations in which the balance between doing something or not doing something is very fine.  Present practice is that if there is an overwhelming necessity to preserve the life of the mother that is done and it is right that it should be done.  The introduction of the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; would substantially change that balance.  For those who would not support this amendment it is reasonable to pose to those who are supporting it that, as was demanded of the original wording by Senator Higgins on Committee Stage and repeated by Senator Robinson on Report Stage, they would have subjected this word to the same kind of certainty that they demanded of the other side.  That has not been done because it opens up a whole Pandora's Box of what the prior right of the mother is.  It does change the existing situation <Col N="1254" /> substantially.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in those circumstances it is reasonable to say that no reasonable person, irrespective of his or her view on the amendment itself, could be satisfied that the substitution of the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; and the deletion of the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; would not change substantially the existing law and the existing practice.  Since what I would broadly seek to do is to maintain the existing practice, whether the other amendment does it is a different question. We have already examined that point.</P>
    <P>With regard to this particular amendment to the amendment, the case has not been made that the balance would be substantially disturbed and the existing law would be fundamentally changed.  I understand the frustration of those who seek to insert the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;equal&rdquo; but it is going much too far without the kind of analysis and examination which were demanded and not received partly because there was no attempt to do it and partly because the certainty with which it was being demanded was impossible to deliver anyway.  This substitution admits the high standards set of such amendments by those who support the use of the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo;.  To a certain extent, those who support that have failed to discharge the obligation which they impose on themselves.  That is a reasonable position and in those circumstances I could not support the substitution of the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; because without subjecting it to the most detailed public examination here and from the examination I have made I have reached the conclusion, be it right or wrong, that in doing so I would fundamentally change the present situation and the present practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to Senator Robinson, in the present situation the dividing lines between where intervention and termination of a pregnancy takes place and where it does not take place is a matter of judgment and that point of intervention would be substantially changed by the introduction of the word <Col N="1255" />&ldquo;prior&rdquo; and the elimination of the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; because a more remote possibility of danger to the life of the mother would demand and be expected to receive protection.  Basically I believe that the balance which exists at present and which is satisfactory would be changed in such a way as to change substantially the present situation in an indefinite way which would be almost incapable of definition.  Over a period of time that prior right to life of the mother would grow into a right and a practice which would be far more widespread and far more all-embracing than the present situation.  That is what would happen. There is no doubt about it.</P>
      <P>There is also the point as to the quality of life and the health of the mother which would not be specifically life threatening there and then but we do not know whether the health of the mother would be entitled to be taken into consideration. If we did that we would change the law in a very fundamental way, and in a way in which I do not want to change it and it would not have my support.</P>
      <P>It was interesting to hear what the Minister had to say yesterday.  My understanding of it was a little different from that of Senator Robinson.  I did not understand the Minister to say that he regarded the present wording as posing a threat to pregnant women.  Other Senators for whom I have tremendous respect have made that suggestion but I did not understand the Minister to say it in the House yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, quite reasonably, called upon the Opposition to recognise that &mdash; this was clearly shown up by Senator Robinson in her quotation on Committee Stage &mdash; they were leaving the interpretation of the present wording to the Supreme Court and that the definition of what a life threatening situation is for the mother will be ultimately for the Supreme Court to decide.  It appears that Fianna Fáil are happy that the court would uphold the established medical practice at present and that is what I would wish them to do.  I do not think we can be certain that that is the case and therein lies the problem.  The Minister's <Col N="1256" /> approach was a little different in that what he was seeking was, if possible, to have a qualifying statement which would simply make it clear that any operations that are necessary to save the life of the expectant mother would not be unlawful. Sometimes in introducing a matter like this, it can be easier and more straightforward to put things in that way, that operations that are necessary to save the life of the expectant mother would not be unlawful.  You can leave the general law there.  I understand that to be the Minister's position.  Generally speaking, the case for this amendment has fallen substantially short of what is necessary to encourage me to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be fairly short because I recognise that this is a debate in which the same questions are being asked and the same answers are being given.  Nobody is satisfied with the answers they are getting but they are the answers.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson said that, far from wasting time, she would be prepared to spend ten years here if her stamina permitted rather than allow the people to vote.  In the early stages of this discussion it was said that the introduction of this amendment showed lack of confidence in the courts and in the Oireachtas.  Nothing I have yet heard in this discussion went anywhere near to expressing the extraordinary lack of confidence in the people which was expressed by Senator Robinson. She would talk for ten years rather than allow the people to express their views on this matter.  That seems to me a quite astonishing lack of confidence in the people and the democratic system. However, if necessary we will go on discussing this again and again, asking the same questions and giving the same answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this amendment in this House, the problem for a lot of people was giving equality to the foetus which was at its very early stage and where it could be argued that it was not a human being, it was so early that it should not have equality with the mother.  That was a problem which had to be given very serious consideration. But we are now talking about <Col N="1257" /> priority, the prior right of the mother, apparently at any stage, during pregnancy of eight or nine months, or even a few days before the child is born because this amendment seeks to give a prior right to the mother, there is no qualification, and it would be a right up to the very day before the child was born.  It seems to be going very far indeed to deny equal rights to a child which had reached that stage. I think by anybody's definition or belief a child who is so near being born would be a human being and should have equal rights with the mother.  It is no longer a question of whether it really was a child, whether it really had a soul, whether it had the full characteristic of a person but would give prior rights to the mother right up to that stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins argued in favour of this amendment by saying that it would remove some of the doubts about the rights of the mother.  It seems to me that it would remove all of the doubts as to the right of the child, because if the welfare of the mother is always to have priority, which of course this says, then it would be no exaggeration to say that the whole constitutional amendment would be quite worthless.  We would be preparing the way for legislation to allow abortion if the physical or mental health of the mother was at risk, psychologically or any other way, that then she must have prior rights.  That is what it must mean. In this respect I think that Senator O'Leary has said something very similar and he must forgive me if I am misrepresenting him.</P>
    <P>If we were to adopt this amendment and give prior rights to the mother then we would be preparing the way for a situation in which any excuse could be given for saying that there must be an abortion because the mother must have prior rights and her health was at risk in some way, mentally or physically.  Of course we would then be so near the situation that exists in many other countries that we would have sold the past, we would have reached the stage when very soon, with a few more moves in that direction, we would have abortion on demand.  You cannot have a situation where you are going to give prior rights <Col N="1258" /> to the mother without saying that the infant has not equal rights and without saying that any case can be made for giving prior rights and, in such circumstances, this amendment would be worthless and the life of the unborn would be very seriously at risk, not perhaps today or tomorrow, but in the future.</P>
    <P>I can see why Senator McGuinness put down this amendment.  I can see her concern for the mother.  I can see why she seeks in some way to protect the mother, to express concern for the mother or to try and arrive at a formula which would ensure that the mother's life would be respected and protected.  But I have to say that if this wording is used &ldquo;prior&rdquo; means more, it means better, it means superior, it does not mean equal because if it meant equal then there would be no necessity or purpose in the amendment. It means superior rights and once you have superior rights then any situation in which the life or health or anything in connection with the mother can be used as a reason for having an abortion.</P>
    <P>The Minister intervened yesterday to express his concern and apprehension in this matter.  Senator O'Leary said that there seems to be some difference of opinion as to what exactly his view was. I was a little uncertain myself.  I understood him to say that an attempt had been made in the other House to introduce some kind of an amendment which would protect not merely the mother but a doctor who is treating the mother so as to save her life.  He asked why it would not be possible to have such an amendment in this Bill.  I do not wish to be contentious but if the Minister were seriously concerned, and if he regarded this as a really serious danger, then he should act and do something about it.  He has the ability in this House, he has the voting strength in this House to introduce an amendment to support the present amendment.  The fact that he does not consider it necessary to do what could be done in this House leads me to assume that although he is expressing a reservation, concern, that he is making a point, he is not unduly apprehensive that the Bill as it stands is going to lead to a dangerous position for women in these <Col N="1259" /> situations.  I must and do give him credit for the fact that if he was so concerned that this was a real danger he would act and do something about it.  Because he has not acted and has not done what he certainly could do in this House, then I can only assume that he thinks it is a good and interesting point, something which should be explored but that he does not really believe that it is going to lead to a dangerous situation for mothers.</P>
    <P>In his intervention he has attempted to shift the responsibility to Fianna Fáil, to shift the responsibility to those whom he describes as the real sponsors of this Bill. I spoke earlier about shifting responsibility, about the extraordinary situation of a Minister putting a Bill through this House, not standing over it and asking another party to accept responsibility for the Bill, but I am quite happy to accept responsibility for this Bill.  I do not see the problem or the danger in the way the Minister does.  I do not agree that the danger which he posed is a real danger. If I did see it in that way and if Fianna Fáil saw it in that way then I can assure you Fianna Fáil would act and would bring in an amendment and would do what they considered necessary to meet this situation.  In so far as responsibility for dealing with the situation is concerned I assure the Minister and the House that Fianna Fáil accept their responsibilities fully in this matter and would introduce any amendments, or attempt to introduce them, that they considered necessary to cater for any danger or defect that exists in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested an amendment to say, as I understand it, that certain actions would not be unlawful, that if a doctor carried out an operation to save the life of a mother it would be written into this Bill and into the Constitution that that particular operation was not unlawful, but how you would define the circumstances in which a doctor might, should or may, carry out such an operation and that it would not be unlawful would, it seems to me, be a very difficult task.  Again, it is a most unusual suggestion to make.  It is most unusual to incorporate in a law, in legislation, the <Col N="1260" /> fact that something shall not be unlawful. I am sure it is not unique.  I cannot think offhand, but it is quite likely that here and there there are sections in Acts to say a particular thing shall not be unlawful, but by and large it is not the normal thing to do.</P>
    <P>The normal law says that certain things shall be unlawful, certain things shall be offences, certain things shall be crimes and it is for the court in each case to decide whether a particular incident or action committed by somebody is contrary to the law, whether in all the circumstances it is breaking the law.  This is obviously the correct way to deal with problems of this kind, to say what the law is, to say what is an offence and allow the courts to decide whether in a particular case the law has been broken.  To approach it from the other point of view, as I say, may not be unique but it certainly would be unusual.  To take one example, the law does not say that if a surgeon has to carry out a very difficult operation in a critical case, and I am not talking about a mother and child, I am talking about a case where somebody is critically ill and that the surgeon decides to operate, to perform some very unusual, very difficult, critical kind of operation and it fails, and as a result of the operation the patient dies, there is no law I know of that says a surgeon may carry out a critical operation and even though it is not successful and the patient dies that it shall not be unlawful for the surgeon to do that.  Of course, no court would dream of finding a surgeon guilty of manslaughter merely because the operation failed, even though it was an operation where the surgeon knew very well that by attempting it he was putting the patient's life in danger, even though it was quite clear that the result of the operation might be the death of the patient.</P>
    <P>There are many other instances &mdash; not even medical &mdash; where people have to make decisions.  A fire chief may send firemen to do things he considers necessary to try to curtail a fire and save lives and his action may result in loss of life. Nobody says that he does anything wrong there.  There is no Act which says that if a fireman takes that kind of decision it <Col N="1261" /> shall not be unlawful.  It may sound a little bit crazy to be giving these instances, but it is no more crazy than the kind of situation where it is suggested that a provision should be written, not only into the law but into the Constitution, that if a doctor in a situation involving a pregnant mother takes a certain action which he thinks in all the circumstances is the right thing to do, that it shall not be an offence if the end result is the death of the foetus.  To try to write this kind of thing into the law or even into the Constitution is quite unnecessary, unreal and to get back to what we spoke about earlier, shows a complete lack of confidence in the courts and in the whole system.</P>
    <P>My view is not shared by some of my colleagues in the Seanad but is, on the other hand, shared by many eminent lawyers. My view is that the constitutional amendment will not lead to any change in the law, that it will merely ensure that the law is not changed.  That is its purpose and that I think will be its effect.  Of course I could be wrong.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson says that the amendment will change the law and that it will make very serious changes in the law.  I do not agree that she is right &mdash; but if she is right then it seems to undermine one of the principal arguments that is being made about this constitutional amendment from the very beginning because most of the brunt of the initial and continuing attack on this amendment was that it was quite unnecessary, that this whole thing was a waste of time, a waste of money and a waste of resources.  It was said we could depend on the courts and on the Oireachtas to protect the unborn child and that the rights of the unborn child were in safe hands, that the whole thing from beginning to end was unnecessary. This, of course, is the nub of this discussion.  Senator Robinson says that this gives new rights to the unborn, that it will effect a very serious change in the rights of the unborn, obviously changes for the better, changes in relation to the mother.  If she is right in saying that, and perhaps she is right, it seems to be quite clear that the right of the unborn up to now was quite uncertain and vague and not what it should be.  If that is so, then <Col N="1262" /> this constitutional amendment is quite obviously very necessary.  If it needed this amendment to change the law to give the unborn the rights that most people think they should have, then the constitutional amendment was necessary.  It confirms my belief that we should have it.  In that situation I am in the position of saying, yes, perhaps I am wrong from the legal point of view but I am certainly right from the point of view of wanting to have this amendment to the Constitution to give rights to the unborn that apparently they did not have up to now.  In this respect you cannot have it both ways. Either it was unnecessary, the unborn was quite safe, or the rights have been changed so as to give the unborn fundamental rights, in which case it was necessary.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I get back to the position of reiterating my belief and the belief of many eminent lawyers that this constitutional amendment will not lead to a change in the law as it is administered on a day-to-day basis.  It will not make any change.  We will have the approach from both the medical point of view and the legal point of view exactly as it was up to now.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins has given us a rather colourful scenario of the kind of things that are going to happen if this amendment is passed.  He has conjured up crises in the operating theatre, of frantic consultations among the medical staff in any given hospital about whether a given case can or cannot be now operated on because of this constitutional amendment. He has talked about appeals to the Western Health Board and all kinds of quite alarming situations, if they are correct. I have to say that there is more than an element of fantasy about some of the situations which Senator Higgins put before us.  I do not believe that there will be that kind of change.</P>
    <P>I believe that the 1861 Act will still be the Act which will apply in these cases, an Act which has been administered and has been in operation for over 100 years. In the kind of situation where a doctor has to decide in a particular case what he should do and what he can do <Col N="1263" /> and what has been successfully done over these years, I believe the law will be administered in future as it has been in the past as far as the legal point of view is concerned.  I believe that medical practices which operated in the past will continue to operate and be applicable in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of medical opinion which is on record as saying they are quite happy that that will be the situation in the future.  There are doctors &mdash; and Senator Higgins quoted a letter from a doctor &mdash; who do not agree.  That is one of the problems in this case, that some lawyers and doctors do not agree about this.  I can only say that I accept the expert view of some of these lawyers and doctors.  I adopt the view that this is not going to make any change from a practical point of view.  I am confident that commonsense will prevail in the future in the operating theatre and in the courts.  My conviction in that regard at an earlier stage has been severely criticised.  Not only have I been criticised but apparently commonsense was given a very low rating in dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>Medical practice is one thing and courts and the law are another thing.  In the application all these laws and all these practices, unless they are complied with and implemented with commonsense they are all worthless.  I consider that in the implementation and the application of these matters commonsense is very important indeed.  It is commonsense that has resulted in the acceptable way in which these matters have been dealt with over the last 100 years.  That same commonsense will prevail and ensure that these matters are dealt with in an acceptable way in the future.</P>
    <P>When the dust settles on this controversy, whether it takes ten days, ten years or whatever it may be, then this constitutional amendment will be seen as necessary and worthwhile legislation.  Again, I have to remind people who are old enough to remember it about the introduction of the 1937 Constitution when we had the most appalling scaremongering about the things that were going to happen if the Constitution was introduced, <Col N="1264" /> about the way in which women were going to be affected, families were going to be affected and the number of things that were postulated at that time in that campaign.  There were a number of hair-raising possibilities raised as to what would happen if that Constitution was introduced.  It was absolutely appalling. The present situation is quite mild and quite restricted when compared to that time.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of that time by some of the things that have been suggested during this debate, some of what I can only describe as scaremongering, warning the people what may happen if they pass this amendment.  It reminds me of 1937.  Of all the bad results which were threatened at that time, none of them proved to be true.  That Constitution was an extremely good one.  It has stood up to time very well.  It has been an extremely good document and with this amendment it will be an even better one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point I would like to state my conviction on this question of the supposed threat to the life of the mother which it is said this amendment would entail.  It seems to me that this argument is based on the mistaken assumption that the amendment if passed would confer some sort of absolute right on the child so that no medical intervention which might have dangerous implications for the child could be considered. But surely the words themselves make it absolutely clear that there is no question whatsoever of an absolute right.  After acknowledging the right to life of the unborn, the amendment goes on to guarantee to respect that right with due regard to the equal right of the mother and to defend and vindicate that right as far as is practicable.  It is abundantly clear, therefore, that we are not talking about an unqualified or absolute right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The qualifying phrases &ldquo;with due regard to&rdquo; and &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; clearly imply the possibility of circumstances in which the guarantee of the child's right to life may not always be upheld.  These qualifying phrases have not been plucked out of the air.  They are already in use in other sections of the <Col N="1265" /> same Article of the Constitution, Article 40, which we are now proposing to amend.  They are used in relation to the protection of the rights of citizens, born persons, who have nonetheless equal rights.  The fact that in this amendment we are also dealing with equal rights does not mean that the Constitution does not recognise the possibility that it may not be appropriate or feasible in all circumstances to uphold or defend the right.  It has been said that a doctor might not be able to perform an operation to save the life of the mother if to do so might endanger or even end the life of the child.  Since the amendment does not change the existing law under which medical practice operates, this fear must arise from the assumption that a court would grant an application to prevent such a life-saving intervention on the grounds that it infringed the constitutional right of the child, but no court anywhere would rule that a doctor must not perform an operation to save the life of a mother unless the law clearly and unambiguously obliged the court to rule in that way.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that there is nothing in the wording of the amendment which would oblige an Irish court to rule in this way, a way in which, indeed, no court would ever wish to rule.  I believe, therefore, that there is no justification whatsoever for the fears that have been expressed or for the needless anxiety which has been generated about the consequences of inserting this amendment in the Constitution.  In their statement on this matter, the 300-member Irish Association of Lawyers for the Defence of the Unborn put it bluntly, and I quote: &ldquo;We unequivocally maintain that there is nothing in the original wording which would oblige an Irish court to make such a grotesque decision as that suggested by Mr. Sutherland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As has already been mentioned in this House, all five of the university professors of obstetrics and gynaecology &mdash; practising doctors who are also teaching the doctors of the future &mdash; have stated that they read with astonishment the suggestion that the amendment might endanger the lives of mothers.  Concluding their statement issued on 15 April the <Col N="1266" /> professors stated, and I quote:</P>
    <P>We have found the original wording proposed for the amendment to be entirely satisfactory.  As doctors, we believe, that this wording would present us with no difficulty in the proper discharge of our professional responsibility.</P>
    <P>That statement was signed by Professor John Bonner, Professor Eamon de Valera, Professor David Jenkins, Professor Kieran O'Driscoll and Professor Eamon O'Dwyer, by all five of the university professors of obstetrics and gynaecology in the Republic.  Their word on this matter is good enough for me and it should be good enough for the House.  I believe that it will be good enough for the people when they come to cast their votes in the referendum.</P>

    <P>To summarise what I have said, I have risen to speak because the Irish version of the wording of the amendment has been called into question and has been ridiculed here yesterday and previously by Senator Higgins.  I regret that Senator Higgins is not here to listen to me.  I believe in all humility that I have sufficient knowledge of the language, both orally and otherwise, to give an opinion as to the adequacy of this wording in the amendment that we have here.</P>
    <P>I accept the wording in Irish as being quite intelligible, quite correct and a <Col N="1268" /> quite satisfactory translation of the original version in English.  I have referred particularly to the first sentence in the Irish wording &ldquo;ceart na mbeo gan breith&rdquo;.  Emphasis has been placed here on &ldquo;ceart na mbeo&rdquo;.  Senator Higgins said rather scathingly that he assumed that it was the plural of &ldquo;Beo&rdquo;.  It is, and that is what it should be in that context because we must remember we are not using the language here as if we were conversing. It is not conversational language but neither is the English version.  It is academic, it is legal structured language appropriate to the purpose for which it is being used here.  For that reason it must be, as it is here, a satisfactory and a complete translation of the original English wording of the amendment.  I believe it is and I am quite satisfied with the wording in English.</P>
    <P>I regret that Senator Higgins is not here to hear me say that because I am convinced that what I am saying is correct. I also want to say that the people who translated that are people who know the language very well, who are experienced translators, who have been working in that field for many years.  They know the language orally and grammatically and are capable of producing a full and complete translation of the English version of the amendment.  Tá mé lánsásta leis an bhfoclaíocht atá anseo san leagan Gaeilge den Bhille seo ar Leasú den Bhunreacht mar atá sé os ár gcomhair.</P>
    <P>Emphasis was put on &ldquo;ceart na mbeo gan breith&rdquo;, disparagingly I would add.  If we go back to the most fundamental article of our faith, that is the Creed, Cré na nAspal, we find there reference to &ldquo;an beo agus mairbh&rdquo;.  The contextual reference to &ldquo;mbeo&rdquo; in the Creed has stood the test of centuries.  It is the version that is in the catechism of Dr. McHale of Tuam who was known as the lion of the fold and whose knowledge of Irish was not in question.  In that Creed it is &ldquo;a chuaigh suas ar neamh, atá ina shuí ar dheis Dé, a thiocfaidh arís le breithiúnas a thabhairt ar bheo agus ar mhairbh&rdquo;: that is, &ldquo;who will come again to judge the living and the dead&rdquo;.  What is wrong with that?  That is the same &ldquo;beo&rdquo; that is used <Col N="1269" /> here in &ldquo;ceart na mbeo gan breith&rdquo;, a thiocfaidh arís le breithiúnas a thabhairt ar an mbeo, sé sin ar na daoine atá beo &mdash; the people who are alive now.  If it be right in a context of that kind, in Cré na nAspal, the most fundamental article of our faith, and the creed I learned in my youth, what can be wrong with it in a translation of &ldquo;to judge the living and the dead&rdquo; or the translation of &ldquo;the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn&rdquo;?  It is correct, it is fundamentally sound.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go any further into the amendment itself.  Much has been said already and all of the ground has been covered.  We have heard many eloquent, entertaining and fundamentally good speeches from various Senators. The main difficulty seems to centre on the equal rights of the unborn and the mother, &ldquo;comhcheart na máthar.&rdquo;  That has been traced in depth legally, theologically and otherwise, I will not go into it except in a very simple way.  I do not wish to delay the House unduly.</P>
    <P>First of all, it is right for me to say that it is universally accepted that life begins with conception or fertilisation.  I believe that is generally accepted in this House. If it is not, I should say that I believe that is the case, that, as Senator Robb, to whom I listened carefully, so rightly put it in his contribution a new life begins at conception or fertilisation.  If that be so, the blueprint for a human being is thereby delineated in all its details.  We are told by theologians, medical man and other experts that the whole blueprint of a human being is set out in that act of conception down to the main features of that developed foetus and child at the time of birth, even to the details of hair, eyes and the main characteristics of that human being when that human being comes to the stage of coming into the world.</P>
    <P>If that is so &mdash; I believe it is so &mdash; nobody has the right to perform any action in any way that will interfere with, terminate or destroy that human life until it has the right and reaches the time to be born.  That is where the difficulty arises about equal rights of the child and mother or equal rights of the unborn and the <Col N="1270" /> mother.  If they are two human beings they must have equal rights.  Therefore, as I said, any act by anybody to destroy, interfere with or terminate the life of either that unborn child or the mother who bears that child in her womb is morally wrong.</P>
    <P>Let me go to the next step.  When a doctor is dealing with a pregnant woman he has not one but two patients, the woman and the child she is bearing.  That doctor has two patients.  If things begin to go wrong in the pregnancy he must do all he can to keep the pregnancy going until the child reaches viability, that is until the child is able to live on its own and until there is a good chance of being able to save both mother and child in any necessity that may arise.</P>
    <P>If there is no chance &mdash; this is the crucial question &mdash; of sustaining that pregnancy, if there is a clear indication that the mother will die before the child can be born alive, in other words before the child can be taken out, the doctor has to choose between two deaths or one.  He is not choosing between the mother and the child, he is choosing simply between two deaths or one death.  That is where the matter of equal rights comes in here. In simplicity, that is what the doctor is faced with, the choice between two deaths or one.  He is not choosing between the mother and the child as such. There is nothing he can do to save the child, because the child must die obviously if the mother dies because it is too young to survive outside the womb, therefore it will not survive on its own outside the womb.  The doctor does not want to cause the child's death because of anything that may terminate the life of that child.  Perhaps the mother does not want that child to die either.  Even given the present state of medical knowledge and expertise there is no way of saving the child.  The doctor may intervene to save the mother in such circumstances. That happens.  It is a usual occurrence. That is where I think the difficulty arises between the equal rights of the mother and the child.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Eoin Ryan when he reminded us of the introduction of the Constitution in 1937 and all the opposition <Col N="1271" /> that it met with at that time.  I am old enough to remember that time and old enough to remember all the opposition the Constitution met with.  Thank God, none of the things that was threatened at that time ever happened.  The Constitution has been found since to be one of the best instruments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like other members of my party I spoke on Second Stage.  It was not my intention to speak on Report Stage but, having listened to much of what has been said, I felt obliged to comment further and to make my views clearly known.  I certainly have no qualms of conscience about this particular matter. It is well that I should repeat much of what I said on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I listened very attentively to Senator Robinson.  I regret she is not here.  Maybe she will come in before I finish.  She rightly made the point that this is very much a legal, medical problem and she also made the point that those who are not legal or medical people should endeavour to read about the problem and what those for and against this amendment have to say.  I have done so as indeed have many Members of this House who are not legal or medical people.  Certainly, from what I have read, I have no doubt that the amendment is right and that the wording is right.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin, Senator Honan and other Members referred to the statement of the university professors of obstetrics and gynaecology, five eminent people who between them have been present at the births of thousands of babies, some of them probably difficult births, not the straightforward births which most of them are.  These people have said clearly that they found the original wording proposed to be entirely satisfactory.  The ethics committee of the Irish Medical Association, a very eminent group, also found no difficulty with the wording.  They could not agree with the theory of the Taoiseach or of Senator Robinson that women were condemned to death.  They disagreed totally with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hanafin referred to the Association of Lawyers for the Defence of the Unborn.  They represent 300 or more lawyers. They said they were satisfied that existing lawful, medical treatment of the mother during pregnancy would continue <Col N="1273" /> to be lawful.  These are eminent people and they know what they are talking about.  I know, too, that the wording was prepared in consultation with very eminent people who represent a very broad opinion in the medical, religious and political fields.  Everybody has, in fact, had a say on this wording.  Senator Robinson referred to the lack of input by women's groups.  I know that the pro-life movement groups in every town are composed mainly of women.  Certainly it is wrong to suggest that women have not had an input into this matter.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Robinson &mdash; I deliberately waited in the hope she would come in because I would prefer her to hear what I have to say &mdash; and her authoritative address on this matter.  She spoke at length on this important subject but at the end of the debate, leaning over to Senator O'Leary, she admitted that he was modest enough to admit he could be wrong.  She then said that she too could be wrong.  The whole thrust of her emphasis was the danger of the death of the mother.  She highlighted this as a very vital and important matter.  However, at the end of her contribution she said she could be wrong.  That is what I found very wrong with her contribution.  By her contribution she has done a lot of harm to mothers-to-be in Ireland.  She has caused, in my opinion, unnecessary alarm.  If she was 100 per cent certain about what she was saying she should say so, but she said she could be wrong.  Her statements may cause much unnecessary alarm to mothers-to-be and that is why I decided to intervene in this debate.  I do not propose to delay this important debate further but it seems that Senator Robinson is endeavouring to confuse the issue.  She appears to hope that by causing confusion she will be successful.  I do not think she will.</P>

      <P>I gather no one else wishes to contribute before my reply.  I am very pleased, and grateful, that so many Fianna Fáil Members have contributed to the debate on this amendment because I was worried that yesterday, on the previous amendment, so few <Col N="1274" /> Members appeared to be willing to contribute although they were, perhaps, opposed to my idea.  They were prepared to vote but they were not prepared to argue the matter.  While I may disagree with what they said I regard it as being a compliment in many ways that they have taken the trouble to speak and argue with me.  I appreciate quite a lot of what they said.  I also appreciate &mdash; this comes through clearly in many of their contributions &mdash; how sincerely they feel when they argue this matter.  I suggest that, perhaps, sometimes their sincerity is, as it were, a sincerity of faith, a sincerity of religion, a sincerity of genuine charitable feeling rather than a sincerity of really understanding the difficulties which this wording is creating.  That does not detract from my appreciation of what they have said.</P>
      <P>It is significant that Senator De Brún &mdash; perhaps he was unconscious of this &mdash; when he was talking about the use of the word &ldquo;beo&rdquo; referred back to the use of the word &ldquo;beo&rdquo; in the Apostle's Creed. I agree with him that this is the way the word is used in the Apostle's Creed and so on, but, at the same time, the close connection between the religious significance of what he is saying and the way in which the wording is put is significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons, when he referred to morality continually he said he was not dealing with the soul but, at the same time, the moral content of what he was saying came through a great deal more than, as it were, the legal or the factual content.  We still must keep asking ourselves the question: are we, in fact, legislating in terms of the morality of one group of people, or are we legislating for the whole country?  When I say the whole country I am talking in terms of people who are starting a New Ireland Forum, who are trying to persuade those who are not now under our technical jurisdiction that they should join us.  As regards emotional terms, certainly people have talked in emotional terms but they were on both sides.  If we talk in emotional terms of a threat to the mother, there is no doubt that to use the phrase, helpless unborn babe, as Senator Fitzsimons did, are also emotional words.  It is a question on <Col N="1275" /> which emotion does come into it.  I do not think we can avoid that.</P>
    <P>Before I go into my main reply to the debate there are a couple of matters I should like to say about what Senator O'Leary and Senator Eoin Ryan said. Senator O'Leary attacked me for not dealing with the matter in detail in my proposal.  I must confess that he probably has some justification for saying this.  If so, I can only say <i>mea culpa.</i>  Perhaps I should have gone into more detail on an analysis of the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo;.  Basically I am a simple woman and to me &ldquo;equal&rdquo; means &ldquo;equal&rdquo;, &ldquo;prior&rdquo; means &ldquo;prior&rdquo; and &ldquo;life&rdquo; means &ldquo;life&rdquo;.  When I talk about equal rights I do not mean equal rights as conditioned by the fact that doctors already have a practice they are going to go on doing, regardless of what the law says.  When I say &ldquo;prior&rdquo; I simply mean that if one is deciding between the life of the foetus and the life of the mother in a situation of death threatening, I consider that the life of the mother, possibly, should have a prior right.</P>
    <P>As far as the word &ldquo;life&rdquo; is concerned, when I say a threat to life, I mean a question of life and death and I do not mean a question of welfare.  I deprecate Senator Eoin Ryan's effort to suggest that what I am proposing is that the welfare of the mother should take priority over the life of the foetus because that is not what I am suggesting.  This is verging on the same old accusation that anyone who opposes the amendment is somebody who is trying to bring in galloping abortion on all sides.</P>
    <P>As far as the prior right to the life of the mother is concerned, I cannot understand why Senator O'Leary says that this would change existing practice because it seems to me that what everyone is saying, and presuming, is that in the situation &mdash; despite anything the constitutional amendment may say &mdash; where there is, in fact, a life-threatening problem and one has to choose between the life of the foetus and the life of the mother, doctors do preserve the life of the mother.  A prior right is assumed.  Therefore, my amendment would not change anything.  Senator de Brún said this did <Col N="1276" /> not arise and I am sure he was perfectly sincere in what he was saying but he is wrong in that there are undoubtedly at present situations where there is severe kidney disease or severe high blood pressure of the mother, where caesarian operations are performed in or about the 24th week of pregnancy where there is undoubtedly a very severe risk to the life of the foetus.  One cannot say for certain that the foetus will die but, let us be frank, the foetus's chances of life are not really all that great.  Yet these operations are currently performed in our maternity hospitals because they are essential to preserve the life of the mother.  There the doctor is, in fact, making a choice.  He may not be making an absolute choice that this one is going to die or this one is going to live but he is coming pretty near to it.  That is the type of operation which eminent doctors are worried about.</P>
    <P>I completely agree with Senator Eoin Ryan that if Senator O'Leary's party are so worried about the use of the term &ldquo;equal&rdquo; and if they feel that a subsidiary term should be put in, as the Minister suggested, then why did they not come in here with an amendment to say so?  If they believe this they should act on their beliefs and should stand up and be counted.  It is not much use coming in here and saying one disagrees with Senator McGuinness's amendment because it will do this, that or the other if one is not prepared to do anything to deal with the situation which that person sees as a danger too.  If the Minister feels that way he should bring in an amendment and if Senator O'Leary feels that way he should bring in an amendment.  They should not just sit here and criticise other people's amendments.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if it is argued that my suggestion of &ldquo;prior&rdquo; might bring in the idea of welfare or something more indefinite rather than actual life or death then the phraseology used by the Minister, and by Senator O'Leary, about operations to save life would surely be open to the same interpretation, that it would be possibly operations to preserve the welfare, the health or whatever of the mother.  Basically, as far as the meaning of the word is concerned it is not that I <Col N="1277" /> do not understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo;.  I do, but I am saying that when one says &ldquo;equal&rdquo; one means equal. That is the problem.  When I say &ldquo;prior&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;prior&rdquo; and I mean that if there is going to be a threat of death to one or the other I would prefer to preserve the life of the mother.  I am not very ashamed of that.  If I am being told that I am a galloping abortionist by saying this well, I am a galloping abortionist and that is the way it is.  I am talking about actual life, not about welfare.  I am certainly not talking about, on any excuse, as Senator Eoin Ryan said, or any case can be made, for superior rights in any situation.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how that could be argued when the Bill specifically refers not to right to welfare, right to health or anything like that, but right to life of the unborn and right to life of the mother.  If we are going to talk in welfare terms and say right to welfare we might just as well say the unborn under this constitutional amendment will have a right to welfare and, therefore, it should be legally forbidden for, for instance, pregnant women to smoke because it is a well established threat to the welfare of the foetus.  It is not necessarily a threat to the life of the foetus but it is certainly a threat to the welfare of the foetus and that is very well established.  If we are going to say life means welfare that is what we are going to put in rather than a simple protection of the right to life.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan raised the problem about writing things into the Constitution, writing limitations to the amendment into the Constitution, which he described as crazy writing into the Constitution.  The trouble is that that is precisely the exercise we are engaged in, crazily writing into the Constitution, where the law has protected us all along and shows no signs of not protecting us in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator de Brún said nobody had the right to perform any action to interfere with the right to life of the foetus and yet he went on to say that he was convinced that present medical practice will continue. I suggest that this is an illogical position because at present medical practice does interfere with that right and if <Col N="1278" /> one takes an absolute stance it should not be happening.  Also, if one says no one has the right to perform any action to interfere with the right of the foetus one would not even be allowing equal rights to the mother, one would not be allowing any rights at all.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of definition remains unanswered and unsolved.  To say that if we assume that the use of the word &ldquo;equal&rdquo; will mean that doctors will stand by and not do anything and let mothers die is a reflection on doctors is all very well but, surely, it is also a reflection on doctors to say if we bring in a law to say they are not to do something and they do it regardless of the law, take no notice of the law, that is also a reflection on doctors. Some doctors are prepared to say, &ldquo;I know religiously speaking I should be doing this and, therefore, I will take no notice of the law.&rdquo;  However, other doctors are worried by the necessity to obey the law.  One has to choose between the eminent persons, both are equally eminent. There is the presumption being spoken of that present practices will continue but that is only a presumption.  It is not a certainty.</P>
    <P>In this context the Minister's contribution to the debate was crucially important, as Senator Robinson said.  The Minister said he had a feeling of a need for a subsidiary statement, that he needs a statement that interventions to save the mother's life will not be unlawful, or interventions to preserve the mother from death will not be unlawful.  If the Minister says that this is so the extraordinary thing is that, having failed to get this subsidiary statement, this clarification, he is still prepared to sit here and by his inaction to pass the very wording about which he has such doubts.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement tried to shift the responsibility to Fianna Fáil.  I said quite clearly on Second Stage what I feel about Fianna Fáil policy on this matter but it must be remembered that Fianna Fáil are not the Government.  The Minister is the Minister.  It is the responsibility of the Minister, not the Opposition's responsibility.  To do what he is doing, passively to promote the present wording &mdash; that is what the Minister is <Col N="1279" /> doing; he is not abstaining and saying he is Pontius Pilate and is washing his hands of what happened &mdash; is totally irresponsible given the feelings he has expressed. For the Minister to make pleading and pathetic statements about his waiting for Deputy Michael Woods to give the answers to his questions and so on does not in the least alter the fact that he has simply thrown in the towel and decided to give up fighting for what he genuinely believes.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with one other aspect of the matter in a rather fantasy way.  I would like to put that aspect to the House because it is important.  Senator Robinson said, in a fairly brief reference to this, that if this matter affected men rather than women we might have a very different attitude to this comfortable presumption that medical practice would go on, as it were.  Women do not get pregnant by themselves as all Members know. Even the ovum must be fertilised.</P>
    <P>What is this wording about?  It is wording about the equal rights of the mother. Why is this matter about the equal rights of the mother included at all?  Surely it is about a decision which occurs, and occurs not all that infrequently providing one includes the ectopic pregnancy and the uterine cancer decisions.  They must be included legally.  The double-effect theory does not have legal effect.  Decisions as to whether one ends a pregnancy, or whether one creates a real risk to the life of the mother do not occur all that infrequently. This threat to life is strictly confined to women because only women are pregnant.</P>
    <P>Let me create a theoretical scenario and in these days of employment and maintenance equality and so on: perhaps one should not say it is so fantastic a scenario.  Suppose that each time this conflict occurred the medical authorities brought in the husband and said: the foetus has an equal right to life to the parents, not just to the mother, and in order to keep the foetus alive, and be sure that the foetus is alive, we must risk your wife's life but we will be putting your life on the line as well because if your wife dies we will have to arrange for <Col N="1280" /> you to die too, by painless injection, of course, but to die nevertheless, quite definitely. It could be said: there is an area of doubt, there is an equal right to life, but as it is only equal there is very little we can do about it; what do you suggest should be done?  If, in that scenario it is a case where the pregnancy was allowed to go on despite severe kidney disease or blood pressure, the husband, too, would have to live for a period of weeks or months with the threat of probable death hanging over his head.  This scenario may seem lunatic and ridiculous but is it really so far-fetched?  Does it not seem ridiculous just because most members are men?  Would all the male Senators feel so comfortably sure that the mother's life would be protected, and nothing would really change in present medical practice, if their own lives were to be laid on the line as well?  It is in the light of this kind of thing that I am talking about the prior right of the mother rather than the equal right of the mother.  If it was the equal right and prior right of male Senators perhaps they might feel just a little bit less comfortable about saying but of course the medical practices that are going on will continue.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullooly said that nothing he had heard or read had altered his views. Perhaps that is only to be expected, but he accuses Senator Robinson of being Euclidean in her dealing with the matter. He referred to the fact that the citizen's right to life is included in the Constitution but it is not specifically stated as being equal to anyone else's, it is just a right to life.  How can one construe equal as being equal if one is saying one is construing equal as meaning equal except in the case of present medical practice?  Senator Mullooly does not accept that the present constitutional amendment wording will affect anything, but that is not so.  There is ample evidence to prove that it has already affected many eminent doctors who are really worried about it.</P>
    <P>As far as the Euclidean argument is concerned, perhaps he is complaining that Senator Robinson is actually logical in her argument.  This probably hurts a lot because women, of course, are always accused of being extremely illogical and <Col N="1281" /> men are supposed to have the absolute monopoly of logic as far as argument is concerned.  In fact, Euclid had at least the merit of logic, as those of us who learned geometry at school have had perhaps, bitter experience of but not so Senator Mullooly.  I would suggest that logic is the furthest thing away from his contribution.</P>
    <P>I will return to what I said when introducing this amendment, that the reason I introduced it was that I felt that there was a need for clarity.  All of us seem to be presuming that in a life-threatening situation the mother's life will, in fact, be preserved.  Why then do we object to this amendment if we presume this in this situation of competition, and I am talking about life now, life is the word which is before us and not welfare?  It surely cannot be for the feeble reason given by the Minister for Justice, that to accept the amendment would cause delay.  This is the least possible harm that can be done. Is a little bit of delay to be weighed on the scales more than an important decision which will affect the safety of mothers, and the life of mothers and children? Or is the objection to my amendment really because the promoters of what is called the pro-life amendment do not actually want to give mother's life priority?  Some of the people who are promoting this constitutional amendment <Col N="1282" /> made statements, when challenged on the question of capital punishment, for instance.  They were asked why were they not against capital punishment if they were against abortion in this way? They had spoken in terms of innocent human life as though one must distinguish and say, of course the unborn is innocent and the born may be guilty. Perhaps, what they feel is that the unborn is innocent whereas the mother may be guilty in some way and, therefore, a judgment must be made.</P>
    <P>If we go into this we will get lost in the mists of theology rather than law or medical practice.  If this is the attitude of the promoters of the constitutional amendment, if they genuinely do not want the mother's life to have priority in these situations, at least my amendment, even if defeated, will have made this, perhaps, a bit clearer to the people who are going to vote that when they are voting they will be voting against the clear statement of the priority of the mother's life if they support the constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>That is important.</P>

      <P>In deference to the patience shown by Members of this House, I do not propose to speak at length.  We have all had a very full opportunity of expressing our views.  I will go back to the major criticism of this Bill that was made at the outset and that I believe has been reinforced and strengthened by the debate that has taken place on each Stage, the debate on general principles on Second Stage, the meticulous debate on Committee Stage and the proposed amendments there, and the <Col N="1285" /> even more technical and detailed debate on Fourth Stage, Report Stage, yesterday and today.  It is important on Fifth Stage to go back to the basic flaw in this proposal to amend the Constitution.  It is the eighth Bill to amend the Constitution. This basic flaw does not occur in any of the other seven.  All of the other seven were susceptible and proper subjects for constitutional amendments.  This Bill, as is certainly proven by the debate we have had in this House, is flawed and defective. Whatever one's views on the issue of abortion, whatever one's views on the kind of life and framework and political basis we should have in Ireland, this Bill is not susceptible of a proper vote by the people in a constitutional referendum because it is not possible to know what it means.  Senator Eoin Ryan admitted that he did not know what was meant by the life of the unborn.  He did not know.  He was prepared to leave it to some future decision of the Supreme Court.  Other Senators on both sides of the House with different viewpoints on the issues involved have admitted that they do not know what the wording means and cannot know until after the popular vote in the referendum.  That is simply not a satisfactory basis for a constitutional amendment.</P>

      <P>The clearest indication that comes from anybody with any openness of mind who reads the debates in this House or who follows them in the <Col N="1286" /> newspapers is that there is a great deal of uncertainty about the scope and implications and intent of this amendment.  It is not clear what effect it will have on existing practices in relation to contraception. It is not clear what effect it will have on existing practices in relation to the treatment of rape victims.  Take, for example, the statistics given by the Rape Crisis Centre in relation to current practice of women who go to the Rape Crisis Centre for help and treatment.  In the statistics circulated in a booklet from the Rape Crisis Centre last week there is reference to the occurrence of pregnancy as a result of rape.  It is in table 9 of the statistics and it was drawn from a sample of 82 women.  Of those 82 there was a diagnosis of positive pregnancy in 14, the next category who took the &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; pill, 14, the next category is negative, in other words no pregnancy, 31, and the fourth category is not applicable, women either too old or too young to be of child-bearing age and therefore this heading is not relevant, 23.  It is quite clear from this debate that none of us really knows whether the 14 who took the &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; pill, 14 Irishwomen who took this step after they had been raped, could do this when the constitutional amendment is through.  The Senators on that side of the House who expressed themselves as favouring this amendment &mdash; that does not include Senator Eoin Ryan &mdash; believe that the constitutional right dates from the moment of conception, the moment of fertilisation and, therefore, benefits the fertilised ovum.  If that is the case there is a constitutional right to life of this tiny microscopic dot of cell, that certainty is a life &mdash; I accept that and I have no problem about accepting it.  The problem is whether it is appropriate to confer a constitutional right to life on such an entity and equate that with adult women.  If that is the case there is no doubt at all that this will affect contraceptive practices, rape treatment and the present medical approach to treating pregnant women where there is the difficult problem of a possible conflict between the life of the mother and the life of the unborn. I have very considerable sympathy for <Col N="1287" /> the approach adopted by Senator Eoin Ryan that commonsense will prevail, but am afraid the answer to that is that doctors, too, must obey the law.  Doctors must adhere to the law and the commonsense must come from us.  It is the legislator who must have commonsense, in the matter. I put it to this House on Fifth Stage that, whatever else the debate on this constitutional amendment has revealed, it has revealed that we are greatly lacking in commonsense, that we could put a proposal to the people when we do not know, and will not know when the vote is taken, what it means and we do not know the answers to the searching, important, human questions that have been asked.  These are not phoney abstract lawyers' questions.  They affect women, in particular women and their relationship to their own fertility cycle, women in the most intimate part of their lives, women who are very largely in Irish society under enough pressure as it is.</P>
      <P>I am going to conclude on this because it is not my intention to delay the House further.  The basic flaw in this amendment is that it is so uncertain in its scope and so potentially contradictory in its meaning and so potentially damaging to existing practices in the area of family planning and medical treatment that it must not be the subject of abstention by conscientious citizens who do not like this amendment but do not want to feel that they are voting for abortion.  They are not voting for abortion.  The existing criminal law prohibits abortion and no legislator in this House is suggesting that that be changed.  What they are doing and must be persuaded to do is to reject a constitutional proposal which simply lacks the necessary core of clear, precise meaning to be the proper subject for voters in a referendum.  It is unique in that and I hope that we can rely on the common sense of the people to save us from this legislative proposal which has taken up so much of our time, and which we have failed to have the political capacity and will to amend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to <Col N="1288" /> remarks that were made here yesterday by Senator Higgins.  He referred to an attack that was made on him personally in a periodical.  I would like to place on record that I would regret very much that an attack of that type should be made on any Senator.  I regret particularly that it has been made on him and I wish to be dissociated from that.  I certainly would never like to have anything to do with that type of remark.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that all of us who reject the idea of abortion ever becoming legal should urge the adoption of this amendment by a large majority.  If we or the country were to reject the amendment this would signal clearly that in May or June of this year, 1983, we were not prepared to extend constitutional protection to the unborn child.  It is certain that such a verdict would foster an attitude conducive to the acceptance of at least limited abortion.  I am absolutely certain of that.  I emphasise that I am not suggesting that anybody here is pro-abortion. I do not believe that people are pro-abortion until such time as they tell me they are pro-abortion.  I am merely dealing with what I believe will happen if this amendment is beaten.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, a vote for the amendment in this House and in the country clearly signals our rejection of the idea that the direct and intentional killing of life before birth has ever been the right solution in any human situation. The purpose of the amendment, in the words of the Minister for Justice in his Second Reading speech in the other House, is to ensure that what is called legalised abortion will not become a feature of our law or of our society against the wishes of the people.  The amendment achieves that objective simply and effectively and without threatening anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know, and it is not necessary to say it, that the Constitution enacted by the people can be changed only by the people.  Theirs is the constitutional right to be the final decider of this or any other question in that regard.  Everyone knows the present necessity to enshrine in that Constitution the right to life of the unborn was not envisaged 45 years ago. Few indeed could have envisaged the <Col N="1289" /> extent of the deterioration of human respect for human life, born or unborn, which we are now witnessing on an almost universal scale in this so-called enlightened last quarter of the twentieth century.  One of the reasons the amendment is positive rather than negative is to ensure that the declaration of the right to life of the unborn must be respected and must be respected, for example, by the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>As has been emphasised by all lawyers with a basic knowledge of European law, the right to life of the unborn can be insured against attack only if that right is specifically protected in the Constitution. The wording of this amendment protects the unborn against all comers unless the people should decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>Now that this amendment is about to be passed by both Houses and presented to the people, all the arguments put forward in both Houses as to why a referendum should not be held or why we should have a different amendment are totally and completely irrelevant.  Only one amendment is going before the people.  This amendment would not be possible were it not for the support given to it by members of the Fianna Fáil Party, members of the Fine Gael Party and members of the Labour Party.  It is no longer a Fianna Fáil amendment.</P>

      <P>If it is accepted by the people there is no victory or defeat for any one political party.  This amendment could not have passed through without the support of members of the three main political parties.  There is no victory or defeat for any one of the major political parties if this amendment is passed.  It is not a political issue.  It is a human rights issue.  Let it be clearly understood that if it is passed by the people it can only serve the case for the unborn, but if it is defeated it will not be a case of things being as they were previously.  It can only weaken the case for the unborn.  It is a double-edged sword.  If it is defeated it will weaken the case against any powerful pro-abortion lobby that I believe will inevitably arise in the future.  It is a <Col N="1290" /> double-edged sword.  If it is accepted it strengthens the case for the unborn: if it is defeated it will weaken the case for the unborn.</P>

      <P>It is not good enough to say that because clearly an amendment will now go before the people the situation will resolve itself into all those who are in favour of a constitutional amendment supporting this amendment.  I do not believe that to be the situation at all. As I said at the outset, there is more than an element of moral blackmail in this movement.  You cannot set up the situation whereby you first set about having an amendment passed by the Dáil and then put that amendment to the people on the basis that it has been put here this evening.  That is not the full story.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of an amendment and against abortion but I am not in favour of this amendment.  I will not support it and I will encourage other people not to support it.  I do not share the view that there is in the present generation a lesser respect for human life than there ever has been because I think there is a greater respect for human life now than there ever has been throughout history.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Senator Hanafin.  We have moved out of the dark ages.  It is true that matters like abortion have become institutionalised in other countries, but to a large extent that was the institutionalisation of something that always existed.  It is true to say that the quality of human life has improved and is continuing to improve.  I do not share the negative view that the world is on the moral, downward trail because I believe in the dignity of human beings and their increasing self-awareness. While we have individual problems, I believe that that dignity has meant a greater respect for human life both in this area and in areas in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to say that any constitutional <Col N="1291" /> amendment, even the one I support, will guarantee our Constitution against international challenge.  That problem cannot be solved within the confines of this constitutional amendment or any other constitutional amendment. Anyone who says that it can is misinforming the people.  This constitutional amendment will not have any greater status when we have to decide whether to continue membership of organisations who might interpret the rules of their organisations in a different way.  The existence or non-existence of this constitutional amendment is in this regard not relevant.  It is not correct to say that its enactment by the people will guarantee us against the very real problems which I envisage over the next few decades in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin has correctly analysed that this Bill could not have reached the stage it has without the support of all the parties to a greater or lesser extent in the Dáil and Seanad.

      <P>It was.  As the person in my party charged for the responsibility of looking after the passage of this Bill through the House and the interest of the Fine Gael Party in that regard, I found the position of the Labour Party quite extraordinary.  I owe it to my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party to say that it was the judgment of the majority of members of our party that the best interests of the country would be served by the holding of the referendum at an early stage.  We recognised that the referendum was within the power totally of the other House and that our job was to examine the legislation and to try to impress upon those who had the power and the authority to prevent its enactment the importance of sharing our viewpoints.  There are only two groups that could have done that, one is the majority in Dáil Éireann and the other is the people.  That is the reality of the situation as far as the majority of the members in the Fine Gael Party are concerned.  They believe this.  I have never believed that it is an unreasonable or an immoral position to take.  Senator Robinson said earlier that she would like to express her disgust at the possibility that a political party that has the power to delay a Bill should refuse to delay it by their abstention.  I wish to express my disgust at the fact that a political party that had the possibility of defeating the Bill in another place refused to do so and that is a reasonable position for me to take.</P>

I mentioned earlier the sincerity of the contributions of members of Fianna Fáil and I specifically mentioned Senator de Brún and Senator Fitzsimons and I would also include Senator Eoin Ryan.  However, I do not think I want to extend that to Senator Hanafin.  I am disgusted and shocked at the contribution which he has made on Fifth Stage in which he has deliberately tried to reduce this again to a question of saying that anyone who opposes this amendment is a pro-abortionist and is trying to weaken the protection of the unborn child.  That is what he said and that is what he meant.  I protest vigorously against it.  He was trying to clothe it in polite words but that was what he was trying to do.</P>

It is a disgrace to the debate in this House that after all that has been said and after the serious and sincere debates that have gone on, we should end up with this kind of smear campaign.  It seems to destroy the whole atmosphere of the debate that we have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I wish to pay tribute to Senator O'Leary for the subtlety with which he has defended a difficult position on behalf of his party.  He will know when he reads the record of the previous Stages that I did not interrupt him at all.  It is important that the record shows that the Labour group in the Seanad, joined in so many divisions by the university Senators, voted on amendments which would have protected women, which exposed the <Col N="1297" /> absurdity and the danger of this amendment to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I want to invoke one principle which is important at this final Stage.  I think that most people who have studied constitutions agree that constitutions in general deal with matters about which one either can or should be certain.  For example, the great European expert on constitutions, Giovanni Sartori, refers to the aspect of <i>garantie</i> as the aspect which is common to constitutions; it is in matters in which you can guarantee or should guarantee.  All the evidence that we have heard in speeches on both sides of this House tells us that we are moving into an area by way of referendum in which no certainty is possible.  It is appropriate at this stage to suggest that we should compare our exercise with a possible hypothetical exercise as has taken place appropriately in some parts of the United States where people held a referendum on whether Charles Darwin was right or wrong or whether Darwin should be excluded from the school curriculum, whether you wanted to drive American school children back to the Book of Genesis. Let us be clear, that is what this amendment invites us to do and not in a backward oriented sense only.  It has been demonstrated at every stage of the debate that it is not a casual ignorance of certainty; it is not a casual affair with the past, it is almost a casual abandonment of assurances in relation to certain medical practices that were available to pregnant women or women who might become pregnant.  I am grateful to Senator Hanafin for one thing.  Twice during the course of this debate he dissociated himself from some of the unsavoury tactics of the people who are now going to run this campaign in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask another question about that. Does this mean that I have a guarantee from him that members of his party will not take into their hands the dishonest literature of these organisations?  Do I have a guarantee from the other large party, who I understand were criticising my party just a few moments ago, that they will not do as they did in my constituency at the last election and take literature from unrepresentative groups <Col N="1298" /> who are not honourable enough to put the addresses of their printers on their literature, and to distribute it to drive me from the Dáil?  I am careful in the way I place that on the record.  That happened in my Second Stage speech, I identified them, the people who ran in and out of cars so that they might not be seen.</P>
    <P>In complete contradiction of what Senator Hanafin has to say, this debate is not now over.  The debate that took place in this House in particular is of relevance to the public.  It is not a matter of the Dail having considered certain proposals, words that were not explained, many of us having sat here through different stages of the debate in the Seanad until Report Stage when several Senators seemed to have been provoked to offer their opinions and their definitions in both English and Irish.  It is not a matter of saying, &ldquo;Look, we have rid ourselves of this debate and now we are off to the public with the original wording and that it is a simple matter of yes or no.&rdquo;  If we do that it is a celebration of ignorance and a matter of dishonour to this House. The debate in this House has been better than that in the other House.</P>
    <P>As a political scientist and a historian of these institutions, and as someone who has written about the Seanad, I want to assert the right of the Seanad to discuss its own affairs.  Our responsibility here as elected representatives for university constituencies, those people who have been nominated and elected from the different panels, is to this Chamber.  It is not to come in here with a shadow cast over our options by another House.  It serves the future of the Seanad very badly if you stand up and say, &ldquo;Well, we can only decide this one way or the other&rdquo;&mdash; positive or negative, depending on the options that are allowed either in a previous consideration by the other House or in a potential future consideration by the other House.  This devalues the Seanad.  We need to be very careful in this matter.  Our responsibility is to the arguments and to the votes that take place in this Chamber.  I should have congratulated the young Minister of State before now.  I wish him well in everything he does.  He has joined with others in <Col N="1299" /> saying that our prospects are very bad in the other House if we reject anything here.  This is the argument but I would remind him of our distinguished predecessors, people like W.B. Yeats and others in the twenties who felt that it was important to make the case on divorce and that this House enabled them to make such speeches despite the fact that they were to be ignored in their claims for most of the life of this so-called Republic.</P>
    <P>The Seanad has rights of its own; it has the right to have a debate.  It has witnessed a marvellous debate in which again and again and again the rights of women, the dangers to women have been asserted and people have counter-asserted a form of words about which many of them have said they have reservations. The very best defender of the form of words has said, &ldquo;Look, it would not have been my decision to start.&rdquo;  Now we are invited by Senator Hanafin to imagine that our debate need never have taken place.  He suggests in a kind of apocalyptic vision that we are at a stage in the world's history when we need to do this, perhaps, I do not want to put words into his mouth, not only for Ireland but for the world, in which respect for life has declined.</P>
    <P>We are not amending the Constitution to assert our neutrality, we are not doing anything that will lessen the threat of war, we are not doing anything that will celebrate the right to life in the Third World, we are not doing anything to give men and women equal rights in the Constitution. We could save ourselves an immense legislative hassle by saying that it is wrong to discriminate on the basis of sex and put that into our Constitution. We are not doing that: what we are doing is that we are sending, as I described it on the previous Stage a mumbo-jumbo of words using concepts imported from abroad by people who want to use our Constitution as an exercise for themselves. We are not doing anything for life.  We are not doing anything to eliminate threats to life but we are doing something, and it it the most important thing <Col N="1300" /> that I have to say, that is profoundly threatening to the lives of women.</P>
    <P>Remember that even the best speeches from the other side of the House did not deny that from the moment this amendment to the Constitution is passed the position of women is changed.  It has been equated with something nobody has been able to define in either language.  Senator Robinson, to her credit, for more than a decade has asserted the rights of women in this Chamber.  She has my admiration and respect for that.  But it goes further than women being invited to protect themselves by voting against this amendment and by mothers protecting their daughters by voting against this amendment. Anyone involved in human sexual relationships, men who care, owe it to Ireland to reject this amendment.  I do so in the interests of life, because my definition of life is not a constricted, narrow, fearful imported notion that we are being threatened from here, there or everywhere. The woman that one sleeps and lives with, who bears our children, is entitled to the rights under the Constitution that even exist at the moment and our appropriate exercise should be in amending the Constitution to create equality for women rather than disgracing ourselves at this stage by allowing a form of words to go to the public, about which we cannot be certain in any positive respect, but about which all the negative respects had been stated by expert opinion, that it materially damages the position of women.</P>
    <P>I have not wanted to go on and on speaking about this subject but, with respect to Senator O'Leary, who I believe has sought to justify a very difficult position in this Chamber, how can you, I repeat, acknowledge the danger to the life of women on the one hand and then sit back in your seat?</P>
    <P>I was in the position when I was a Member of the other House, and Senators spoke often about the other House, and I chose and I choose now, if I was never to occupy a seat again in that other House, that it is more important to be certain in relation to what one does in relation to the rights of women than it is to be pragmatic.  It is just not good <Col N="1301" /> enough to take the decision to sit in your seat and say there is an elaborate justification for this.  It belongs in the other House and in that other House seven or eight members of the Labour Party let us down.</P>
    <P>Let us call a spade a spade.  I know the intimidation.  I know the pressure that people who want to come back here to earn their livelihood as Dáil representatives are under in this matter.  I have known it since 1971 when, for example, the party opposite would not allow to go into print a Bill in relation to matters of family planning.  I know all the cowardice that is induced by the pressure of the people in constituencies from different majorities.  But it is too much to suggest that the position of the Labour Party in the Seanad is extraordinary.  It is very simple.  The Seanad group of the Labour Party have consistently voted at all stages against this measure because we discussed it and found it to be anti-woman and, I say this lest it be patronising, we were glad to walk in behind initiatives taken by other Senators from the university constituencies.  I agree with Senator O'Leary on one important point.  It is frankly disgraceful that the Fianna Fáil Party should just keep their heads down on this matter.  I know the Fine Gael Party agonised about attitudes it should take, but the idea that the Fianna Fáil Party should, for example, discuss the matter briefly and let it off to the people, is an invitation to a seedy version of ourselves that at best we will have a constitutional referendum which will sit there to cripple us.</P>
    <P>We were invited by medical practitioners to leave them alone and allow them to practise their ethics.  The day we pass this we are rejecting their request and that is very important.  We have made a matter that was previously a matter of personal medical ethics a matter of popular choice in a referendum.  It would be fine to do this in relation to whether a new star had been discovered, but we are doing it about the bodies and lives of women.</P>
    <P>There is nothing extraordinary about the Labour Party's position on this.  It is very consistent.  It has been argued all <Col N="1302" /> through.  If you wanted to block this and send it back to the Dáil you voted against it in the Seanad.  I find it very hard to accept that you can have some other kind of convoluted position, that you can say something like, &ldquo;Well, I am sitting here not expressing an opinion on it and I am going to invite the public to vote against it, but of course I am not going to campaign either.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  I know what it means.  It means that the very people whose functionaires wanted to remove people like myself from Dáil Éireann had not the courage to campaign publicly against this anti-woman measure.</P>
    <P>Now I speak personally and not as acting leader of the Labour group.  I intend to oppose this measure because it is anti-woman.  But, more importantly, I believe it is an abuse of the constitutional alteration process and I invite those who at one time said that they wanted to invite us to a new version of the Constitution which would have included Dissenters, Protestants and Catholics to say what they are going to do.  Are they going to include women in their crusade?  Will they be involved and with what ashes in their mouths can they ever again reinstitute a crusade?  I say that with no pleasure because across from me are a group of people who would have tacitly supported tribalism in this country rather than pluralism. The Labour Party's position should not be misrepresented.  Their position at every stage was that the origins of the amendment had come from an unrepresentative demand and that there was no need for it.  It followed through to identify specific dangers. Despite our general opposition to the demand for this referendum we went in to support the university Senators where they suggested specific amendments that would in fact have mitigated the danger of passing it.</P>
    <P>Through you, I speak to Senator Hanafin who condemned the tactics of the people I have been attacking myself.  I repeat this.  Does this mean that in the course of the whole referendum we will have a proper debate?  If we have a proper debate, surely it must include the very fine contributions from all sides that <Col N="1303" /> were made in this House rather than some little tribalistic dance that puts women further back in Ireland.  That is the danger.  I remember the time when I found the organisations with the leaflets, who printed them in an unknown place and had them delivered to a lady who did not want to identify herself, who gave them to another woman who distributed them outside a church and tens of thousands of them were distributed.  Members of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties rushed up and took bunches of them each saying, &ldquo;Give me a bunch of those&rdquo;.  Is that what we are going to have at the referendum?</P>
    <P>I hope that in Senator Hanafin's comment and his condemnation of the tactics that has been exposed by myself in the paper that we are going to have a referendum that will be about issues.  I hope that the referendum will not be soon.  I hope that every woman, but more importantly everybody who believes in equality, who believes, like I do, that a woman should not be penalised by her sheer ability to bear a child, will have an opportunity to consider this debate and the debate in the other House.  It is not a matter of ducking this and ducking that. The reason we have voted against all Stages of this Bill is that we have been for equality and one of the most primary forms of equality is equality between men and women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear up a few misapprehensions.  First, Senator Higgins' condemnation of some of the pressure groups he mentioned would have been a little more convincing if he had mentioned the pressure groups on the other side who are guilty of tactics which can be condemned just as easily. He has mentioned Senator Hanafin not taking responsibility for things that have been done by certain groups.  I hope Senator Higgins will give the same undertaking not to take responsibility for some of the activities of those pressure groups who have to a very large extent been the cause of the initiation of this debate in which we are taking part today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say two things.  Senator <Col N="1304" /> Higgins said that even the best speakers on this side of the House admitted that the lives and welfare of women would be affected, would be undermined by this constitutional amendment.  I accept with all humility the fact that I must not have been one of the best speakers on this side of the House because quite clearly I did not admit that.  In all of the contributions I made to this debate I expressed my conviction, my belief, that this constitutional amendment would not adversely affect the lives or welfare of women.  That is my belief.  Obviously Senator Higgins does not agree with it but I want to make it quite clear that I did not express that view; in fact, my belief was quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to comment on what Senator Robinson said.  She misrepresented me slightly &mdash; I do not mean deliberately so &mdash; when she took certain words out of my mouth without putting them in context.  She said that this constitutional amendment should not be put before the people because it was so vague and uncertain and that I admitted I did not know what &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; meant.  By that, I think, she meant that I was not in a position to define exactly at what stage a foetus was a person and was deserving of the protection of the amendment.</P>
    <P>What I did say was that this question was a question of great complexity, that it was open to discussion, that it was constantly being discussed in the light of new views and new discoveries and so on and that to attempt to define in the Constitution exactly what constituted an abortion would not only be extremely difficult but would be undesirable because the views about that would change over the years and that the only effective way was to allow the court to decide exactly what constituted abortion in the light of current medical views.  This may be in a sense saying that the position is uncertain but it is the only proper way to deal with it.  To put something into the Constitution that would have to be amended every time there was a change in medical views would obviously be an impossible situation.</P>
    <P>Having demanded definition in regard to this amendment, Senator Robinson <Col N="1305" /> went on to use words to the effect that the existing law dealt with the question of abortion adequately over the years, but blithely ignored the fact that existing legislation never made any attempt to define what abortion meant.  Existing legislation did exactly what I said should be done in this case, it left it to the court &mdash; at any given time and in the light of current medical opinion and public opinion &mdash; to decide in all the circumstances what would constitute abortion.  This is the proper way to deal with this.  It is not uncertain, it is the only way in which it can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, having listened to what Senator McGuinness said I feel there is a misunderstanding about remarks I made and whether my explanation is accepted or not I can only give it.  I have thought about what I said, I do not know what created the misunderstanding but I can only assume at this stage that it was when I was finishing up and when I said that if this amendment is passed it will strengthen the case for the unborn and if it is defeated it will weaken the case for the unborn.  If that is the remark that caused the misunderstanding I am sorry but I happen to believe that to be true.  In fact I went to great pains when speaking to say that I did not believe that anybody was pro-abortionist on the other side, I said I would not believe it until they told me that they were.  I am sorry about the misunderstanding because I tried to avoid all that during the debate. I cannot be responsible for somebody else's interpretation of my remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an extraordinary debate in many ways and we in the Fine Gael Party are in a difficult situation.  For my own part and, indeed, I am sure I can speak for the majority of my colleagues, had there been any hope of there being a different vote in the other House or if there had been any possibility of an all-party committee to re-examine this matter we could have sent it back. However, I do not think that any useful purpose would have been served and I <Col N="1306" /> take issue with Senator Higgins on that one point.</P>
      <P>If one accepts, as I do, the Preamble to our Constitution then there is no need for this or any amendment to the Constitution to bolster the moral standing of the Irish people.  I am genuinely fearful that this constitutional amendment, if enacted by the people, will do violence to Irish family life and possibly force young Irish wives who cherish their children to travel abroad for life-saving operations.  I want to make it abundantly clear that if an amendment had been made providing for medical care for Irish mothers, and if that had been included in this measure, I would have been happy to vote for that and to vote for the measure before the House.</P>
      <P>As it now goes to the people, my personal position must be on the side of the Irish family and on the side of the Irish mothers.  On referendum day I will certainly find myself voting against this measure.  Throughout this debate in the Dáil, in the Seanad and in the public press there have been absolutely conflicting ideas from all the experts, from the legal people, the medical people and the theological people.  It is very difficult to arrive at a conclusion.  There is so much ambiguity in this that I think one must come out very positively on the side of the Irish mothers and give them the protection I believe they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two very brief points to make.  The first is with regard to Senator O'Leary's contribution.  He spoke about a greater respect for life now than at any time in our history, and also he said that the moral fibre of the nation was as healthy now as at any time in our history.  I would not disagree with that but this amendment did not originate on the basis of a lack of respect for life or the moral fibre of the people at the present time.  As I understand it, the reason this came about was that legalised abortion could be imposed on the people by a decision of the Supreme Court or by the European Court.  That was the sole reason for the amendment.  It was not related to any criticism of the moral fibre of the people.  Senator Higgins said it was <Col N="1307" /> disgraceful that the Fianna Fáil Party should keep their heads down in this matter but the Fianna Fáil Party have not kept their heads down in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to the block vote of the Fianna Fáil Party, that we are all unanimous here in the Seanad.  The question was raised whether some Members did not feel otherwise about this question.  I would ask the same question to the members of the Labour Party.  The same situation applies to them.  Did <Col N="1308" /> nobody in the Labour Party feel that they should speak otherwise than in the block way they did?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to assist voters at the referendum by making available to them a statement explaining the issue on which they are being asked to vote.  The proposed statement is prescribed in the Appendix to section 1 of the Bill and it sets out in full the text of the new subsection which the Eighth Amendment Bill proposes to add to Article 40.3 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that a polling card shall be sent to every voter, including postal voters, containing a copy of the prescribed statement.  The statement will also be displayed on posters in and in the precincts of polling stations. Presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out the statement to them, where necessary, and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposal and then marking the ballot paper in accordance with the voters' answers.  These arrangements are identical with those made in relation to previous referenda on Bills to amend the Constitution.  The arrangements are additional to the permanent provisions of <Col N="1309" /> the referendum law under which copies of Bills to amend the Constitution are made available in post offices for inspection free of charge and for sale at a price not exceeding two-and-a-half pence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister to the House.  It is the first occasion when I have been here that he has come to the House as Minister.  I did not detect any note of wonderful enthusiasm in his voice as he introduced this technical measure which follows as a consequence of the substantive Bill which passed, despite Labour opposition, through this House.  There are a number of points which I would like to make even on a technical Bill relating to this amendment because they reveal and further endorse some of the criticisms of the defective proposal on which people will be asked to vote.</P>
      <P>The Minister in introducing the Bill referred to the fact that it is proposed to assist voters by &ldquo;making available to them a statement explaining the issue on which they are being asked to vote&rdquo;.  It does not do that: as he goes on to say, it merely provides for a ballot paper that will have the precise text of the proposed amendment in it but it will not explain what that text means.  It would be very difficult to draw up an explanatory memorandum at this stage explaining what that text means.  We have been debating it in this House for a number of weeks. We have had very basic differences and a lot of questions have not been answered.  The ballot paper will contain the wording but it will not contain any explanation for the voters.  As I said on Second Stage of the Bill to amend the Constitution, the explanation will be left to a very random section of the political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey has said that the Fianna Fáil Party will not campaign as a party for this referendum.  I do not know if he will continue to say that but he certainly has gone on record as saying that Fianna Fáil will not campaign as a party for this referendum.  The Taoiseach has said that he will make a statement urging <Col N="1310" /> people to vote against the referendum.  It is clear that perhaps a significant number of members of the Fine Gael parliamentary party and the Fine Gael organisation will campaign against the amendment.  It is clear, also, that the Labour Party on the whole &mdash; certainly the Labour Party in the Seanad &mdash; will campaign against the amendment to the Constitution. Apart from that, there are pro and anti campaigns, which are largely organised on a voluntary basis and which also differ substantially in their composition and membership throughout the country.  To a very considerable extent, it looks as if the pro- and anti-amendment campaigns, in so far as they have emerged to date, will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this Bill is the technical measure relating in some way to conveying the message about this amendment to the voters it is worth underlining the unusual nature of the way in which the campaign is likely to be conducted.  Apart from the very unusual nature of the participation or, apparently, largely non-participation in a formal sense of the political parties, it is at least quite likely that the main thrust of the campaign will be organised by the pro-and anti-amendment groups, associations and individuals who come under those broad umbrellas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may well, if care is not taken, allow the campaign to polarise because, voluntary bodies, who are pushing for a particular sectional voice, sectional viewpoint or sectional interest, can attempt to polarise and to narrow the focus on an issue.  I greatly fear that in the absence of a substantial involvement by serious and responsible politicians and political parties that the debate could become a very narrow pro- and anti-abortion campaign. <Col N="1311" /> That is quite clearly not the issue that this constitutional amendment is proposing to deal with.  It is not, in fact, an issue of whether one is pro- or anti-abortion.</P>
    <P>Several Members of both Houses have made it clear that although they oppose the constitutional amendment they are anti-abortion and would not be in favour of legalising abortion.  Therefore, I would like to use the opportunity in contributing on Second Stage of this Bill to urge elected representatives to involve themselves in this unfortunate campaign.  We have to have it now.  We have a Bill proposing to amend the Constitution by way of the normal process which has to be validated or not in a referendum. Therefore, none of us can advocate our responsibility as elected representatives. We have had a lot more opportunity than the ordinary voter to inform ourselves, to become aware of the issues that are involved.  We must go out and campaign in the country and make sure that the issues are fully understood.</P>

It is important that the campaign is a fully informed one and that the elected representatives are actively involved in it.  I come now more closely to the wording of the Bill.  It is to me an unusual feature of it that the appendix, referring to what will be on the ballot paper, refers only to the English language of the amendment.

Since the Bill is passed in both languages &mdash; I see that it will be available for a mere 2½p to the Irish citizen, perhaps that is one of the cheapest things that can be purchased in the country at the moment &mdash; nevertheless, it would seem to be appropriate, when we are amending the Constitution in this manner, that both the English and Irish texts should go before the people.</P>
      <P>I have another comment to make on the appendix, which is what will be on the polling card.  It is on page 3 of the Bill.  It quotes what the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution proposes to do. Then it has these questions I referred to on Second Stage.  It appears to me that these are questions that cannot in fact be approved, or not approved by the voter because the voter will not have the knowledge and understanding of the text to do that.  It says: &ldquo;If you APPROVE of the proposal, mark X opposite the word YES on the ballot paper&rdquo;, or &ldquo;If you DO NOT APPROVE of the proposal mark X opposite the word NO on the ballot paper&rdquo;.  Then under No. 4 it says: &ldquo;A copy of the Bill can be inspected free of charge and purchased for two-and-a-half pence at any Post Office&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I considered and my colleagues in the Labour group here also considered, very seriously tabling a Committee Stage amendment to add subsection (5) there that we felt should also properly go on the polling card so that the voter could have a full appreciation of the issues.  We were prepared, in fact, to consider tabling an amendment inserting an official warning, to the effect that if this proposal is approved it could endanger the life of certain pregnant women.  Why <Col N="1313" /> give the text of it and just ask for approval or no approval without drawing attention to the very serious reservations?</P>
    <P>I made reference to the fact that we have warnings on cigarette packets, that they can endanger the health of citizens. Similarly on the polling card for citizens going to vote in this referendum it would not be either inappropriate or outlandish to suggest that there should be a warning that approval of the proposal may endanger the health of pregnant women.  I deliberately use &ldquo;may endanger&rdquo; so that, in fact, it would not be dogmatic, it would not be categorical or taking sides.  It would be a fair, further subsection because the issue certainly has been raised.  It is a view held by the Taoiseach. It is part, at least, of the apprehension of the Minister for Justice even if he does not wish to express it fully as that kind of view.  It is a view expressed in this House by the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs and by a number of contributors to the debate.  There is a real danger, if this amendment is approved, to pregnant women.</P>
    <P>One could add a few more specific points as part of the polling card explanation. If approved this constitutional amendment will affect various contraceptive practices which are available at the moment.  Women should know, going into the polling station, that it will very likely affect the availability of the IUD, the morning after pill and of the other types of contraceptives, which may have an effect of preventing implanation of the fertilised ovum.  That should be spelt out, whether on the polling card or in some sort of explanatory documentation in relation to the constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>That would be a much more practical and realistic approach than to try, in some sort of explanatory memorandum, to define life, to define the concept of the unborn and to define the equality of rights as between the woman or girl who is pregnant and the unborn, wherever life was determined to begin for the purposes of imbuing it with a constitutional right. All of that is abstract.  The real and practical point that could be brought to the <Col N="1314" /> attention of the voter and could well be on the polling card is the Government danger alert that it could affect the life and endanger the health of pregnant women and, secondly, that if passed this proposal could and probably will affect the access to various kinds of contraceptive devices.</P>
    <P>Voters in general and women in particular would know that this proposal is something that can and, I submit, will affect substantially the most intimate aspects of their relationship and will bring the Constitution in a very intrusive way into the most private decisions that husbands and wives and mothers and fathers may make.  It is, therefore, not an abstract issue and certainly in a narrow sense is not to be seen as an issue of whether one is pro- or anti-abortion.</P>
    <P>That is a very different issue which simply has not surfaced to any degree in this debate.  Anybody who has read the debate, particularly in this House, could only be struck by the lack of any substantial focus on the issue of abortion.  What was being focused on was the way in which this constitutional proposal would affect the texture of the lifestyle of people in the country, that it was proposing to impose a denominational view of when the life of the unborn begins, it would appear, and also whether it should be protected as a constitutional right and the consequent effect that would have on contraceptive practices and on medical decisions relating to the treatment of women in pregnancy.</P>
    <P>These practical consequences could be drawn to the attention of the voter.  They could be alerted in a polling card, in a sign outside the polling station or certainly, I hope, in the information made available in the course of the campaign by those opposing this amendment.  The concentration should be on those issues, on the practical, real consequences for ordinary women in this country and the way in which this amendment must be rejected.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to insert into a polling card the consequences for our external reputation, for this little country and how we are viewed outside by our friends who see us as moving into an age when the <Col N="1315" /> Constitution will be seen to reflect the majority religion, where that was accepted and not thought to be something that was in any way surprising because of the religious affiliation in the country.  Our friends from outside would view with dismay that kind of development. They would probably like a further addition on the polling card or on the sign outside the polling stations saying: &ldquo;This is the death knell of any constitutional crusade such as was launched only a few months prior to this particular initiative. You cannot have a pluralist society if you move in the direction of adoptinga Constitution like this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may be a little bit too abstract a notion to include on the polling card or in a big sign at the polling station.  I hope it will certainly be part of the broader information made available to the voter. I hope that the campaign will, as my colleague Senator Higgins emphasised in his Fifth Stage speech on the previous Bill, deal with the issues that we dealt with in this House over the last few days. Even if we cannot, in the course of the provisions of this Bill, legislate precisely for the additional information of a practical nature which we would like the voter to have in a polling card or at the polling station, that information will in other ways be made available when people come to exercise their vote.</P>
    <P>When the Minister returns, I hope that he will indicate to this House if he has a date in mind for the referendum.  It would be desirable that that date be put off for as long as possible.  I hope that it will be put off even until the autumn if that is within the possible limits of his discretion in the matter.  We are learning more as days go by, we are getting more information. As I mentioned already, the medical profession are providing more informed knowledge as to the dangers of this measure.  As time goes on, some of the initial certainty that this was a simple human rights issue has gone and we have begun to realise that it is anything but simple, it is very complex and, in order for it to be considered in all its complexity and in all its inappropriatness, it would be better that as much time <Col N="1316" /> as possible be allowed for the actual campaign for the referendum.  I hope the Minister will indicate to us what the date he intends to set for the referendum will be.</P>

      <P>Níl sé ar aigne agam oráid fhada a dhéanamh ar an mBille seo ach séard atá uaim ceist a chur ar an Aire Stáit: bhí fúm an cheist a chur ar an Aire an fhad is a bhí sé anseo maidir le leagan Gaeilge den Bhille seo.  Níl aon Ghaeilge ar an mBille seo.  Sin é an gnáth rud, measaim, do Bhille dá shórt seo, is é sin do Bhille a bhaineann le reifreann.  An cheist atá agam ná, an mbeidh aon Ghaeilge ar an bpáipéir vótála nó ar an gcárta vótála a chuirfear ós comhair na vótáláithe nuair a bheidh siad ag vótáil?</P>
      <P>This Bill is wholly in English and this is appropriate, I understand, to a Bill of its kind.  I had intended to ask the Minister the question, but unfortunately he had to go to the other House, will there be anything in Irish, in other words, will the voting paper put to the electorate be bilingual?  Will the voting card, or the ballot paper, as the case may be, be in Irish and in English, or will it be wholly in Irish?  That is my question.</P>
      <P>I am amazed and appalled at the suggestion Senator Robinson made that there should be some indication on the ballot paper or some information outside the polling stations that if this referendum is passed it would endanger the lives of mothers, in other words, that a warning should appear on the voting paper or that a similar enlarged poster will be outside the polling stations indicating to women voters that if this referendum is passed the lives of women would be endangered.  That procedure would be totally and abysmally unprecedented.  I believe that it would be wrong and out of character in a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Senator Robinson's suggestion will not be acceded to, because I believe that it would be unconstitutional.  We have been debating unconstitutional and constitutional issues for the better part of three or four days now.  I believe it would be unconstitutional to do so.  I submit that it be rejected totally by this House <Col N="1317" /> and, if not by this House, by the Government, of whom Senator Robinson has asked that it be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos aontaím go hiomlán leis an Seanadóir de Brún go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh an leagan Gaeilge ar fáil do na daoine a bheidh ag caitheamh a vótai san reifreann atá le teacht.  An tábhacht atá ag baint le sin ná go bhfuil na focail i nGeailge chomh dona sin go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh seans ag na vótaeirí a rogha a chur i gcrích orthu trí iad a chur ar ceal trí vóta &ldquo;níl&rdquo; a chaitheamh.  Tá sé tábhachtach, chomh maith le sin, gur féidir leis na vótaeirí comparáid a dhéanamh idir an leagan Gaeilge agus an leagan Béarla.  Mar a dúirt mé san díospóireacht ar an Cheathrú Céim den Bhille atá glactha anois ag an Seanad, tá difríocht mhór idir an leagan Béarla agus an leagan Gaeilge.  Tá brón orm nach raibh seans agam bheith anseo ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir de Brún nuair a bhí sé ag moladh an togha leagan Gaeilge a bhí i gceist ach léireoidh mé, más mian leis, céard go díreach atá i gceist.  Nuair a bhaintear úsáid, mar shampla, as cúpla focal &ldquo;na mbeo gan breith&rdquo; tá tú ag baint úsáid as focail gan brí.  Ar an gcéad dul síos an focal &ldquo;breith&rdquo;, mar atá eolas ag an Seanadóir, tagann sé ón focal &ldquo;beir&rdquo; agus mar bhunús leis sin tá an focal &ldquo;beo&rdquo;.  Tá tú ag caint faoin bhreith sar a mbíonn tú ag caint faoin rud beo.  Is féidir difríocht a bheith eadrainn faoi sin ach, gan dabht ar bith, i leith &ldquo;na mbeo&rdquo; níl sé léirithe ón méid a chuala mé ón Seanadóir de Brún bunús na bhfocal sin.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh leagan i nGaeilge os comhair na vótaeirí. Táim sásta tácaíocht a thabhairt don Seanadóir san méid sin.</P>
      <P>Tá sé de nós ag daoine na laethe seo aistriúchán beagnach díreach a dhéanamh ar an méid atá ráite acu i nGaeilge.  Níl sé sin de nós agam féin mar caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil mé beagán sean-fhaisiúnta faoi na cúrsaí sin. Labhraím i nGaeilge nuair atáim ag caint faoi chúrsaí Gaeilge agus níl sé de nós agam aistriúchán a dhéanamh.</P>

    <P>It is not my intention to repeat directly <Col N="1318" /> what I have just said in Irish because I do not subscribe to the now fashionable notion that one must translate every word one has said in the Irish language into English exactly because I believe that there is enough Irish in the country to understand the basic sense of what I have said and which I can say in a sentence.  It is most important that the Irish version be available with the English version so that people can see the sheer impossibility of reconciling one form in Irish with the form in English or, indeed, the internal inconsistency within both the formulation in English and the formulation in Irish.</P>
    <P>The only point worth translating about the Irish version is that in a lovely way &mdash; this is where Senator de Brún and I who are both committed to the Irish language will differ &mdash; the Irish language reveals the absolute absurdity of the words, because indeed in the words &ldquo;na mbeo gan breith&rdquo; the word &ldquo;beo&rdquo; cannot be derived from any verb and, in turn, the whole question of what it is that might be born could refer to the intentions on telephones of anybody who might ever want to have made love to somebody who might have become pregnant at any eon in the future.</P>

      <P>I want to come specifically to the Bill before us.  I will assist the Cathaoirleach and be very brief.  I have a few suggestions to make to the Minister of State about the Bill.  It would be terribly inconsistent of me if I had spoken on all Stages of the previous Bill if I did not endorse the statements made by Senator Robinson to say that this formulation of words that we have decided to put to the people is in itself incapable of explanation.  What can be explained &mdash; I support Senator Robinson in this &mdash; are the dangers inherent in the passage of the form of words.  It is more than an abstract suggestion of Senator Robinson that, quite frankly, the position of women is changed by the amendment.  It would be <Col N="1319" /> helpful if the attention of women was addressed to this fact.</P>
      <P>I have a question to put to the Minister of State in relation to this.  In a way, it is an extension of a remark that I made on the Final Stage of the previous Bill. Could the Minister of State indicate what steps will be taken to stop misconstructions of the amendment near polling stations? Let us be perfectly clear about this. We have had seven referenda before now in which we sought to change the Constitution about matters that could be explained rather simply.  Parties explained their positions and they invited the voters to vote yes or no.  Will the Minister of State say what will happen if the so-called pro-life movement distribute deliberately misleading leaflets outside polling stations?</P>

I am referring to the Electoral Act 1963 and to that part of this Bill which derives from that Act.  I must inform the House of my experience in this regard which is that people who are not bound by the normal disciplines of political parties, which is that the name of the director of elections be published on every piece of literature will not publish their address or identify their organisation.  If such people may come within the precincts of polling stations, in and near polling stations, what will we do?  The Cathaoirleach may suggest, as he has, that I am speaking of some kind of restriction on freedom of speech.  I am not&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The nature of elections and referenda is entirely that people who make statements accept responsibility for them.  For example, in the last election in Galway West, an organisation calling itself ISPUC distributed tens of thousands of leaflets outside polling stations. Later SPUC decided that it would dissociate itself from ISPUC.  Senator de Brún knows well that the leaflets were printed in Roscommon.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question about a referendum.  If I have to stand at a polling station inviting people to vote against this blatantly anti-woman referendum I will put my name at the bottom of any literature I distribute.  I am asking the Minister of State what actions he envisages taking to discipline organisations who are separate from the political parties in relation to the referendum. It should be remembered that we are in a very curious situation.  The Taoiseach is going to be sitting at home advising the people that they should vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but not campaigning.  Fianna Fáil are going to be on a higher plane suggesting that they will not be campaigning as an organisation <Col N="1321" /> but that they will be spiritually sending their organisation off in favour of the referendum, whatever that might mean.  I can only draw the conclusion that individuals, and groups, who are not used to the discipline of elections and referenda will present themselves outside polling stations and distribute, as they did in elections before now, literature that is irresponsibly worded.  If it is said that there will be a display of a statement of the words what action will be taken against those who display distortions of that statement in or near the precinct, people, for example, who might want to do so?  Of course one is entitled to call for votes for the capitalist party, vote for the socialist party or vote for the republican party.  Everybody has words that have no meaning often for many people, little letters and big letters; it depends what one means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that we are going to have organisations who are not disciplined by the normal electoral process and they are going to feel free.  For example, suppose they decide to print, &ldquo;vote for the unborn, vote yes.&rdquo;  What are we going to do about that?  This is not an academic matter for the Seanad.  It is not a matter of freedom of speech, it is a matter of the freedom of the voter to know the form of words.  I doubt if many people will be taking the entire Seanad debate and distributing it widely throughout the newspapers and so on.  What am I to do?  Am I to stand there and look at nine month old babies represented as the unborn, for example, on a leaflet or something like that or leaflets with bouncing babies calling on people to defend them?  Because of the unusual nature of this referendum we are entitled to ask what disciplines the Minister of State, and the Minister for the Environment have in mind in relation to the conduct of this election?  One might ask if I am not, late in the evening, introducing a red herring.  I am not.  Business commenced today with a complaint from a Senator about somebody who had already distorted this referendum in a leaflet that was condemned by everybody in this House.  That was done in Leitrim. It was in a parish newsletter that sought to distort the message of the referendum <Col N="1322" /> already.  I want it recorded that I sought in the Seanad a protection for the voter from distortion near, in and around the precincts of voting.</P>

      <P>I am about to finish and I am delighted if the Minister of State is about to tell me that under an appropriate section of the 1963 Act that sanctions are available to him.  I should like to tell him that these are unfortunately in practice.  It is a very appropriate time to say this because we are speaking about something that is derived from the Electoral Act, 1963.  It is a very important point to make now.  May I make the unfortunate suggestion that recently we had much publicity about abuses of electoral practices but always after they had taken place.  I am appealing to the Minister of State, and through him to the Minister for the Environment to say on this occasion, on this referendum above all else, he will advise the people in advance of the appropriate sections of the law and to display posters to show what the sanctions are under the Electoral Act, 1963.  I do not want, for example, to have to drag myself back after this referendum suggesting abuses, going through the courts and things like that.  I want to do what the Opposition have invited me to do, to allow the public to see the words for what they are.</P>
      <P>I support Senator de Brún in wanting the leagan Gaelach chomh maith lets an leagan Béarla.  He knows the reason for that is that my view of the Irish language is that it is a wonderful, beautiful language that celebrates life and love, and its verbs and structure cannot handle the misery of the suggestion of this referendum. He disagrees with me on that as he is entitled to.  I support that and, of course, I want the English version but I emphasise that it is absolutely necessary that warnings be distributed that groups who do not comply with the 1963 Electoral Act will be prosecuted and the Minister and the Minister of State, are going to have great difficulty in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> I should like to address the Opposition now.  I will give an example of it.  We recovered nearly 1,000 leaflets that were printed by an organisation calling itself CPAM Box AC36 which, when checked was the box No. of Lloyds Bank in London. That was an organisation printing a bogus address, pretending to be pro-life. We had an organisation calling itself ISPUC disowned by SPUC.  There is no point in coming along and being all polite after the referendum is over and, like I had to do, going to the Superintendent of the Garda who after carrying out an investigation will say that he has discovered that these are bogus addresses and he cannot identify the people who lodged thousands of these leaflets.</P>
    <P>We already know that in Leitrim there will be an attempt, not only completely to corrupt the form language of the referendum, but to defame, slander and libel people.  If we are going to have this appalling exercise which I have opposed from the beginning, let us use the 1963 Electoral Act, and the referenda Acts to make sure that these cowards will not appear again, the people, for example, as I mentioned in my discussion of the previous Bill, who appear from nowhere, with leaflets from nowhere and the worst cowards from the larger parties who will run out of their cars and say, give me a bundle of those to distribute.  Then, suddenly, the referendum is over and the seedy people have won.</P>
    <P>My view in this: I have accepted defeats in elections, referenda and different things but let us have standards and not have to go to the courts afterwards. Why should we have some unfortunate half-witted woman standing in front of a polling booth or a church to whom a bundle of leaflets has been given by a woman who owns a firm but who does not want to be identified or another person who stores the leaflets, collects them from some place in Roscommon and drives them to Galway and they are all safe except the poor half-witted woman whom I could, after the election, bring a case against for breaches of the Electoral Act?</P>
    <P>Let us handle all this in advance.  It is <Col N="1324" /> going to be a most unusual referendum. The Seanad can be sure that I will be out there inviting the people to say no to this most historic anti-woman measure ever suggested in the history of the State. We will have the organisations on each side and some individuals within parties doing what they feel is important and campaigning against the referendum.  What does it mean to say that the big parties are not campaigning?  Does it mean that there is going to be no polling day activity or that we are going to have &mdash; as people at one meeting described to me &mdash; the storm troopers?  Will the storm troopers of the extreme movements be outside the polling stations?</P>

I have no obligations in this because I did not ask for this exercise but on the Opposition side we have the people who got their form of wording while more people decided they can wash their hands of it.

      <P>When the Minister for the Environment first came into the House for the commencement of this debate I had intended to welcome him to the House, as did Senator Robinson, but I notice he did not stay very long.  In the <Col N="1325" /> circumstances I can well understand his feelings that he did not want to stay long to preside over the introduction of this Bill.  Unfortunately, the Minister's extreme lack of enthusiasm about his own Second Reading speech is probably mirrored by an even greater lack of enthusiasm by his Minister of State for the whole exercise in which they are engaged at present.  I was about to suggest that perhaps the Minister, and the Minister of State, should join in a type of strike against this Bill and putting it into effect.  Perhaps, having listened to what Senator Higgins has said, I might change my mind about that because if we have any hope of Ministers who would, in fact, use the Electoral Acts and use the Referendum Acts in the way Senator Higgins is suggesting in order to prevent abuses perhaps we should be relying on the Minister for the Environment, and Minister of State, who would at least feel enthused about trying to stop this kind of abuse.  I will not encourage them to follow the example of the Minister for Health who managed to shift the previous Bill out of his Department entirely by simply refusing to deal with it.  I hope, despite their lack of enthusiasm about putting this into effect, that in their carrying out of their onerous and unwelcome duties they will follow the suggestions made by Senator Higgins and take steps to prevent the issuing of unidentifiable propaganda and the general abuse of the Electoral Acts which could occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the Bill, and what is laughingly called an explanatory memorandum about the amendment which is to appear on polling cards, I agree with Senators de Brún, Higgins and Robinson that this should appear in Irish and English.  For the sake of peace in my house I had better say that.  It is not just a question of are the Irish words right or wrong or what way the Irish words are put: it is also a question of the fact that there are not just people here who speak Irish as well as speaking English, there are people for whom Irish is their first language.  It is their requirement, and right, to have the polling cards in the Irish language.  Recently, a lady was prepared to go to jail because her parking ticket <Col N="1326" /> was not in the Irish language.  I suggest that if in such an important matter as this the polling cards are not in the Irish language people would be justified in being willing to go to jail rather than deal with the matter in a language which may not be their first language.</P>
    <P>However, to go on to the so-called explanatory statement, I realise it is practically impossible to explain the unexplainable and if one thing has emerged from the debate in the House it is that this wording is unexplainable.  It is understandable if the Minister for the Environment, and the Minister of State, in the Bill cannot put forward any better explanation.</P>
    <P>I suggest, referring to another section of the Bill, that blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters are far from being the only ones who will need help in trying to understand this.  Perhaps we should have explanatory leaflets or booklets issued to us during the course of the run-up to the referendum.  I seem to recall that a few years ago the State issued a large number of booklets on Civil Defence which were circulated to every family telling us what to do in the case of a nuclear war attack. This referendum will be more likely I hope to affect people's lives than the likelihood of a nuclear war here.  Perhaps it might be well spent money to issue an explanatory booklet which will sum up the arguments made on both sides.  There was even a time when we had a vast issue of free toothbrushes to prevent any danger to our children's teeth.  That was not so long ago either.  There may be danger to more than our teeth in this referendum and, perhaps, we could have the issuing of a free booklet about it instead of this bare statement which is not, I submit, an explanation of what is going on. Although this may be described as a red herring it is red booklets we may well be drowned in by the time the referendum comes.  The blood dimmed tide of leaflets of the sort described by Senator Higgins may be even higher than it has been already.  I join with other Senators in saying that we need to be careful about this kind of campaign.  People are very quick to condemn politicians and say they fail to do this or that, but at least politiness <Col N="1327" /> cians are accustomed to election campaigns, they know the rules and while they may stretch them a bit here and there by and large they stick by them. They do not try to push crude propaganda of an absolutely deceptive nature.</P>
    <P>There is the aspect of the non-printing of leaflets and the other aspect of Electoral Acts where the cost of mounting campaigns is limited.  I wonder will there be checks on this.  With the enormous issue of propaganda on one side or the other it has been suggested that money comes from abroad to finance this.  Will there be checks on how much this costs? This has only occurred to me recently and I have not had an opportunity to check how this applies to referenda as opposed to elections.  Is there any limit on the amount which one side or another may spend in their campaign?  I share Senator Higgins' concern that the storm troopers might well be out with their quantities of leaflets.  In this connection I am reminded that in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper the other day I read that the pro-life people in Spain who were also trotting out Mother Theresa on their side greeted her not alone with their pro-life slogans but with the fascist salute.  Perhaps, storm troopers are not the wrong words to use.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the explanatory memorandum should be enlarged by some clearer and fuller explanation of what is implied by the wording and the Minister should make every possible effort to prevent in advance abuses of the Electoral Acts which may occur in this campaign.</P>

      <P>I always give way to the ladies.  In the main the debate on the previous Bill over the last few weeks has been constructive but we have strayed a bit from that in the last hour or so.  In fact, I am rather appalled at some of the suggestions made by Senator Robinson. I hope her suggestions are not taken <Col N="1328" /> seriously by the Minister.  One I am referring to in particular is that a Government warning should be on the ballot paper, or displayed in a prominent position inside and outside the polling booths, to the effect that should the referendum be carried it could endanger life.  She was referring principally to the female voters.</P>
      <P>Those on the opposite side to Senator Robinson could equally claim that a warning should be on ballot papers that should the amendment be lost the life of unborn children could be in danger.  They have equal claim to have that on the ballot paper as the other warning.  They are those who claim that if the amendment is lost there would be a lobby for legalised abortion but if I went on on that subject I am sure the Cathaoirleach would call me to heel.  The Cathaoirleach has been quite generous to some of those who took part in the debate on this Bill and allowed them to stray into areas that should have been debated on the previous Bill.</P>

      <P>They were over and over again.  I welcome the Bill and I am sure the country welcomes it.  I am sure everybody will welcome the Minister announcing the date of polling as soon as possible.  That brings me to a point I wish to raise with the Minister of State.  It may be unfair to ask him to give us an indication as to when polling might take place, because that depends on the day the Minister makes the order.  I understand that polling day must not be before 30 and not after 90 days of the Minister making the order.  When there is that 60 days in which the polling can take place, it is good latitude for people to make arrangements, I should like to ask the Minister to give serious consideration to giving an early indication as to when polling might be.  Senator Robinson asked that the poll be left over until the autumn and that consideration should be given some serious thought because there are many people who will be anxious to cast their vote on this issue and are now arranging holidays.  I am sure it is pointless putting it to the Minister to consider <Col N="1329" /> making arrangements for people who might be holidaying in the State to vote if they have their polling cards with them. As there will not be constituencies involved as such it might be possible to permit persons with an address in Dublin to vote in Cork or Kerry, or wherever they may be on holiday.  It may lend itself to great abuses.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that presiding officers or polling clerks who cross from one constituency to another are permitted to vote in the station they are serving.  It has happened in Dáil elections, particularly in Dublin areas, where returning officers find it necessary to minimise as far as possible the dispersing of the staff from one constituency to another.  Many votes are lost in general elections in this way and I am sure the same occurs in other cities such as Cork and Limerick.  Many people who work in my constituency at polling stations cannot vote because they preside in a neighbouring constituency.  As the ballot paper will be the same in all constituencies I ask the Minister of State to ensure that those who must move from one constituency to another to serve in these polling stations are given the opportunity to cast their votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more serious matter is the notifying or the giving of some indication to the country of the polling date.  People may be confused now but I have no doubt that as the campaign gets under way they will give it more serious thought.  I have no doubt that the poll will be greater than some anticipate.  The Minister should ensure that as many people as possible have an opportunity of casting their vote. His greatest contribution to this would be to give an early indication of at least the month when polling will take place.  He should give some consideration to putting it back until after the holiday period now that it is not possible to have polling before the holiday period.  It must be remembered that people without family ties take holidays from June.  Certainly, July and August should be out as far as polling is concerned.  It would be a reflection on the Minister if he held the referendum during the peak holiday months. It may be possible to have it in June but the time is drawing very close.  Even if <Col N="1330" /> the month of June is considered it must be remembered that it is a holiday period. It is a serious matter and one I ask the Minister to take into consideration.</P>

It is Fianna Fáil wording opposed by the Attorney General and by the Government.  The Bill incorporating wording by the Attorney General came through the Lower House and was defeated in favour of the Fianna Fáil wording and it is now here before us with the Minister for the Environment from the Labour Party, the Minister of State from the Labour Party and the only opposition to the Bill comes from the <Col N="1331" /> main group of the Labour Party.  It is the most extraordinary Bill that has come in here and is not being pushed by the Minister of State or by the Minister who left the House after making a brief entry and a speedy exit and has not returned. Nevertheless the wording must be infallible because neither of the Government parties could fault it in its transit to the Seanad.

Nevertheless, I will go on and I will adhere to the terms of the Bill before us as much as I possibly can.  Fortunately or unfortunately if I go away from the terms of the Bill it will not be my fault.</P>
      <P>To do as was suggested by Senator Robinson and put notices oil the polling cards would be completely illegal.  In the next breath Senator Higgins said that if these pro-life people are allowed in the precincts of polling booths to display their goods that that would be out of order.  I do not know what terms or what wording the Senator intended to use, but people going into a polling booth in the future will not be making their minds up at that time whether notices are displayed inside or outside the polling booth.  We have taken a decision on whether we will campaign in this referendum and the decision is that we will not campaign.  We do not underestimate the intelligence of the Irish people to define for themselves which wording should be accepted.  They can say yes or no, or tá or níl in this referendum.  It is very simple.  I listened very attentively to a constructive debate on the referendum in this House and I will make up my own mind very quickly in connection with the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The referendum paper should be bilingual. The referendum should be held as soon as possible.  A great deal of the legislative time of both Houses and especially this House has been taken up with this debate and the people are anxious to give their decision on this issue.  While I do not want to prejudice the result of this referendum I am confident of the outcome because of the failure to change the wording that is going before the people now by everybody who was opposed to it.  Many people do not like that wording because it was ours.  Nevertheless, it is <Col N="1333" /> foolproof and infallible and I recommend it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to tell us the date of the referendum.  The Bill before us is a mechanical Bill.  Senator de Brún moved in as spokesman on this side but I would have no intention of moving away from the terms of the Bill but for the latitude that was given to the previous speakers.  However, I know that the mechanics of the Bill are the same as any other constitutional amendment local Government provisions.  It will be a matter for the returning officers in the various constituencies to effect the laws in accordance with the Act and I am sure that they will do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would first of all like to convey to the House the expression of regret from the Minister who was unable to return following the division in the other House due to commitments at a Cabinet meeting.  I have been made aware of and acquainted with the points that were made in my absence and during his presence and in the spirit in which this debate has obviously commenced I will attempt to be very brief and to the point.</P>
      <P>Firstly, the standard practice &mdash; a point made by Senator de Brún and I suspect by some others as well &mdash; is that both versions in both official languages of the State will be made available to the electors when they go to the polling stations. The normal process within these Houses is that the English language version is printed first and the official translation follows, as Senators are, no doubt, aware.  There is no proposal to change that procedure arid the Irish language version and the English language version will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point, and I am not taking them necessarily in sequence, was raised by Senator McMahon and Senator O'Toole &mdash; the question of the fixing of the date.  The Government have made no decision in relation to the day on which polling will take place.  As the House is aware, the provision is not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days, so effectively the earliest possible time for such <Col N="1334" /> a polling day would be the end of June &mdash; 28 or 29 June.  This is in answer to Senator McMahon's question regarding holiday time and I regret to tell the Senator, to get the arithmetic clear, that it will probably be some time between the end of June and the beginning of September because of the constraints of law. This may have the effect, regarding holiday time, that the Senator referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not that discretion. We need to make the order in not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days and we must fix the day within that period once the legislation has gone through.  So we do not have the discretion that the Senator appears to suggest we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it 30 days from the time the order is made or from the time the debate finishes in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Senator's pardon, I have apparently misled the House.  It is 30 days from when the order is made, so if the Government make the order it is 30 days from then.  I thank him for that correction.  We have that discretion.  I will convey to the Minister and to the Government the views that have been expressed in relation to this.</P>
      <P>On the question of postal voting and the other changes, we are confined by the existing law with which every Member of this House is already familiar and, therefore, the matters of postal voting and transfer of votes, to which Senator McMahon referred, cannot be changed in the present climate, I regret to say.  I will draw the House's attention to the fact that the report of the working party for the register of electors has been circulated. There was a debate in the other House in relation to it and those matters will be dealt with subsequently, but for the purposes of this poll the provisions governing postal voting and all the other matters relating to voting in polling stations apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I want to turn to the point that was raised with some considerable &mdash; and <Col N="1335" /> in my personal view &mdash; justifiable concern by Senator Michael Higgins in relation to the way in which the campaign will be conducted and to the legal matters relating to the publication and printing of material.  Senators will be aware of the procedure whereby in elections for political office in constituencies party political emblems cannot be worn inside the precincts of the polling stations.  The only material permitted to be put on display, as set out in the Act, is the text of the statement set out in this Bill in both languages. Any other literature must be outside the precincts of the polling station &mdash;&ldquo;precincts&rdquo; being defined by the returning officer in the traditional manner. In my experience in by-elections the definition varies considerably from place to place but there is a convention which appears to be accepted.</P>
    <P>In relation to the more worrying point &mdash; which I find very worrying &mdash; about the kind of anonymous literature that has been circulated in the past, I would draw the House's attention to section 13 of the Prevention of Electoral Abuses Act, 1922 to which the Referendum Act, 1942 refers.  For the benefit of the House I will read it out to put it on record.  It refers in part to some of the concern that Senator McGuinness referred to in her comments. The section is as follows:</P>
    <P>Every bill, placard, or poster having reference to an election shall bear upon the face thereof the name and address of the printer and publisher thereof; and any person printing, publishing, or posting or causing to be printed, published, or posted, any such bill, placard, or poster as aforesaid, which fails to bear upon the face thereof the name and address of the printer and publisher, shall, if he is a candidate, or the election agent of a candidate, be guilty of an illegal practice, and shall, if he is not a candidate, or the election agent of a candidate, be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds.</P>
    <P>There is provision obviously within that section for sanctions in relation to some of the abuses to which Senator Higgins <Col N="1336" /> referred.  We will have due regard to all of the points which have been made on this Second Stage debate in relation to that point and see what action can, within the operation of the law, be taken by us.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all of the points that have been raised by Senators on Second Stage.  I do not believe I have omitted anything and I will conclude.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I raised the point with the Minister on Second Stage about the possibility of people acting as presiding officers and polling clerks in neighbouring constituencies being able to cast their votes.  There have been instances in my constituency and in neighbouring constituencies where a person living only, perhaps, a 100 yards away is serving in a polling booth up the street and has not, because of the difference in the ballot papers, been able to cast a vote.  Surely it would be possible to permit such voting on this occasion on the usual presentation to the inspector of his or her polling card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Séamus de Brún</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the assurances of the Minister that the only matter that may appear on the polling card is the usual matter that is allowed on the card under such circumstances.  I said initially when I rose to seek an assurance <Col N="1337" /> that the matter on the polling card on polling day would be in both languages, that is in Irish and in English, I did that with sincerity, because of my interest in the language, and particularly for the people in the Gaeltacht areas and also for the people outside the Gaeltacht areas whose daily language is Irish and who would be very disappointed if both languages would not be on the voting card in this referendum.</P>
      <P>I said also that I was appalled at the request that Senator Robinson had made that a guarantee or a warning would be on the voting paper warning women voters that if this referendum were passed women's lives might be in danger.  I was sincere in that and I would be very concerned if such a warning would be on the voting paper.  I hope that such a procedure is illegal.  I believed that Senator Robinson was not serious, but it appears that she was serious because she got a certain amount of support from her colleague, my adversary to a slight extent in this debate, that is Senator Higgins.  I call him my adversary in friendly terms in that we seemed to be differing about the meaning of the wording of the amendment before us.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins still insists that he does not understand that part of the wording &mdash;&ldquo;Admhaíonn an Stát ceart na mbeo gan breith chun a mbeatha&rdquo;.  I thought I made that quite clear here today when I elaborated to some considerable extent on it.  If I understood Senator Higgins rightly when he spoke on the last day here on this Bill, he said that the word &ldquo;breith&rdquo; related to the word &ldquo;beir&rdquo;.  That is true.</P>

      <P>I was not aware, a Chathaoirligh, that on occasions you etymologically teased each other in this House, but it certainly is a pastime that seems to provide a certain degree of encouragement and pleasure anyway.</P>
      <P>To refer to Senator McMahon's point, there is provision under the present legislation to enable a person who is a presiding officer in a polling station and who has a vote in that constituency to vote in the polling station where he or she is working, but which is not the polling station where that vote is registered. There is no provision to enable someone who is working as a presiding officer, or polling clerk of one kind or another in a polling station outside his constituency to vote.  It is an anomoly which we will certainly look at in the context of legislation. For the time being I would simply suggest to people who may take up such a job &mdash; Senator McMahon is perhaps bearing this in mind &mdash; that they would attempt to get placed in polling stations within their constituencies so that they could both vote and work on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hesitate to follow the road of Senator de Brún in relation to the points that he <Col N="1340" /> made but on a personal note I share many of the views expressed by my colleagues in the Labour Party and with Senator Robinson and Senator Higgins in relation to this, but the debate is over in relation to the main matter, and I am sure that the Chair would at this stage not like me to open that matter up again.  So I will stick strictly to the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Minister any further here today, but I think there is a precedent in previous referenda regarding a person moving from one constituency to another in the Dublin area as distinct from a person moving out of his own electoral area to another area, within his constituency, whereby a polling clerk or a presiding officer was permitted to vote.  I would ask the Minister to investigate this fully before polling day or before the instructions go out to the returning officers for the various constituencies.  Or, if it is not possible to give such instructions to returning officers, then he should issue some instruction to them to keep personnel within their constituencies so that it will be possible for as many people as are eligible to vote.</P>
      <P>In relation to a point raised by Senator Robinson and others on the Second Stage regarding the control of literature, the Minister was good enough to put on the record of the House just now the section of the Act which indicates such control. However, I suggest that the £100 maximum fine will be no deterrent.  I should also like to ask is it a £100 fine for an organisation operating in the entire country or operating in a particular constituency, or does it refer to each polling booth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the first point that Senator McMahon has raised, we will certainly look at what he has suggested. If there are precedents we will take them on board and we will do what we can to facilitate everybody in the exercise of his vote in what will undoubtedly be, as far as this Government are concerned, a free election.  Let that be quite clear.  I am not a lawyer, and I may not be reading or interpreting section 13 <Col N="1341" /> of the 1923 Act correctly, but it does refer specifically to every bill, placard or poster having reference to an election or, in this instance, a referendum, being affected. The critical thing is whether somebody standing outside a polling station and handing you a handbill, can be deemed to be covered by the words &ldquo;either published or posted&rdquo; in this section.  As a lay person, my view is that handing something from one hand to another is posting it &mdash; there are more qualified people in this House to comment on that &mdash; and that they are liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100.  So, in fact, for every time you hand out one of these things it is conceivable that that sanction is there.</P>
      <P>The spirit to which Senator Higgins was referring is not exclusive to this.  In a political debate in an open, democratic society &mdash; and there are not that many societies around on this globe &mdash; anybody who goes to the trouble of printing on paper his point of view in a free election should have the courage and be encouraged to print it publicly and openly and to identify himself.  Otherwise such people are taking the benefits of democracy and evading the responsibility.  In so far as we have any function in the Custom House &mdash; and I regret that we have any function at all on a personal note &mdash; we will try to ensure that those standards in democracy are maintained.  I think all sides of the House would share with me the spirit in which that comment is made regarding the openness of democracy and the requirement upon everybody who has the freedom to print and articulate a point of view of identifying himself in a particular manner.</P>

      <P>It is still not abundantly clear, and indeed the Minister has admitted that he is no lawyer and he is not interpreting the section of the Act, but is it the case that every person who hands out a bill is subject to a maximum fine of £100 or is every bill that each person hands out subject to a maximum fine of £100?  I suggest to the Minister that it could be argued if there was a prosecution on these lines that the bill being handed out, whether in Galway, <Col N="1342" /> Roscommon, Cork or Dublin, is the same bill, and as it was only handed out on the one day as a single print, it is subject to a maximum fine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Cathaoirieach for allowing me to being this matter into the House for discussion and to highlight the problem with regard to St. Joseph's Hospital in Coole.  I should like to congratulate the Minister of State and wish him the best of luck in his new undertaking.</P>
      <P>I have addressed the House on several occasions but not when you were in the Chair, a Leas-Chathaoirligh and I want to congratulate you and wish you well.  I know it is only the start of greater things for you.  You treated us very fairly when you were in the Chair in the last Seanad and I have no doubt that you will do the same for us in this Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to call on the Minister to reconsider his decision with regard to St. Joseph's Hospital, Coole.  The hospital is situated on 12 acres.  The entire building <Col N="1343" /> is perfectly maintained and contains four wards, a modem operating theatre, recreation hall, a physiotherapy room, hydrotherapy pool, laundry, five classrooms, dining halls, playgrounds, workshops, sunken bathrooms etc., all on the ground floor and covering in all 75.000 square feet.  There is bed space for over 150 adults.  There is also an administration building, a nurses' home containing over 50 rooms and a doctors' suite.</P>
    <P>All this arose from a reply from Deputy Desmond, Minister for Health, to one of our local Oireachtas representatives, Deputy Gerry L'Estrange.  He stated in the letter to the Deputy that since the closure of Coole hospital in 1981 considerable thought had been given by both the Midland and North-Eastern Health Boards in conjunction with his Department to devising a scheme whereby the hospital could be used in the health services.  He said that no realistic proposal had emerged, which was hardly surprising as both the location and structure of the building stood in the way of it being used for health purposes.  The health board have written back to the Minister asking him to reconsider his decision.  How can the Minister condemn something he has not even seen?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that a hospital such as St. Joseph's in Coole, which is in perfect structural condition, could not be erected at today's prices for anything less than £5 million or £6 million. With no money available to build a similar structure, St. Joseph's in Coole can be used immediately at very little expense.  It is a disgrace to leave Coole hospital lying idle when there is such a great need for a hospital with its potential. In present financial circumstances, this valuable asset should not be lost. This hospital, which is awaiting occupancy, is threatened by so-called experts who say it has outlived its usefulness, at a time when the Midland Health Board admit widespread overcrowding.  This is not the view of the ordinary Westmeath person.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, went on public record to say that Coole hospital was not suitable for <Col N="1344" /> health services.  With all due respect to the Minister, who has not been to Coole, he has been badly advised.  The Health Board have made four suggestions to the Minister as to how they could service Coole hospital and keep it open as a hospital.</P>
    <P>We all know there is a crying need for facilities for adult mentally handicapped patients.  With 150 beds available this could alleviate the problem to some extent.  Coole hospital is only 12 miles from St. Loman's in Mullingar and it is only three miles from St. Peter's hospital in Castlepollard.  It could not be said to be out in the wilderness and too far away to take patients of that nature.  At present there is a two to three year waiting period for hip operations and hip replacements in Navan hospital.  If Coole hospital were in operation this waiting list would be reduced greatly.  As we have the highest unemployment &mdash; 18 per cent &mdash; in north-west Meath of the five midland counties, it would help in no small way to have State participation to keep jobs in rural Ireland.  This is a very fine hospital in a beautiful part of the country.  It is in perfect repair and is needed for the treatment and accommodation of the sick.  It is also needed to give employment to our people.  As the only Oireachtas Member living in the Coole electoral area, I personally invite the Minister to come down to see this very valuable unit, which could be a great asset to the State, before making his final decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Minister of State for coming to listen to our plea with regard to St. Joseph's in Coole.  I should like to wish him well, he is a man for whom I have a great personal regard.  I do not reside in the Coole electoral area but Coole hospital is situated about 12 miles from Oldcastle and I know it very well.  I had the pleasure and honour of entertaining young patients for many years.  Coole hospital has served the needs of the people of the midlands and Meath areas for many years.  Young, physically handicapped children were brought to Coole hospital and, thanks to the care and expertise of the medical staff <Col N="1345" /> of the time and the Sisters of Charity, many of these young people have turned out to be great athletes.  I know some of them personally.</P>
      <P>What happened in the intervening years was that through modern day medicine and early detection etc., the numbers being admitted to Coole hospital bacame fewer and fewer.  The unit was not viable and its full facilities were not utilised.  The Sisters decided to withdraw. While that situation existed in Coole with regard to the facilities it was originally intended to provide, at the same time the North-Eastern Health Board had an input into hospital down through the years as the surgeon, Dr. McGrath from the orthopaedic unit of Our Lady's Hospital in Navan performed operations in Coole hospital.  Orthopaedic operations were being carried out in Meath and in other areas and matters reached a chronic stage.  We have not got the facilities in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan and they have not got them in the Midland Health Board either.  The North-Eastern Health Board serve the needs of parts of Westmeath, Longford and other areas.  We are terribly cramped for space.</P>
      <P>We have a hospital in Coole worth £5 million to £6 million which is left idle.  It is a perfect structure and all wards are at ground level.  It has ramp facilities that many hospitals have not got.  It could be used in many different ways.  There is an urgent need for accommodation for mentally handicapped adults.  There is need for long-term geriatric beds and long-term post-operative orthopaedic space. I can assure the Minister there is nothing political in my motivation in supporting this matter.  I refer to a letter sent to me on 1 July 1981 from the chief executive officer of the North-Eastern Health Board.  I tabled a notice of motion as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the North-Eastern Health Board take note of the present intention to dispose of Coole hospital and that every effort should be made to ensure that patients for whom the North-Eastern Health Board is responsible shall continue to have the benefit <Col N="1346" /> of access to the services which this hospital has.</P>
    <P>In the course of his letter the CEO stated:</P>
    <P>Since talking to you last, I have had a long discussion with the Chief Executive Officer of the Midland Health Board.  He is, at the moment, in active negotiation with the Bishop of Meath and the Trustees of Coole and he intends making an offer for the hospital and its facilities in the near future.  He has assured me that our needs will be provided for in Coole and knowing him of old I am quite satisfied that, being a man of his word, we will have no problem there.</P>
    <P>I have also asked him that in the event of his negotiations on behalf of the Midland Health Board breaking down with the Trustees that he will advise me immediately and I will then seek to negotiate on behalf of the North-Eastern Health Board.  This would, of course, have to be subject to Departmental and Ministerial approval.  Nonetheless, I take your point fully that this matter is urgent and that action is required rather than words.  I would mention, however, that Coole hospital is, of course, within the territory of the Midland Health Board and it should, by right, have first chance in seeking to make arrangements which will allow us all to continue in Coole.</P>
    <P>I hope the above will be satisfactory and I am fairiy certain that a reasonable and acceptable compromise can be worked out by the Midland Health Board in relation to for Coole.</P>
    <P>He then goes on to mention staff with which we are not concerned here, although as local people we are very concerned about what happened to the staff there.</P>
    <P>That letter was from the chief executive officer of the health board and it is a complete contradiction of what is outlined in the Minister's statement.  I would like to know what happened in the space of two years to have Coole hospital regarded as a non-viable unit.  I would <Col N="1347" /> like to know where the Minister got his information.  I believe there is some move to regionalise and provide a unit perhaps in Athlone which will cost the taxpayers £10 million while, at the same time, we by-pass the existing hospital at Coole which in the opinion of the CEO and the doctors employed there is quite fit to meet the needs of the locality.</P>
    <P>I believe it is time to call a halt to over-regionalisation.  Rural communities are losing their identities rapidly due to a policy geared entirely towards monopoly urban development.  This policy in all areas of development is crippling employment prospects in rural Ireland. The cost to the State is astronomical in terms of the cost of implementation of these programmes and the very high unemployment figures.  I invite the Minister and the Minister of State to visit Coole hospital.  I can guarantee they will be pleasantly surprised and will be given food for thought.  Then I am sure they will agree with the sentiments expressed here by Senator Cassidy, by myself and all the elected representatives in the Longford-Westmeath constituency and the Meath-Westmeath constituency also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I wish to make a very brief contribution with regard to Coole hospital is that one of my very close friends has a child who was treated satisfactorily at Coole hospital. The child had a very serious foot problem which, fortunately, was discovered in time and the child spent a considerable period in the hospital.  She was very successfully treated and almost miraculously cured and is now in perfect health.  There are many other instances of children from my locality who have been treated in Coole hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that 80 per cent of the staff are still unemployed.  In the Minister's letter to Mr. L'Estrange he says &ldquo;You will appreciate that in the present difficult budgetary situation we simply must allocate financial resources to best effect&rdquo;.  I know of many cases &mdash; as, I am sure, do many other Members &mdash; where people are waiting for up to four years to be admitted to orthopaedic hospitals for hip <Col N="1348" /> operations.  It seems to me that we are simply reducing the services and this is not acceptable.  If we continue along these lines we will create a situation where when funds run out the institutions will simply close down.  I am concerned about this.  Numerous people have called to me who are awaiting admission to orthopaedic hospitals but the hospitals are booked out for a very long time into the future.  Because positions are not being filled due to financial problems the waiting lists are building up.  Instead of reducing the number of people waiting for admission to hospital the figures are building up.</P>
    <P>The position of Coole hospital should be reconsidered.  As Senator Lynch said, it is a very suitable premises.  It has ramps which are not available in most other places.  It is a pity that the hospital cannot be used for the purpose for which it was intended.  The requirement is there and I am sure something could be done to get the necesary finances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>All health services must be planned in a rational and realistic manner if we are to make the best use of the scarce resources which can be made available.  While this principle applies to all services, it applies with even greater force to the hospital and other institutional services which take the highest proportion of health expenditure.</P>
      <P>Over the past six or seven years detailed consideration has been given to the planning of hospital facilities in the Midland Health Board area.  These plans have been carefully developed to ensure that an adequate hospital service is available to the population of the area within the constraints of available funds.  The planning of the first phase of the development of the general hospital at Mullingar has reached an advanced stage.  This phase of the development provides for maternity and paediatric facilities which are urgently needed and I have already indicated my intention to allow this scheme to proceed at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that in some respects the health services in the midland area are <Col N="1349" /> not as fully developed as they might be. This applies in particular to paediatrics and orthopaedics.  The development at Mullingar will relieve the situation in relation to paediatrics and in the meantime I am examining a proposal from the health board to establish this service in the interim at Tullamore and Portlaoise. The health board are currently studying the possibility of establishing an orthopaedic service at Athlone and I am awaiting their proposals on this.  I have recently given approval for the completion of the final phase of the geriatric home in Longford and for the re-wiring and the installation of fire alarms at the geriatric home in Mullingar.  I am satisfied that these developments when completed will provide the population of the area with a level of hospital facilities which is adequate for its needs and on a par with services elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In considering these developments I was, of course, acutely aware of the fact that there is a hospital at Coole which has been closed since 1981 and I gave serious consideration to the possibility of using Coole for some of the services which I have mentioned.  However, I must point out that since the closure of Coole considerable thought has been given by the Midland Health Board and the North-Eastern Health Board in association with my Department to developing a proposal which would make a viable use of this hospital in the health service.  However, no realistic scheme has emerged and this is hardly surprising when the facts are considered.</P>
    <P>First, there would be considerable capital expenditure involved in acquiring the hospital and adopting it to modern day standards.  Then, of course, there would be hefty annual revenue implications as well.  Because of this I could not sanction any proposal in relation to Coole unless the health boards were prepared to give it a higher priority than the other proposals for developments in their areas. This the health boards were not prepared to do.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the location of the hospital has to be considered.  It is situated towards the northern end of the health board area and as such is not a suitable <Col N="1350" /> location for a regional service such as orthopaedics.  In addition, it is located in a somewhat isolated area, removed from any sizeable centre of population.  This fact alone makes it unsuitable for the care of, say, geriatric or mentally handicapped patients since the whole emphasis in the development of services for such patients is to integrate them as far as possible into the community.  This simply would not be possible at Coole.</P>
    <P>Other factors also have to be borne in mind.  For example, the hospital was only about 50 per cent occupied for the last four or five years it was open and prior to its closure there were only 30 patients there although it had accommodation for 114.  Also the previous occupiers of the hospital, The Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, had considerable difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained staff.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, well aware that a basic hospital facility does exist at Coole but any one of the factors which I have outlined puts a serious question mark over it.  Taken together, all these considerations are quite compelling and suggest that Coole can have no place in the hospital services of the future.</P>
    <P>I could not give approval to any scheme which would consume scarce resources for no sound reason other than to continue in use the vacant buildings at Coole. I should add that Coole is in no way unique.  For example, we are actively planning for the closure of certain hospitals in Dublin as major developments there come on-stream and since assuming office I have approved the closure of the maternity hospital at Trim.</P>
    <P>To be frank, it is my view that the hospital at Coole is not suitable for use as a health care facility and I see no possibility of using it as such.</P>
