      <P>Molaim don Seanad Pádraig MacRaghnaill a cheapadh mar Chathaoirleach den tSeanad.  Tá sé mar bhall den Oireachtas le fada an lá agus is an-oiriúnach é don phost atá le líonadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recommending Senator Patrick J. Reynolds as Cathaoirleach for this House, I am recommending somebody who has a long experience in public life. For over 40 years he has been a member of Leitrim County Council.  For over 20 years he has been a Member of Oireachtas Éireann.  He has been elected to both Houses: three times to the Dáil, four times to the Seanad.  Since it is now four-three in the Seanad's favour, I am very glad that he has seen the light in this regard.  He is in every way a worthy person to preside over the deliberations of the Seanad.  Senators who were Members <Col N="9" /> of the Seanad in the past have had experience of him as a member of the Cathaoirleach's panel of temporary chairmen.  In presiding over the House, he has done so with judgment, with humour and at all times with very definite fairness.  He has shown what a Latin author defined as the mark of a good chairman, that is, to be <i>suaviter in modo, fortiter in re.</i>  He has those qualities which this House seeks in its Chairmen and, I may say, has found in Chairmen in recent years.  I have great pleasure in proposing Senator Reynolds.</P>

      <P>I want to express my thanks to the Members of the Seanad for electing me as Cathaoirleach.  I am very conscious of the honour that has been bestowed on me in giving me the task of presiding over the business of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I see in the House three distinguished predecessors and as I recall their time in the Chair, I realise the high standards I have to follow and it is an honour to know that you, my colleagues, consider me fit to succeed them.</P>
      <P>I know that Senator Dooge and Senator McDonald will not take it amiss if I pay a special tribute to Senator Tras Honan, my immediate predecessor, who in her short time in the Chair was both particularly effective and charming.  I am afraid I can only be effective.</P>
      <P>I want to assure Senators that I will be impartial and that my conduct of the business of the House will be in accordance with the letter and the spirit of our Standing Orders.  It is good to know in this regard that I will have the wise advice of the Clerk and the Clerk Assistant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More important still, I know that I will have the full co-operation of all Members in ensuring that we will conduct our business <Col N="10" /> with dignity and efficiency and therby enhance the reputation of the Seanad as an important part of our democratic State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, on behalf of the Members on this side of the House I should like to congratulate you on attaining the position of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I know from working with you in the past that you will be an impartial chairman.  Today, you will get an easy ride from this side of the House but I guarantee that it will not be as easy from now on.</P>
      <P>I know you have the interests of this House at heart and that the traditions of the House will be upheld by you as they were by the people who sat in the Chair before you.  We are in a new situation here, and I sincerely hope the efforts being made by former Leaders of the House to bring this House into an important area of government will be continued. This House for too long was considered to be in a secondary position.  It should not be in a secondary position, and I sincerely hope that, for the length of time we sit in this Seanad, we will see more and more Bills initiated here and the importance of this House will be upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I should also like to place on record our good wishes to you, Sir, on your election to the high office of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I join with the Leader of the Opposition in asking you to continue the good work undertaken by your predecessors to reform the House, its functions and its workings.  I am sure that, as soon as the Committee on Procedure and Priviliges meets to continue discussions along these lines we can, in fact, make this a useful House of the Oireachtas initiating legislation in its own right and leading in areas of legislation in such a manner that the Government might take example from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You paid tribute to your predecessors. I should like on behalf of the Labour Party to put on record our appreciation of your predecessors in office: the Leader of the House when he was Cathaoirleach, <Col N="11" /> my colleague Senator McDonald when he was Cathaoirleach, and the previous Cathaoirleach to whom we all owe a great tribute for the manner in which she chaired the proceedings of this House and, indeed, the style she brought to the office, a style all her own admittedly, but one that was a welcome breath of fresh air in the actual running of this House. You said you would try to emulate her achievements in the Chair and that you could not possibly be as gracious as she is.  I have no doubt that you can be very gracious, but I doubt that you will ever be as glamorous as she is.  We will be looking forward to great things from you, a Chathaoirligh, and I wish you a long and happy stay in the Chair.</P>

      <P>Mar Sheanadóir neaspleách is mian liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an Seanadóir Reynolds mar Chathaoirleach nua an tSeanaid.  Nós maith é, is dóigh liom, gur Seanadóir ar thaobh amháin den Teach a bheas in a Chathaoirleach den Seanad agus gur Seanadóir ón taobh eile den Teach a bheas ina Leas-Chathaoirleach.  Is folláin an leagan amach é sin dár ndaonlathas.  Maidir leis an Seanadóir Paddy Joe Reynolds féin, fear ar fónamh é a bhaineann le teaghlach a thug agus a tugann seirbhís mhaith don tír.  Táim cinnte gur dea-Chathaoirleach a bheas ann.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming Senator Pat Joe Reynolds as Cathaoirleach of this House and also to join with those who have hoped that the work on the improvement and reform of the procedures of this House will be carried on so that the Seanad can play a proper and important part in the work of the Oireachtas.  I also join in paying tribute to the former Chairmen.  Unfortunately, and much to my regret, I missed being here during the chairmanship of my most admired colleague, Senator Tras Honan.  I feel sure everything everyone has said about her is well deserved and that you will be a worthy successor to her.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leat agus a rá gur mór-chúis áthais domsa tú a bheith toghtha d'aonghuth mar Chathaoirleach den Teach seo.  Tá aithne mhaith agam ort le fada an lá agus tá mé cinnte go ndéanfaidh tú do sheacht ndícheall do dhualgaisí a chomhlíonadh go héifeachtach agus cothrom na féinne a thabhairt do gach Seanadóir.</P>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, first of all, I want to congratulate you on your unanimous election to the post of Cathaoirleach of this House.  Having known you for a long number of years, I am convinced that you will discharge your obligations efficiently and with courtesy.  The name Reynolds in Sligo-Leitrim has been synonymous with good service to the public for well over half a century.  It is a fitting honour for you to be elected Cathaoirleach of this House today.  It is a recognition of the work which you and your parents before you did for the people of this country over half a century.  I am delighted and I wish you every success. Guidhim rath Dé ort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I should like warmly to wish you well on your election.  On this side of the House we intend to behave ourselves and to act as a constructive Opposition.  We may be small in numbers but still there are enough of us here to let you know we are here.  We may run off the rails at times but I am quite sure that with your long years of experience you will not be long in bringing us back on to them again. After your long years of service it is nice, as the Leader of the Government said, to see you at last in the Chair.  I got there in a shorter time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank Senators for their very kind remarks and, now that I am out of it, I will be always glad that I tried to do the job which I was greatly honoured to have bestowed on me.  A Chathaoirligh, I will not dare to forecast how long you may be in your office because I did very badly the first day I took the Chair. I said I would be there for four years and I lasted only ten months.  I am sure that after the crucifying campaign all sides of the House hope you will last a bit longer. <Col N="13" /> But do not be too sure &mdash; not too long. I sincerely congratulate you again and I wish you well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my sincere congratulations to my fellow countyman, Senator Reynolds.  Indeed I know he is a very able Chairman because I entered public life under his chairmanship. When I entered Leitrim County Council he was Chairman of that body. I have no doubt that his ability as a chairman will be seen in this House in the future.  I wish him every success.  It is a fitting reward to him from his own political party for the years of service given to this country and to his party by his late father, his late mother and himself.  I am glad that service has now been fully recognised by his party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I should like to add my voice to what has been said already and to wish you well in the months and years that follow.  I should also like to say how grateful I was to your predecessor for her kindness to myself and to former Senator Séamus Mallon when we arrived here out of the blue as newcomers.  As I was reminded this morning by a senior serving Member of the Seanad, we had a long &ldquo;honeymoon period&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; with Senator Honan was indeed for me a great experience.  I understand that I am now an old hand, but the rules are different. However, I will just mention in passing that it was a great pleasure to be accompanied on this occasion by two fellow Northerners, Senator Rogers and Senator McGonagle.  I know they can expect to have lively debates and to be very welcome here in Seanad Éireann.  I am sure you are looking forward to their contributions as much as I am, and we are certainly delighted to be here and feel it is a great honour and privilege to serve with you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader of the House give us any indication when the next sitting day will be?  There does not seem to be much business coming from the other House.  The filling of the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach is urgent.  We cannot appoint any committees until that position is filled.  It should not be later than this day two weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ryan said, we have the time of year when there is a slowing down of legislation coming from another place and, accordingly, this leaves us in some difficulty here.  I agree with him that the matter should not be left and that until we do this we cannot appoint our Joint Committees.  If the House wishes to fix this day fortnight, as suggested by Senator Ryan, I would be content with that, which would be, in fact, a decision to meet this day fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, first of all as I am on my feet may I warmly congratulate you on your appointment as Cathaoirleach?  Specifically, on the date of the next meeting of the Seanad, I agree very much with Senator Ryan that it is important that we fill the post of Leas-Chathaoirleach so that the Committee of Selection and other committees can meet.  I suggest to the Leader of the House that there is very good reason why we should meet next week.  Although there may not be legislative business coming from the other House, there may not be Bills for us to consider but there are a number of important motions on the Order Paper.  There are four motions in the names of Senator Higgins and myself, supported by the full Labour group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preference Senator Higgins and I would have in the taking of the motions would be the motion on prison reform. There have been a number of important reports on prison reform recently and it is a matter which has not been discussed <Col N="15" /> in this House.  There is the very difficult and extremely urgent issue that the Curragh Military Prison still has civilian prisoners. That is a matter of public importance and urgency which this House should debate.  If the Minister for Justice is not available for this debate, then there is an alternative &mdash; the most important issue facing this country, the motion on unemployment.  There is no more serious subject which this House could discuss. As the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Lanigan, said it is important that this House from the very beginning should establish its role.  He used the term that it must not have a secondary position&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator is saying is relevant to the Order of Business which will be taken next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the possible date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I press on the Leader of the House that this House should not simply adjourn this afternoon for a fortnight, but meet next week in order to take either the motion on prison reform if the Minister for Justice is available or, alternatively, the motion on unemployment. This would give the House an opportunity to ensure from the earliest stage that we are fulfilling our full role as the second House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by saying that the fact that we have had three Seanad elections in 18 months has drawn a lot of public attention to this House and the onus is on us to show that we are aware of the urgency of the social problems facing this country, and that we intend to establish an unprecedented level of business for this Seanad right from the beginning. Therefore, I appeal to the Leader of this House and to other Senators to meet this day week for the purpose of taking a motion.</P>

      <P>I want to address the Leader of the House in precisely the same way as Senator Robinson has done.  My memory of the subtlety of the Seanad procedures is a little blunt, having moved briefly to lesser things perhaps since 1977 when I was here.  In the decision to meet in two weeks' time for the purpose of electing the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I see the clear implication that we will not be sitting next week.  I am aware, as Senator Robinson and other Senators are, that outside these Houses people are drawing our attention to the conditions that prevail in the Curragh where 12 prisoners are being held. Many of us would have hoped before now that military detention would have ended.  This is an important matter.  Why can we not meet next Wednesday to discuss Motion No. 12 on the Order Paper which will enable this matter to be discussed? To facilitate the business if, for example, people feel that this matter can be disposed of before then, we could discuss Motion No. 10 which deals with unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should revert to my original suggestion which was that we should fix the next sitting day.  I did this in the knowledge that we might get side-tracked into a discussion that was out of order.  If we fix this matter for the next sitting day we can at an appropriate time discuss what the next sitting day will be.</P>

      <P>According to the clár, the fixing of a date is specific, a date to be set now for the election of the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  All the other matter is linked with the actual fixing of the date and the contributions from my colleagues were made on the basis of when the next date will be.  They are asking that the date be brought forward from a suggested date of 9 March to possibly next week in view of the urgency of the matter.  The question of fixing of the date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Perhaps it might be best if this matter were determined now. But I should indicate why I assented to the suggestion of Senator Willie Ryan that we could be specific in regard to fixing it for 9 March.  We now have the suggestion that it should be on 2 March. I would like to indicate the reasons why I think that 9 March is more suitable.</P>
      <P>It has been the custom of the Seanad that we should not meet, or only very rarely should meet, unless there is Government business to dispose of. Indeed, in my earlier years in this House the custom in regard to motions could be briefly described as not taking them. Motions lay on the Order Paper often for the duration of a whole Seanad and that was in the days when we had decent durations in the life of the House.  In more recent times we have had an arrangement whereby there was a rotation among the motions proposed by the different groups.  That arrangement fell with the fall of the last Seanad.  It is my intention to propose to the first meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that that should be re-instituted. Meanwhile, we are being asked that we should come together next week, even though no Bills would have come to us in the meantime from Dáil Éireann, for the purpose of electing a Leas-Chathaoirleach and for taking motions.  I do not think that this is the line we should follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember a very long time ago when I first entered politics and I first sought public office.  It was in the year 1948.  I got a piece of advice from someone on that occasion who told me that there is <Col N="19" /> one thing to remember in politics: &ldquo;Don't start at a pace that you can't keep up.&rdquo;  I think many of us in politics have seen people who start at paces that they cannot keep up.  I am as anxious as anyone that this House should show itself to be a lively House, show itself to be a busy House and should concern itself with the many problems that are exercising the mind of the community.  But, on the other hand, I do not think that this House should start off by meeting today, saying we must meet next week, we must start discussing these motions.  I think it is reasonable to meet today, despatch such business that can be despatched today, and that we should meet in two weeks' time when I anticipate there will be two Bills from the Dáil, one of them a Money Bill, and that we would despatch those Bills and take a motion that day.  We would then seek to have business as soon after that as possible.  I do not believe we should start off at too fast a gallop and for that reason I think that 9 March is a more suitable date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed at the approach being adopted by the Leader of the House.  He referred to past practice when motions were taken only rarely and that the practice was not to take them and that somehow we have improved a little on that.  But I understood from the contributions made by the Leader of the Opposition here, Senator McGuinness and Senator Ferris that they were all aware of the need for a much more radical change in the Seanad.  We have a number of important motions and the most important issue facing this country is unemployment.  If the Leader of the House is correct that there will be two Government Bills the following Wednesday, then the likelihood is we will not have time for a motion or at the most we will have an hour or so for one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the difficulty is that we are being asked by the Leader of the House to accept what I <Col N="20" /> would describe as a rhythm of the past rather than a new departure.  I believe that this House will be judged on how it begins and how it intends to proceed. Rather than adopt the example of setting a pace that we cannot keep up, it seems that we are going to adopt an old rhythm that we really cannot justify.  We cannot justify having a second Chamber that will not meet unless there is business coming from the other Chamber.  I recall that Senator Dooge has been one of the stalwarts and champions of this House and one of the Senators who proclaimed the authority and integrity of this House to meet when there is business to do.  I submit that the serious motions down on this Order Paper are business to do and, specifically, if the Minister for Justice is available that we should take the motion on prison reform and, if not, that we should take the motion on unemployment.</P>
      <P>There is no more serious problem than unemployment and there are a number of Government Ministers who could come into this House for that debate.  It is not one that requires very detailed research by individual Senators.  They all know a great deal about it and should have an opportunity to debate for the record the serious underlying problems which face us in curbing the present rate of unemployment and in providing jobs for our young people and for our population generally.</P>
      <P>I would submit that the case has not been made for adjourning for a fortnight and that the amendment proposed, that we adjourn until next Wednesday, should be accepted by this House.  It was Senator Ryan who raised the urgency of appointing a Leas-Chathaoirleach and I agree with him.  We should do this at the first opportunity, which is next week, rather than accept a leisurely pace that we somehow cannot meet unless there are Government Bills coming before this House.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party, as an individual group within the Government, will retain their rights to put down motions in this House and will be submitting that case to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that, as a party, we can identify ourselves here.  We are part of a Government but we have no intention of losing our identity.  I want to assure the Leader of the House that we will be putting motions down in our own right; we will be looking for the appropriate time to have them discussed and we will, with the Whips, reach agreement on the order on which they will be taken. I would ask the Leader of the House if, pending the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the agreement of the House could be reached because this is the only House that can reach agreement pending the formation of the committees that one of these Labour Party motions would, as it is already on the clár, be taken at the first sitting at which we agree to elect the Leas-Chathaoirleach.  We want to identify our party as an individual group.</P>

As to the suggestion that a Labour motion should be taken on the next sitting day, I can assure you that before the evening is out there will be at least five motions from the Fianna Fáil Party on the clár for the next day.  The Opposition are entitled to have one of their motions taken first.</P>

      <P>I congratulate you on your appointment as Cathaoirleach.  You can see already that you are going to be faced with a rather difficult and onerous task, not so much from this side of the House but from the other.  I certainly am quite confused with the process that seems to be going on from what must be referred to as the Government Front Bench, as there does not seem to be any cohesion as to what they propose for this House, when they propose to have it and how it is proposed to be done.  Maybe like Senator Higgins, I am a bit rusty with regard to procedure in this House, but I am beginning to feel a little sympathy <Col N="23" /> for the Leader of the House because in a matter of minutes he seems to find himself in difficulty.  We must point out that the facilities of Government are available to the Government side of this House.  No such facilities are available to us.</P>
      <P>Some Senators now wish to change the protocol that I have always seen adhered to in this House.  The Labour Party while in Coalition Government still want to be separate in this House and to absorb the time of this House to gain for themselves a special place.  I do not want to deny them that, but I would like them to recognise the fact that there are other people in this House who have not the same facilities as they have, such as the Fianna Fáil group and the Independent group, who are more entitled to time for motions than the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Honan, I hope that we last longer than ten months and that the Government Front Bench will come together and have an agreed agenda for presentation to the House, to you a Cathaoirligh, to us and to the press so that we will not be contradicting one another, as seems to be happening today.</P>

      <P>Senator Dooge said that he did not think we should meet next week because he did not approve of us going into a gallop at the beginning of the session.  He ought to remember that under the last Coalition Government we were brought back here early, before the Dáil, at a very fast gallop to debate the constitutional crusade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>He should also note that on the Order Paper or on the Order of Business there is no mention of the constitutional crusade, which is very significant in view of the fact that the only constitutional change which we have and which will be on this Order Paper very shortly is the amendment to the Constitution which is at present before the Dáil.  He should explain why we do not have anything about the constitutional crusade on the Order Paper, whether the amendment is part of the constitutional crusade or not because he should realise that you could have this crusade or you can have the amendment but you cannot have both.  If we meet next week we can debate that because we had to debate these things twice under the last Government, not only at the beginning of the session but also at the end.  If we meet next week we could certainly take this motion or we could take another motion of that sort on the Order Paper.  I support Senator Robinson and Senator Higgins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh and Members of the Seanad, I would like first of all before I speak on this motion to congratulate all of you on your election and your appointment and to say on my behalf personally as a former Member of the Seanad, albeit a fairly reluctant one, that it would be my intention to ensure that the full potential of this Chamber would be completely utilised in both the initiation of legislation and in the development of the country's consciousness and awareness of the issues that confront our society today. Indeed, this is such an important issue that I wish to speak on the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion seeks the agreement in principle of Seanad Éireann to the establishment <Col N="30" /> of a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to consider and make recommendations regarding possible legislative and other measures to deal, in the interests of the common good, with the supply and cost of building land.  A resolution to this effect was passed by Dáil Éireann on 2 February 1983.</P>
    <P>The committee now proposed would, in effect, take over the task of the Joint Committee on Building Land which was established in July 1982, and which lapsed on the dissolution of Dáil Éireann on 4 November 1982.  The terms of reference of the proposed Joint Committee are, in effect, a re-statement of the terms of reference of the original committee and the new committee would comprise a total of 20 members, 13 of whom would be drawn from Dáil Éireann and seven from Seanad Éireann, as previously applied.  The motion would require the committee to report before 31 December 1983, instead of 30 September 1983, the additional time being allowed to compensate to some extent for the interruption in the work arising from the dissolution of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>The re-establishment of the Joint Committee on Building Land is only the first step in the fulfillment of the policies of the Government in relation to building land, as set out in the Programme for Government.  The Government acknowledge that the imposition on the community, and especially on new houseowners, of costs arising from the windfall profits of owners of development land is a source of inequity which causes deep resentment and the Programme for Government includes a commitment to the re-establishment of the Joint Committee and the preparation of appropriate legislation.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the re-establishment of the committee should not be seen as a strategem to postpone effective action on the question of building land.  Instead, the decision to have the whole problem remitted to a Joint Committee, working to a given timetable, is a reflection of the importance attached by the Government to the desirability of having an agreed approach to the matter so as to avoid as far as possible <Col N="31" /> the disruptive effects of a situation whereby measures implemented by one administration are dismantled by the next, as has happened elsewhere, particularly the United Kingdom.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to the enactment of legislation by mid-1984 on the question of building land and for this reason the motion specifies that the proposed Joint Committee should report before 31 December 1983. I will be seeking the co-operation of relevant Government Departments and State agencies in ensuring that the committee will meet this target.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by welcoming the Minister of State to the Seanad.  He is somebody who is very familiar with this House.  In his time as Senator he was the most active Member and I have great personal pleasure in welcoming him in his present capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the motion, I have to say <Col N="32" /> that I have certain reservations about a motion even to re-establish a Joint Committee on Building Land at this stage.  I think that what is required in order to make progress is commitment.  I know that the Minister of State and the Minister for the Environment, the Tánaiste, have that commitment.  It is the firmest part of Labour policy in this area and has been for a number of years.  What we need is leadership and commitment in order to achieve social reform, particularly in this important area of control of the price of building land.</P>
    <P>The Kenny Report which is referred to in this motion was submitted to the then Government in March 1973, practically ten years ago.  Also referred to in this motion is the Bill which was promoted by the Labour Party and indeed was very substantially the work of the Minister of State here today, Deputy Quinn, which was introduced in May of last year as a legislative proposal for the control of the price of building land.  I am glad that the Minister when introducing this motion today adverted to the fact that it should not be seen as a &ldquo;stratagem to postpone effective action on the question of building land&rdquo;.  So often in our experience a committee is appointed to have the effect of postponing action and, therefore, it is absolutely vital that we do not have any delay in the commitment in the joint programme to legislation being enacted by mid-1984.  That is the very latest date we could envisage.  I see some merit in seeking to get a measure of agreement on the principle of controlling the price of building land but if that measure of agreement is not forthcoming in the early stages of the Joint Committee it is not worth waiting for it.  It is not worth waiting for a level of political agreement that is not there.  This Government must legislate for this very important aspect of housing policy, of control of land prices generally and control of speculative profit.  They must not fudge their own commitment in an attempt to bring other political persuasions along.  This is absolutely vital.  If after the Joint Committee has been reestablished under this motion it is clear at a fairly early stage that agreement cannot be reached, then I would hope that <Col N="33" /> the stage would be reached where the committee would so report, put the ball back in the Minister's court again, let the legislative heads of a Bill be drafted and let the Bill come before both Houses for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the wording of the motion itself.  I welcome the fact that there is a final date for the Joint Committee to report, before 31 December 1983, but I note that there is provision in the motion for the Joint Committee to submit a number of reports.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 of the motion states:</P>
    <P>That every report which the Joint Committee proposes to make shall, on adoption by the Joint Committee, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>I would like clarification from the Minister that the report mentioned in paragraph 7 is the final report of this committee because the wording of the motion is open to the interpretation that the Joint Committee will have complied with the terms of the motion if they submit even an interim report by the end of December this year, or a report on some aspect, perhaps the constitutional aspect or the legal aspect.  It is vital that we know that this Joint Committee are given a mandate to do a job of work between now and 31 December 1983.  If they have not done that job of work, I would like an express commitment from the Minister that he will take back the area of responsibility and proceed to bring a Bill before the Oireachtas at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him every success in his new portfolio.  These are very wide-ranging terms of reference for the Joint Committee and this is something which must be welcomed by all. Unnecessary criticism has been made about developers, about people involved in planning, in the building trade and in <Col N="34" /> the sale of land both inside and outside urban areas.  I also welcome the apportionment of members as well, 13 from the Dáil and seven from Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Robinson when she said that we would need a conclusion of this report by the end of 1983 because there have been many publicised inaccuracies in connection with the whole structure in the building trade and in the speculative buying of land.  However, one must remember that many of the housing problems of the city of Dublin &mdash; and indeed in other cities throughout this land &mdash; that would have been the responsibility of the Department of the Environment and housing authorities throughout the country have been resolved by speculators and others in the field of construction. We must not lose sight of the fact that they did a very practical job in the provision of housing, regardless of the prices that had been charged in a then very inflationary market.  I would not in any way be selective in condemnation of them: I would rather await the findings of the Joint Committee on Building Land.  While I did not have much time to examine this in depth, I see that the planning laws will be examined as well.  While we have had amendments to the Planning Acts, there is much more to be desired in connection with the planning laws and I am delighted that that is a part of the terms of reference of the Joint Committee.</P>
      <P>The Committee have wide-ranging terms of reference and no doubt they will submit an effective and comprehensive report on an issue that has gained much unreal publicity down the years.  The city of Dublin has been very much to the forefront in that field and one would believe, listening to the media from time to time, that public representatives throughout the country have been involved in land speculation whereas their main duty is the provision of houses. I welcome the report and I will have an opportunity to speak further on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the previous Senators in welcoming the Minister of State to this House.  It is very appropriate that the first thing this Minister <Col N="35" /> should propose to this House is this motion because we all know that the area of building land and planning is one in which this Minister has a very personal interest and I hope to see in his period of office the results of the commitment which I know he feels in this particular area.  I join with Senator Robinson in saying that probably the most important part of the motion is to say that the Joint Committee should report before 31 December 1983.</P>
      <P>I know there are many important things to be considered but we must remember we had the Kenny Report ten years ago.  I remember reading it very carefully at the time because I had to make a report on it for another body.  I feel that a great number of issues that are to be dealt with by this committee are already quite fully dealt with in the Kenny Report and do not really need to be pushed any further.  Perhaps, however &mdash; and I hope this may be the true explanation &mdash; the reason why this committee hope they can finish their work by the end of this year is that so much of the work has been done already.</P>
      <P>I part company with the previous speaker on the idea of the unreal publicity about the problems which have arisen, particularly in the Dublin city and county areas because of this building land problem and because of development. Travelling as I do in these areas quite a lot I would join with those who wrote the epitaph for Sir Christopher Wren in St. Paul's Cathedral in this regard and say: <i>Si monumentum requiris circumspice.</i>  If you want a monument look around and see what has happened to Dublin city and county because of speculation in building land and, what is more, speculation in the buying and selling of planning permissions. At least that is what it turns out to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I certainly agree that the committee would have to take into consideration the operation of the planning laws, I would not like to see them charged with an entire revision of the Planning Acts because that is an enormous task and if they have to do that I do not see any possibility of their getting on quickly with <Col N="36" /> their own specific task.  I would suggest that as far as the Planning Acts are concerned this committee should only deal with them in so far as they affect building land.  The task of looking at the Planning Acts in their entirety should be dealt with in another way.  Certainly the most important aspect is that this is a very urgent problem as any of us can see by looking around us.  The main thing is that we should move from consideration to action as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a limited declaration of interest in this regard in that I have some small interest in a company which would have some interest in the result of these deliberations. I should hasten to add to the House, however, that my interest is of the nature that I have paid the enhanced value for land rather than I am in a position to take advantage of the enhanced value.  Obviously there is some interest because those people who have already paid enhanced value for land would have an interest in the transitional arrangements and it is well that I would put on record my interest, even though it be small in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur that there is a problem in this area and there is an element of truth in what Senator O'Toole and Senator McGuinness have said.  It really depends on the portion of the country from which one comes and where one's experience lies.  There are very many areas of the country in which this has little or no relevance and there are other areas in the country attached to and contiguous to the main population centres where it has been a major problem over the past few years and will continue to be a major problem.  There is a sense in which it shows the division of the country, even though it may not be a welcome division, between problems that arise as a result of increased organisation and quite different and unrelated but very real problems which continue to exist in other areas which do not have urban problems.  I would ask those who come from rural areas to understand that because the problem does not exist in their own area that does not mean the problem does not <Col N="37" /> exist at all.  Similarly, I would like people who live in urban areas to recognise that it is not the burning problem as far as people who live in remote areas are concerned. A recognition of the different interests of different sections of the country, differences which cut right across party political boundaries, is important if we are to solve the problem.  I agree the problem needs to be tackled and needs to be solved.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the impression I got from Senator Robinson, I think it is important that we get the widest possible political agreement on this point.  We can rest assured that there will be a change of Government in this country some time, and unless legislation which is introduced in an area like this has the broad support of the people, then pressure will come on to change that legislation and indeed it will be used as a rallying point for those who disagree with the policy of the two parties who make up the present Government. I believe there is every chance of getting wide political agreement in the country on this point; that is why I support the establishment of this Joint Committee and why I think it is well worth our while to wait until 31 December 1983 to hear their conclusions in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why it is important to get wide political agreement on this.  Without going into the details of the matters which have to be considered by the committee, it is implicit in the motion which is before the House that the possibility of a conflict between where we all wish to go and the present Constitution is possible.  In those circumstances political agreement across the political spectrum of the political parties is almost a prerequisite for action if that should be the case on examination.  I am not prejudging whether it is or not, but if to take effective action we need in some way to amend the Constitution that can be done only with broad political consensus.  That is another reason why I believe political consensus in this regard is worth working for and striving for and I think this committee is the right way to do it.</P>
    <P>The problems are identified as being the constitutional ones to which reference has already been made.  It is fair to <Col N="38" /> say that these constitutional problems, in so far as I have examined them in a tentative way have expanded considerably since the Kenny Report.  In this regard I look forward to the contribution from one of the new Senators in this House who I understand was one of the contributors to the Kenny Report.  There must be a recognition of the development that has taken place in the constitutional law since that time as well as the changes that have taken place in the general development area, the actual buying and selling of planning permissions or rezoning of land.  It is not just a question of lifting the Kenny Report and putting it before this House and the Dáil.  It is much more important and difficult than that.  We have to take the Kenny Report as a starting-off point on which we hope we are all agreed and then work from that as to how it can fit within the constitutional framework which has evolved and continues to evolve since that date.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested that the Joint Committee should consider the taxation implications. That is very important because that is one of the possible ways of dealing with the problem, as well as a problem that arises if you decide to deal with it by some other method.  The operation of the Planning Acts and the draft Bill which is called the Local Government Building Land Bill, 1982 also have to be considered.</P>
    <P>In considering them, I support the idea that we should establish such a committee that should examine the constitutionality of any proposals which they may wish to make: they should examine their legal and administrative practicability, the financial and economic implications not only in respect of the financial and economic implications of those who are directly involved or who might be involved in the future but also the financial and economic implications for the State which I think are quite considerable in this regard.  We do not want to have a situation where the State has to raise substantial money to buy land before it really needs it.  Another thing that must be borne in mind is to take into account the likely effects on housing and other forms of development.  All these various <Col N="39" /> things should be examined by the committee. Above all, the committee should seek to establish a consensus.  I think that consensus is an important guarantee that the legislation which we enact will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>The problem I have with regard to the motion has nothing to do with the fact that the date is 31 December.  If that is genuinely adhered to I do not think we can reasonably suggest that it is unreasonable to put a date like 31 December 1983 in it.  What worries me is the commitment which will be necessary from the committee to report by that date.  This is not a committee who will be able to meet once a month because if so, they will not get their work done.  It is almost a full-time job for the members who will be appointed to that committee to prepare a worthwhile report and to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 31 December 1983.  All of us should be conscious of the fact in nominating people to that committee that it is going to be almost a full-time job.  We should recognise the reality of that situation.  In an attempt to get a consensus, recognising that there is a limitation with regard to 31 December 1983 and further recognising the fact that it has constitutional problems and severe financial problems both for people personally and for the State, I think it is worthwhile establishing this committee.  I agree with the terms of reference laid out and I intend to support the establishment of this committee when it is voted on by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Dr. O'Donoghue Dr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment, to welcome his presence here today with this motion and indeed to support the basic spirit behind the motion.  I do not want to make a long contribution.  We will have the opportunity to do that when the committee report or when there is any prospective legislation before the Houses.  I do want to make one or two remarks.  First of all, I was a member of the Kenny Committee, one of the six members who worked on that report for about 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential point I want to make is <Col N="40" /> that that was not a political committee. There were six members on it.  We split.  Reasonable people can end up holding reasonable differences of opinion.  With the best will in the world when you are dealing with a complex issue which touches on matters of fact, matters of law and matters of political taste or political priorities &mdash; if I can put it that way &mdash; it is unlikely in a democracy that all will end up of the same mind.  While I would agree with the approach of Senator O'Leary that a committee should set out in the spirit of seeking consensus, I would not be too disheartened if they found that it was not possible to produce such a broadly based consensus.  For that reason the essential point I want to emphasise is that made by Senator Robinson, namely that it should be the final report that we get on 31 December and not some sort of holding operation.  Next week will be the tenth anniversary of the presentation of the Kenny report to the Government of the day.  I would have thought that anybody who has the slightest interest in these matters has his or her political mind made up for him or her one way or the other, but these people are unlikely to shift their political views very substantially over a period of months.  Therefore, we are dealing primarily with matters of fact and matters of law.  The Kenny report recognised some of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>In the legal area it suggested, if my memory does not fail me, that any Bill coming from the Oireachtas should be immediately referred to the Supreme Court to establish its constitutionality.  I hope that that will still be the approach. In other words, let us not waste time in these Houses trying to interpret what judges in their wisdom will eventually be called upon in some shape or another to resolve.  Let us put that matter beyond doubt at the earliest opportunity by referring a Bill to the Supreme Court for their verdict on its constitutionality.  I hope that that will not be a cause for delay. The committee should concern themselves primarily with working very quickly through the existing material, updating it to take account of developments <Col N="41" /> over the last ten years &mdash; because there have been a number that are relevant &mdash; and then either report their agreement if they can agree or establish why they disagree.  In other words we do not want a report which tells us just that they failed to agree.  Let them tell us the basis on which they cannot agree with one another, whether it is their political priorities, matters of fact that they are not able to resolve in time for disposal, or disagreements of some other form which we do not need to pursue at the moment.</P>
    <P>Essentially my message to the Minister today is that we should get on with the establishment of this committee as quickly as possible, that we should help them to get on with their work as quickly as possible, and have the final report by the end of the year so that we can have the legislation by summer of next year. After all, it would be totally impracticable to expect to have legislation by the end of this session, in the summer of 1983.  If it is going to the 1983-84 session a difference of a few months one way or the other will not significantly alter the issue.  Provided we have the legislation by summer 1984 that is not an unreasonable timetable.  The point I emphasise is that we want agreement if that is possible but if it is not highly likely we certainly want the clearest statement possible of the reasons why people advocate courses of action.</P>
    <P>Finally I suggest that the committee do not waste too much time trying to solve the taxation treatment of these issues. They should primarily concern themselves with any legislative proposals, because the taxation area of itself is so complex that it would almost invariably be tailored over a number of budgets. You have only to look at the history of capital taxation in any country, not just Ireland, to see that it is virtually impossible to get a watertight set of proposals in year one.  No matter how you set about it you almost invariably end up with adjustments for a number of years thereafter. The primary requirement is to resolve the basic approach to the legislative treatment of the property rights which reside in the ownership of land that can be relevant for development.  While <Col N="42" /> that, on the surface, touches only a small portion of the total land area and therefore, as Senator O'Leary pointed out, apparently touches only a small proportion of the population, at the end of the day it affects everybody.  If you get the wrong answers, as taxpayers we all will end up having to foot the bill in one form or another.  It is everyone's concern even though all may not be aware of it, but the primary requirement is to resolve the basic approach to the legislatirve treatment of the property rights in this area. If we do not do that we will have continuing uncertainty and a political football will be made of an issue which of its nature is not really a party political issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the initiation of the motion today which re-establishes this very important committee.  I join with my colleagues in their congratulations to the Minister on his attendance in this House today as Minister of State after a short period in this House.  I knew of his impatience to go to other fields, and he has achieved that, and indeed it is coincidental that he has achieved his high office in an area in which he has a commitment.  It is appropriate to realise that the agreement by the previous Government to set up this committee was a result of a Private Members' Bill that the Minister initiated on behalf of the Labour Party in the Dáil and on a suggestion from the previous Government he agreed to the format of setting up this Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  He did that hoping that there could be a consensus, as has been outlined by Senator O'Leary, on these matters dealing with the rights of private property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator Robinson's concern that there might be areas of delay in this committee's work or the adoption of any report coming from them.  When the Minister was chairman of this committee I had the honour to work with him representing my own party and I stated at the committee's inaugural meeting that on behalf of my party I was not prepared to accept that there would be undue delay in bringing forward a report, so that we could grasp this nettle of the area of <Col N="43" /> private property, particularly in regard to housing people whom we in the Labour Party like to ensure are properly represented. We undoubtedly are likely to run into the area of constitutional problems halfway through the workings of this committee, because we discovered even in the Private Dwellings Act that in the area of private ownership constitutional problems are bound to arise.  I hope that if we arrive at consensus in the area of constitutional problems at least we will ensure a very swift amendment to the Constitution in the event of that being necessary for the recommendations of this committee to be brought to fruition. Since the committee were set up events, particularly in the greater Dublin area, have proved the necessity for the fullest and most active consideration of this problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be partisan when I congratulate the members of my own party in the Dublin area for having spearheaded through the various statutory authorities, corporations and county councils, the problems involved within an area which has a responsibility for the provision of houses in particular.  I would like to think that the submissions that have been requested by the committee, when chaired by the Minister, from the various local authorities will now have arrived for this committee's perusal so that each county council, planning authority and housing authority will have itemised their problems and considered how to achieve the provision of land banks to ensure proper and orderly development.  The provision of housing for people really in need of houses must not be held up because of the inability of planning authorities or development authorities to acquire land.  Also some element of control must be introduced to prevent people who can afford to do so from manipulating the market by putting large land tracts together and obtaining planning permission on them that will upgrade the value of the land in such a way that any future development there will give immense profits to people who can go into that area of speculation.</P>
    <P>The re-establishment of this committee <Col N="44" /> will be a useful exercise.  Having served on it I know the tremendous dedication of the members to achieving results quickly as the Minister has mentioned in his motion.  I hope that in complying with their terms of reference the committee will report their findings to us without any undue delay and that a consensus will be reached on their decisions by the parties concerned and that legislation or any constitutional amendments that would be required will be quickly forthcoming.  We agree with the terms of reference.  In agreeing, as a Labour Party, to the setting up of these committees, we would like the opportunity to discuss the terms of reference on each occasion to ensure that they are broad enough to achieve the kind of action that Senator Robinson has referred to.  We as a party are impatient in many areas of legislation such as this to ensure that the proper consensus is forthcoming in the Houses of the Oireachtas and that there would be a radical change in areas of legislation for the betterment of all the people.  Where that is at stake we as a House should respond actively, and the setting up of this committee as part of the new Government's programme which has been agreed between the two parties is something that we in the Labour Party welcome.  I look forward to the committee's findings at the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like the other speakers, welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the reintroduction of this joint committee.  There is no doubt that in many areas of the country there has been controversy over planning permissions and delays that have taken place in the allocation of land for housing.  In many cases the problem arises from within the Department of the Environment just as much as it does from speculators. Many areas have not proper sewerage and sanitary facilities available and therefore the amount of land available for development that can be used for housing is extremely small and the cost of it therefore is driven up.  When the committee sits the Department of the Environment will have to be investigated just as much as the Constitution and the <Col N="45" /> tax implications in land.  The Department of the Environment, as well as the Department of Finance for not providing funds for the infrastructural development, are as much to blame for the high cost of land in various areas.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Senators who talked about buying and selling planning permissions were not referring to legislators in the Dáil, Seanad or the county councils throughout the country, but to the selling of land on which planning permission was in being.  If the implication is that people in county councils, in the Seanad or the Dáil are being paid for getting planning permission, we should knock that straight away.  That suggestion was made in recent days on a public platform and the lie should be nailed here just as it was nailed at that conference.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree that we should have a speedy end to the deliberations of this committee, but by having a set date of 31 December 1983 we might run into problems. This committee should sit as often and as long as is necessary to complete their deliberations and we should have a report here when the deliberations are completed and not on a specific date.  It would seem that if you set yourself a date to finish a job when you are coming towards that date you might tend to speed up the process, and not to the betterment of the subsequent legislation.  The tax legislation part of the deliberations might be better omitted, because in this area the Government of the day through the Finance Act have the opportunity to change the source of revenue which they get, and the tax that can be got from profits on speculations can be taken into account each year as and when the budget comes out.</P>
      <P>It seems that every time the Constitution is changed this change will be challenged and you do not know what sort of minefield you will run into.  I think the Cathaoirleach will agree with me from the point of view of Senator Robinson that the more changes there are to the Constitution the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply as briefly but comprehensively as I can to points made by various Senators.  First of all I thank them all collectively for their kind wishes at my coming to the Seanad today and on my appointment.</P>
      <P>Let me say that the terms of reference for this committee were drafted by the previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, with the agreement in part of both myself and Deputy Peter Barry who was spokesperson at the time for the Fine Gael Party.  Therefore, the terms of reference have already a fair measure of agreement.  We changed the deadline but not the length of time which Deputy Burke originally gave to the workings of that committee, extending it from September 1983 to December 1983 to take account of the recent political changes and elections.</P>
      <P>The date in question, to reply to Senator Robinson, is the final date as far as we are concerned for the report of this committee.  That was the understanding on the previous occasion and it is definitely my understanding on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of this committee as far as I am concerned will be, as Senator O'Donoghue indicated in his contribution, the role of basically drafting the legislation for both Houses.  It is in effect taking Committee Stage of legislation in advance of Second Stage.  All of the political parties in this House are agreed in principle on the desirability of doing something based on the Kenny Report and on the commitment to deal with the problem of land speculation.  In so far as <Col N="47" /> the political parties have a common agreement, the common agreement is analagous to Second Stage where something should be done on the matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome very much the committed contributions made by a number of Senators. I suggest that the members of this committee will take on, as Senator O'Leary said, a substantial volume of work.  Any Member of the Seanad who becomes a member of this committee is committing himself to a substantial amount of work the volume of which will in the main be centred around drafting legislation that is administratively effective, without bureaucratic hindrance of any kind and clearly designed to have the broadest possible agreement within our society with the desired objective of eliminating the problems that have arisen because of the lack of control of the price of building land.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole in his contribution made reference to the role of house builders and speculators in the building trade generally.  I would support basically what I think he was trying to say, but which frequently, I regret to say, comes across differently from other people, not necessarily from Senator O'Toole.  I have always made the distinction between the house builders &mdash; the building contractor and the building developer who leave something on the ground after they have finished, who add value to the community wealth of our society &mdash; and the land speculator who adds no value whatsoever, who simply creams off the value which he in the first instance did not do anything to create.  It is to be regretted that, in the short-term phraseology that develops in our society, the legitimate building industry is frequently confused with the speculator.  A speculator in this instance is someone who is not adding to the value but simply extracting the value that the community created in the first instance.  To that extent I share the sentiment of what Senator O'Toole said.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness was worried about the time frame within which this committee would work.  I have dealt with that by saying that we are concerned primarily with legislation, and the committee <Col N="48" /> are expected to complete their work by 31 December 1983.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donoghue, as Senator O'Leary said, was a member of the committee who produced the Kenny Report, and I looked forward to his contribution in this area.  He, in particular, is aware of the changes that have taken place, particularly the legal changes regarding the interpretation by the Supreme Court of the constitutionality of certain legislation which at the time of the writing of the Kenny Report was deemed to be constitutional but subsequently was found not to be so.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary talked about the desirability of achieving consensus.  I support this view to the extent that, like Senator O'Donoghue, I think at the end of the day that there will be differences of opinion.  As Senator O'Donoghue said, reasonable people at the end of the day will hold reasonable differences of opinion.  It is essential that we maximise the agreement in so far as that is possible so as not to disrupt the land market unduly.  Experience since 1947, particularly in the United Kingdom, was such that there have been about four to five separate legislative attempts to regulate this market.  It became highly partisan to the extent that landowners and land developers deliberately held land during the holding of office of one administration in the hope that a change of Government would bring about a change in the market.  That in the short term had a damaging effect upon the well being of people who depended upon the local authority or the housing developer directly to provide housing for them, because it froze land in certain areas.</P>
    <P>We should be capable of learning from the experience of other countries, particularly our next-door neighbour, in this regard, and not fall into that trap.  To that extent I understand and recognise the expertise and I compliment Senator O'Leary on his contribution and on his limited declaration of interest, which is a very healthy precedent to establish in both Houses in this regard.  However, I would not like to see consensus confused with a postponement of any kind of enactment of legislation until such time <Col N="49" /> as we get total unanimous agreement.  I do not expect that to be achieved, but I expect that this House and the other House can achieve a working consensus that will result in legislation that not only has the support of the majority of the people but also is seen to be a workable legal instrument, which is also a factor that must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris in his contribution referred to the historical origins of this committee, and he was right in saying that to a certain extent the Labour Party was the godfather of it in so far as the proposal following the second tabling of this as a Private Members' Bill &mdash; it was first tabled in 1980 &mdash; from the Deputy Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Peter Barry, that a committee be established was accepted in principle by me on behalf of the Labour Party and was graciously accepted by the then Minister, Deputy Burke.  The fact that a by-election was being held in Dublin West at the time &mdash; which constituency had been the victim of unauthorised and highly speculative land development &mdash; had little or nothing to do with the readiness of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to conceive such a committee.  Nevertheless it proved to be an interesting lever in ensuring that the readiness of the two major political parties to contribute towards a constructive solution was somewhat heightened.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised legitimate points about the role of the State, both at local and national level through the Department of the Environment and the local authorities, in ensuring that there is an adequate supply of serviced land, zoned or otherwise, that will enable development to take place, whether we control the price of that land or not.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the general problem, the background against which this legislation is absolutely urgent.  It is now 20 years since planning legislation was effectually brought into this country in 1963. The 1961 census, if my memory serves me right, was the first census since the foundation of the State that showed our population stabilising and beginning to grow, certainly in the larger urban areas. In 1973 the Kenny Report reported on what was then the scandal of uncontrolled <Col N="50" /> unbridled and untaxed land speculation in the suburban areas.  Ten years later, in 1983, we are now attempting as an Oireachtas as distinct from an administration of the day to deal with the problem. In the intervening years our population has become the fastest growing population of any State in the EEC and that of Dublin, for example, is growing at the rate of approximately 20,000 a year. The whole process of settlement on this island is going through a total and radical transformation such as occurs only once in the lifetime of any nation.  We are shifting the basis upon which this island lives from a pattern of rural settlement which grew up over a period of at least 300 years to a transformation which will change the face of this country by the end of this century.</P>
    <P>Statistically, in 1910 or thereabouts 20 per cent of the population of this island lived in what we would classify as urban areas, that is towns of 1,500 or more, with 80 per cent living in rural areas.  By the year 2000 which is now closer to us than the date of the assassination of President Kennedy, that proportion will be virtually reversed, 80 per cent of the population living in what we would call urban areas and 20 per cent or thereabouts in rural areas.  That will happen in the next 17 years.  Already the ratio of urban to rural is somewhere in the region of 55:45 per cent.</P>
    <P>The problems that we are now experiencing in the inner cities of Cork, Limerick and Dublin and to a lesser extent Galway and Waterford were forecast with grim accuracy by every urban specialist as far back as 15 years ago, because the ingredients that brought about the problems which we now have were self-evident and had brought about exactly the same problems in countries like Spain, France, America and Great Britain.  Therefore, we simply can no longer turn our heads away from this problem because if we do this problem will, as it has begun already to do so, devour ourselves.  Lest anybody thinks that this is a Dublin problem, I would refer him to the tragedy of the instance that occurred in the streets of Limerick over the duration of Christmas.  If we had <Col N="51" /> stood up ten years ago in this House and said it would be unsafe for grown men and women to walk the streets of Dublin we would have been laughed at.  We can no longer be laughed at today.  Part of that problem relates to our failure to deal with the reality of urbanisation.  We cannot begin to deal with the problem of urbanisation unless we begin to deal with the problem of land.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn away from that theme of mine for which I could have the Seanad sitting all day next Wednesday and the following Wednesday and the Wednesday after that if the House so desired, and to address myself to the three political parties in this House and to the Independents.  All political parties are on record as saying that they agree in principle with the need to do something in this area.  The Labour Party have a clear specific policy proposal in the form and shape of a Bill.  Nobody criticised the principle of that Bill in the two debates that took place in the other House.  Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael said that while they supported the principle of the Bill they had reservations about its sections, methodology and effectiveness.  Individuals Independents &mdash; I am thinking in particular of Mr. Jim Kemmy, the former Deputy, who made a contribution during the debate the second time around in the Dáil.  I cannot from memory recall if any of the Independents spoke the first time the Bill was debated in May and June 1980.  I know from the contribution made by Senator McGuinness and the interest expressed by Senator Brendan Ryan that there is considerable interest in this among Independent Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The setting up of this committee &mdash; I want to be quite clear about my own commitment in relation to it &mdash; is a specific follow-through to the debates which took place earlier in this House.  I am saying as a Labour member of this particular joint administration that this is a unique opportunity for the members of both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to flesh out, formulate and work out the details of a Bill, the principle of which has already been agreed to.  As Senator Ferris <Col N="52" /> said in relation to the setting up of this committee prior to the sudden dissolution of the previous administration, we had already asked for and have now substantially received submissions from virtually every major local authority, and from institutions such as the Royal Society of Chartered Surveyors, the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, the Institute of Engineers in Ireland, the auctioneers and all other interested bodies, including the business organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  A lot of the preliminary work has been done.  For Members of this House and the other House, this is a good opportunity to give non-office holders a substantial role in the formulation of legislation, the effect of which will be to transform the way in which land is held in urban areas for the next 20 years, which will affect 70 to 80 per cent of our population. If ever non-office holders in this House or in the Dáil sought substantial power in a legislative sense the Seanad has been offered it today in the formulation of this committee.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody has any doubt, this Government and this Minister intend, as is our commitment in the common programme, to enact legislation in 1984 to deal with this problem.  I hope that Senators and Deputies will avail fully of the opportunity provided by this committee to have a constructive input into the formulation of this legislation at a stage when such an input can have a meaningful effect.  If they do not avail of that opportunity, they should not take it for granted that their non-taking up of the offer would prevent the legislation from being drafted or prevent this or the other House from passing what I hope will be a measure which will have the substantial support of all Members of the House. Therefore, I thank Senators very much for the constructive words offered from all sides of the House and to say in conclusion that when the committee is established my Department will have a role in servicing and assisting the work of that comittee.  I give a personal undertaking to the Members of this House and of the Dáil that in so far as I can affect the measure, the committee will get every <Col N="53" /> possible resource necessary to complete its task in a meaningful and constructive way within the time set by the terms of this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. P. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach tréaslú leat féin as ucht do cheapacháin, agus tréaslú leis na comhaltaí gur éirigh leo an Teach seo a bhaint amach, agus gur fada buan iad.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that my first appearance in this House as a Minister is to promote a Bill the object of which is to provide for increased penalties for offences under the Foyle Fisheries Acts, 1952 to 1976.  The Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, established the Foyle Fisheries Commission which is a joint North/South body with statutory responsibility for conservation, protection and development of the fisheries in the Foyle area.  That Act also defines the Foyle area and lays down the fishery law for the area and the penalties for breaches thereof.  The Foyle area comprises the entire catchment area of the River Foyle which flows partly in County Donegal and partly in Counties Derry and Tyrone.  The Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Acts of 1961 and 1976 amended and extended the provisions of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952.  Legislation similar in terms to the Foyle Fisheries Acts was enacted by the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
      <P>Most of the penalties for offences under the Foyle Fisheries Acts, 1952 and 1961, have not been changed since 1952. The changed money values in the meantime and the growing level of illegal fishing in the Foyle area, including incidents of violence involving members of the Foyle Fisheries Commission's protection staff, clearly indicate that the existing penalties are not an adequate deterrent. Furthermore, the Fisheries Act, 1980, provides for substantial increases in fines for the same offences throughout the rest of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> The Bill provides for substantial increases in penalties for fishery offences in the Moville area which is the part of the Foyle area located in County Donegal.  Maximum penalties of up to £600 or imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or both such fine and such imprisonment are prescribed on summary conviction.  For the more serious offences provision is made for trial on indictment and the maximum penalty on conviction for such offences is £2,000 or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years or both such fine and such imprisonment.  In general the penalties prescribed in the Bill are in line with the penalties for similar offences as provided for in the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the high level of illegal fishing taking place not only in the Foyle area but in the country as a whole.  Our valuable salmon stocks have been seriously depleted in recent years because of illegal activities.  We all have a duty to ensure that these stocks are safeguarded in the interests of our commercial fishermen, anglers and our very important tourist industry.  I am satisfied that the setting up in 1980 of the regional fisheries boards has helped to improve protection and will continue to do so in the future.  The increase in fines provided for in the Fisheries Act, 1980 has also contributed to a reduction in illegal fishing and I am satisfied that the increased penalties now proposed for the Foyle area will likewise act as a good deterrent against illegal fishing there.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise, as strongly as I can, that while I hold the office of Minister for Fisheries and Forestry I will spare no effort to ensure that the cancer of illegal salmon fishing is reduced to the minimum.  I look forward to the continued co-operation of the Regional Fisheries Boards, the Naval Service and the Gardaí in achieving that target.</P>
    <P>I would refer Senators to the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill which sets out the existing penalties and the proposed increased penalties. Similar provisions for increases in penalties for the same offences have been prescribed in a Fisheries Amendment (Northern Ireland) Order.  It is proposed <Col N="55" /> that both the Bill, when enacted, and the Northern Ireland Order should come into operation at the same time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment as Cathaoirleach and wish you well in your office.  You will have the co-operation of my party.  I welcome the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.</P>
      <P>We are in agreement with the Bill.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission is a fine example of North-South co-operation. The purpose of this Bill is to introduce increased penalties for illegal fishing. While penalties might be severe, this legislation is necessary particularly in regard to the conservation of salmon stocks. Poaching is posing a threat to our salmon stocks and to fishing in general.  At one time it was only a case of a person poaching a salmon for his dinner, but now poaching is done for commercial reasons. These poachers are professional people. The methods they use are very cruel and are not in keeping with the ethical standards of fisheries.  Poachers are definitely the enemies of fishermen.  The full co-operation of all fishermen is needed to ensure that poaching is eliminated and to ensure the future livelihood of fishermen.</P>
      <P>Another threat to this industry is pollution. I am sure steps are being taken by the powers that be to eliminate pollution. As a result of agricultural development there has been pollution, and I should like to see more grant aid from the Government to eliminate such pollution. I welcome the Bill and hope it will have the desired results.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his statement.  Having come from Derry I could not return without saying something about the Foyle fisheries and the powerful inpact that it has made.  There were ugly incidents on Lough Foyle.  These waters were disputed but the North-South co-operation measures taken at the time resolved those difficulties.  I should like to emphasise that in any area where such co-operation <Col N="56" /> can be mounted, that should be done.  If I go to the west side of the Inishowen Peninsula, I am somewhat appalled when I see one of the largest factory ships from the USSR being fed not only by Irish trawlers but by all kinds of trawlers.  A factory processing ship can come into the Swilly and actually anchor a few miles from Rathmullan or Buncrana.  Surely it could be looked at in either Buncrana or Rathmullan.</P>
      <P>The biggest single problem in the Republic and in Northern Ireland is unemployment.  De Courcy Ireland, the other day in <i>The Irish Times</i>, an expert in maritime matters, pointed to the fact that in Denmark for one fisherman at sea there are eight ashore.  I would be satisfied with four or five.  That matter should be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoachimLoughrey" hpid="Mr. Loughrey Mr. Loughrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment.  As somebody who got to know you over the last number of years and whose friendship I choose to have, knowing your family background in political life and as a person in your own right I feel that you will wear this great honour with distinction.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.  I welcome Senator McGonagle from Derry and have noted his interest in fishery development.  While for a second or two he was in the wrong bay when he moved into Lough Swilly rather than Lough Foyle, his interest is sincere.</P>
      <P>The Minister said, and I agree, that it is not nice to have to welcome anything which introduces or increases penalties. Nevertheless because of depletion of salmon stocks in the Foyle and around our coasts, such measures have to be introduced.  This is merely an extension of penalties provided under the Fisheries Act, 1980.  A joint fisheries board was set up which comprised representatives from the North and South.  For this reason the Foyle is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kiely referred to agricultural and other types of pollution.  While I would not like to see industrial pollution <Col N="57" /> in the Foyle I would like to see industry, particularly sea fishery related industries, there.</P>
    <P>Fishermen in the area are opposed to night fishing.  They are day fishing as a temporary measure and I should like the Minister to make that permanent.  There are obvious dangers attached to fishing at night apart from storms.  The Minister said that he would bring the Foyle into line with the rest of the country.  Might I point out that the hours of fishing on the Foyle are four ten hour periods, that is, 40 hours a week.  If the stocks are built up again, the Minister might consider extending that period.  If the fishermen realise that the stocks are still depleted or run down they would want to cut down on the hours but, in the meantime, I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of extending these hours.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest the introduction of tags for salmon fisheries.  It would be a way of curbing illegal fishing if only fish that were tagged could be marketed. The Minister might consider introducing such a method of tagging and give fishermen a quota of tags.  When these were used up they could fall back on other lines of earnings.</P>
    <P>There should either be a total ban on or the legalisation of monofilament netting. The killing powers of monofilament netting are better than those of other types of netting, even super nylon netting. If two boats are fishing side by side and one is using monofilament netting and the other not, then one catch will be bigger than the other.  The Minister's predecessor said that to ban the importation of monofilament netting would also be banning its use for other jobs other than fishing.  Might I suggest that he either ban it completely or ban netting ranging from four and a half inches to five and a quarter inches which would be used for fishing, or legalise it.  It is attractive because it can be used in daylight.  I ask the Minister to consider those points.</P>
    <P>Donegal County Council have set up a fisheries committee comprising of ten members, two from each electoral area, and on to that they have co-opted six members to represent the various fishing interests.  It is their desire that the Minister <Col N="58" /> would appoint to that committee a senior management member from Bord lascaigh Mhara and a principal officer from his own Department.  On their behalf I make that request to the Minister. I ask the Minister to keep in mind when he is considering this request that 60 per cent of the fish caught around these coasts are landed in Donegal. There are not enough on shore jobs relating to the fishing industry.  I would welcome one in three or one in two.  The Minister should treat this committee with keen interest and take it very seriously. Hopefully he will do as they request.</P>
    <P>Greencastle pier is in need of repairs. Donegal County Council this week have allocated a sum of £13,000 towards temporary repair of the pier.  Since last year the number of boats landing at the pier has increased from 19 to 33.  There are £25 million worth of fish imported here and it is a scandal that Ireland should have to import fish at all.  The processing units for white fish in particular are not suitable at present.  I ask the Minister to look at Donegal and see if something positive in the fishing line can be done at Killybegs, Burtonport, the Swilly area, Buncrana and Rathmullan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. P. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Senators who contributed to the debate.  I am glad to note that Senator Kiely felt as I do about discouraging poaching which is rampant both North and South.  If we are to have salmon fishing in the future then this must be stamped out.  He also referred to the fact that he was accepting the seriousness of this problem.  I fully agree with him.  I also thank Senator McGonagle for his contribution and welcome him to the House.  He mentioned some matters concerning his own area and referred to problems which arose in <Col N="59" /> the past in relation to poaching where members of the protection staff were involved.  This kind of thing is regrettable. It was the co-operation of both southern and northern authorities that brought about a solution to the problem at that time.  The commission staff and the Garda Síochána are to be complimented on the way in which they co-operate in stamping out breaches of the law in relation to fishing.</P>
      <P>He mentioned the possibility of providing a processing facility in that area, having had experience of seeing Russian factory ships in that vicinity.  As the Senator knows, this is a seasonal operation and he will agree that most of the fish caught for processing in that area would be processed normally in this country and specifically in Killybegs.</P>
      <P>Senator Loughrey covered a lot of ground in his contribution.  He will appreciate that I am not in a position to deal specifically with many of the matters he raised but I will be in touch with him later about them.  He referred to fishing periods and an extension of same.  That is something we can look at in the light of stock build up in the Foyle fishery area. In relation to the monofilament aspect of netting, we all know that the use of the monofilament type of net is a danger to stocks in that it seems to be, from experience we have of it, a much more efficient way of catching large stocks of fish.  We are at present as the Senator will be glad to know, in contact with the Department of Agriculture with a view to discussing the banning of the importation of this type of net.  He will appreciate that it is used for other types of fishing and also for agricultural purposes. While I may have my personal views on what should be done in relation to monofilament nets, there are other factors which must be taken into account before a decision is made.  We are pursuing this matter and hope to have some definitive views on it in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the tagging of fish and the issuing of tags on a quota basis &mdash; I understand that is what the Senator is <Col N="60" /> referring to &mdash; there are problems there. While it might curtail the illegal fishing &mdash; the Senator put his finger on the real problem &mdash; basically, as long as there are people prepared to purchase fish caught illegally, they will be caught.  It is a question of providing the kind of surveillance necessary to track down people receiving this commodity.  That would be the greatest deterrent.  There may be some merit in what the Senator has said, and it is something we can look at and, indeed, I will have a look at his suggestions.</P>
    <P>On the specific matter of the re-establishment of a committee in Donegal comprised of the local authority members and others, the Senator is seeking an input from BIM and my own Department.  We will look at it and see if our involvement, or the involvement as suggested by him with that committee, would be beneficial to the purpose for which the committee is being set up.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the Second Stage of the Bill.  I can assure the House that I and my Department will spare no effort to stamp out something which we can no longer afford, that is, the prevalence of illegal fishing around our coasts, in our estuaries and, indeed, in our inland waters.  We have a very valuable and precious commodity in salmon.  We are now possibly the only major salmon fishery in western Europe, and to prevent that proud boast slipping away from us, we are obliged and we have a solemn duty to ensure that that fishery is protected to the best of our ability.  While we may have problems and may be operating within limited resources, all of us have an obligation not to condone in any way, by word or by deed, any breaches of regulations in relation to illegal fishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this section but I would like it to go on the record of the House that subsection (3) of section 2 provides:</P>
      <P>Any reference to summary conviction in section 35 or section 49 of the Principal Act shall be construed as including a reference to conviction on indictment.</P>
      <P>Section 35, as I understand it, deals with buying, selling, exposing for sale or having possession of salmon or trout unlawfully captured.  In this section we are extending that to include the possibility of conviction on indictment, and later on under the next section the scale of penalties is laid down.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that the penalties for buying or exposing these fish for sale &mdash; not being involved in actually procuring them &mdash; merits the possibility of a £2,000 fine and/or two years in prison.  If it does, it represents a considerable change in the attitude of the people of Ireland to such a matter.  I have no objection to it, as I am not going to buy or sell any of these fish.  The average man in the street &mdash; and we must pass legislation which is in some way relevant to him &mdash; would only laugh at you if you told him that the possibility of imprisonment for two years would arise in respect of a conviction on indictment as a result of the buying of an illegally caught salmon or trout.</P>
      <P>There is no point in having legislation unless it is to be implemented and unless there is an intention to implement it.  The previous penalty in this regard involved a minor fine of £25, and some additional fine in respect of each additional salmon or trout.  There was no question of imprisonment, not to mind a question of indictment. To pass legislation which will not be implemented only brings the legislation into disrepute.  I doubt that this will ever be implemented, and that is what is worrying me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, I recognise what the Minister <Col N="62" /> says.  I took careful note of his Second Stage speech and what he said about this being the last place in western Europe with a potential for a large scale salmon industry.  It is very important for us to preserve it.  Do we have the determination to do this?  Or are we merely putting something on the Statute Book which we have no intention of prosecuting, no intention of ever implementing on indictment, and no intention of indicating to the judiciary that they should impose two years' imprisonment for this offence?  If you told the plain people of Ireland that there was a potential for them to spend two years in jail for having bought a salmon which was caught illegally they would not believe you.  Public opinion may not yet have been educated to such an extent that it would make this a rational or reasonable step.  I understand it may be in the Fisheries Act, 1980, but I was not here in 1980 and I am not responsible for that.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Senator, if I were caught under the Act I would immediately take on my colleague to defend me.  He would make a very good job of it.  We are talking here about maximum fines and terms of imprisonment.  I assume the discretion of the courts would come into play when discussing the particular penalties involved in the form of fine or imprisonment. We are talking maxima and, as the Senator well knows &mdash; better than I do, indeed &mdash; discretion is used in these matters. While the plain people of Ireland would be flabbergasted, possibly, at the thought of having to spend two years in jail in these circumstances, it may very well be a very chastening exercise to do that, at least on one occasion.  That depends on the courts.  As Minister all I can do is lay down the top line, not the bottom line, which is a matter for the courts to decide within the limits laid down.  That is the maximum fine.  As the Senator said, it is already in the 1980 Fisheries Act.  I will not enter the disclaimer entered by the Senator.  We must live with the Act as it is now, and live <Col N="63" /> with the maximum penalties laid down in the Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister is right in saying that the main purpose of the legislation was to increase the penalties. There is a significant change in the legislation, the reason for which I do not understand.  I am seeking information from the Minister rather than anything else.  The Principal Act contained a provision whereby the proceedings could be taken by the equivalent of the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time: &ldquo;A commission or other persons authorised by the commission.&rdquo;  I think that is the way it was put.  That is being extended in one regard.  An officer of the commission is specifically mentioned.  A member of the Garda Síochána is specifically mentioned and &ldquo;not by any other person&rdquo;.  In other words, the power to bring a prosecution is being taken from the general body of people.  This might be as well if people are to go to prison for two years as a result of a conviction.  Could the Minister indicate why this legislation is being changed to limit from the general public the right to take a prosecution under this Act, that right at the time being subject to the approval of the commission but nevertheless being there?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General has advised that <Col N="64" /> it is necessary to include that provision in the Bill to make it clear that section 73 does not preclude the bringing of prosecutions in the District Court by the general prosecuting authority, that is, the DPP.  The deletion of the right contained at present in section 73 of the Foyle Fisheries Act of any other person with the consent of the commission to bring proceedings in the District Court in respect of an alleged offence against the Foyle Fisheries Act is being made on the advice of the Attorney General, who has stated that the bringing of proceedings under that Act by persons not named in section 73 is unnecessary and impracticable.  In other words, it has come about through the advice of the Attorney General, and, while there is a change, it is more of a tidying up exercise than anything else.</P>

      <P>The Local Appointments Commissioners have established an unrivalled record for fairness in making selections for posts since they were established over 50 years ago. From time to time the legislative provisions under which they operate require up-dating to ensure that the statutory framework under which they operate is absolutely clear-cut.  This is the aim of the current proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to enable the Local Appointments Commissioners to resume their practice of awarding credit for a knowledge of <Col N="65" /> Irish when selecting or recommending candidates for posts in local authorities, health boards and other bodies.  The Bill will also clarify and confirm the Commissions' powers in relation to the selection of candidates and will provide a statutory basis for the making of regulations by the Commissioners in connection with the conduct of competitions.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also make statutory provision for the non-application of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, to posts of town clerk in smaller urban district councils.</P>
    <P>Since 1974 it has been Government policy that for entry to the public service, Irish and English are of equal value and candidates showing proficiency in both languages get credit for this.  The Commissioners were implementing that policy by awarding credit to candidates for proficiency in both languages.  This was in line with the policy and practice in relation to competitions conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>In December 1979 the Supreme Court decided on appeal that the Commissioners had acted beyond their powers in granting extra credit for a knowledge of Irish to candidates being selected and recommended by them for appointment. As a result of the court decision the Local Appointments Commissioners had no option but to suspend the award of such credit.  This Bill will enable the Commissioners to resume the grant of such credit in accordance with Government policy and, indeed, I should add successive Government policy on this point.</P>
    <P>Up to the time of the Supreme Court finding the Commissioners had in the normal process of selection given regard to training, knowledge and experience over and above the minimum qualifictions for the particular post being filled. This was necessary to ensure that the best qualified and most suitable candidate was selected, as the basic qualifications for an office are, by definition, minimum qualifications. However, in the light of the terms of the court decision it is considered necessary to provide explicit legislative cover for the Commissioners' practice in this regard and section 2 of the Bill is designed to meet this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> It is also considered desirable to spell out beyond doubt the exact powers of the Commissioners in the area of selecting candidates.  The Commissioners' powers to select candidates are set out under sections 8 and 9 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, and section 29 of the Local Government Act, 1955.  These provide that selection shall be by competitive examination.  This has been interpreted as meaning written examination.  When this is not feasible, as happens in practically every case, selection may, with the consent of the appropriate Minister, be in such manner as the commissioners think proper.</P>
    <P>In practice the commissioners use the services of interview boards to assist them in their selection of candidates.  It is felt that the procedure adopted by the Civil Service Commissioners is the most appropriate for spelling out the exact powers of the Local Appointments Commissioners in the area of selecting candidates, and sections 3 and 4 of the Bill have been modelled on corresponding provisions in the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956.  These provide that selection shall be by competition consisting of one or more specified types of tests.  They cover also the short-listing of candidates and the making of regulations by the commissioners in relation to the holding of such competition.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing proposals, which arise out of the Supreme Court decision, problems have existed for some time in relation to posts of town clerk in the smaller urban district councils.  Selection for the filling of these is made by the Local Appointments Commissioners under the provisions of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926. There is a very high turnover in these posts and over the years representations have been made by the elected councils concerned and others to have them filled by local competition which would of course be open to all qualified candidates. This would reduce somewhat the degree of turnover in such posts and would reduce the delay which is necessarily involved in competitions held at national level.</P>
    <P>This issue was raised in the course of <Col N="67" /> discussions between management and staff side interests under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for local authorities and health services on the grading, salaries and other matters related to town clerks generally.  At that time it was agreed to recommend that when a suitable opportunity arose proposals should be formulated for incorporation in legislation whereby town clerk posts in urban district councils with a population of less than 9,000 would no longer be filled on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for this by excluding these town clerk posts from the scope of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.  While this proposal does not arise because of the court case, it is felt that the opportunity presented by the present legislative proposals should be availed of to effect the necessary change.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This is a resumption of the practice of giving additional credits for the official languages.  It was a decision of the Supreme Court to discontinue the practice by the Local Appointments Commissioners of giving credit for the national tongue at interviews.  A person who had not got a knowledge of Irish could get a job under the decision of the Supreme Court and then be asked to take up a position in a Gaeltacht area or a part Gaeltacht area along the west coastline. That person might not be the most suitable choice for that area.  That has been the case in the interim period since the decision of the Supreme Court.  I welcome the decision to give recognition and credit under the Bill to people qualified in both languages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Local Appointments Commission on their selection of candidates with the academic requirements and suitability for the job but it does not always follow that a candidate selected for a particular field of administration is suitable effectively to carry out his duties in a practical way.  I am sure most of the people here who have worked in local government have seen selections made <Col N="68" /> by the Local Appointments Commission on an impartial basis but when the person appointed went into the field of administration he was highly unsuitable for the job.  We see this from day to day both in planning and local government appointments. While I acknowledge the impartiality of the Local Appointments Commission in their judgment and in their selections, very often the candidate is not suitable in the field of administration. Emphasis should be placed on this aspect of selection.  That is a very valid point.</P>
    <P>This Bill was inherited by the Minister. I am in full agreement with it.  I welcome the decision to revert back to the old system which worked very well.  With all due respect to the judicial people, they found a loophole and took a decision in connection with a particular case.  One swallow never made a summer.  Indeed, there are three urban councils in my own county and you would want to ring up daily to find out who is the town clerk because a temporary system was in operation when the county council were seconding people to take up the duties of town clerks in the three urban areas of Mayo.  Some legal man felt that it was wrong to take Irish into consideration or to give credit for it at a particular interview. That is what happened, and it does not augur well for the proper administration of any urban area to have town clerks passing through as fast as they were passing through in my county and throughout the country.  A town clerk with some measure of permanency has a certain amount of incentive to carry out some worth-while duties for the town or urban district he is administering.  For that reason I welcome the Bill and I support it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been welcomed earlier but may I add my personal welcome to him?  The Bill also is to be welcomed because it deals with certain defects in the present legislation which are now being remedied.  It is also welcome because it gives us an opportunity in this House to express our opinion of the Local Appointments Commission and of its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The defects which are remedied by this <Col N="69" /> Bill are small matters: the question of giving additional credit for Irish in posts where it is not an essential qualification, the freedom of the Local Appointments Commission in relation to the type of competition, the making of regulations in regard to screening and short listing, and this problem of the revolving town clerks.</P>
    <P>That these defects have been found is perhaps an indication to us in this House, and to those in another House, of how careful we must be in regard to the legislation which we process here each sitting day.  I understand that much of the problem in regard to the defects we are now dealing with arose because in a particular enactment instead of using the original formula of, and I quote, &ldquo;select by such means and in such manner&rdquo;, this was replaced by the shorter phrase &ldquo;select in such manner&rdquo;.  In this case brevity might have been the soul of wit but it brought us all to the Supreme Court.  It is a salutary lesson for us in this regard.</P>
    <P>This brings me to make a more general comment.  In dealing with complex legislation of this type, is our system of a debate in principle on Second Stage followed by the type of Committee Stage which we have really appropriate having regard to the complexities of the type of legislation which we have?  I have said many times that we should meet in a more informal situation, not just from the policy point of view, but from the point of view of the very wording.  It is not just that we need the experts there when we are deciding what we want to do with a particular measure.  We really need a parliamentary draftsman there to see how we are going to do what we want to do.  This is something that we must all keep in mind.</P>
    <P>What is being done in this Bill is something with which we all agree.  The question of extra credit for Irish is in line with Government policy.  I wish to make a comment with regard to this.  I suggest that it should be perfectly clear how much credit is being given.  One of the criticisms of the practice of giving additional credit for Irish in the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission is that it is often a great mystery.  I <Col N="70" /> have been a Member of this House for 20 years and I have not sat on an appointment board in that time.  But when I did, and it was many times, there were difficulties because it was a &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; business. The interview board looked at people's qualifications and suitability. This was all taken away and something was done behind the rood-screen in some holy of holies.  The procedure should be more open.  It may well be that this is something that is now part of the practice of the Local Appointments Commission, and if so I am very glad to hear it.  If it is not I urge that it should become so. Otherwise it becomes an irritant to the candidate and to the members of the interview board.</P>
    <P>There are divided views in regard to the question of screening and shortlisting. There are many cases in which this has to be done.  Even in some quite senior posts interviews have gone on for three weeks at a time, so much so that the interview board, when they come to their final decision, had to look back at photographs of candidates to try to recall people whom they had interviewed two and a half weeks beforehand.  In a situation that witnessed great mobility, we should have a large number of people coming up for separate jobs at frequent intervals.  There is a case for shortlisting. As long as there is some procedure whereby people who feel that they have been wrongly left off a shortlist can demand their rights to be interviewed, they should not be allowed to do this in such a way as to clog up the whole machinery of appointments or indeed to involve the Local Appointments Commission in an undue amount of expense. In this connection I would like to ask the Minister what is the position in regard to the question of fees for entry for local appointments competitions and the question of possible special fees for those who are left off the shortlist but appeal to be placed on the list for interview.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general assessment of the Local Appointments Commission we can say that this was one of the fine achievements of our Government, an achievement which started very shortly after self-government and something <Col N="71" /> which old mother England has not yet caught up with.  If we look at the way in which our local officials have been appointed for over 50 years and look at the situation still among the local authorities in Britain, we realise that in this instance we have been far ahead of the times.  It is interesting to recall that this question of the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission, was there from the beginning. In fact, at the first annual conference of Sinn Féin which was held in 1905 in the Rotunda this system was advocated by Arthur Griffith.  He treated it as one of the keystones of the Sinn Féin policy.  In the very interesting time of the Dáil Department of Local Government under Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, one of the few Departments of Dáil Éireann prior to the Treaty which was successful, one of the things which was done was the investigation into such a scheme.  It may be of interest to Senators that it was someone who for many years was a Member of this House, the late Michael Hayes, who, on emerging from prison in 1921, was asked by Mr. W.T. Cosgrave to sit down and prepare for Dáil Éireann in those pre-Treaty days a scheme for local appointments. It was probably appropriate then that Michael Hayes became the first chairman of the Civil Service Commission as Ceann Comhairle, and it was only the pressure of the work as Ceann Comhairle and as Chairman of the Civil Service Commission that led him to refuse the chairmanship of the first Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the advantages of the LAC.  They have developed a very great expertise.  It is, by the fact that their methods are recognised and well-known, attractive to candidates and produces an attractive pool of candidates for important posts.  It is efficient in regard to the fact that it can reduce the cost of advertising due to the manner in which it operates.  Above all their great advantage has been the way in which they have produced mobility in the local authority service.  This is a really colossal achievement. We can look back in the bound volumes of <i>Dublin Opinion</i>, and find <Col N="72" /> there a cartoon depicting an urban council meeting.  One man is thumping the table and saying, &ldquo;Are we as patriots going to stand still and not speak out against a man from the next parish being appointed as our dispensary doctor?&rdquo; That was an exaggeration of the spirit that was there before the Local Appointments Commission but not a complete exaggeration.  Now we have a system that has given confidence to people that they are able to make a career on merit.  We have had this for over 50 years, not just in the purely administrative jobs but also in the jobs of my own profession of engineering, the Minister's profession of architecture and the medical profession. This has had a remarkable effect and has given this mobility, so much so that when the Institute of Public Administration produced a report on mobility in the public service as a whole it pointed to what had been achieved in the local authority sector as a model for the civil service and for the remainder of the public sector.  In comparison, the disadvantages of the Local Appointments Commission system are relatively minor.  In fairness, it must be said that many of the complaints that have been made against them down through the years have been remedied. In particular, there has been the complaint of delay.  This has been a persistent complaint down through the years, but my impression is that this is not so loud or so frequent a complaint nowadays as it was.  It seems they have managed to overcome many of the difficulties in this regard.</P>
    <P>Acknowledging that the Local Appointments Commission have been this very distinct success, do we just accept that and leave it there?  I would suggest to the Minister, no.  I would suggest to him that accepting that the Local Appointments Commission have been a singular success, it is time to look at the whole question of the public sector. There was an interdepartmental report some years ago, but, like many interdepartmental reports, it somehow got lost.  It certainly is lost in regard to any effect that it might have.  There have been close ties between the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments <Col N="73" /> Commission since the twenties.  There are close ties between the staff who are working for the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission. I think that we need mobility throughout the whole public service.  This is something that we need if we are to move forward.  If we are to set our whole economy on a firmer basis, if we are to come through the great troubles that now beset us, one of the things that will be a potent weapon in our struggle will be the promotion of mobility throughout the public sector.  This mobility being achieved so readily by means of the Local Appointments Commission, then we should certainly look at whether it is time to consider once again the question as to whether there should be a public sector commission.  There are, of course, arguments on both sides.  I am not coming down necessarily for a unified body, but I am saying that it is something we must look at.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in his introductory speech that his aim was to make the statutory framework absolutely clear.  I agree that that is an admirable aim, but has the Minister really achieved it?  If he looks at his own Bill he will see again legislation by reference.  He has on the face of the Bill ten Acts referred to in the Bill.  There are another ten not referred to in the Bill that also affect the work of the Local Appointments Commission.  I know that it is necessary to come forward as quickly as possible and to remedy defects where defects exist, but there is a very strong case here for attempting to consolidate the legislation.  If the aim is to make the framework absolutely clear, it should be clear to legislators.</P>
    <P>I return now to the point that I made earlier.  Unless legislation is clear to legislators then we cannot do our job properly.  I know this takes time and is difficult, but I appeal in regard to this Act and indeed to many more that there is a case here for consolidation.  I would like to echo something which I have said many times and which Senator Eoin Ryan has also said many times in this Chamber, that if we could get away from legislation by reference we would be doing a better job.  The law would be <Col N="74" /> clear to us as we enact it.  The law should be clear to the people for whom it is enacted.  We have examples in many of the countries of Europe where every Bill which comes forward is a Consolidation Bill.  This also is something to which I would ask the Minister to give his mind. Meanwhile, the legislation that he does bring forward to remedy defects that have been found is indeed welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join in the welcome to Deputy Ruairí Quinn to the Seanad and to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister of State.  I wish to focus briefly on those sections of the Bill relating to the criteria to be used by the Local Appointments Commissioners in selecting staff.  The importance of appropriate selection techniques cannot be over-stressed.  When we look at poor selections it can have very serious consequences, especially when we consider the reality that it is difficult to dispense with the services of an employee who turns out to be a problem, or unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The trade union attitude, generally speaking, is that selection is the employer's prerogative and that if an employee proves unsatisfactory then it is up to the employers to put up with the consequences.  Great care is taken by many organisations in purchasing, for example, a very expensive piece of equipment. A recruitment decision, however, demands particular care when viewed in monetary terms because it involves an investment decision of hundreds of thousands of pounds over the lifetime of an employee.  Looked at from the point of a misfit or a dissatisfied employee, he may find himself locked into a job for life.  His dissatisfaction with his lot may result in, for example, a poor quality of work which in turn may affect the standard of work by those with whom he works in a group and also may lead to bad industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning specifically to the question of selection in the local government service, I hope that the expanded selection criteria proposed in the Bill will be used further to integrate professional and administrative grades.  This dual structure, <Col N="75" /> whereby professional people give advice to administrators who are of course, the decision-makers, greatly reduces the prospects of, for example, engineers, architects and town planners ever achieving a top administrative post like county manager.  This is an unhealthy and unwise situation.  In fairness to the local government service, however, they have made considerably more progress in integrating professional, technical and administrative grades than in the case of central Government.  By intensifying their efforts in integrating these grades, the local government service could set a very valuable headline for the civil service.</P>
    <P>I urge the continuation of competition for selection of senior posts rather than relying on the criterion of seniority alone. Merit &mdash; and this has already been touched upon &mdash; should be the dominant criterion in the selection of staff for all grades of officers and employees and, in the case of public servants in particular, personal qualities like diligence and courtesy should carry at least as much weight as formal qualifications.</P>

    <P>Since I came to the Seanad a reasonably short time ago I have tried to make it a habit not to speak about matters about which I have little or no knowledge. I am making an exception this evening to intervene very briefly in this area of local authority appointments, an area about which I have virtually no knowledge.  However, it has been drawn to my attention that there is concern among officials of middle to senior management levels in local authorities about the composition of some interview boards.  That is not to question the integrity of the membership of the interview boards concerned &mdash; I want to stress that quite clearly and carefully.  The concern is rather that it appears occasionally that the interview boards are comprised of people of equivalent rank to the post which is to be filled or sometimes a rank <Col N="76" /> below it.  This, apparently, is causing concern to local authority officials who are competing for these posts, since they feel it reflects in some way an attitude on the part of the civil service that the local authority appointments are not quite as important as they might be.  The view has been expressed to me, and I would like to put it to the Minister for consideration in the context of implementing this legislation, that it might be considered that, in future, interview boards should be comprised of personnel of a rank at least one step above the post which is to be filled.  I do not wish to continue on that point.  It is one that has been drawn to my attention and I would in turn wish to draw it to the attention of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not want to speak at any great length on the Second Stage of this Bill.  I think Senator Dooge and others have covered the general precedents of the Bill very well.  This is one of the rare opportunities we get of discussing the work of the Local Appointments Commission, and one problem which has been notable over the last 15 years and, in particular during the period of time when I was a member of local authority, which was the first ten years of that 15 years, needs to be ventilated in the House.</P>
      <P>The appointments in local authority offices take place on the undeniably fair criterion of merit.  The problem of the parochial difficulties which would arise in the absence of a Local Appointments Commission has largely been overcome, but this has been done at a considerable price and is particularly noticeable when employment prospects in the local authorities are good.  It may not be quite as big a problem this year as it has been in the past but, no doubt, as employment prospects improve, it will again be a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the Local Appointments Commission feel themselves unable to consider the strategic importance of the appointments which they are making to the particular local authority. In other words, they seem to fail to take into account the necessity for stability in local authorities, and a well qualified person <Col N="77" /> can successively apply and be appointed to a large variety of posts in different local authorities.  That gives rise to a high turnover of officials and a problem, particularly where employment prospects are good, that the local authorities, especially those who might be described as less fashionable, do not have a permanent technical or administrative staff but a technical or administrative staff that are passing through for the time being.</P>
    <P>Because the Local Appointments Commission have done this on a national basis, if they are asked to appoint something to the Clare County Council they cannot say &ldquo;there is a need for stability in Clare County Council, if we appoint candidate E we know he is also an applicant for the job in Dublin and when he gets that job he will immediately leave Clare County Council&rdquo;.  The position will develop over a period of time which is similar to what happened as regards the small urban authorities and their town clerk.  It applied even more fundamentally to important positions in local authority and, therefore, in the consideration of further legislation in this area and the criteria to be examined, some consideration of the needs of the new employer, plus the needs of the old employer, is necessary.  I recognise that in doing that you are limiting the freedom of action of the individual who is making the application, and that is why it is very difficult to do and why it must be done with great delicacy and consultation with all the interests involved.</P>
    <P>While the Local Appointments Commission have been very successful, it has given rise to a situation where nobody is charged with the responsibility of looking at these appointments on a strategic basis so as to get a degree of permanence and policy consistency throughout local authorities which is necessary for the implementation of their many important schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that we have had an impartial consideration by the Local Appointments Commission of all appointments which they make.  It often appears to me that expertise from <Col N="78" /> outside the local authorities system and the civil service should be brought into the appointments commission because, in too many cases, as has been suggested by Senator O'Leary, the people on the appointments commission might be interviewing a particular engineer whom they might want to get back to their own county, so they place him in another county where they can get him into a position for promotion.  You have technical people from within the local authorities sitting on selection committees and you might get a very enthusiastic engineer in a particular county who goes for a job in another county and he finds he does not get it.  There is another appointment coming up in some other county and the same members of the appointments commission are on the interview board again.  You can get a very enthusiastic young engineer going around the country for every position that comes up, the same people are interviewing him and eventually they get fed up with looking at him and he gets fed up looking at them. He either stagnates in the job in the local authority or he gets out of it.</P>
      <P>Another point often forgotten by the Local Appointments Commission is that most people who work for local authorities have to meet the public to a larger degree than technical people in other industries.  I do not want to get myself into trouble here, but it is often felt by people who approach officers of local bodies that they do not get the courtesies they expect.  The public relations aspect of appointments should be taken much more carefully into consideration than has heretofore been the case.  A member of the public who goes to a local authority is generally in trouble of some description or he is looking for something that might or might not be contentious.  He should be met in a courteous manner but, unfortunately, that does not always happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions which were significantly different from those made in the other House. It is a comment I am not supposed to make but I cannot avoid making it.  If I <Col N="79" /> can intrude on an earlier part of the discussion today, my personal view is that this House is very suitable for the initiation of legislation, because it gets a kind of consideration, maybe partisan, but nevertheless a measured consideration that frequently preoccupations in the other House do not provide for.  We are committed to a legislative programme and I hope to see much of that legislation being initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole welcomed the Bill and the reconfirmation of the role of the Irish language within our system as an official language of the State but particularly for those areas where people wish to conduct their business in Irish or, alternatively, where a working knowledge of the language is effectively essential if we are to give effect to the objectives of the political parties and of successive administrations in the consolidation of the restoration of the language.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge displayed yet again his detailed knowledge in a substantive way of the entire operation of this area, and I welcome many of the points he made. The question of consolidation is a bigger matter than this legislation.  I am not passing the buck, but in this regard the responsibility now is that of the Minister for the Public Service.  However, I have taken note of his proposal and I believe it is something that the Government <i>in toto</i> could look at.  It does not just stop at the Government.  Indeed the reform of the Oireachtas in general, and specifically of both Houses, could have permanent committees of consolidation doing the kind of work directly with the parliamentary draftsmen, regularly to update and upgrade legislation so that Members of the Oireachtas, or people who have to look at what the Oireachtas enacts, can clearly see that they are looking at the entire body of legislation in a particular area and not have to go rooting through other laws and references.  The point is well made, and certainly it has been taken by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the last point made by Senator Lanigan, of the doubt raised in people's minds regarding how many <Col N="80" /> points are granted for Irish and, if so, how the actual system works, my understanding of the system &mdash; and I was only once before a Local Appointments Commission for an interview post with a local authority &mdash; is that the interview board is comprised of public sector personnel and also professionals from outside.  It is not confined to a closed shop of public servants. Where appropriate and when necessary the commissioners request people with the necessary external qualifications working in the private sector to participate in the board and to use their judgment in helping the board to select the best qualified candidate.</P>
    <P>On the question of Irish, such a board is never allowed to know which of the candidates it has interviewed has even applied to take the Irish language exam, or what marks they may get for fear it might unduly influence what is their task, which is to assess the competence and qualifications of the applicants in other areas.  The figures, such as I have them, are assessed on the basis of competence of the Irish language, where 6 per cent is granted, and for a good knowledge of the language 3 per cent is granted.  I am assuming here that the 6 per cent mentioned is out of 100 per cent rather than getting 106 per cent or 103 per cent as used sometimes to be the case in leaving certificate mathematics, where if a student did the examination through Irish he could get 110 per cent.  That is the situation in relation to Irish.</P>
    <P>I am particularly attracted to the idea of mobility within the public service generally. I would go further and look for the kind of mobility that the French were able to achieve in the Fourth Republic between the public and private sector where you could in fact have people moving in and out.  The only kind of mobility of that kind that exists at the moment is in the political sphere and not in the civil service sphere.  If we could extend the same degree of mobility into the civil service, some of us might make very good civil servants and some of the civil servants might make excellent politicians.</P>
    <P>The principle of mobility is something that in a small society like ours with limited resources we should encourage, and <Col N="81" /> in so far as this legislation provides for that, I would welcome it.  However, it does cut across at 180 degrees the kind of argument which Senator O'Leary was making for the local man.  He virtually paraphrased the cartoon described from <i>Dublin Opinion.</i>  A balance between the two at the relative level and scale, is what we are looking for &mdash; and I think a balance has been found in the legislation in relation to town clerks.  The situation there was notorious, as Senator O'Toole said.  There were town clerks moving virtually permanently all the time from post to post trying to get a permanent position and then applying for something else.  It meant that substantial towns, for example, towns the size of Trim and Navan, would have a local person who found himself acting as the temporary clerk.  He would go for the appointment when it became vacant but he would not be successful. Somebody from, dare I say it, Cork would be appointed to the post and he would no sooner get the post in Trim but would want to get transferred to a vacancy that had arisen in Midleton and would possibly apply for that.  Eventually after three or four vacancies, the local man in Trim, who simply wanted to be the town clerk of Trim, would eventually get the job and there would be stability there for the duration until perhaps he proved his worth and was promoted to be county manager of Cork or whatever. The instability in the system was such that, as Deputy Frank McLoughlin mentioned in his own County Meath, one simply did not know who was going to be the town clerk every time one went into the local authority.</P>
    <P>I think most Deputies and Senators from provincial Ireland recognise the kind of problems this generated, and by definition, the lack of commitment such an office-holder would have to the development of the town and to the promotion of industrial development, tourism or amenities in the town.  The change that we are making in this legislation, which follows agreed consultations with unions and personnel people in the Department through the C and A system, is one that I think is welcome.</P>
    <P>I think on that point Senator Hillery <Col N="82" /> from his own expert knowledge as Professor of Industrial Relations in UCD brought to bear the kind of thinking that is now needed in assessing the suitability of people in such positions.  Frequently civil servants at all grades, both technical and administrative, have now got to have skills which perhaps were not as critical or were not as important in previous times.  The transformation in social attitudes, the equalisation and democratisation of attitudes, both in the women's movement and the youth movement which has removed the traditional hierarchial pyramid between grandchild and grandparent and indeed father and child has not, in my view, been adequately reflected in the way in which we relate to each other in administrations.  You can get into conflict, I believe, when people who operate a 19th century pyramid structure of human relations within any kind of organisation run into difficulties, when relations in the outside world frequently have become quite different. To that extent I think the personal qualities to which Senator Hillery referred of diligence, commitment and civility are factors that should be taken into account by any interview board.  Having made those kind of comments I want to stress because of the impartiality of the Local Appointments Commissioners and the legislation which was set up to establish them, this Department and myself, and successive office-holders before me and those who will come after us, have no role in this area, nor should we have.  I know the commissioners will read the debates in both Houses and as I expect any intelligent group of people would do, will have regard to the considered points that have been made by all sides in this House.</P>
    <P>The comment that was made by Senator Flor O'Mahony is something that requires a certain degree of sensitivity.  If people are applying for a post of a certain grade or a certain seniority, within the constraints of available resources and available personnel for interviews I think people charged with making that selection should ensure not only that the interview board is competent and proficient in what it does but also that it is comprised <Col N="83" /> of people of a suitable grade and rank so as not to complicate or to add to the difficulties.  If concern exists about this matter &mdash; I am given to understand that it is there among some sections of the local authority structure &mdash; then perhaps this is an opportunity for the Oireachtas to acknowledge that it is there and to trust that the Local Appointments Commission themselves will take whatever necessary steps they consider appropriate to remove that concern.</P>
    <P>All of us are agreed that the success of the Local Appointments Commission has been considerable particularly against the background in which they were established. Professor Dooge referred to Mr. Michael Hayes.  It might interest him to know that we still have the original circulars that were drafted by him in the Book of Circulars in the Department of the Environment in the Custom House. It is one of the major achievements of our society.  Perhaps after 60 years we should be as much concerned now with effectiveness, efficiency and suitability as the founding fathers were with impartiality, because things move at a faster pace now.</P>
    <P>In reply to an earlier question by Senator Dooge as to the normal time span, I am given to understand that it is approximately six months depending on the post and I do not think it is possible to speed it up a lot more.  A month is given for advertisements, one to two months for getting in references, for interview procedures and then allowing the person time to give their notice of at least a month on the other side.  There is a minimum amount of time below which it is not possible to go unless you want to introduce a degree of mobility that would wreak havoc with our industrial relations in the public sector, which I do not think is the proposal.</P>
    <P>In making those points I would like to thank all contributors in this debate for their personal good wishes and for the constructive way in which they dealt with this measure.  I would like, therefore, to propose agreement to Second Stage.</P>

      <P>This is really the kernel of the second purpose of the Bill.  It has been decided to spell beyond doubt the exact powers of the commissioners in the area of selecting candidates.  I think this section seeks to do that by inserting criteria which were previously used in the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956. There are two points I want to make arising out of the section.</P>
      <P>It is clear both in what the Minister says and in subsection (2) (b) that the appointments will be by competition.  It is stated that the competition shall, as the Commissioners may decide, consist of any one of the following: interview, written examination, practical examination or any other test.  I do not have the benefit of the actual report of the Supreme Court but I am depending for the moment on the Minister's statement in Second Stage in which he said that the Supreme Court decided that the Commissioners acted beyond their powers in granting extra credit for knowledge of Irish to candidates being selected.  To do that it is obvious that the Supreme Court must have inquired into the method that was used for determining the success or otherwise of the particular candidate. Obviously the Supreme Court decided that it was a competent body to subject to scrutiny the methods of appointment and methods of assessment used by the commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of selection we are proposing here could, in due course, be subject to scrutiny by the High Court and ultimately the Supreme Court in a case brought under the new subsection (3).  I <Col N="85" /> presume no difficulty will arise if the commissioners can vouch that the way in which they arrived at their conclusion was by way of written examination or by way of a practical examination but if it is by way of interview how would the commissioners report to the court on a competition of interview?  It appears to me that that is what they would have to do.  The Supreme Court have said: &ldquo;We are going to look at the way in which you conducted the test or the competition&rdquo;. One of the ways in which you can have a competition under this new legislation is by interview.  Therefore, would we have a situation where a person who felt aggrieved could go into the High Court and say, &ldquo;I do not believe that the interview was conducted fairly and I do not believe that I should have been given less marks than somebody else&rdquo;.  In order to prove that that was not the case, would the Local Appointments Commission have to put before the court the scheme that they used for marking one interviewee over another interviewee?  Is that what it means?  Because if it is, it appears to me that it would be a very difficult thing to do.  Therefore, I ask the Minister if he is satisfied that a secision by the Local Appointments Commission to use an interview type competition will not give rise to difficulty, should the result of that interview be questioned in the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem as such in the commission, if taken to court, revealing or disclosing the manner in which they operate.  They can always do that.  An interview is an oral competition and people who go to be interviewed are marked accordingly on a set of criteria. It is the collective judgment of three, or some cases five, participants on the interview board.  I do not see that there is any difficulty in the point that the Senator is raising should some dissatisfied person feel that they were unfairly treated.  The commission will make available to the court the system under which the particular candidate was selected.</P>

      <P>This is my first opportunity in this Seanad to welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  Perhaps he does not feel too welcome in the circumstances, but he is welcome.  I regret having to raise an issue like this in this House in this manner at this late hour.  I regret any inconvenience I may have caused to the Minister, or at least I would not wish to have done it in this fashion.  My motion refers to the failure of the social services section of the Western Health Board to comply with a directive of the Employment Equality Agency with regard to a proposal to employ all male staff in a hostel for homeless men and the compliance of the Department of Health with that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central issue in this is a directive from the Employment Equality Agency. However, it refers to a proposed hostel for homeless men in Galway, and in order to see this problem about an all-male <Col N="87" /> staff, the problem of the homeless and homelessness in Galway has to be put in its perspective if the issue is to be understood and seen in its relevant context.</P>
    <P>The problem of homelessness in Galway was first identified about three years ago, not by the Western Health Board, not by the Galway Social Service Council, which is effectively a function of the health board though it is theoretically separate, but by a group of individuals. They were, to my recollection, predominantly female and they suffered no great fright, harrassment or damage to their integrity or their virtue from the fact that they were working with the homeless and with homeless men.  That was three years ago.  At that stage the Western Health Board saw fit to congratulate these people for the work they were doing and to remark on how well they were doing it &mdash; again, may I hasten to add, a group who were predominantly female.  So, the sex does not matter but since it is being made to matter we have to talk about it.</P>
    <P>The health board agreed that a problem existed and needed to be dealt with quickly.  That is as far back as September 1980.  We then had the sort of double shuffle which, unfortunately, besets the homeless in this country, which is that suddenly the corporation and the local authority became involved.  We had about a year of this sort of shuffle in which the local authority endeavoured to pretend that it was doing something about it and then got a long statement from the Department of the Environment shifting the problem back to the health board and taking it out of the hands of the local authority.  This is the sort of thing that happens to the homeless but nobody usually notices because nobody usually notices the homeless until something happens to them, and something, I fear, is going to happen to them fairly shortly in Galway if action is not taken.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board then proposed a temporary shelter and caused some confusion there.  There were local objections and it was alleged that the objections would not have been as severe if a different and more respectable &mdash; and <Col N="88" /> it has been alleged a more responsible group &mdash; were running it than the Simon Community.  My interest and connection with the Simon Community is both wellknown and fairly well regarded, if I am to judge by recent election results.  Therefore, any perception of the Simon Community as an irresponsible organisation is confined to the ranks of the prejudiced and perhaps the over-sensitive bureaucrats who do not like voluntary organisations who answer back, but it definitely is not reflected in public opinion either locally or nationally.  Nevertheless, this shelter was set up and it was staffed by men and by women, though there were some difficulties in the early stages because of the appallingly inadequate facilities that were available there.</P>
    <P>In the manner of these things sometimes, this shelter was burnt down.  It was nothing more that a temporary pre-fab, but it was burnt down, and facilities were then provided for homeless people in what had been a night shelter for men run by the Legion of Mary.  This had facilities for men and women and was staffed by men and women consistently. Malicious rumours have been circulated by agents of statutory bodies about what happened in that house.  The rumours are lies.  They have absolutely no foundation. In fact, they have been used to justify decisions of policy and they are based on total fabrications.</P>
    <P>The Simon Community were unhappy. They were living in an area which was highly populated and they had made commitments to the local community which they intended and intend to meet, and therefore they wished to have a permanent shelter or hostel provided for people.  Simon then began to accentuate their campaign of action to try to persuade a rather indolent and lethargic health board to do something quickly about it.  The response of the health board and its agent, the Social Services Council, was to accuse the Simon Community of being irresponsible.  So what? No problem at all, except that the response went further.  The response surfaced in the form of a proposal to build a night shelter for homeless men, and staff were to be recruited, paid for fully by the <Col N="89" /> State and the advertisement for those staff specifically stated that the staff should be male.</P>
    <P>One thing is clear from that chronology, and that is that in the area of homelessness in Galway the Simon Community are the experts.  I do not like blowing the trumpet of an organisation I am closest to, but in the light of the circumstances in Galway it is very necessary to do so.  Indeed, in reply to a Dáil question on 8 February 1983 on homelessness in Galway I found it most ironic that the figure the Minister provided for homeless people in Galway was quite clearly supplied to the Western Health Board by the Galway Simon Community, because they are the only people who know and they are the ones who are dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of the Simon Community is based on compassion, acceptance and support, not on control.  The word &ldquo;control&rdquo; has been referred to in a context which would horrify you if you were not dealing on a day-to-day basis with the problem.  In that context, the Western Health Board proposed to exclude the Simon Community.  They decided it.  Simon had nothing to do with it, contrary again to their malicious and false allegations.  They also decided to employ four full-time staff.  Apart from the clear breach of the constitution of the Galway Social Service Council, which undertakes not to: &ldquo;supplant or interfere with the autonomy of existing voluntary organisations or compete with them...&rdquo; and bearing in mind that that council is controlled by the Western Health Board, there was this extraordinary predilection and insistence upon male staff.  For me this has implications of 19th century asylums where big, strong heavy men were required to keep people under control who would otherwise be a threat presumably either to themselves or to the community.  I and other people sought in great detail reasons for this insistence on male staff, and the more we probed the more appalling the situation became.  That was when the question of the need to control people arose, that you would be dealing with men who were difficult and so on and, therefore, you <Col N="90" /> would need men to control them, that these men had been involved in the abuse of children, which was a lie, that these men had been involved in the abuse of women, another lie.  These were the stories that were told to us and this was the reason they said they needed men to control the homeless men of Galway.  It was because of malicious and complete distortions of the facts based on no direct contact with the people involved.  I emphasise the organisation that is now being excluded knew these people best but their views were never sought on these issues and their views on the best method of staffing were never sought.</P>
    <P>These fictions about the abuse of children, about violence, and about abuse of women, are the classic anti-homeless fictions which have beset those campaigning, whether it be for homeless women, children or men in Dublin, in Galway and in many other places in this country.  They are nothing more than fictions.  The gardaí will tell you that in the context of the problems of crimes of violence the chronically homeless are not particularly high on their list of problems.  The sort of prejudices that are being fostered by these people would be more appropriate to a Sunday tabloid than to the pronouncements of officials of the caring services.</P>
    <P>The reality is the opposite.  Indeed, a senior officer of the Western Health Board has been insisting publicly on the need for integration in psychiatric hospitals because he recognises the need for integration of the sexes and the therapeutic value of that integration.  That is in the psychiatric services, but apparently when it comes to the homeless those sort of considerations do not arise.  I will quote from a letter from a member of the Galway Simon Community who was being discriminated against by this provision for all-male staff: &ldquo;The experience of working with homeless men is that many of them have difficulty in relating in a meaningful manner to women.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anyone who has ever dealt with homeless men will know that one of the unfortunate consequences of homelessness is precisely that many of the single homeless having spent most of their lives in an <Col N="91" /> all-male environment, industrial schools, army, prison etc. find that the culture is essentially all-male.  If one is serious about the normalisation and rehabilitation of these men one does not employ an all-male staff.  Such a policy only compounds their social handicaps and does little to bring about a constructive change to their lives.  I defy anybody to suggest otherwise.  I have worked with homeless men, men who were alledgedly violent, and I know the value and the contribution of full-time female staff to their happiness and their comfort, in the capacity to persuade them to live in the dignity that any human being should achieve.  It is total distortion and totally untrue to suggest that all-male staff are necessary for reasons of control or otherwise.  It is ante-diluvian, it is 19th century and it is fundamentally anti-woman.  One particularly well-qualified woman acquaintance of mine who is a social worker, has a certificate of qualification in social work, has worked with the probation service and has spent 12 months working with the homeless, is apparently ineligible to be considered for a staff position in this hostel for the homeless in Galway. It is because of this woman's commitment that this issue has been raised with the Employment Equality Agency.</P>
    <P>When the Employment Equality Agency approached those in Galway who were attempting to recruit this all-male staff, they were greeted with misrepresentation of a most extraordinary kind. It was alleged that the hostel had no facilities for women.  An impression was given that an old premises was being refurbished and there could not be any provision for women.  The truth is the exact opposite.  In spite of abundant evidence about the importance of female staffing in a situation like this, the Galway Social Service Council with the full support of the Western Health Board proposed to build a hostel, absolutely new, with no facilities for women involved. There was no question of a problem.  It was designed to exclude women, it was planned to exclude women.  It had nothing to do with any problem other than the fact of a deliberate decision to <Col N="92" /> exclude women from the service.  That was a misjudgment and a misrepresentation of the problems and personalities of the homeless, of the culture of homelessness and of the needs of homeless people.</P>
    <P>Extraordinarily enough, the clause under the Employment Equality Act which those agencies endeavoured to invoke concerned problems of lighthouses and such buildings.  They endeavoured to distort totally the employment equality legislation.  When the issue was clarified to the Employment Equality Agency they contacted the Galway Social Service Council by telegram pointing out that the all-male policy was in the view of the Employment Equality Agency illegal, and effectively directing them to insert a new advertisement leaving out the all-male staffing requirement.  It appears that the Galway Social Service Council will not comply with that directive. The Galway Social Service Council, who are effectively an arm of the statutory services, and are not independent of the statutory services in the case of Galway and therefore are an instrument of public policy, have decided to defy the State-sponsored Employment Equality Agency in terms of staffing proposals because of anti-female prejudice.</P>
    <P>I did not want to raise this issue here but as it developed I endeavoured on many occasions to contact the Minister. I wanted to meet him quietly to present the facts to him.  I rang his office on many occasions, I got many promises from his office to let me know when he could meet me.  None of those promises was ever met, therefore I have had to resort to this tactic.  I had no success in dealing with the Minister.  Early in February I wrote a letter to him.  <i>Inter alia</i>, I indicated that the all-male environment, apart from being illegal, is unhelpful to the residents, and that is the experience of the Simon Community.  I have so far received no reply to that letter, though I understand today from an official of the Minister's Department that the Minister has written to me indicating that he is more or less happy with the decisions taken by the Western Health Board and the Galway Social Service Council.  I will be delighted <Col N="93" /> if the Minister can tell me when he replies that that is not true.  I have been endeavouring to contact him for three weeks and I am not in any way attempting to misrepresent him.  It is in final frustration that I am here and this is not the way I like to do business.</P>
    <P>The Minister, we were told, accepted the justification of the Western Health Board of the need for all-male staff &mdash; this is what his officials told us &mdash; because of the problems associated with these homeless people.  This is clear anti-female prejudice on the part of a State statutory agency apparently being complied with by the Minister.  I find it astonishing that a Minister of the Labour Party and a socialist, part of a government who are and claim to be a reforming government, who in particular have laid emphasis on the role of women in society, could either actively or passively tolerate the treatment of women in this issue and in general the principles, activities and carry-on of those agencies of the State who are responsible for this mess.</P>
    <P>If that was the end of it, perhaps I could have left it to my female colleagues to assert the rights of women.  However, the unfortunate consequences of this policy are that, because of the involvement of the Employment Equality Agency and the apparent refusal to accept their opinion and their attempt at a directive on the advertising, this matter will now be brought by that agency to the Labour Court and, if necessary, to the courts of this land in order to assert and defend the right of women to be treated as equals in employment.  The implications for our equality legislation are enormous.  If it is open to any employer to define any premises in which he proposes to employ staff in such a way that facilities for women are excluded, then any employer who does not want to employ woman can get around the requirements of the Employment Equality Agency.  A fundamental issue of principle is involved here, identified as such by the Employment Equality Agency.  Unfortunately, agencies of the State are involved in that question.</P>
    <P>That is not the central problem.  It will be a matter for the Minister, the Western Health Board and the Galway Social <Col N="94" /> Service Council to deal with the embarrassment. The problem is that such procedures will involve long delays which will leave a newly-built, health-board owned and financed hostel unstaffed.  I am assured by the Employment Equality Agency that the proposals are illegal and that any appointments made under that advertising and policy will be invalid. Consequently we will have long delays while this whole thing is worked out, in the context of what is happening in Galway, and this is why the matter has particular urgency.</P>
    <P>Pressures from local residents on the existing hostel for homeless men will increase.  They will not be able to understand why they have to live with a hostel for homeless men which frightens them &mdash; even though there is no need for them to be frightened &mdash; when another new hostel is vacant.  It will be empty because the question of who should staff it will be going through the Labour Court and the courts generally if necessary.  Ultimately the homeless men of Galway will be the victims of this particularly shortsighted and sexist policy.  The pressures of the local residents, I fear, will produce a situation in which the Simon Community will be forced to leave their existing premises.  They are not being allowed to take over the new premises because those in authority have decided they are not fit to do so.  Instead homeless men will be back on the streets of Galway directly as a consequence of this proposal to employ all-male staff.  I find it unacceptable, the homeless men of Galway will find it unacceptable and I sincerely hope the Minister will also find it unacceptable. This will be the first time in 18 months that anybody will be sleeping in the streets of Galway.  Since Simon opened in Galway 18 months ago nobody has slept rough in Galway.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister has in this whole issue accepted unquestioningly the view of the official bureaucracy which has nationally failed miserably to solve the problem of homelessness.  We have abundant evidence of that, though I regret that on the basis of some recent replies to questions about county homes the information does not seem to have <Col N="95" /> reached the Minister's desk.  We have abundant evidence of the incapacity, inability and unwillingness of the State caring services to deal with the problem of homelessness.  They dealt with the problem by ignoring it, by closing down wards, county homes and so on.  We have abundant evidence of the inability of this bureaucracy to deal with the problem of homelessness, yet the Minister apparently accepts his advice entirely from that source.  He could not find himself in a position to discuss it with me before apparently he came to a decision, and could not find himself in a position to tell that bureaucracy that there are bigger issues than their obsession with sexism. So much for reform and in particular for the much-touted public policy of partnership between statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister in accepting as justification for an all-male staff the need to keep people under control has given official credence to the view that homeless men are dangerous, uncontrollable and implicitly, therefore, objectionable.  All in all, I regret to say, it is a magnificent job of confirming prejudices against the homeless.  If the prejudice against the homeless permeates into the very office of the Minister for Health &mdash; though I suspect it is not a view that the Minister holds himself and I am sure this is an oversight rather than a deliberate policy decision &mdash; how can those of us who are trying to change public opinion about the homeless and to direct it towards dealing with the problem of homelessness rather than moving it on to the next parish or the next village or the next street, do so if official credence is given to this prejudice in the staffing policy for hostels for the homeless?  Most of all, the policy of all-male staffing has for the reasons I have outlined placed the homeless of Galway at great risk.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would like first of all to reject categorically the distortions and half-truths of the Western Health Board and other agencies in Galway with regard to myself who have been named on a few occasions with regard to the Simon Community nationally and locally, and above <Col N="96" /> all and before all else, the distortions and misrepresentations of those agencies with regard to the problem of homelessness and the personalities, culture, attitudes and so on of homeless people, because that is the biggest single dishonesty in the whole thing.  I want badly a hostel for homeless men in Galway.  I believe it is needed.  The resources and the expertise are there to deal with it.  A hostel must work.  A hostel must be compassionate, patient, accepted.  It is our experience that those qualities and that atmosphere can be generated only in a mixed sex environment where men and women are working on the staff, and it will not and cannot be generated in an all-male environment. I would like to reassert and to ask the Minister to reassert the basic principle of partnership on a basis of equality between statutory and voluntary organisations in the running of social services at local level.  I request immediate decisive action by the Minister to remedy this appalling situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not share Senator Ryan's detailed knowledge of this problem at this hostel, he mentioned a couple of issues of principle which I too would like to underline.  The first of these which he mentioned last and once in passing during his speech is the importance of the partnership between statutory and voluntary bodies in running our social services.  This kind of policy has been supposedly the policy of successive Governments for years.  I recall that Deputy Erskine Childers when he was Minister for Health and another of the present Minister's predecessors, Deputy Brendan Corish, were particularly emphatic in their support of this kind of idea.  This idea simply cannot work if the partnership is seen to be one of one partner who is totally in authority and the little boys &mdash; or indeed the little girls &mdash; who are simply to be handed out grants, asked to give account of them and regarded all the time as the junior partner in the business.  In the present atmosphere where we are being told over and over again that there is such an incredible shortage of resources for growth in the social services and in the provision of care <Col N="97" /> within the community for various deprived people and people who are facing different kinds of handicaps and difficulties, it is all the more important that voluntary bodies should be encouraged and should be treated as adult bodies who know what they are doing and who have a certain amount of expertise, in some fields more expertise than the statutory authorities.  Unfortunately for some reason, I am not saying always, a sort of tendency seems to occur, towards creeping dictatorship by the statutory bodies, once they are working along with the voluntary body in any area, to want to take over, to have total control.  I am afraid that in some areas what I have described as creeping dictatorship tends to become galloping dictatorship and the voluntary body is either shoved out of what they have been doing or made to feel that they are very much the inferior partner.  It appears that this has been happening in this case in Galway.  I know that the present Minister would have a strong commitment towards this area in principle and I would ask him to look at this area and to make sure that the bodies who are nominally under his control in his Department would cease to act in a way which suggests that they are trying to either push out voluntary bodies or make voluntary bodies very much the lesser partner in any enterprise which is jointly undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second principle that I wish to refer to is that which has been pursued by the Employment Equality Agency. The fact that male only staff are to be recruited for this hostel is an obvious breach of the law, and it seems extraordinary that a statutory body should be prepared to defy the law of the land in this way and that they are prepared to be brought to the Labour Court and perhaps to the High Court because of the policy that they are pursuing.  The rationale of this idea of male only staff seems to be extraordinary.  The argument seems to be that men are needed to control these men.  I have not the same experience of homeless men that Senator Ryan has but I believe that on the whole they are unfortunate rather than violent and aggressive. They have their difficulties; nobody <Col N="98" /> would deny that.  Of course they can be difficult, but the kind of difficulties they have do not necessarily need to be met with brawn and beef.  They are the type of difficulties that need to be met with compassion and patience, and who is to say that only males are capable of providing the compassion and patience which are needed?</P>
    <P>As far as being able to exert authority is concerned, it is also extremely insulting to suggest that women are not able to behave firmly or to exert authority.  We have only to see the work of women in the probation service where they have to deal with very difficult cases, and indeed sometimes very much more aggressive cases than are appearing amongst homeless men, to see that they are well able to exert authority.  As for sexual problems of one sort or another I would have thought that both the Western Health Board and the Minister would have realised from the problems that arose in Kincora boys' home in Northern Ireland that having a male staff only does not necessarily do away with sexual problems or mean that we will do away with problems of that nature.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the women of Ireland today are well capable of looking after themselves.  A woman who applies, is accepted after competition and interview for a job in this situation is the kind of woman who will be able to look after herself and deal with the problems that will arise therein.  To fly in the face of the Employment Equality Agency and say that all we need to take care of homeless men are Mr. Atlases who can keep them well down is a complete distortion of what is needed.  It is also breaking the law.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Ryan, I am surprised that it is the present Minister who is involved in this kind of situation, and I can only feel that he has to some extent been given selective information.  I would be very reluctant to think that he himself would have these sort of opinions about the equal employment of women or the position of voluntary bodies.  In fact I know that he does not hold such opinions. Therefore, I appeal to him that he should at least look at the whole situation <Col N="99" /> again and listen to people who are not officials of the Western Health Board and who are not part of the statutory set-up to ensure that the law of the land is complied with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment to the very important portfolio which he now holds.  It is unfortunate that on his first coming into this House as Minister with an overall responsibility he has got such a picture of one of the bodies over which he exercises ultimate control.  I do not stand here as spokesman for the Western Health Board, but as a member of that board I feel it is my duty to answer some of the insinuations that have been made in the House tonight.  I would not in any way defend a policy of discrimination against females in the employment sector.  That question can be handled by a Department other than the Department of Health.  On the question of the health board's involvement and selective information, we have had a feast of selective information on this point this evening.  To suggest that an all-male staffing would be involved in the running of the functions of this hostel is incorrect. Perhaps an advertisement has appeared in the public press for filling male staffing requirements, but I want to put to the Minister that the Western Health Board have provided the facility whereby the Social Service Council of Galway, the Simon Community and the health board themselves will have an input into the staffing and running of that hostel. Thereby it will not be an all-male staffing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan declared tonight that they have an expert in that field; it is the duty of Simon to present that name to the health board in conjunction with all the other agencies who will be involved in the running of that hostel.  Therein lies the solution to the problem that Senator Ryan seems to have, with regard to making it a sexist institution.  It is incorrect also to say that the Western Health Board within County Galway do not operate similar facilities within the county.  They do in fact.  Whatever research has been <Col N="100" /> gone into to produce such facts as Senator Ryan has stated is inadequate.</P>
    <P>The history of the involvement of the voluntary bodies, and in particular the Simon Community in Galway, with the health boards has been very unfortunate. There has been a great deal of discontent among local communities, and that is not peculiar to Galway, as to the siting of proposed hostels or facilities for the homeless.  The homeless of Galway need urgent attention and the health board took urgent steps to comply with the statutory law to provide that facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They took steps to provide a shelter for the homeless of Galway.  To suggest that the present proposal is inadequate might be correct in one instance in so far as now it is recognised that such a facility is being provided in the city. There is always a focal point where unfortunate people gather and people who would otherwise be in other towns and cities have drifted towards Galway city. The original provision of this facility for 12 people is not now enough because there are 16 or more people in that position in Galway at present.  To suggest that no facilities are being provided for females in Galway is not correct in so far as females have a facility in Galway in Bethlehem House, which is being run by a voluntary organisation at present.  It might not be the ideal situation as regards a mixing of the sexes, but with a problem which is new to the city a genuine effort has been made to provide facilities for both sexes within the limited resources that are available to the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also said that the suggestion of the health board was that they would be committed to psychiatric institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There was reference to psychiatric institutions.  The reason why <Col N="101" /> the health board were doing that was that very many of the people so involved would have alcohol-related problems and the health board in Galway provide, probably the only one outside Dublin, facilities whereby people who are suffering from alcoholic-related diseases can have treatment.  Senator Ryan probably quoted out of context it was in that interest that the health board so decided.</P>
      <P>The question of partnership must be emphasised in order to put in perspective the arguments put forward by Senator Ryan.  Open invitations have been given to all voluntary organisations to become involved in this and in that way there was no debarring of females.  I hope the Minister will investigate this thoroughly and receive a clear indication from the health boards that they have, at all times, been perfectly amenable to the fact that the personalities involved could have been female as well as male.  The suggestion that the Social Service Council in Galway or any other area as an arm of the health boards would not include voluntary workers, as in the case that has been made tonight, is incorrect.  All of the social service councils have voluntary organisations as members.  To suggest that health boards are anti-voluntary organisations is ludicrous to say the least, as the very nature of a social service council is that it embraces all voluntary organisations as well as supervisors from the health boards.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the advertisement was taken out of context and used as a vehicle to attack the health boards in this House.  The real issues involved, which I am sure have not gone unnoticed by the Senator who proposed the motion, have been twisted out of context and been used in a deliberate fashion to attack a health board which is providing this facility.</P>

      <P>I received notice from Senator Ryan of the matter to be raised on the Adjournment this evening.  His comments in relation to the method of recruitment of the staff concerned are correct.  In such a serious <Col N="102" /> situation we should resist the temptation, and it is a temptation to which I too have yielded, to engage in confrontation.  I do not know the precise relationship between the Simon Community in Galway and the health board.  I cannot comment on the allegations that there have been distortions as Senator Ryan has said.  I do not know what precisely the half truths are that he has alluded to or the alleged misrepresentations that he speaks of or the allegations of an uncaring bureaucracy.  But I do know one thing: I have heard that language used on many occasions.  Indeed, I have often used it myself.  There is a temptation to yield to that assessment and we, as public representatives, have a tremendous capacity in this country to use the language of confrontation and a tremendous reluctance to use the language of resolving the problem. There is a serious problem and an impasse between Simon and the health board at local level.</P>
      <P>There has been no delay whatsoever on my part in attempting to assess the situation.  I received his communication on 4 February.  I contacted the board and I received a report on 18 February.  I do not recall any statements made by officials in my Department to the Senator in the context of a decision which I may be arriving at on the matter.  We should be very careful, therefore, in trying to communicate with one another on this question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Only a letter which I sign and you receive from me matters. Letters in the post are an entirely different matter.  It is what the Senator acutally receives, and I will be very careful in preparing any response to him on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with the allegation the Senator made in relation to the appointment of staff, because he is on very firm ground.  I regret that the advertisement that was put in by the Galway Social Service Board &mdash; I have a copy of it &mdash; referred to male staff with an interest in <Col N="103" /> the problems of homelessness required to run a hostel for homeless men in Galway city.  It has been difficult to get through to Galway on the phone and find out whether the health board received a directive from the equality agency.  I accept that the advertisement should not have been put in in that form, because it advertised for male staff only.  I am well aware and do not need to be reminded at all, that the EEC directives on equality are very stringent.  It appears that the Social Service Council in inserting an advertisement at this stage, if I may use the language of slight exaggeration, does not have a leg to stand on in terms of the law of the country.  It may have felt that under the Act it had an entitlement to do so, but the directives on equality are very stringent and already it appears that some sections of the Act are contrary to the EEC directives.  I share the Senator's view that there does appear to be a problem there.  I can assure Senator Ryan that I will request the health board to contact the Social Service Council to ensure that the appropriate measures are taken and that both male and female prospective applicants have an equal right to employment in the hostel.  There can be no question as far as I am concerned of a refusal to employ female staff.</P>
    <P>I received the Senator's correspondence on the matter on 21 February and have had very little opportunity to consider the matter.  The Senator is correct is raising the point.  He need have no concern; whether he raised the point here or in correspondence I would have followed up the matter one way or the other.  I will contact the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board with my views on the matter.  I have no doubt that he will contact the council to have the situation rectified as a matter or urgency.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question locally of shelter for homeless men in Galway there are quite conflicting views.  I am very concerned that these views should be on a point of impasse.  I acknowledge the tremendous contribution of Simon throughout the country, but Simon in Galway are of the view that the shelter is too small, <Col N="104" /> too crowded and that it would be run by male staff only.  I have only seen the advertisement in the past day or two.  It is also alleged by Simon that it would cost twice as much as what Simon could run the shelter for.  Frankly, I do not have enough information to reach any definitive conculsion on that.  Simon in Galway also want to be involved in running the temporary shelter along with the health board on a 50/50 basis.  Simon want to plan for a long-term hostel to be built on the grounds of the Regional Hospital.  In that regard, I can assure Senator Ryan that the site on the Regional Hospital grounds has not been abandoned by the health board.  It was rather that this opportunity came along to build the current hostel and Simon want full-time volunteers to be used in the running of these shelters.</P>
    <P>I concur with the general sentiments of Senator McGuinness that we must have effective local constructive co-operation between the voluntary bodies and the statutory agencies at local level.  It does require a meeting of minds and a joint co-operative approach.  I do not hold the view &mdash; and I have been a Dáil Deputy since 1969 &mdash; that because there is a statutory agency in existence automatically it must be perceived as being either a creeping or a galloping dictatorship. Again, that is the language of confrontation. If one uses that language it is perhaps inevitable that public servants and public officials will react in kind.  I make a plea for that co-operation and I hope that whether in Galway, Wexford and Cork or anywhere else where there is interaction between voluntary agencies and the statutory bodies, these matters will be resolved.</P>
    <P>I want to make one emphatic statement: I am not going to resolve them.  I cannot resolve them and I cannot go around the country advising the health boards on what they should do in terms of local implementation of statutory functions. Otherwise, we may as well abolish all statutory agencies and all the voluntary agencies and have everything run from the Custom House.  That is not possible because we are the largest employer in the country.  We employ 60,000 people <Col N="105" /> in the delivery of health care and responsibility has to be devolved onto the health boards.  I met the chief executive officers and the chairmen of the health boards last Friday together and impressed upon them the absolute need for full joint co-operation at local level between the voluntary bodies and the statutory agencies. I hope that will come about.  I hope that the impasse in Galway in relation to the new shelter will be resolved.  I very much regret that Simon declined the health board's invitation to become involved in the management committee of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I willingly stand corrected, but that is the information I had. It shows how the absence of communication can create misinterpretations on my part.  That is the information I had and I am glad to see it publicly challenged. <Col N="106" /> That kind of joint participation would be invaluable because, after all, what matters in Galway is that homeless men and women have accommodation. The respective roles and views of the agencies involved should be subordinate whether it be Simon, Senators or Ministers, to the need to provide effective local accommodation for homeless men and women.  They come first and must be seen to be coming first irrespective of our views.  In conclusion I assure Senator Ryan that I will contact the health board, request that the recruitment situation be rectified and that equal full opportunity be given to men and women to contribute their expertise to work in this setting.  I have no doubt that the health board will respond.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter and bringing it so sharply to my attention. I have no doubt, if I know him at all, that he will probably be doing it every week as long as he is in the Seanad, and fair dues to him.</P>
