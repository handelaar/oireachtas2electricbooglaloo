      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the Environment for the courtesy he showed this side of the House in the efforts he made yesterday to ensure that we would know what No. 1 on the Order of Business was today.  It is the first time I have seen such efforts made by Government Ministers to ensure that the Opposition would know exactly what would be on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>Could the Leader of the House make a special arrangement for the House to discuss No. 14 on the Order Paper, the Tuam sugar factory question, which is a burning issue in the west of Ireland because of the Ballyforan situation in recent days.  The Leader of the House should be flexible enough to take this motion because it is a matter of extreme urgency.  It is a matter of extreme importance affecting the lives and livelihood of many people in the west of Ireland.  I would appreciate it if the Leader of the House would arrange to have it debated any day this week.</P>

      <P>In regard to the question of taking Motion No. 14 or Motion No. 18, I did receive strong representations last week on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party that Motion No. 18 should be taken this week.  It may be possible to take that motion on Thursday in spite of the very heavy amount of business we have, or possibly to take it next week but it is up to the Fianna Fáil Party themselves to decide what their urgency is, what is their choice of priority, motion No. 14 or No. 18.  But in regard to accommodating either motion, I think, the best that could be done would be to have a debate on Thursday.  That certainly could be discussed between the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Second Stage be ordered for Wednesday, 6 July 1983.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been circulated.  It is a Bill on which there was agreement that it should pass in this session of the Oireachtas. It was thought that with the pressure of business in the other House it was more appropriate that this Bill be brought into the Seanad so that it could have a substantial debate here before being passed to the Dáil.  This, I think all Senators would agree, would be preferable to having it passed under constraints of time in the Dáil, and then passed to <Col N="473" /> the Seanad after the Dáil has adjourned. I would propose, therefore, that we should order the Second Stage for tomorrow and take it as the first item of business tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>This is obviously a very important measure and, indeed, as a member of the Labour Group I very much welcome the fact that it is coming before us.  It does seem to me that we are operating under truly intolerable constraints in addressing ourselves to legislation. The Dáil is due to rise on Friday of this week.  Is this Bill expected to pass through both Houses in all stages before Friday?  It does not seem that the importance of this measure would allow it to be properly considered by both Houses in that time.</P>
      <P>I would have thought, since the Bill is ready, that it would be preferable to arrange that the Houses sit longer in July rather than rise and put us all under what I think are unreal constraints.  I do not think we are doing the job properly if we are going to try to rush this important legislation through in three or four days flat.  I very much welcome it, and I am glad the Minister has been able to prepare it and bring it before us, as he undertook to do before the summer.  We are getting our priorities wrong in not giving enough time to consider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general acceptance of this Bill.  I am a little surprised that it has arrived at all in that the functions and powers and duties of the Minister are being handed over to a semi-State organisation.  The system is being changed.  From our knowledge of all semi-State organisations it is quite clear <Col N="474" /> that not one of them is profitable.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not a profitable organisation either, but they have been and could be.  The Minister might have another look at section 24 (2) to find a new device whereby demands would be made on the Minister for tax purposes only.  It is too much of a fall-back for the companies to allow them to know that if things do not go right the Minister will have to find the money for them.  The State will have to give them the money</P>
      <P>I will give an instance of a similar matter. When the former President, the late Mr. Childers, was Minister for Transport and Power he brought in an enabling Bill granting £4 million to CIE.  At that time that was to be the end of all the problems of CIE.  We know what happened, and we know what is happening today.  I am afraid we are giving those boards too much of a fall-back on the Government of the day for financial purposes only. Apart from that you will be told: &ldquo;It is none of your business&rdquo;.  It is your business if they have no money, but everything else is not your business.  We are giving them too much of a fall-back and they should be made to face the music themselves.  The end product should be their product.  In fairness to the Minister, his idea is right but I do not think it is implemented in this Bill.  We do not want those boards to say: &ldquo;Finances are slack this year.  It is all right.  We can go to the Government.  They will not close the place down&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear if I have understood Senator Killilea in criticising the models chosen in this Bill for the establishment of the two companies. If that is what he is criticising, I agree with him.  The company model is not the best format, and I mentioned this on Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also have doubts about the splitting off of postal and telecommunications services.  The Bill requires that a national and comprehensive service which would have a strong social dimension to it be provided by the two companies.  Therefore, it would be wrong to simplify the position and say they are purely commercial <Col N="475" /> companies providing a purely commercial service.  I regret that the original Bill adopted the company model because, once that was adopted &mdash; even though a lot of time has passed since the Bill was published, and even though the Minister has in fact accepted a number of important amendments and introduced them on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil and is prepared to introduce amendments in this House &mdash; it has not been possible, regrettably, to change the basis for the establishement of these two bodies.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred, if we are hiving it off from the civil service, that it would be one statutory corporation and that the Bill itself would have spelt out in very specific detail the functions, duties and responsibilities of that statutory corporation. I accept that it is too late in the day now to do other than express criticism as I do of the company model which has been adopted.  Here I disagree with Senator Killilea.  The company model is a very insecure one from which to provide a major national service either in the area of postal services or telecommunications services.  I would be very worried that there might be privatisation or that there would be values which would be appropriate to a commercial company but would not be appropriate to providing a national service.  As legislators we must be concerned about the medium and long term nature of services in this area which we are going to have.  If it were possible, realistically, to table amendments on this company structure I would certainly have been prepared to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The point raised by Senator Killilea is a fairly fundamental one.  For too long we have tolerated a situation where we almost expect semi-State bodies to lose money.  Senator Killilea is incorrect in saying that all semi-State bodies lose money.  They do not all lose money, but most of them do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Aer Rianta make <Col N="476" /> money and up to last year Irish Shipping Ltd. consistently made money and hopefully they will return to that situation. The onus is on us, if we are setting up semi-State bodies, as we are in this case to create the right environment so that they can be a commercial success.  Even though, as Senator Robinson said, quite a bit of what An Post and An Bord Telecom will do will be of a social nature, the overwhelming mass of what they will do will be of a commercial nature.  It is fully expected of them in this Bill to make profits and from those profits to subsidise the social element of the service.  Profits have been made.  Last year profits were made by the services as a Department of State.  There is no reason why the services should not make profits.  I fully expect both of them will make profits, only if we give them the right environment and we do not impose on them too many unneccessary obligations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>In the latter half of 1979 and in 1980 I had a small role to play in that Department.  The idea was to leave them within the Department and not push the boards.  For example we had the management structure set up with the district managers.  We were about to do something about the collection of revenue. In different districts the building programme had commenced.  A good deal happened in those two years.  I was listening to the out of order gimmicks about telephones on the radio this moming. That has gone on for years.  But nobody praised the installation figures of 60,000 and 80,000 and how well the Department worked.  We had the problem of the choking up of the higher parts in the Department.  Perhaps we were overstaffed in the Department in O'Connell Street.  Perhaps the whole system which was in operation from days gone by was carried on, not through any fault of theirs &mdash; the system that had developed over the years that authority started and ended in O'Connell Street.  I am not saying there was anything wrong with it, but it could have been rearranged in a better way, even without this semi-State organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak personally, of course, and from <Col N="477" /> experience.  It was one of the best experiences I ever had in my life.  If the Department had been given an initiative and if that initiative had continued we would hardly have needed this semi-State organisation which can come running back seeking more cash.  That is really all the power that is left to the Minister &mdash; the same power as he has in CIE, and in Aer Lingus, the power of money.  That is the power the Minister has.  We are handing away our powers day by day.  We appoint the boards and that is the last we see of them.  That is history now, the history of every Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to wander too much from this point.  I was not here for Second Stage last week, but this is a point I would have made strongly.  Perhaps it is not so easy to make it on this Stage.  The Minister might have been braver if he had had another look at the two alternatives. There were two alternatives.  The 1978 review was not the absolute answer for 1983.  It is late now but I make that point. I do not agree with all Senator Robinson said.  I do not understand all the legal terms because I am not a legal man, but I understand the complexity of the Department.  Will the hive-off be as fruitful and as successful as we first thought? I hope it will be, but I am afraid that it may not be.  I will be sorry for the Minister or any Minister if it is not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the doubts expressed by Senator Killilea have entered the minds of many people from time to time.  Of course we cannot be certain that the course on which we are embarking will be successful.  I am reasonably confident that it will be.  Six months ago I inherited plans which were in progress.  Perhaps if I was starting afresh I might have done some things differently, but if I started again I would have delayed the whole re-organisation for a long time to come, and would have continued the uncertainty which has existed since the Dargan review of 1979. Uncertainty is one of the real problems we have at the moment, and the sooner the uncertainty is ended the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Killilea made a point about <Col N="478" /> criticisms in the newspapers and on the radio and television of the telecommunications service.  I agree to a great extent with what Senator Killilea said.  Much of it is not justified.  There is far too much of it.  Some of it, of course, is justified, but we have to make allowances for the public, especially the public who are suffering frustration waiting for telephones or for telephone repairs.  We have to make allowances for the criticisms but equally we have to say that a great deal of progress has been made, as Senator Killilea says.</P>
    <P>One thing on which I did not agree with Senator Killilea was the implied criticism of senior civil servants in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Quite frankly, I think that is a bit of a cop-out.  Politicians have to accept responsibility.  It is true to say that one of the reasons for the relatively underdeveloped nature of our telecommunications service is that up to 1977 very little thought had been given to telecommunications. There was a great deal of thought about infrastructural development, industrial development, and so on, but telephones were not included in that. It only dawned on Ministers towards the latter half of the seventies that this was a problem.  There has been a great deal of criticism of Ministers who held office since that time, but very little credit has been given to them.  What Senator Killilea has said is correct.  A good deal of progress has been made.  A very high number of connections are being made and, in fairness, while criticism can be levelled at previous Ministers, credit should also be given to them.  This gives me an opportunity to say that some of my predecessors, Deputy Faulkner, Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Cooney, Deputy Witson, and their Ministers of State, who included Senator Killilea, deserve a great deal more credit than they get and a great deal less criticism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not implying any criticism of the senior civil servants, and I want to make that clear.  The system in operation since the foundation of the State suddenly took a huge leap forward in the seventies.  Demands for services <Col N="479" /> really got out of hand to such an extent in 1979 that as fast as telephones were installed twice as many people were applying for more.  I am implying a criticism of the system that operated, and very little was done about it.  I will give an example and it still applies.  If you have an extravagant telephone hill and you want to query it, or if there is an error in it we are all aware of the ferocious task it is to try to get it corrected. That is not the fault of the senior civil servants.  It is the fault of the system in operation.  If you are down in Belclare where I live and you want to question your telephone account, you have to make contact with Dublin city.  You have to go down to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in O'Connell Street. How do they know whether your phone was working correctly without going back and checking it out in Galway?</P>
      <P>I am not implying criticism of the senior civil servants, I am criticising the system. We had done something about that. We had appointed district managers and we hoped that the whole system would be built round them.  If that had continued to be done from 1981 on, I say openly and categorically in this House, there would be no need for this Bill. Despite what the Minister said, it was as important in 1979 and 1980 to bring in such a Bill as it is today.  The pressures were exactly the same.  There were conferences day in, day out, with the unions. We had problems discussing this matter with the unions just as we have today. My Minister, Deputy Reynolds, had done an enormous amount of work.  The Bill is before the House and we must deal with it.  The Minister said I implied criticism of senior civil servants.  I did not.  I criticised the archaic system.  Much needed to be done to make it viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>One final point on this definitions section which refers to the fact that there will be two companies dealing with the two different services.  One problem which might well arise from having two separate and distinct companies which legally have no relationship with each other could be a problem of duplication. <Col N="480" /> A number of the services provided at the moment are provided in the same building, at the same counter, by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I would be interested in the Minister's view on how unnecessary duplication could be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point Senator Robinson has mentioned is worth considering. It is one that I have reflected upon. When the Dargan committee were looking at this whole problem they looked at models of what happened elsewhere. Having considered all those points they felt that the better thing to do was to have two separate enterprises.  I feel on balance that that decision was correct notwithstanding some of the possible drawbacks that may be inherent in it.</P>
      <P>Senator Killilea suggested we should keep this within the civil service.  The main recommendation of the Dargan Review Group was to take these two businesses out of a civil service environment, which is no longer appropriate to such a big business, and put them into a commercial environment and that is the main purpose of the Bill.  If we were not to accept that, we would have no cause to be pressing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be able to give us any idea of the change of profitability that can take place?  He has told us that in the last year there was a profit made by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Could he quantify the profits that can be made by dividing the board?  What will be a quantifiable benefit to the consumer by setting up two separate boards if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are making a profit at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dargan Review Group looked at this and felt that in a semi-State commercial environment there would be greater flexibility and greater commercial input, and the bodies would be able to recruit commercial people rather than be confined purely to civil servants.  Again this is based on experience elsewhere where, generally <Col N="481" /> speaking, these services have been very successful out of the civil service and have made considerable profits.  We are basing all our judgments on the hope that the success elsewhere would be replicated here.  I am very hopeful and optimistic that it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate the other countries which were successful in changing from State to semi-State status and the change in the profitability, or lack of profitability, by changing from a State to a semi-State entity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This has happened in a number of countries, most notably and most recently in the United Kingdom.  It has also happened in Australia and there has been restructuring in the United States of America.  There are a number of other examples &mdash; I do not have them to hand &mdash; and I hope we will replicate the success in those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister quantify in any way the benefits that can accrue by changing?  There have to be quantifiable benefits, and the Department and the Minister's advisers must have gone into this situation before agreeing to changing from State to semi-State status.  Can the Minister give us any indication of quantifiable benefits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Senator's attention to the Dargan Review Group which covered all these points.  Because of the great flexibility of a commercial environment the main benefit expected is that we will end up with a better, more expanded and more profitable service. That is the whole purpose of the reorganisation. Not only are the interests of the consumer well protected but also the interests of the work force and the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>If I borrow money I like to find out exactly how much per month I am going to pay back.  If I go into a business enterprise I like to know what the, return on my investment will be.  The Minister keeps mentioning the Dargan <Col N="482" /> Report.  Let us be straight about this: the Dargan Report has no relevance to my question: what profits can the Minister see accruing from this board that are not now accruing to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 13 deals with the financial targets, and we could deal with the subject there.  It does not come up under the definitions section, but I would be reluctant, even on section 13, to start quantifying the matter of profits. I could set unrealistic targets, especially in the present state of the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should be aware that these two companies will be subject to the Companies Act.  In relation to giving freedom, this gets back to the point I made earlier.  For too long we have been hamstringing some of our semi-State companies and dooming them to failure.  We must not do that on this occasion.  We must create the right environment <Col N="483" /> and give them sufficient freedom to make a go of it.  We cannot have Ministers running semi-State companies, as the Senator knows from experience, because we have not got the time or the expertise to do it.  That is what we are appointing boards to do.</P>

      <P>I disagree completely with the Minister on that.  I do not see where the big strains are on all those semi-State organisations.  I have not seen any interference, if there ever is.  Can a Minister go down to CIE and make an ordinary day-to-day working decision?  I do not think he can.</P>

      <P>I do not think he can do that in the Sugar Company or in Aer Lingus.  The only authority the Minister and the Government of the day have is to save these semi-State organisations when they are in financial trouble.  Apart from that, the functions of any Minister in any of those Departments are practically nil.  It is wrong for this Minister, or for any Minister, be he in this Government or any other Government, to say that for far too long we have been hamstringing those semi-State organisations.  That is copping out.  I cannot see any semi-State organisation that I know of, and particularly the ones most seriously in debt, allowing a Minister to intervene.  If they are asked to change a judgment they will quickly and sharply say that that was a commercial decision made by the board and it was none of the Minister's business. I do not think it is true to say that we have a grip on those semi-State organisations. What is wrong is that we have let go the grip on those semi-State organisations and they can do as they damn well like.  The good companies are all in debt now and it is their own fault.  I would not take the blame for that politically.</P>

      <P>This is a standard provision. This section deals with expenses arising from the Minister's function in the administration of the legislation.  This section is included in all Bills involving <Col N="485" /> expenditure by a Government Minister of his Department.  It provides for the recoupment of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of the cost of the administration of the Bill when enacted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just because something is standard does not mean it is right.  We are talking about transferring the running of two particular entities from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to two semi-State commercial bodies. Surely every expense incurred in the running of those two enterprises should be borne by the companies themselves?  This is one of the problems we hear when we talk about the day-to-day running of State and semi-State companies, and these companies making a profit.  It is said that because they do not have to repay loans to the Government, or that they do not have to pay the type of expenses mentioned by the Minister, they are not commercial.  If we are setting up commercial bodies, every expense incurred should be borne by these companies.</P>

      <P>After this reorganisation there will be a residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs which will be responsible for general policy in the area of posts, telecommunications, broadcasting and so on &mdash; as is the case with the Department of Transport which is responsible for general policy.  The expenses of the Minister and his office are borne by the Exchequer and this happens in every case.  Later in this Bill we will come to sections dealing with financial targets and targets for the remuneration of investment by the State will be set.  We expect that these companies will be net contributors to the Exchequer before very long.  It is normal practice in even Act that administrative expenses fall on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>If I understood the Minister. we are now going to have a residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs which will look after the affairs of these two companies from the Government's point of view.  It appears that we are <Col N="486" /> running into the type of situation we have in the Department of Defence where we have the professional Defence Forces on one side and the Department of Defence on the other side.  We are talking about two semi-State bodies and now the Minister has brought a third dimension into it &mdash; the residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs, an over-seeing body to run these two commercial companies.  I have no doubt that if we are going to leave a residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs behind we will incur costs, because the administration in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will milk the semi-State bodies being set up under this Bill.  This makes a sham of the idea that we are setting up semi-State companies which are going to make a profit. If there is any sense in this at all, we should leave the administration of these two semi-State bodies where it belongs. There is no need for a residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If there is any expense incurred, or if there is any need to refer to any Department, it should be the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>I could not agree with Senator Lanigan.  There is a need for residual power.  For example one of the sections we have already passed, section 4, deals with the question of penalties for breaches of various pre-existing legislation. Somebody will have to decide on an on-going basis the revision of these penalties and it should not be the job of the Post Office or of An Bord Telecom.  That is not the line of country they are in.  That is a matter of public policy and it can only be done by a Department which will have the type of residual power the Minister is speaking of.  There are many over-riding functions of this nature for which administration will be necessary.</P>

Somebody is going to have to decide to change it.  Somebody is going <Col N="487" /> to have to introduce the legislation.  You cannot have a semi-State body introducing legislation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's explanation of why he needs section 6 is satisfactory. There will inevitably be residual powers and discretions remaining which will need to be exercised, and not by officials or boards of the semi-State bodies, and they will need to be looked at in a general policy way.  There will also be the consideration of the working of the Act itself, and whether any amendments would be necessary to help and further advance the bodies being set up under this legislation.  In those circumstances section 6 is a proper safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it vital to have a dimension that will have some Government responsibility in future, and ensure the continuation of the service we all now enjoy through such a large Department as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I do not want to vest totally in any new board the power to withdraw what I consider a social service just because they felt it was uneconomic.  Certainly, we must maintain structures that will dictate a policy outlined by Government <Col N="488" /> and by all the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We must have a forum in which we can express reservations if these two semi-State bodies decide for commercial reasons that they are unable to deliver letters to Paddy Joe on top of a mountain, who has always enjoyed the service of a postal delivery. The Minister has been kind enough in his amendments to write in as far as possible all the various definitions of service we consider people require.  A structure in which we would have an input at some future date is important because this Department will have to provide a social service and we want to have a voice to ensure that that is carried out.  If some expenses are necessarily incurred I think it is a necessary safeguard for the public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to hear from the Minister on the points I have raised.  Taking Senator Lanigan's point of view, the theme right through the Bill &mdash; the most important sections deal with finance &mdash; is always &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice could deal with the sections dealing with fines; the Minister for Transport could deal with other sections and the Minister for Finance could deal with the most important sections because at the end of the day he is the person who will be approached either by the board or by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I am <Col N="490" /> looking forward to a comment from the Minister on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This House is much more enjoyable than the other House.  In relation to the residual Department, there are now 30,000 employees in my Department, of whom about 100 will remain in the residual Department. Many functions will be retained.  There are many sections in the Bill under which the orders will have to be laid before the House, regulations made etc.  There is also the question of international postal and telecommunications agreements, etc.  Some Minister has to be responsible to both Houses for general policy and for reviewing the performance of those companies. It is normal practice that ministerial expenses fall on the Exchequer and are paid out of general taxation.  Hopefully, in this case there will be revenue coming from both companies to help to alleviate the taxpayers' burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter in the first place, but I will not be as hard on Senator O'Leary as he was on my colleague. If I ask a question of the Senator he should not jump down my throat and suggest that every time that he opens his mouth I jump down it.  Maybe his sensibilities are a little more acute than mine. However, I never objected to him asking me a question when I was speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs will have about 100 employees.  We are setting up commercial enterprises, and we are leaving a residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I suggest that the Department of the Public Service would be the best Department to operate the residual end of the Department, and the Department of Finance would deal with the actual finance arrangements.  We have to relate the Companies Act when we talk of penalties.  Surely the Companies Act should encompass every penalty for every offence under every enactment of this House.  I cannot see why we have to waste taxpayers' money with each Department dealing with different types of fines for the basic misuse of company organisation.  If we are going to have this <Col N="491" /> residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs, not alone will there be 100 employees but that number will grow, as has happened with the Department of Defence.  The Department of Defence are only an administrative body who pay wages and deal with administration and have nothing to do with the running of the Army.  The Department of the Public Service should take under their wing that particular type of organisation, the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism should take in the offences against breaches of company law and the Department of Finance should take upon themselves some of the duties to be left with this residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I am disappointed to hear that anything being said on this side on this Bill is a waste of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The theme of the debate had to be set today.  It might be hurtful to some people to have to listen to it, but <Col N="492" /> if they do not want to listen they can leave.  No one is compelling them to stay here.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious matter.  This Bill deals with the most serious division of responsibility that can be given from the State to private enterprise.  In the area of communications, what happens today might not be relevant tomorrow.  It is a fast moving world and we have to keep abreast of developments, nationally and internationally.  I questioned the Minister because of my inability to be here last week.  I wanted his opinion and I got it. I can see that he is not over-enamoured of the idea of the Bill and I am sorry he did not give it a little bit more time and thought.</P>
      <P>The claim is being made that this Government are going to stay in power for four years.  That is a long time.  Two more years would not have been too long and things could have developed.  I do not accept the excuse that this Bill was foisted on him and that he inherited it. This Government always claim responsibility for the good things but the bad things they inherit.  We have another Bill coming into this House later, an inheritance the Government did not accept, but this Bill they do accept.  The only thing I question is the necessity for it.</P>
      <P>The first line of section 9 is the most important and it reflects what Senator Lanigan was talking about a few minutes ago.  It is again the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  You can see who is holding on to the reins all the time.  I have had the devastating experience when coming up with a fresh idea in the Department, nourishing it to see if it was fruitful and arriving inevitably at the Department of Finance.  I remember the episodes in our famous efforts to try to introduce the Giro system into the Post Office.  When you arrived at the Department of Finance you would be stalemated and cross-questioned.</P>

      <P>In those days things were not casual in the Department of Finance any more than they are now.  I do not think they ever will be because they are <Col N="493" /> the hierarchy of the nation.  You genuflect gently if you want to achieve something from the Department of Finance &mdash; that is if you are working in another Ministry.  We know what it is like to be an ordinary TD or Senator if you are asking anything of the Department of Finance.  You just genuflect gently and hope it will happen or that someone might err.</P>
      <P>I would be worried that these boards will not be able to do at the end of the day exactly what they want to do.  Giro is one instance.  If the postal board do not move with the times, they will disintegrate into a very weak company.  The financial operations of the Post Office are the key to their success.  For example, the post office in any town holds the most prominent commercial position.  On reflection, that will he agreed.  The staff at the counter are of the highest integrity and are merely selling stamps.  It is not today or yesterday that the post office should have zoomed in on this financial business.  I hope that An Post will be able at this late stage to zoom in and grab some of that most important business.</P>
      <P>The small saver is the most important saver and has always been.  Any Government will explain that the best saver is the small saver.  They are the people who down through the years have used the facility of the Post Office, but modem times and changes have deflected them. A big effort must be made now by the postal board and I am afraid that restrictions will be placed on them by the Department of Finance, which would be a tragedy.  An employee of the post office who is paying out pensions on a Friday, may be asked by a couple who come in at 2.55 p.m. to give them the pension quickly because they want to go to the bank to lodge it.  It is tragedy that that has been allowed to happen.  The system in the post office never changed when it could have changed.  Giro was the answer but we shirked it at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that Giro is still the answer and new methods and new devices can be used to attract people to save in the Post Office.  Small savers placed their trust in it in years gone by.  I beseech the Minister, <Col N="494" /> on this Stage in the Bill, to insist that no restrictions on progress towards that end be placed upon An Post.  That is imperative.  It is fundamental to the whole process.  There are many agency types of work that the Post Office can do other than issue television licences, which was very appropriate work.  I would like the assurance of the Minister here today that the small savings money market is made available freely and without any restrictions to An Post.</P>
    <P>I asked a question on a previous occasion about the subsidiaries.  I cannot imagine how that is going to work or why it was brought into the Bill.  An Post is the answer and it should be so registered. If they are going to hive-off certain sections to subsidiary organisations of the board, I cannot see it being of any great value.  For example, the philatelic side can be very fruitful and financially rewarding and I would hate to see it given away to a subsidiary company.  I cannot see why in one section of the Bill we are saying that we give the right to form subsidiaries and in another section of the Bill we are registering it as a full company. We should set up the framework clearly and emphatically for one company.</P>
    <P>I do not know when the Minister intends the vesting to take place.  It is, of course, a very important part of the whole programme and I would like him to extend to me the courtesy of notice of his intentions on subsection (2) of section 9 before I make any further comment on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mithcell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has raised quite a number of points some not relevant to this section and we will be dealing with them later.  In relation to subsection (2) which says &ldquo;The Minister shall by order appoint a day to be the vesting day for each of the two companies as soon as practicable after the companies have been registered.&rdquo;  The sooner they are registered the better because there has been a great deal of uncertainty and because of successive changes of Government there has been an inordinate delay in enacting this legislation.  I certainly would be very disappointed if 1 January <Col N="495" /> 1984 passes without vesting date being declared.  We would like it to be sooner than that, if practicable.</P>

      <P>Unions never say, &ldquo;Great, you have given us more than we want.  Take some back&rdquo;.  They are not going to say that they are over-pleased. In fairness, everybody will accept that I have been more than generous in meeting the points raised by the unions in the past six months.  Of course, once the Bill is enacted we shall have a very major job managing the transitions from the Department of State to semi-State and that will not be without its problems.  The sooner the companies are vested the better for the workers in the two services, for the consumer and the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I would not want to pretend that there are not items to be sorted out but I do not see any insuperable obstacles.  I believe that we will be able to negotiate the transition and manage it well.  It is as much in the interests of the unions and their members as of everybody else that this is a success; and the sooner the better, as far as I am concerned.  The unions appreciate that the uncertainty of the last few years has been very damaging for themselves and very worrying for their members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really.  It is very important that before the vesting takes place the course be very clear, although there will be other obstacles.  We should not let it pass without asking for the comments of the Minister at this stage.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 10.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 deals with authorised share capital and the value of the property to be transferred.  In his opening speech the Minister mentioned £1,500 million as the value of the property to be transferred on vesting day, that this amount of £275 million was debt free, that there was £705 million of Exchequer loans, that £355 million was going to be issued by the Minister under the Act and close to £80 million to finance leasing arrangements with Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited.  He then mentioned, under sections 29 and 31, capital works and current works.  Section 29 mentions £50 million to be made available for the financing of capital works and grants for current expenditure for An Post.  It goes on to say that the postal company will get £10 million and the telecommunications company will get £150 million for working capital.  There is, however, no mention of provision of money for capital works for Bord Telecom Éireann.  Does it arise under some other section, or why is there no mention in this section of capital amounts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that Bord Telecom Éireann will be in a position to finance their own capital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision for money in the Bill under this heading. It will be up to Bord Telecom Éireann themselves to fund capital works within the service.  The nature of the business is such that it should be able to finance <Col N="497" /> itself.  It is a different situation in An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if the Minister does not make prior arrangements for the provision of sums for capital purposes he is flying in the face of current economic thinking.  Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited are there and this is possibly the company which should provide these funds.  There is no guarantee and there is nothing at all written into this Bill on the provision of capital sums for Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator will know, Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited were set up as a subsidiary a couple of years ago and progressively more and more of the capital needs of Bord Telecom Éireann have been raised by ITI, so the Exchequer contribution this year is very small indeed.  Next year, after vesting date, there will be no Exchequer contribution and all the funds will be raised by ITI, assuming Bord Telecom Éireann want ITI to continue, or if not, by Bord Telecom Éireann direct.  That has been the way it has been and that is the way it will continue to be. There is plenty of money around for this purpose because it is seen as a very good investment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points that I would like to raise.  One is the question of the exclusion of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; or &ldquo;teoranta&rdquo; from the title of both companies.  I understand for historical reasons, that to add the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; in the case of the Post Office might not be aesthetically very pleasing because of the long history of the Post Office.  I have no real objection to that in Irish or English.  It would be preferable if it were there, but for that special reason.  That special reason does not apply at all to the Irish Telecommunications Board.  What it really shows is the lack of determination with which we are establishing semi-State structures.  On the one hand <Col N="498" /> we establish limited liability companies, and on the other hand we do not insist on the use of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.  This helps to create the mystique that in some way they are guaranteed by the State and have unlimited power to commit the State.  For that reason it should have been made perfectly clear &mdash; and I would like to place this on record &mdash; that they are a limited liability company.  They do not have unfettered power to borrow or to speculate but must live within the normal commercial rules like everybody else.</P>
      <P>The other point relates to subsection (3) (a).  This paragraph deals with what the authorised share capital of the Post Office shall be, the value of the property transferred under sections 40 and 41, the value of the money made available under section 29 to finance capital works and the value of working capital to be made available under section 31.  Those three together, increased if necessary by around £½ million or £1 million as the case may be, shall comprise the total authorised share capital of the Post Office.  If you contrast that with section 19 of the Bill you will see that there is also an instruction under section 19 that the Post Office shall issue to the Minister for Finance one share of £1 in a share capital company.  That is not covered elsewhere. Also, section 31 from my reading of it authorises the issue of additional shares to the Minister for Finance.  It appears that under subsection 3 (a) and similarly under (b) as it relates to Bord Telecom Éireann.  There should be a provision which would make it quite clear that the share to be issued under section 19 and the corresponding share to, be issued in respect of Bord Telecom Éireann form part of the authorised share capital of the respective boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I also have a question on share capital, so perhaps the Minister could answer that as well.  I would like the Minister to explain the inclusion in section 10, of (d): &ldquo;Each company may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, divide the shares in its share capital into several classes and attach thereto respectively any preferential, deferred, qualified or special <Col N="499" /> rights, privileges or conditions.&rdquo;  Given the nature of the share capital and share-holding, would the Minister clarify whether, in fact, it will be open to either of these companies, particularly the telecommunications company, to offer shares in the company to private subscribers or whether those shares will be confined and held only by the subscribers to the memorandum of association, the Minister himself and the Minister for Finance.  Is it going to be possible for a private party to acquire shares in these companies?  If not, what is the purpose of authorising the companies to classify the shares in that way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point made by Senator Robinson about whether it is possible to give or sell shares to anybody else, the answer is emphatically &ldquo;No&rdquo;. There will be two shareholders in this company &mdash; the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will own all but one share and the Minister for Finance will own one share.  That is the position.  Subsection (3) (d) of this section states that each company may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, divide the shares.  Later on we will be dealing with the setting of financial targets. That is to allow for the creation of preference shares and shares which would have to be remunerated first and so on, if the need ever arose.  We have to make allowances for that.  That would be dealt with in the articles of association. Senator O'Leary pointed out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>When would the need arise for that, except by issuing shares to private parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In the amendment we inserted in the Dáil it is prohibited that any shares can be disposed of, as the Senator knows.  There were some questions during the discussions leading up to the reintroduction of this Bill as to whether certain portions of shares should be, for instance, cumulative preference shares, in other words, shares that would have to be remunerated at a certain time in a certain way.  It was argued that part of the money that is being capitalised <Col N="500" /> should be cumulative preference shares, to be remunerated first, but it was decided not to proceed on that basis at this stage.  But there is the option in the future to decide whether or not there should be preference shares of any sort. It is part of the powers of the Exchequer in seeking its remuneration.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary has questioned the reason for omitting the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo;. This was at the request of both companies. It was felt that from a marketing point of view it would help.  There are precedents for it.  For instance, the Housing Finance Agency and Youth Employment Agency are limited companies.  I do not think that there is any major significance in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency is a limited company and also the Youth Employment Agency, but they do not have appended to their names the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.  We are just following that example here.  As you will see in the preceding section 9 (1) we have already agreed:</P>
      <P>The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, shall cause two limited companies conforming to the conditions laid down in this Act, to be formed and registered under the Companies Act.</P>
      <P>So they are limited companies.  It is just that they are being exempted from the use of the word &ldquo;limited&rdquo; at the end of their title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a point about the question of this one share that should issue to the Minister for Finance.  Under what heading of subsection (3) (a) does that come in as being part of the authorised share capital of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman when consulted on this point felt that it was not necessary to have it inserted here.  It is inserted later on in the Bill, as the Senator will see.</P>

    <Col N="501" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman should be asked again.  It is not going to be a major issue but, at the same time, one part of the Bill says that authorised share capital of the company shall consist of shares issued under very specific sections &mdash; sections 40, 41, 29 and 31, yet under section 19 another share is being issued.  Is that part of the authorised share capital or not?  That is a crazy situation.  Just because it is a share which is going only to the Minister for Finance, there is no point in not getting the thing done properly, if it is to be done at all.  It appears that the parliamentary draftsman should be asked again.  I have no ideological hang-ups on whether it is included or not, but I do not want the Bill to be found unsatisfactory in any way as a result of failure to include something which can be included without any controversy at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just one point.  I agree that the addendum of &ldquo;limited&rdquo; should be placed after both of these companies in every section of the Bill.  We find that the only two shareholders are the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Section 4 (4) states that the Minister is equally responsible if an offence is committed under the subsection (1), (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) and under sections 37, 60, 84, 87, 98 or 99.  It appears that the only people left out of the offences sections are the two Ministers who are the only shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I understand the Senator's point.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will own all but one share and the Minister for Finance will own the other.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only a technicality. There are two other people holding shares in trust.  They are civil servants and responsible to the Minister.  The whole Bill provides the legal framework within which the companies will operate. The companies will have an entity as <Col N="502" /> distinct from the shareholders.  They will be responsible for the actions of the company. I do not quite get the point the Senator made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under normal company law or company procedure, the shareholders are equally as responsible as the manager or the secretary of the company. Here we have a situation where the only people who are not going to bear responsibility for any misdemeanours are the two Ministers who are the only shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that the responsibility of the shareholders is covered by the Companies Act.  That is the relevant Act.  It is not at all necessary to go into that detail in this Bill because the normal Companies Act covers responsibilities of shareholders in every company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have another look at the point that I raised?  I understand from Senator Robinson that section 19 (1), of which I was not aware, was introduced at a relatively late stage in the Bill.  I also have the Bill as initiated in the other House and it is correct that it is not in the Bill as initiated.  It does not make any difference to me, but the Minister should check with the draftsman again to see whether or not it is necessary to include something under section 10, (2) or (3) (a) and (b) on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will check the point again, although we have already discussed this with the draftsman, as I said, who did not think it necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>One final point on the shareholding.  In response to Senator Lanigan earlier, the Minister made it clear that it was not intended to provide any capital initially to Bord Telecom <Col N="503" /> because they would be able to raise capital. They are on the profitable side of the services to be offered.  If they are prohibited from issuing shares to anyone and if the shares held are held by the Minister and he cannot alienate them, how are Bord Telecom to raise the necessary capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be borrowing. We will be dealing with this in greater detail in other sections.  As Senator Lanigan said, some of the debts undertaken by the Exchequer will be given to An Bord Telecom as shares.  They will have something in the order of £435 million of shares.  It is envisaged that their debt equity ratio will be maintained on a 1 to 1 point something basis.  There will be scope for borrowing something in the order of £500 million to £600 million at peak against their assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that those points are finalised, I want to ask a question on subsection (3) (a) which states that the authorised share capital of An Post shall be an amount not exceeding the total of the value of the property to be transferred. Could the Minister say when this valuation was carried out and is he satisfied that it is absolutely up to date?  Is it appropriate either today, when the Bill is passing through this House, or at 1 January when the transfer is about to take place?  Will the value be given at the date of transfer?  Is the Minister satisfied that the valuation of the property is correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the postal service we have been used to, on a door-to-door basis for both letters and parcels, I wish to compliment the Post Office on the way they have served the people down through the years.  Of course no service is ever 100 per cent: there is always room for improvement but as a former postal deliverer I understand the difficult conditions under which postmen had to work.  It was only in the last ten years or so that they were provided with transport in the form of vans. Until then they had to use bicycles which were often in bad condition, as were also the roads they had to travel.</P>
      <P>When the Minister hands this operation over to the semi-State board, there may be changes in the delivery of the post.  As he has stated, in countries such as Australia where a similar change has been made, it is customary for people whose homes are out in the wilds to collect their post at a pick-up point.  I am totally against that and so are my party. Before he hands over this responsibility I should like the Minister to give an assurance that this will not happen here and that, as Senator Ferris said, the board are not just being set up from the point of view of making money.  There are other social aspects to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will see that in paragraph (a) the requirement is to provide a national postal service within the State and between the State and places outside the State and in (b), to meet the industrial, commercial, social and household needs of the State for comprehensive and efficient postal services in so far as the company consider it reasonably practicable to satisfy all reasonable demands for such services throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on in the Bill we make the provision <Col N="505" /> that the Senator seeks, by using the words, &ldquo;unless alternative acceptable services are provided&rdquo;.  So I think we have covered the point made by Senator Cassidy.  We have added here in this section the word &ldquo;household&rdquo; and later on the word &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; to cover those points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, again we have not been daring enough.  The statement, &ldquo;to provide a national postal service within the State and between the State and places outside the State&rdquo; is very broad and general.  The next paragraph ends with the words, &ldquo;so far as the company consider it reasonably practicable to satisfy all reasonable demands for such services throughout the State&rdquo;.  I cannot understand why the Minister would allow the draftsman to put in the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; there.  We must look at the postal services in its reality.  Every morning or at some time during the day a person from the Post Office will call to every household for which he has mail. The network is so wide and so broad that if a postman has not some mail for the first house, he is almost certain to have it for the second.  The route takes him each day to tap on the door, if needs be, of every household in his area.</P>
      <P>Going back to previous remarks, what has happened is that we loaded the postman going out in the morning but we never thought, as a nation, that we should have offered facilities for him to bring home something in the evening also.  That half of the journey was always forgotten. There were many services that could have been rendered.  The scope of the Post Office could have been widened so as to deal, for instance, with advertising at a cheap rate.  No organisation in this country or in the world has such a contact nationally and internationally as has the Post Office.  It is wrong for us to place demands on the Post Office by way of the use of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Post Office is capable of rendering a wide range of services at reasonable costs to the nation or to individuals or companies.  Unfortunately, that facility is not utilised.  Instead we see private individuals <Col N="506" /> huckstering around the country with different brand names on their vans delivering mail when the Post Office if utilised correctly could do all that so simply, so gently, and so easily.</P>
    <P>It is imperative at this stage, particularly on section 12, that we reflect a little so that we get the matter correct.  There is no denying the fact that the Post Office parcel service collapsed totally.  This all generated down in Sheriff Street.  Hassle between workers and management in regard to modernisation has gone on for so long now that the Post Office has lost out on that particular trade but that does not mean it is gone forever.  Now is the time to re-instil some optimism, to regain all that lost work, not to mention the new work that can be generated.  We talk of satisfying all reasonable demands.  The Post Office could satisfy so gently the most unreasonable demands that could be made on anybody.  The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; does not mean very much.  I make that point because we should have looked in this Bill for the absolute amount of optimism.  When one considers the system that is now there &mdash; from the time when a letter is dropped into the letter box until it is delivered to the addressee &mdash; one realises the whole nucleus that is involved on a 24-hour basis and the contact there is between the Minister and the whole country.</P>
    <P>Another point is that there are outlying areas in this country which the postman passes every morning and there are children who walk four and five miles to school from such areas.  I often wondered why we never thought of having a post van carrier system that would transport such children to and from school.  It would be no trouble to the postman to do this in addition to his duty to deliver mail. What is needed is just some imagination. I hope that the postal board will use their imagination in regard to the many facets with which they might become involved. If a company wanted to give a personal advertisement to every person in this nation, there is machinery available now which can print all that sort of thing and it could be delivered in one day by the Post Office to every individual.  That is <Col N="507" /> another facet that has not been thought of.</P>
    <P>We are talking about being reasonable but we canot be reasonable in regard to the Post Office any more.  In order to make it pay, to make it viable and to give it a new thrust we must be unreasonable in the demands we make on it.</P>
    <P>We should not in this House be asking the Minister or the Government to do what is reasonable because they can do that anyhow.  It is what is unreasonable, what we cannot imagine they can do which is so easy for them to do.  They must do what we would consider to be unreasonable if they are to be successful. Otherwise, each year the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be asking for an increase in moneys for the Post Office and we will all agree and utter pious platitudes about the board.  If the postal board do not go outside the realm of what we as lay people imagine to be possible, they will not succeed.</P>
    <P>In the Bill we must be flexible on that and we must have also absolute optimism because this is the one place in which optimism is imperative.  The Post Office is a wonderful arm of society but we have not half utilised it in the past.  I hope we will utilise it fully in the future.</P>
    <P>I come now to subsection (c) which is to provide services by which money may be remitted whether by means of money orders, postal orders or otherwise.  We should have left that out of the Bill completely. I regret sincerely that I was not here last week because that is something I would have asked this House to drop from the Bill.  We should not specify orders &mdash; postal orders or otherwise.  We should just leave it without that and let the boards have the authority to provide services by which money may be remitted as they think fit.  We should have been big enough and broad enough to omit it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that we are more or less defining the role for An Post. We should not be.  We should be giving them the authority to do the job and not be coming back here to us saying they want more money to do it.  We should <Col N="508" /> give them the wherewithal now to do the Job.  I submit that the words in brackets in (c) should be deleted so as to give an outward look to the whole idea.  The word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; can mean everything and anything and it can mean nothing.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about Giro.  The greatest tragedy ever to befall the Post Office was that it did not introduce the Giro system.  Perhaps it is not too late to do so now but if that system had been introduced long ago, the Post Office would be a tremendous organisation today.  I see no reason why the Post Office should not have for its small savers a saving scheme for house purchase, or a bank card scheme.  What is wrong with the Post Office?  Why should they not be able to keep such accounts?  There is a section in the Post Office already full with computers which would be quite capable of dealing with financial matters in the same way as can any of the bigger banks.  With their skills, the Post Office could probably do the job even better than most of the commercial banks can do it.</P>
      <P>That is why we should not limit the activities of An Post.  For example, there is no reason why we should not have a banking account system and cheque book from the Post Office.  All we lacked in the past was imagination.  What is wrong with a small saver having a Post Office cheque book account?  Is it not possible for the Post Office to have a cash-disposing system such as that operated by some of the banks whereby one can obtain a certain amount of cash by putting a card into a slot machine outside the building?  There is a real need for such a service throughout the country and the Post Office are capable of providing it.</P>
      <P>I took forward to an imaginative postal board.  We should open up the scope of the Post Office and use it as an alternative to the banking system which today dictates its term as it wishes.  I do not want to go into that part of it.  There is an alternative and we should get back to the small saver, to those who have used the Post Office all their lives and who have no reason now not to trust it except in the sense that it cannot offer them the facilities they need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also in the Bill the proposal <Col N="509" /> to provide consultancy advisory training and contract services inside and outside the State as the company think fit.  That speaks for itself and indicates that there was and that there is optimism somewhere at the back of the minds of those people who drafted this Bill.</P>
    <P>We talk about Third World problems. In this context the Post Office can give to any State training, any advice that is unparalleled by any other semi-State organisation in the country.  It is a field the new board should develop just as the ESB gave advice on services throughout the world.  I could never understand why the Post Office did not engage in this field before now.  I welcome the Minister's opinion on the withdrawal of that particular statement because it is closing rather than widening the whole operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>After that rather imaginative treatise from Senator Killilea I want to make a couple of points on the wording.  What he says is obviously very accurate but on the question of satisfying all reasonable demands there can always be a situation where someone can be unreasonable.  For instance, if a fellow decided to go off to some barren island in the Atlantic and insisted on having daily delivery of post he would be covered by the words &ldquo;a reasonable demand&rdquo; in that situation.  While it may be tautological, the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; covers anything and everything and opens up the whole situation again even though it is listed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator said about what the Post Office is capable of doing is all very true.  We all have had experience from childhood of letters being delivered in desperate conditions. I would not have any worries about the <Col N="510" /> new board not being able to develop to the very full the potential that is obviously there with the skills they have. Senator Killilea has ministerial experience and he knows what the background is but I am looking forward with confidence to the board pressing ahead with many of the ideas he has put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister agreed to have the word &ldquo;household&rdquo; included in this section.  This goes a long way towards the concern all of us had that this new board might consider that the needs of the household were not as important as what we would consider them to be in terms of the social aspect. The inclusion of this word is indicative of the Minister's contribution to the framing of this legislation after the draftsman had finished with it.  There is no doubt that the Bill has the stamp of the Minister on it, arising from various meetings he had with people, including the trade unions involved in the postal services, up to date. I am satisfied that the word &ldquo;household&rdquo; will meet that requirement together with the other amendment he referred to.</P>
      <P>In defining what we consider the principal objects of the postal company I have no objection to spelling out what the situation should be in regard to money orders and postal orders.  It is important when we are diverting from a State to a semi-State company that we spell out in legislation what we consider the role of the company to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I echo Senator Killilea's call for an expansion, a total revolution of what in fact a Post Office can do by way of service for the people in the area of finance, savings and savings banks.  After the doctor and the vet I would rank the postman as the next most important socially acceptable person in the country because of his having a daily contact with people who might not otherwise be contacted. He is a vital link between civilisation and isolated areas.  Therefore, the postman must be recognised by all of us as a very key person.  His service to this day can never be adequately recognised in any legislation.  It is only in a definition of what the service is that we can put on the <Col N="511" /> record of this House our appreciation of the service that postmen give and have given.  He is a link with people in isolated areas, people who are in receipt of social welfare or other payments.  If the service was linked to a banking system, it would be of tremendous benefit to people living in remote areas and who would be apprehensive about keeping money in the house.  There are calls from all sorts of people about the nationalisation of banks.  That is something the Government cannot afford but in the Post Office they have access to and practically own a banking system.  All we need to do is to spell out that role for the new board. There is nothing in the legislation which will prohibit the new board from delving into whole areas that we consider they should become involved in.</P>
    <P>One of the places we can look to for a shining example of the banking system in the area of the postal service is Japan where the postal banking system has been developed to an outstanding degree of success.  The Japanese postal savings system is one of the largest banks in the world.  Deposits in the system have been growing twice as rapidly as those in any of the commercial banks.  If that sort of system took off in this country one could imagine the importance of having money readily available in post offices which could come to the assistance of people in the area of local loans, loans for house building, loans for improvements, or loans to farming organisations.  One need only look at what has happened in the area of loans from banks to fanning enterprises which have run into difficulty and the fact that farmers have been forced to sell some of their stock and part of their land to meet commitments to the banks.</P>
    <P>The postal Giro system that was originally advocated but never really took off was the nucleus of what that could possibly be.  We have rural postmen traversing the country on bicycles or in vans on a daily basis.  They would give a much better service to small villages than a mobile bank which possibly only visits once a week.  I hold no brief for banking but the public would benefit to a great <Col N="512" /> extent if, like Japan, we had this saving service.  In that country it constitutes the most important part of Government funding for loans and investments and through the Trust Fund Bureau there are funds for housing, environmental improvement, medium and small term enterprises, agriculture, forestry and fisheries.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there is a great difference between the population of Ireland and that of Japan but the people of Ireland have great confidence in the postal service and postal institutions. There would be satisfaction at having money readily available on a daily basis and not just on a weekly basis.  People would not have to travel great distances to the nearest town where there was a branch of one of the banks.  It is appropriate that we should tell this new board to continue, as we have specified here, a service that we feel has industrial, commercial, social and household implications. The Japanese system could be looked at.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that under this section we should advise An Post that we look to them to revolutionise the transportation of cash.  At present the transfer of large amounts of money from one town and village is guarded by many gardaí, squad cars, the Army and so on on a regular basis.  It is so regular that I do not know why they bother to send escorts with them because everybody knows when they are arriving.  The people that knock the banks off are as aware of the time as anybody else because the escorts arrive on the dot every day at the same bank. The Post Office could give a much better and safer service to people who trust them with all sorts of other little chores. The Minister must be aware that postmen are an important and vital link between isolated people and civilisation.  In fact, like politicians, they are doing a whole lot of things that they are not paid to do.</P>

      <P>I was interested by the contributions of Senators.  I greatly share the optimism expressed and also the desire for expansion in new businesses which was first articulated by Senator Killilea and shared by Senators Browne and Ferris.  I see great possibilities for business in new areas especially in the financial area.</P>
      <P>To deal with the point on paragraph (c) to which Senator Killilea referred, he is probably reading it incorrectly.  We are not just talking about money order business or postal order business but about other business.  As the Senator will know, there are money orders in the post office and there are also postal orders but it goes on to state &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; for the specific purpose of indicating that we want them to cover new areas.  To take that out would weaken the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris mentioned the transfer of cash with safety.  I agree that this should be the theme and this brings me back to the phrase which the Minister has mentioned &mdash; whether by means of money order, postal order or otherwise.  &ldquo;Otherwise&rdquo; is the worst word that could be actually put into that paragraph. It frowns upon the meaning of what we want the Post Office to do.  I will give an example and I would appreciate a positive and clear reply on it from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the Post Office acts for savings for the Department of Finance. It is only on an agency basis.  Could the Minister give an assurance to the House now &mdash; I do not want to put him on the spot but I want to point to the reality &mdash; that the Minister for Finance would give permission to the Post Office tomorrow to operate its own savings bank?  It is a <Col N="514" /> very simple question but it personifies what I am talking about.  Will the Minister give a reply before I continue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only this Government but successive Governments have seen the scope for expansion into this area of business and have specifically provided for that expansion in this legislation. The impression I got in the Dáil and here is that there is a broad agreement on all sides of the House that this is the sort of country that An Post should get into provided they deem it commercially prudent.  I see great hope for it.  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister thinks lightly.  It is not that I do not know what I am talking about.  There is a reluctance down in that gestapo of Finance to get anything from them and the time will come when they will stifle An Post.  I can guarantee that to this House today. Rather than taking out the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; the Minister should put in &ldquo;also give certificates for the operation of a savings bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; or whatever. That would be positive thinking.  I know from experience that it is different. I say that with sincerity because I would rather not change the postal board at all. I would rather leave it in the Department the way it is at present than to make a bad board.  We are heading towards a restriction because, as I said at the very beginning of this debate today, every section of importance commences with the words &ldquo;as may be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris is correct &mdash; it is seldom I agree with the Labour Party &mdash; but he was probably stealing from what I had said.  There are many small savings banks around the country who are looking for a father figure.  They do not want to join the big consortiums.  The Post Office is <Col N="515" /> the father figure for those groups.  We have 84 pages of green sheets and not one of them says that this shall be.  Talking to one another here is one thing but it is different when people get together in a little room in the Department of Finance where the cold perspiration must run off everybody before anybody says anything.  That is the reality of the situation. Pious platitudes here are worthless. Lorry loads of sympathy to An Post are not worth a damn.  The Minister should make a statement now which will go into the annals of the House that if the board apply for a certificate for a savings bank the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will guarantee they will get it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with the savings bank in great detail, so perhaps the Senator is anticipating the debate.  I hope we will get to that section before the end of the day.</P>

      <P>I see under section 64 that the company shall not be required to deliver a postal package to the addressee's residence or office provided the company makes acceptable alternative arrangements to make it available to the addressee.  That cuts across what Senator Ferris and I are coming at in section 12. As far as we are concerned, my party and I want an assurance that there will be a house to house delivery of letters and parcels operated by the new semi-State organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given that assurance already and we added in the words &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; and &ldquo;household&rdquo; to meet the points made.  The section the Senator referred to states &ldquo;acceptable alternative&rdquo;.  In other words, if you have an apartment block instead of the postman having to go up the stairs to each apartment, there might be post boxes in the hallway.  That is the sort of alternative arrangement envisaged.  As Senators will be aware, there are, by agreement with the trade unions, pilot schemes going on experimenting with various methods of delivery.  That is what we have in mind in the section.</P>

      <P>Some earlier remarks seem to have been lost in all the furore about the savings bank.  There is the cheque book issue, for example.  That is an innovation.  What has the Minister to say about the omission of permission for Bank Giro to operate, for example?  The Post Office cash desk and cash card would be innovations.  Under this heading we are talking about the industrial, commercial, social and household needs of the State.</P>
      <P>I asked about deleting &ldquo;reasonable demands&rdquo;.  I think &ldquo;demands&rdquo; would quite suffice.  There is no need to put in &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  As I said, what we might think to be unreasonable would be classified as a very simple matter within the framework of the Post Office.  I do not think we should be protecting anything or anybody.  We should not be protecting An Post by using the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. It should be omitted.  We must be broad-minded and optimistic.  That word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is unnecessary.  It does not serve any purpose and I would appreciate it if the Minister would satisfy this side of the House on this occasion by saying &ldquo;Yes, I will take it out&rdquo;.  As regards the other point about the paragraph, I have proved conclusively that it is unnecessary. We must broaden the horizons of An Post.  I am not being unreasonable in asking those things.</P>

It is very difficult to answer all the points raised by Senators as we are on the section now for 45 minutes.

If people living in rural Ireland have a telephone installed, for example, so that their daughters or sons who are away from home can telephone them on a Saturday or Sunday evening because they cannot get home, the rental for that person should not be the same as for a business.  The service is completely different and for two separate purposes. Now that Telecom have come into operation they should be able to define different rates for different purposes.  We promised that everybody would have a telephone on order by 1984.  I do not know how that is today but when I was leaving, it was coming on fine.</P>

      <P>The cost of installation has gone up out of proportion.  The demand has dropped significantly and it is easy to keep abreast with it.  I hope An Bord Telecom will realise that.  A telephone in a house is generally an asset, although in some it might be considered a necessary evil.  An Bord Telecom should have a scale price for the usage of a telephone.  I know of cases where people only make ten outgoing calls in the whole two months.</P>

      <P>I beg your pardon.  I agree with the section.  When I was in the Department I gave a lot of thought to the idea of a postal museum.  The philatelic world in the Post Office is absolutely fascinating.  Every day we come in here to this House we see outside the gates <Col N="520" /> numerous buses bringing children along to watch the hocus-pocus that goes on here.  Then they go to the National Library and the College of Art.  If we had a postal museum it is the first place that the children would love to go to.  There would be a tremendous amount to be done in it.  It is a place that would be self-sufficient, because admittance to it would keep it viable.</P>
      <P>This is another area of the Post Office where the profit could be staggering.  The philatelic scene is a big one.  A museum would be a wonderful way to educate children about stamps and their origin. An Post should see this as a priority.</P>
      <P>The history of the Post Office should not be forgotten.  We should have a place in this city where it could be explained to the public at large and, in particular, to the youth.  It is a fascinating world.  The more I grew to understand it, the more fascinated I became.  Children at school should be encouraged along those lines. We would not have to subsidise such a museum.  We cannot get things for nothing and if children want to go into a postal museum they should be asked to pay.  I am sure they would be quite willing to do so.  It would come under section 1 (b) (3) &mdash; to remunerate capital and to repay borrowings.  I would like the Minister's opinion on this.  Has it been shelved like the Sugar Company in Tuam and the factory for the peat briquettes?  I suppose the postal museum got the same hammering &mdash; the Government had not the money to put into it so bye-bye.  I would be amazed if it was not put into the cupboard.</P>

      <P>The telecommunications section is even broader than the post office section because what is relevant today in Telecom may not be relevant tomorrow.  The one fear that I have about telecommunications is that the system is advancing so fast that the control of it may just slip out of the hands of the Minister or the Government of the day. That should not be allowed to happen.  I am not saying we are deliberately trying to do that or that it is intended in the Bill to do that.  I am saying technology may do it in spite of us.  We need to be very careful about that.</P>
      <P>It is very hard for people to understand how two wires can be passing their house and they cannot get a telephone.  I know why they do not get a telephone.  I am sure many Senators here do not realise how difficult it is to get a telephone.  It may not be a problem with the wires at all.  It may be the exchange.  There may be no space in it.  There are many things Senator Ferns does not know about.  I do not know about them myself.  Technology is becoming so advanced now that it is outside his reach.  The most prohibitive thing is the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are handing over to Bord Telecom. They must be very happy to receive this system.  Despite what commentators who start at 10 o'clock in the morning on RTE may say, they are getting the nucleus of a tremendous organisation and a system of which they can be proud.  Much money was invested in the five-year programme, and prior to that we had the ordinary day-to-day workings of the telecommunications side.  We had a new building programme, most of which is completed.  We had a new installations programme. Whether they like it or not, or whether they know it or not, or whether they want to know it or not is another question, but it is one of the most modem installations available.  We can be rightly proud of it and when it is fully in operation it will <Col N="522" /> operate correctly, and it will operate perfectly. There have been tremendous advances in the technological field.  Members of this House can be quite proud of it.</P>
    <P>Members of this House or the other House and people who want to have a look at the technology in the Department can go and see where, the taxpayers' money was spent.  It was wisely spent. We had installations built for this Department at a tremendous saving to the nation.  This was a boost to the economy at the time and they were built cheaply, effectively and with great efficiency. They may now be considered to be too large.  Other things can be done with them.  They are there and they cost very little in comparison with many other investments made.</P>
    <P>We should be able to move into the field of advice, training and contract services.  I do not want to go too deeply into those matters.  The first place we have to go into the contract business is at home.  We have every type of people putting installations into office buildings, private homes and so on.  The technicians in the Post Office should have the facility available to them to instal every make and shape of apparatus to suit every type of business in the country, and they have failed.  This is where management have failed in the Post Office.  It is the one area in which senior management in the GPO have failed to move with the times to redirect technicians and to redirect stores.  Much revenue to the Departments has been lost in this field.  They have an inferior type service in comparison with what could have been given to them.</P>
    <P>Bord Telecom have a major role to play and they must have freedom of expression and total freedom to be imaginative about those things.  I know they will.  I had some dealings with Bord Telecom as I had with An Post and I know the outlook is good.  I hope that we will not restrict the attitude of mind which I am sure prevails within the board and which should be allowed to continue so that a proper service can be given which we can be proud of all the way from the exchange to the receiver.  I should like <Col N="523" /> the Minister to tell me specifically what section 14 (3) means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I should like to ask the Minister how there is going to be a meeting or a marriage between the private sector and semi-State sector in terms of the very necessary commercial competition there should be as between the semi-State and the private sector.  The commercial sector had been making most of the running in terms of modernising the telecommunications system until about 1981, and from 1981 an impetus was given to the public sector.  I should like to know how the Minister sees the future of this telecommunications industry as between the private and the public sector.  Naturally Bord Telecom will have an inbuilt advantage.  He mentioned that the State will underwrite most of the borrowings and give a capital base to the semi-State body which a normal commercial business would not be able to provide for its own resources.</P>
      <P>Bord Telecom should operate in line with an up-to-date private sector in the telecommunications business, and I do not feel that Bord Telecom should have any inbuilt advantage.  If they have an inbuilt advantage they will not be as commercially hungry as the private sector.  In 1981 we had the setting up by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of sales areas in the main streets of our cities and towns for the sale and installation of modem technology.  I sincerely hope that will continue.  I should like to know how the Minister sees the private sector going along with the public sector or semi-State sector <i>vis-a-vis</i> the capitalisation of Bord Telecom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Killilea asked about subsection (3) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company shall have power to do anything which appears to it to be requisite, advantageous or incidental to, or which appears to it to facilitate, either directly or indirectly, the performance by it of its functions as specified in this Act or in its memorandum of association and is not inconsistent <Col N="524" /> with any enactment for the time being in force.</P>
    <P>That is purely an enabling clause to cover any incidental points which have not been otherwise clearly set out in the legislation. On Senator Lanigan's point, we are specifically giving Bord Telecom Éireann a monopoly in providing telecommunications services within the State, and between the State and other States.  The reason for that is, as has been said rightly by Senators during the debate, is that there are areas of this country where it is not profitable, nor will it ever be profitable, to provide telecommunications services.  That does not mean they should not have them.  There are very strong social reasons why they should.  So that those services can be paid for and subsidised, we are providing the monopoly, and the same goes for the postal services.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments behind Senator Lanigan's point.  I am all for competition. The semi-State sector could do with a little more competition than they have at the moment.  Perhaps the results in other areas of the semi-State sector would be better if they had a bit of competition. The role for the private sector here is (a) in providing the equipment which Bord Telecom Éireann require in their purchasing on a grand scale, and (b) in providing equipment within houses, and within establishments for that matter.  In other words, providing private branch exchanges, and so on, within companies, providing different types of telephones or extensions of telephones within houses.  The monopoly extends only as far as the point of entry to the home, or factory, or office, or whatever. That is where the private sector comes in&mdash;providing the ancillary equipment and providing to Bord Telecom Éireann their own transmission equipment, and so on.</P>

      <P>I always found and still find a terrible anomaly in the reality of the situation.  If people receive a bill with which they do not agree and they want to question it, it comes to the city of Dublin rather than being dealt with in the district. At least locally they would be able to find out that the area system was out of order on the particular date, a fact which would not be known in Dublin.  If cross queries have to be made, by the time they are finalised the poor person who raised the query on the bill will have died from frustration and most certainly will have received two more warning notices to pay the bill from a different section outside of Dublin.  This is not a fallacy.  We will not mention the thousands of pounds of errors some people dream about.  I do not fully agree with that.  But there are very genuine cases.  I have queried bills.  The procedure is frustrating. You get an anonymous phone call from Dublin from a lovely person who is very placid and nice to you, and two days later you get back the same bill saying you have six days to pay or you will be cut off.</P>
      <P>The appointment of the district managers was the most important thing we did in our time.  I had intended to tackle that problem but time was not on our side.  Responsibility is a key issue. Responsibility locally is what is needed. You cannot have responsibility in headquarters for the whole country.  I hope when the Minister is handing over the keys of the kingdom at dinner in the Gresham or over a hot dog down in the storeroom of the GPO, he will tell Bord Telecom that the first priority is accountability locally for telephone bills, and other items, rent and so on, in the telecommunications services.  That has to be acknowledged.  It must be a priority. Otherwise, we are wasting our time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of accountability and the problems encountered by telephone users in finding out exactly how much they owe and for what, this is one of the most frustrating exercises one can go through.  Any other commercial enterprise are accountable for each and every item incurred by them. All commercial enterprises have to issue individual invoices.  A Department of State will not pay a bill to a commercial enterprise unless (1) there is an order number and (2) there is an invoice.  In the Department of Posts and Telegraphs we get no invoice.  We get a statement and the statement only gives figures.  If you query a particular amount on the bill, you are not told how that actual amount arose.  I do not think it is outside the bounds of possibility in a technological age to have the telephone number that is dialled put on the bill.  With a computer system surely it would not be too hard to put in the telephone number dialled.</P>
      <P>We were told about 12 months ago that there was a fail safe system built into the dialling system and that when you called an operator, that operator would ring you back at your own number.  That is not happening.  It did happen possibly in one in 100 cases, but it is not happening at all now.  Perhaps fewer telephone operators are involved now that we have gone on to automatic dialling.  Automatic dialling means there is less accountability by the Department for the calls being recorded to a particular number.  If we are to be totally in favour of this section of the Bill, we must have accountability by Bord Telecom for calls being charged to a particular number.</P>

      <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not concur with my colleagues across the floor.  This is an area of complete disquiet in the country.  I accept that the Minister has said he is not satisfied with it.  I have even gone as far as suggesting to subscribers that they should <Col N="527" /> get a completely new line because they would have day and date, and all sorts of fail safes of their own installed.  It is ludicrous that your phone still apparently registers calls you never made from your house.  It is possible that in the installation of phones wires were crossed and that your phone number might be connected with somebody else's meter.</P>
      <P>What right have subscribers to see meters?  Is it ever explained to them what a meter reading looks like?  Is there a beginning to a meter reading and an end after a period as there is on a water meter or an ESB meter, or how does it function, so that people can really be reassured that there is nothing wrong with the system? Private people formed an organisation called the protection of telephone subscribers or some such name.  People who have day and dates and books, and even used a coin box over a period to check and see if calls were registering, found when they got their bill that calls were still registering.  They were not operator assisted calls.  They were supposed to be direct dial calls.  When I queried this I was told nothing could be done about it.  What rights have these people?  I tried to get a new line for a person and a new meter installed and the number taken out of the directory so that people could not use their phone number, if that was what was happening.  In dial calls a person should be entitled to inspect the equipment.  What advice have we on how people can interpret what is happening to their own meter in the local exchange?</P>

      <P>I want to endorse what has been said.  We all know from personal experience that the telephone charge system is crazy.  The time has come when everybody should be given a private meter.  People are receiving bills which are indefensible.  It is frustrating that after a month you get back a reply saying: &ldquo;We have checked your meter and we find the bill is correct&rdquo;.  There have been cases where people were on holidays for two months but they still received bills. We are told the system is foolproof and day after day it is proving to be <Col N="528" /> anything but foolproof.  We are at the stage where we must be given private meters so that we can see them ticking over.  We are told that local calls can go on all day.  I am very dubious about that. I would like to see a meter in front of me not ticking over.  I am convinced that local calls are ticking over at very long distance call rates.  That is my interpretation from my own experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there is widespread concern on both sides of the House about this problem as indeed there was in the Dáil.  I am not satisfied with the situation.  Senators made suggestions. Senator Lanigan mentioned the question of giving details of all calls made from each telephone.  That would be a very big chore.  Hopefully by the end of the year we will be in a position in certain areas to operate pilot schemes whereby we can give details as requested.  If requested we could give details for the following quarter.  We would not be able to do that for every phone call.  We have meters available for hire.  If people want to have their own meter they can hire one.  That certainly would be helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of people get their bills and never query them.  They pay them and there is no problem.  Of those people who do query them, the vast majority are satisfied after it is explained to them.  Only a relatively small number of people continue to dispute their bills. You hear of the case, as Senator Browne said, of people who were away for two months.  I had a similar case in my own constituency &mdash; I am not saying this explains away the problem &mdash; but it transpired that others were minding the house for the two months and they were not very conscientious about how they used the phone.  Mistakes can happen. There is a meter in the exchange connected to each phone.  A local call only registers once &mdash; one unit.  For a long distance call there are eight degrees of charge, Australia would be the highest charge.  A long distance call within Ireland would be the lowest charge.  Each ten seconds to Australia would represent so many local units, and so many local units would register for every ten seconds. <Col N="529" /> That is the way it works.  The readings show up on the meters in the exchange.  Those readings are taken when the bills are being calculated. Sometimes there can be clerical errors in writing down the numbers.  That would become clear if people queried their bills and the numbers were checked.  In any event it would correct itself at the next billing period.</P>
    <P>We have had open days in exchanges for people to come in and see how these meters work.  We hope to continue to do that.  Nonetheless, given what Senators and Deputies have said, there is obviously a perception that there is a problem.  The perception exaggerates the problem.  The onus is on us in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to try to put that right.  Every effort is being made to put it right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is giving the line that we get ourselves.  If you go into the exchange and are shown the meter, the number will be there.  A neighbour of mine in Carlow managed to get Manchester exchange when he was dialling Galway and this was long before there was direct dialling to England.  Why do we always stand over the suggestion that the mechanism for charging never goes wrong, when quite clearly the mechanism for getting numbers goes wrong?  I cannot accept that the mechanism for charging never goes wrong.  I have been in dispute with the Post Office about this for quite some time.  I never accept it when they tell me to come in and read the meter.  I kept a tally with my local exchange for two months and my reckoning was half of the Bill I got.  I did it as conscientiously as possible.  I have ordered a meter on hire, but I have not got it.  Another matter which worries me is that the Post Office put in a covering note saying they do not accept the reading if there is a dispute. They cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>This section sets out the duties of the telecommunications company. It provides safeguards for the company. Except in section 49 of the Bill where the Users' Council is mentioned, there is absolutely no protection for the <Col N="530" /> user.  This section of the Bill gives every protection to the telecommunications company but no protection to the user. It is not mentioned in any part of the Bill that the user has the right to query.  It does not say that the telecommunications company have to issue a detailed Bill.  It gives no protection at all to the user.  I suggest that section 15 is at fault in this.</P>
      <P>In other sections there are protections against misuse of the telecommunications system.  In the Companies Act there are various sections which give every type of protection.  Penalties can be levied on misusers of the system.

      <P>I support that.  On Second Stage I suggested that we should bring in the meter system already adopted by the ESB, and have meters installed free of charge.  This would give everybody an idea of how much his telephone bill would be.  How many of us have been shocked at our telephone bills? If you query it, you get back a stereotype letter and you still have to pay the bill. Everybody knows you cannot run a business without a telephone nowadays.  If the meter system was installed, it would be to the advantage of the Department. The Minister and his Department would be seen to be doing something that was only right and proper.  If a person owned a telephone, and a neighbour wanted to make a call on it, he would know how much that call cost and where the system was going wrong.  Very often it is not the Department's fault; it could be an employee or a babysitter using the phone, unknown to the owner of the company or of the house.  For that reason I ask the Minister to look into the possibility of installing meters, as is done by the ESB.</P>

      <P>The point was also made during the Second Stage that the ESB connect meters free of charge; they do charge for them.

You put it in an envelope, post it to the Department and your bill is posted to you.  It is a simple process and one which we should turn to.  It is the lack of visible contact of the cost that is the problem.

All the section does is to set the parameters to deal with any complaint.  It does not give the users' council any teeth; under section 49 they must report to the Minister annually and look at the problems.</P>

      <P>This section personifies what I have been saying all day.  On reading each paragraph of subsection (2), (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), one can see everything is done with the consent of another Ministry.  That is a tragedy.  Not alone are we giving the Department to two boards, but we are giving away the power of authority over the two companies also.  I do not see any logical reason why the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should have to contact the Minister for Finance if he is appointing 12 or more members to either of the two boards.  To highlight <Col N="533" /> my protest on this section, I am going to call a vote, as a matter of principle.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (2) (a) says &ldquo;...(including the chairman) shall be at least 12 or such greater number as the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance may determine from time to time&rdquo;.  Surely the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should be able to determine from time to time.  Do not give me the story that he has to get the few bob from the Minister for Finance to pay for the extra directors on the board.  If these boards are worth their salt there will be plenty of profits left after paying the directors.  There is no need to go to the gestapo to get permission to do anything. This is a giveaway.  I am ashamed of a Minister who would give away all his authority, although perhaps he was not aware of that.  Perhaps he does not take this seriously, but I do.  I resent it.  I resent the authority of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs being handed to other Ministers.  This is more fundamental to me than the appointment of the boards because there is nothing we can do about the appointment of the boards.  I will not delay too long on this because we know what will happen regarding the appointment of the boards.  There are the few who will have to be appointed, and we know where the rest of them are going to come from.</P>

      <P>I am ashamed of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to think that a responsible Minister would hand over his authority to two other Ministers.

I do not believe that as Minister responsible he should allow all his powers to be handed over in such a manner.  He is the producer of this Bill, not those who have gone before him or those who come after him.

      <P>I want to say clearly and emphatically that the responsibility for the document before this House today lies with Deputy J. Mitchell, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, not any other person. He is the man who brought it to this House.  He is the man who stands over every word of it, whether he likes or not. I want no more of that petty talk.  If he realises now that he was wrong when he handed over those responsibilities in such a glib way to other Ministries, I want him emphatically to say so.  I want to state emphatically that I disagree with what he did.  It is a scandal in 1983 that a Ministry are handing over all their authority to two boards, maybe correctly so &mdash; we will have a difference of opinion on that when we go through the Bill slowly but surely &mdash; but to hand over all his remaining responsibilities is the lowest cut of all. The Minister should be strong enough, brave enough and big enough to get up <Col N="536" /> now and say he is withdrawing those obnoxious sentences from those four paragraphs. It is a simple matter.  I do not want him to come here trying to play politics.  We can all have a go at playing politics, but we are making reasonable arguments on facts, and the fact is this: the Minister is responsible for section 16 (2) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) and the status of the Ministry for which he holds the credentials, was given to him by the President recently.  If he withdraws those words he will have the agreement of every Member of this House.</P>

      <P>Perhaps when we come to this section on the next Stage the Minister might consider the legal situation.  There is no doubt in my mind &mdash; I am not a legal man, as Senator Killilea commented this morning &mdash; that this is not the first Bill in which certain rights are vested in the Minister for Finance.  He does control the purse strings whether we or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs like it or not.  In all legislation setting up boards certain powers have always been vested in the Minister for Finance.  I am sure if the Attorney General's advice were available to us on this section on the next Stage that point would be confirmed.  If I was at a county council meeting I could ask for the legal opinion and get it.  I cannot do that in this House but I ask the Minister to confirm the legal situation.</P>
      <P>I share some of the sentiments expressed already.  I think Senator Killilea is defending the Minister.  He feels the Minister should have the powers in this section, not another Minister.  If there is a legal reason for it let us hear about it.</P>

Subsection (2) (d) reads: &ldquo;no person shall be appointed as auditor of the company without the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance;&rdquo;.  Does Senator Ferris solemnly state that he saw legislation which stooped so low that the Minister responsible for the Department had to ask the permission of the Minister for Finance to appoint an auditor?  I never <Col N="537" /> have, and I am here longer than the Senator. People might not realise that.</P>

Cut out the nonsense and the codology.  As regards the legal opinion from the Attorney General, maybe the least legal mind might be the best mind on-occasions.

This Bill is the Minister's responsibility; he should defend his Ministry because if he does not, in my estimation he will have a zero rating.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that must be said about this Bill &mdash; this Bill will never be an orphan.  We have a residual <Col N="538" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs which will operate these two companies. Now we find that not alone is the Minister for Finance involved in the operation of these companies and in the operation of this Bill, but we have another element &mdash; the Department of the Public Service. I do not really believe we are legislating for commercially viable companies if we have to have a residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs with, as the Minister said, approximately 100 employees. We know when the Minister says approximately 100, that that approximation could be out by 1,000 per cent or by 5,000 per cent.  Irrespective of whether there are embargoes on bringing people newly into the public service, or replacing jobs in the public service we are now talking about a residual situation and we now have the Department of Finance involved.  How many people in the Department of Finance are going to be involved in this legislation?  How many people in the Department of the Public Service are going to be involved?  In every section where finance is involved the Minister for Finance is mentioned, but when it comes to remuneration, an area one would imagine the Minister for Finance might have an input, it is not the Minister for Finance but the Minister for the Public Service who is mentioned.</P>

      <P>The Minister for the Public Service does nothing except try to tie his policies to what the Minister for Finance will give him.  In the only area in which there is responsibility for paying staff, the Minister for the Public Service is involved.  We are creating a monster by virtue of the fact that we have not got rid of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and we have not given control of the two new boards to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Finance only.  It is the Government's job to give a political direction to these two companies. We now have an outrageous area with three Departments running two boards which were to be commercially viable.  They cannot become commercially <Col N="539" /> viable under the restraints being put on them because of civil service input. I respect the Minister's attitude in this but he would not like to be operating two companies under the restraints being imposed here because we have three Departments running two supposedly commercial companies.  It is not on.</P>

That is a most important section which includes the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;.  There is no point in having consultation and discussions if no agreement can be reached.  It is a most reasonable word to have put in and I thank the Minister for it.  The staff who are being transferred to the two new boards will appreciate the fact that the Minister's heart was with them when he tried to ensure that their terms of employment will not be worse and that he would leave room for negotiation and agreement in the future.</P>

On the one hand he said that the Minister for the Public Service was busy all weekend doing good for the country or for his association.  He is the man who is balancing the act.  He is the man who says you get 2 per cent, 6 per cent, 10 per <Col N="540" /> cent or 8 per cent.  It is unnecessary to put this section into the Bill.  What powers have the board?

I hope when the Minister is appointing the new board, whenever that be, cognisance will be taken of that fact.  It is a very representative board.  I met them on occasions and while I had not a lot of dealings with them, one could see they were worried and were making extreme efforts to make a tremendous input to the transformation of the Department to the boards.  I do hope they will be remembered for this.  I do not know whether people from the Ministers constituency are barred or not.

      <P>I suppose every political party played this game: we said a certain person was appointed from an association, but that did not mean the association would have appointed him or her.  I hope that sort of procedure is not brought into this particular appointment.  I believe these boards are above and beyond politics.  We are talking about posterity and the transformation of a very old, solid, loyal and strong organisation to a new status.  It is very serious from that point of view.  I hope it is above politics and above reproach.  People say nothing is above politics as far as the Minister is concerned, but I do not know whether that is true because I have never had much dealings with him.  On making these appointments the Minister must remember that these appointments are very important and should be above local politics.  I say that openly and honestly: appoint the best people to do this job, whatever their politics or, even better, do not let us know their politics.  Appoint them on their ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going back on my statement that the Minister is wrong in throwing away all this power.  I am going to oppose it vehemently, with all my ability, because I feel very deeply about this.  I am disappointed the Minister did not say he would change this section on Report <Col N="542" /> Stage.  For that reason, I will have to call a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points I want to raise.  The first being on the numbers on the board.  The Bill says &ldquo;the number of directors ... shall be at least 12 or such greater number as the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance may determine from time to time,&rdquo;.  Everybody agrees that 12 is over and above the number that can be considered a workable group.  The Minister in his selection of 12 and with powers to increase that number, may be considering giving the broadest possible spectrum to the board of directors.  I do not think the board should be comprised of the greatest possible number.  What we should be looking for is a small compact board which would deal with problems as they arise.</P>
      <P>Another major problem arises in this section of the Bill in that neither of the companies shall, without the consent of the Minister or the Minister for Finance, get involved in anything with which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister for Finance do not agree.  This is a major constraint on both companies. How can you say that you are setting up individual companies in the telecommunications and postal fields and immediately restrict their activities by virtue of paragraph (f) which states: &ldquo;the company shall not invest in any other undertaking without the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;?  Surely if each of the companies are going to be commercially viable, they must have the right, as companies, to deal with whatever they feel to be commercially viable enterprises within the telecommunications and the postal fields.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The companies are being let down by the insertion of paragraph (f).  The Bill would not be lessened by the removal of that paragraph and it is definitely not strengthening the case being made by the Minister or by the Government <Col N="543" /> that we are setting up commercially viable companies.  With the constraint in paragraph (f), we are restricting them totally and are giving back again to the Minister for Finance the right to restrict the areas in which the two boards can get involved.  Could we have a comment on paragraph (f)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>Twelve is the normal number in the case of any State company which has worker directors and provision is made in the Bill that one-third of the directors will be worker directors.  This is the normal number.  In the case of Bord Telecom Éireann there will be 12 directors, four of whom will be worker directors. However, in An Post there will be 15 directors.  The reason for that is that there will be four worker directors as laid down by the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977 and there will be one postmaster director and between them they will constitute one-third of the board, so there will be ten other directors. I think the numbers are a little high.</P>

      <P>It is hard to disagree with what the Senator says about its being restrictive.  There are undoubtedly some restrictive clauses in it, just as there are restrictions on Ministers.  They are not free agents, they have to go to the Government for permission to do one thing or another.  On other occasions they have to get permission from the Minister of the Public Service or of the Minister for Finance.  This would appear to be a little restrictive, but on the other hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Decisions have been taken which have posed great problems for Ministers and the Exchequer. So it is a safety net.  We may have to review the whole question as to whether Finance and the Public Service should have so much of a role in these things at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am never too sure why when we get a Bill from the parliamentary draftsman it says &ldquo;notwithstanding anything contained in the Companies Act ....&rdquo;  Why should anything be legislated for here which could be contrary to the Companies Act?  &ldquo;Notwithstanding&rdquo; suggests that there is a fault in the Companies Act or that there might be a fault in this Bill that is contrary to the Companies Act and in either case it is faulty parliamentary draftsmanship.  Why do we have this in this Bill, just as we have had these sections in other Bills?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>That any proposed alteration would be notified by the company to recognised trade unions and staff associations is a welcome provision in that section, apart from the question raised by Senator Lanigan on the earlier part of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Lanigan.  I do not think that this is important enough to bother with, but the principle that he is talking about is important enough.  Here we have a company, the vast majority of the shares in which will be owned by the Minister concerned, anyway, who under the Companies Act, if there were no provision here, would have the right to change the memorandum and articles of association by reason of his voting power.  It should not be necessary to write it into legislation. I know that it is there because it was there previously.  It is just not necessary and Senator Lanigan has made a fair point.  The parliamentary draftsman and those who are bringing forward new legislation of this type should seriously examine whether many of these standard provisions are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not just enough for the Minister to get up and say that because a particular section is in other Bills we have to accept it.  In this Bill the Minister is looking for the protection of the Companies Act in quite a number of cases, but he is running away from the obligations of the Companies Act in other cases.  It is not quite right for him just to say that this is a standard subparagraph in most legislation.  It obviously is wrong to start off a section of a Bill with &ldquo;notwithstanding&rdquo;.  There is either a fault in the Companies Act, or the Minister is trying to get away from his obligations under the Companies Act when it suits him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, the Minister and the Minister for Finance are the owners of the company and it is a reasonable provision, but I will accept the point made by Senator O'Leary and already made by Senator Lanigan.  Very often, on a personal basis, I do not like to see clauses taken automatically from one Bill <Col N="547" /> and handed down through the generations from one Bill to another.  Also, as regards adopting Bills with standard pieces of legislation from Acts that possibly go back away into the past century in British legislation, all these things should be looked at and each individual area taken on its own.  However, in this section it is a fact that the Minister and the Minister for Finance are the owners of the company and in that case it is reasonable and it is a standard clause for all State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically speaking, the Minister for Finance is not the owner.  He is only one shareholder and the other remaining 99 shares belong to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I have had an argument all day on this issue.  I think 80 or 81 per cent of the shares of any company give complete ownership to that person and the others are only nominal from the point of view of administrative purposes or voting powers.  I cannot see why the one per cent of the Minister for Finance makes such heavy demands right through the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill should have been introduced in this House with a little panache, dash and daring.  It becomes even more restrictive as we go through the Bill, and I am dealing with it for the first time today.  I am more disappointed as each section comes up because it is the same old swan song that I have heard for the last 14 years in this House or the other House and here it is again in section 17.  The Minister could be brave in this instance and show a little dash, dare and flair.  He should agree that we should take section 17 out of the Bill completely and he should show, not alone to the Members of the Seanad, but to the public at large, that he is sincere in what he is doing in this Bill.  I am afraid that we are not sincere or serious and we are just passing the buck.  That is not good enough in this instance.  The Minister has admitted it openly and clearly and should be daring enough to say that on the next Stage of this Bill he will omit section 17, just to show reason and reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Houses of Parliament are to have <Col N="548" /> the respect that they should command and demand from the public, they should be doing something positive and slightly daring and if it is not right later on, it could be amended.  Twenty seconds in this House will amend any legislation if we all know it is wrong.  For the sake of Bord Telecom and An Post and the 30,000 people that are employed in both, let us have a bit of dash and daring from the Government on this Bill and get away from this tight-rope situation of having to accept what is written down.  There is no logical reason why we should have this in section 17 when you refer back to some of the subsections and the sections we have dealt with earlier.  Senator Lanigan rightly said on one hand you are seeking protection and on the other demanding protection and I fail to see the reason for it.  It stands to gain nothing for the Government for either board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last section, Senator Killilea has already put on record the importance of the contribution that the Government are making to the board. We are handing over a great deal of capital investment by the State out of public finances and it is important that this section give the required power to the Minister for Finance that I read into it.  Perhaps I am wrong.  I am anxious that some recognition be given to the State for their contribution to the setting up of the board.  They are being handled a present of taxpayers' investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ferris suggests that the addition of the final sentence there gives to the unions a certain amount of power, but in actual fact what the section says is that any alterations shall be notified.  It does not suggest that the unions have any contribution to make. Paragraph (f) in the previous section says &ldquo;the company shall not invest in any other undertaking without the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  We are now talking about changing the articles of association.  There is a contrast as between paragraph (f) in the previous <Col N="549" /> section and this section.  The first says that they shall not invest in any undertaking and the second says that notwithstanding anything in the Companies Act the articles of association can be changed by consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service.  Again we get back to this ridiculous situation where the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service are becoming involved.  I do not think that there is anything in this section that would give confidence to the unions because all it does is suggest that they shall be notified.  There is absolutely no consultative power being given to them. This section should equally be withdrawn from the Bill because it gives no powers and does not change anything for anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>If section 17 were dropped, as the Senator has suggested, it would also mean dropping the last part of it which means that proposed alterations in either the memorandum or articles must be notified to the recognised trade unions and staff associations.  That is a very important aspect of it and that element should not be dropped.  Maybe some of the clauses were not changed in deference to our predecessors.  We would not like to be too critical of the proposed legislation that the Senator and his colleagues in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have left behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an old ploy that was tried here a half an hour ago by the Minister.  I would not say that he is more experienced than the Minister of State from the point of view of contributions to debates but that old ploy and political gimmick is gone now.  The Coalition are seven or eight months in power.  Let me add that when we were down in that Department in days of difficult, hard work we had Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs and had a Minister and a Minister of State.  Now in Posts and Telegraphs alone there are a Minister and <Col N="550" /> two Ministers of State.  Surely the Minister or the two Ministers of State are not worth their salt, if the only answer they can come up with today is to talk about their predecessors referring, of course, to Fianna Fáil.  It is the Ministers of the day who are responsible for this Bill.  Passing the buck is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Lanigan said about the last paragraph. &ldquo;Any proposed alteration shall be notified by the company to recognised trade unions and staff associations.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  If they do not like it, it means nothing.  If we are enacting a Bill, they are going to know it anyway.  It does not take section 17 of this Bill to tell them what is going on in their place of work. If it is to be regrettable to them in their place of work they will know it a lot faster than by way of section 17 of this Bill.  It serves no purpose.  You put a message up on the board and you say, &ldquo;We are doing A, B and C and whether you like it or not we are doing it&rdquo;.  I do not care whether Senator O'Leary shakes his head.  I am only reading the English in section 17.  Senator Lanigan really brought the point out.  All it is is dictating to the associations and the trade unions. It is just notifying them.</P>
      <P>If you notified the trade unions tomorrow morning that they were taking a reduction of 7 per cent in their salaries, putting that information on the notice board would not mean anything.  I am only giving an extreme example but the point is made quite clearly.  If the Minister wishes to be authentic, strong and forceful with a bit of panache and dash he would delete this section.  It is of no relevance.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Ministers of State are now handing over in detail to the Ministers for Finance and for the Public Service all the power remaining to them.  The whole thing is a shocking performance by this Government.  The Bill is deteriorating as it goes on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to make the point that no alteration would take place without the Minister's approval.  When approval from the Minister would be received the workers would be entitled <Col N="551" /> to be notified.  How many companies in this country have not notified their workers of whatever they wished to do or of whatever articles they wished to change and put them in bankruptcy courts and put themselves out of business without their workers even knowing about it?  That is why this section is here. At least the workers will be notified.  The Minister will have agreed previously to it so that workers can take the proper action under the legislation governing the employment of people in this country by which they can protect their interest.  This new board will not have the power to ignore their workers and may make no alterations within the terms of the Companies Act without the prior approval of the Minister.  That is a double safeguard for the employees.  I accept everything else the Senator has said by way of valid criticism but I want to be careful that we do not try to water down the Bill by changing words around.  This is an important section for us.  It is an important section for the workers in the industry.  It is very important that the new board would know that there are those safeguards for the workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Senator Ferris is misguided in his criticism because in actual fact what we are talking about here are the articles of association of the company not the operation of the company. Let us be quite straight about it.  If the people who set up the company in the first place have any sense at all they will cover every probability or possibility or suggestion of a possibility in the articles of association.  One of the things that printers love is to get the articles of association of an ice-cream limited company because if you set up a company, irrespective of the size of it, everything will be covered within the ambit of the articles of association.  To say that the workers are getting protection by virtue of the fact that there is a suggestion that they will be told of any alteration in the articles of association and that that gives them protection is a false argument.  It does not give them any protection at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we said that this Bill was one of the most important Bills to come through the Houses of the Oireachtas, we dealt in the main with the fact that we were talking about 30,000 workers but in addition we are talking about considerable assets.  The structure of these companies is to be associated with the assets that are there at present plus Government borrowing and plus the amount of money that can be raised by Telecommunications Investments Limited.</P>
      <P>The structure of the company will be based on the valuations put on the properties on the day of vesting or the day prior to vesting.  The capital construction of these companies will be vital in the capital structuring of the company and obviously if a valuation is put on these companies which is too high, the market will not bear that particular burden and we could have an under-capitalised situation in the two companies.  If there is an under-valuation put on the properties and the assets of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, there could be a situation which would be totally detrimental to the initial setting up of these companies. I should like to ask the Minister on what basis is he to value these companies on the day prior to vesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this issue, we should not say merely that it is just a technical matter.  We are dealing here with the setting up of two major companies and we cannot capitalise these companies unless we find out exactly what the asset value of these is.  I agree with the Minister when he says that the replacement cost of the equipment is the valuation that should be put on equipment.  That is all right if one is in an ongoing business &mdash; one talks about replacement cost &mdash; but when setting up a new company one is taking over assets but not taking them over at replacement cost.  They are taken over at the valuation as they are at the time.  What is being suggested here is that the value of the motor vehicles and technical equipment is to be assessed and that they are to be handed over to the companies at the replacement value.  That is a ludicrous situation.  On the subject of the asset value, I suggest that if you take the valuation on premises as at December 1982 it would be completely different from the valuation in 1983.  I am not sure what the vesting date is to be but I am certain that the valuation on the vesting day will be totally different from the valuation that is put down in the Bill giving the assets of Bord Telecom as £1,500 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in this regard in that the valuation of the <Col N="554" /> property put on it by the Valuation Office and as dealt with in section 18 (1) is largely theoretical.  It is largely irrelevant from the point of view of the financing of the company.  Let me explain to the Senator so that he may understand why I hold that view.  If one takes a building which might comprise 20,000 square feet, containing equipment, and if the valuation on that building is put at £100,000, that means that there will be £100,000 worth of shares issued in respect of it.  It will be issued in total at the end of the day.  If the valuation put on the building is £90,000 instead of £100,000 there will be £90,000 worth of shares issued in respect of that but it will make no difference to the repayments of the company whether it is £100,000 on the balance sheet or £90,000 on the balance sheet. There will be no repayment for the Minister arising directly out of the nominal value of the shares.  So whether it is valued at £100,000 or at £90,000 makes no difference to the actual day-to-day operation of the companies or the day-to-day repayments which they must meet in respect of any capital advanced.  It is purely a balance sheet figure.</P>
      <P>It would, of course, make a difference if everything was transferred for £1. Particularly in the case of the telecommunications board there is some expectation of a return on investment and some measure of that must be available.  But within large margins of error it makes little or no difference as to what valuation is put on.  There will be no liability from the company to the Minister for Finance except the notional liability of the value of the shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree totally with what Senator O'Leary has said.  If one goes to our neighbouring country and sees the privatisation of nationalised industry, including the oil industry, one will find that one of the problems that arose was that when the shares were offered to the public they were offered at a price that would not be the price that would be set down as being a commercial valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a definitive statement of £1,500 million being the asset <Col N="555" /> value of Bord Telecom, of which £725 million was made up by loans of which there was £435 million investment by the investment company and he told us that he would issue shares to the value of £355 million and would write off £80 million of what was owed to Telecommunications Investments Limited.  Therefore it is vitally important that a proper means of assessing the valuation of the capital assests should be arrived at.  A transfer of run-down vehicles to Bord Telecom at the replacement cost will be a major hindrance to the board because regardless of what type of equipment there may be at present in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs it has to be written off over a certain number of years on an on-going basis and the Department have to provide for the replacement of that.  It is ludicrous to suggest that there are 1,000 Bedford CF vans around the country which can be handed over to Bord Telecom as being 1985-1986 vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of explanation of that, the value will be the written down replacement value.  As far as the Minister is concerned he will have all the shares himself with the exception of one for the Minister for Finance.  There is no question of privatisation.  It is reasonable that the Valuation Office should be the people to put a value on this, and that the current value of assets on the vesting date should be the actual figure arrived at.  It is an entirely reasonable approach in this particular area.  I personally would not see any great difficulty in it.  In this case, because of the highly technical nature of it, we will have to rely very much on the Valuation Office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the most important facet of it all is, that apart from the shares, that Telecommunications Investments Limited who are to collect money from the public sector themselves should know exactly and precisely and up to date the valuation of the properties and the valuation of the other matters relevant? Also, it is even more serious from the point of view of An Post because they are the people who are going to start off with <Col N="556" /> the biggest hardship, and the correct valuation to them is even more important than is the case in respect of Bord Telecom. For that purpose I suggest that the valuations as assessed last be placed in the Library so that people can see that they are sound basically, that they would at least be up to standard and they would not be open to criticism.  This should be done rather urgently so that when the next Stage of this Bill is brought here, if there is anything irregular in those assessments they can be corrected by this House and by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would hope that that is the least the Minister of State in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could do for us when indeed he could not do much for us under section 17.  Senator Lanigan is right.  It is most imperative from Bord Telecom's point of view that the valuations be absolutely correct because they are the people who have to go to the open market to purchase money at whatever rates are applicable.  Therefore, we must be absolutely correct.  This must not be done by way of a blanket assessment by the Valuation Office.  There must be details.  The public are entitled to see them.  I most certainly believe that this House is entitled to see them.  It would serve the purpose tremendously if the Minister could make them available before we reach the next Stage of this Bill.</P>

There are 30,000 people employed in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs so surely it is a small thing to expect some of them to produce for us the documents giving the assessment only of the valuation.

He gives a breakdown of the indebtedness by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to Telecommunications Investments Ltd.  He gives the indebtedness to the State but he does not give any evaluation of the assets of the company. How can he justify saying that on the day before vesting the valuation officer will say this is the valuation and still come in here and not tell us how there is a breakdown between buildings, land, vehicles and equipment?

      <P>Our point is that we are asked to give a blanket &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to proposals which are fundamental to the assessment of the valuation.  We are being asked to do this without seeing the figures which are available in the Department.  They are important within the framework of the Bill because, as Senator Lanigan rightly said, Bord Telecom are dependent on the valuations when the Telecommunications Investments Company go to the public at large to seek money from them.  Yet the Minister shirks the responsibility of making available in the Library of this House the right for us to see what these assessments are.  It is a reasonable request from the Opposition to find out what the Valuation Office made their assessments on.  It is just as important, although the Minister glibly slipped by it, as the valuations on post offices.  It would be interesting to know what the valuations are on individual post offices.  It is not be unreasonable for us to ask for such information.  The Minister should state when the information will be available.</P>

      <P>The purpose of that paragraph is to reassure the work force in both Bord Telecom and in An Post. As the Senator is aware, one of the great worries of the work force has been the question of possible future privatisation and therefore the uncertainty that might attach to their future position.

      <P>I admit that I have never taken notice of it before in my life.  It is ridiculous, foolish and unnecessary that the work of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as a 99 per cent shareholder in the company, cannot be taken at Government level and consent for borrowing be given on the basis of a memorandum circulated for reasons a, b, c, d, f, as pronounced by him, without having to go on bended knee to the Department of Finance.  It is time we broke away from this.  The new boards should not be strangled by the Department of Finance but released from it.  The only way release can be given is through the offices of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  We are entwining them.  Not alone will they have to get over the worry of discussing the matter with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs but they will also have to troop across town to have a word with the Minister for Finance.  His one per <Col N="563" /> cent has the same say as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs' 99 per cent.  To me it sounds absolutely ridiculous.  I do not remember seeing it before, I am open to contradiction on that, but whether I did or not it does not mean that it should be inserted here.  The Minister should act now, before it goes too far and retract the consent of the Minister for Finance for such an issue, taking into account what I have said.</P>

      <P>The point the Senator has been making throughout the debate about the Department of Finance having so much say in everything is very significant. There are arguments for it but the question arises whether we are over-centralising things in this respect.  It is a subject which merits consideration in a general way by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If CIE borrow money they need the guarantee of the Minister for Finance.  It is of great help to them when they go to the banks with that guarantee. Otherwise the money might not be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>The Sugar Company may be its own strangler.  We will not debate that.  The Minister has endorsed everything I believe but he does not seem to act upon it.  We are now in a new situation. The oldest organisation in this State is the Post Office.  That is an undeniable fact.  We are giving it a new impetus and we are strangling it before we even give it a start because we are attaching it to the Department of Finance.  We should be giving it the freedom about which I spoke all day.  That is what we should be giving the board, not tying it up in knots with the Department of Finance.  They nearly need the authority of the Minister for Finance to scratch their backs.  It is disgraceful.  Now is the time for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, since he <Col N="564" /> agrees with me, to delete that.  It would be forward thinking by the Minister. Many members of the Minister's party agree with me that we have to give an impetus to this board and not batten down the hatches before they even move.  I am depressed, as the day goes on, by the hold of the Department of Finance on this Bill.  Now is the time to break that. The Minister should do it, and every party and the Independents would agree with it.  The Minister should do something before this comes to a terrible, grinding halt.</P>

      <P>There is considerable force in the point but if I was to do what the Senator proposes I could, in one fell swoop, destroy the possibilities of the board.  If the Minister for Finance was excluded from it and his guarantee was not forthcoming, it could well be that this board and many other boards would have great difficulty in borrowing.  That could destroy the telephone development programme which started three-and-a-half years ago when the Senator's party were in power.  It was a very ambitious programme which is on target.  All the borrowings to date, including the borrowing by ITI which was devised during the Senator's own term as Minister of State and was a very clever and bright idea had to be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  If that guarantee was not forthcoming, ITI would not have been the success it is.  The guarantee has to be there.  While acknowledging that there is some substance in the general point, it is something we would have to look at in a global way.  As of now, the guarantee of the Minister for Finance has to be forthcoming and if his guarantee has to be forthcoming so has his consent.</P>

Section 28 states that the guarantees are only valid to £8,500,000 in the case of the postal company.

Relate that back to section 28 where the Minister is only guaranteeing £8.5 million.  In section 27 the aggregate borrowing limit is £58.5 <Col N="566" /> million.  In the next section the guarantee is only for £8.5 million.  In the next section then we are suggesting that the Minister can make available.  Surely the Minister should guarantee whatever he makes available.  If he makes that amount of money available to the company surely he is responsible for guaranteeing in the end that if there is a problem he will guarantee against that loss.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give some indication as to the basis on which the working capital is being allotted?  Ten million pounds is being allocated to the postal company and £150 million to the telecommunications company, which would seem to be out of line with the capital requirements in both cases where £32.5 million is the asset value of one company compared to £1,500 million as the asset value of the other company.</P>

      <P>As regards accounts, in the event of the boards not going the way <Col N="567" /> we would wish them to go, does the Minister not think yearly accounts are a bit antiquated and that a lot can happen within a 12-month period?  Would it not be possible for us to have a quarterly synopsis?  I suggest that we should have accountability on a quarterly basis rather than on a yearly basis.  Most reputable companies, probably the exceptionally good ones, have one every Monday to know how they are doing.  The direction a large body such as this is going in should be known at more frequent intervals than one year.</P>

      <P>We must strike a balance. There can be a tendency for Ministers to become too involved in the affairs of semi-State companies on the one hand and on the other hand there can sometimes be a very distant relationship when Ministers do not know what the boards are doing.  The last sentence of subsection (1) states: &ldquo;shall keep in such form as aforesaid all such special accounts as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;.  The Minister will have the power to say he would like to see accounts quarterly.  The Government have recently said that in the case of CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome section in that employees can be appointed as directors of the company because this gives employees an insight into what is going on within their own working area on a day-to-day basis.  I am glad that this ties in also with section 35 where, irrespective of the remuneration that might be applicable to a board member, he would not be at a loss of any earnings by virtue of the fact that he had to attend board meetings.  There is in both sections 34 and 35 a protection for employees in that they have an input which is of tremendous relevance in today's business world.  Many companies had problems but the workers were not told of them until it was too late for either the company or the workers to become involved in rescue packages.  The appointment of a director does not mean that he will, in any way, suffer financially from his appointment as a director of the company. That is a welcome addition to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of workers to the board.  There is a responsibility implicit in that which one must mention at this stage.  If something is pertinent to the employment of the staff or to the unions they are entitled to report back to their respective union. However, reporting back must be looked at in a very careful manner.  At board meetings there are certain items and certain parts of the agenda relevant to the normal day-to-day profit-making or working of the boards which are confidential. We should protect the board in some way.  We should insert a clause to state that certain aspects of the workings of the board should be kept confidential. I know of cases where there have been leaks from board meetings.  We should protect the boards.  It is good for the work force to have representation on the board.  There is the other point of the board working as a business organisation. In An Post, for example, if there were <Col N="569" /> leaks concerning the rejuvenation of the parcel service there would be parties outside of the board who would be very interested.  They should not know about that because that belongs to An Post and to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I just give that as an example.</P>
      <P>I suppose confidentiality and secrecy are pious hopes.  I had the experience one time in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of discussing a matter and putting it on a piece of paper.  I read it in detail the following Sunday in the newspaper. I was not shocked but keeping certain matters secret is of great importance.</P>

      <P>What the Senator has said is correct.  It is important that it should be seen in the context of section 37 and not the present section.  The comment he has rightly made about disclosures of confidential information is a matter for all directors not just worker directors.  It should be kept confidential because otherwise the viability of the business could be undermined.</P>

      <P>Like other Senators I welcome this provision but there will be a time gap before the elections take place.  The Bill provides that they should take place within 12 months after the vesting day or such longer period as may be agreed between the company and recognised trade unions and staff associations. In the meanwhile, the Minister under subsection (8), can appoint as a director of each board a member who serves as a representative of the recognised unions and staff association.  I understand there are three at present but there is provision for appointing two here, which would be two out of 12.  Will the Minister clarify the proportion?  One third of the members of the interim board should be worker representatives to keep that balance.</P>

      <P>Part of what is mentioned in section 37 has been covered already by Senator Killilea.  Nevertheless we must deal with the matter of confidentiality by any civil servant.  It is part of his terms of employment that whatever information he gets within his Department he keeps confidential.  Unfortunately, over the years this has not been adhered to.  If we are talking about confidential information would this be the section under which we could talk about the transfer of files or would it be best taken on a later section?  The transfer of personal files must be taken into account. I do not mind whether we discuss it now or on section 45.</P>

      <P>It can only be detrimental to the conduct of business.  There have been problems in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over the past year.  Things have appeared in the papers.  I remember some time ago there was an article about an investigation in the Department into a phone call between insurance officials.  As Deputy Kelly said in the Dáil, the tapes seemed to have fallen from the back of a lorry.  All the names of the officials involved in the investigation and details, not entirely accurate but fairly accurate, appeared in <Col N="571" /> a publication.  That was just one example. There are other examples as well.  That is happening in the civil service context and it can only be a matter of concern. Here we are dealing with a semi-State situation.  We are trying to provide in law that where directors, members of the staff or consultants are privy to information declared to be confidential it would be an offence to disclose that information. It is a proper provision.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan has raised the question about personal files.  It is not the intention to transfer personal files to the semi-State companies.  What will be transferred are essential details of service, levels of remuneration and so on. It is not the intention to transfer personal files in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to transfer to each proposed company the nature of all sick absences, assessments submitted in confidence for promotion, records of all discipline and irregularities, late attendance, supervisors' private comments and employee explanations for alleged misdemeanours?  No prospective employer would normally have any right to or expect this type of information. In a situation where this information was passed on to a new employer the staff should be consulted beforehand. This is of major importance.  If we transfer personal documents we cannot suggest that we are setting up new semi-State companies.  I suggest that if there is to be any transfer of such documents, which exist in all Government Departments, employees should have the right of access to these documents and to be able to make whatever comments on them that they regard as necessary.  It is a vital area of staff relations.  If this is to happen, we cannot start off these new companies with a proper relationship basis as between staff and the new companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Lanigan on this matter of personal files.  I am pleased the Minister said that the actual personal files will not be passed on, only factual details of services.  To pass on personal files of this kind would be like tying a stone around <Col N="572" /> the neck of employees who are moving into a different sphere of employment.  I hope the Minister can reassure us that this will not be done.  The principle still remains that in this sort of matter where files are kept on employees they should have access to them and they should be able to see what is being said about them. It is often said about the right of privacy, and so on, that it is a kind of 1984 situation in which files are kept on people and they never know the information that is being passed in regard to credit, in regard to past convictions, in regard to all sorts of things, who has this information and who has not.  It certainly is a safeguard to any employee to know that he can see what is being said about him and have the opportunity, if possible, to refute it, if he feels that he is being accused in the wrong.  This seems to be an ordinary part of natural justice.</P>
      <P>It appears to be the practice in Northern Ireland and in Britain, at any rate with regard to the civil service, that they are allowed access to these personal files.  Where files of this sort are kept on employees in the new companies, they should be allowed access to them.  I hope the Minister will also be able to reassure us that the whole personal file will not be passed on and that a new start in every sense will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with what Senator Lanigan and Senator McGuinness have said because it certainly coincides very much with my own instincts and my own thoughts on the matter.  The question of what personal files will be transferred will be a matter for discussion with the trade unions.  That is one of the things that will be discussed. Essential information regarding seniority, levels of pay, and so on, will have to be transferred.  It is not the intention to transfer the whole personal file, but there are certain grey areas, relative seniority, for instance, which may have to be transferred, but they are the sort of things which will be discussed with the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general question of access to files is, I understand, being discussed in the general council of the conciliation and <Col N="573" /> arbitration scheme.  From my time in the Department of Justice I know work is going on in the area of legislation generally dealing with public access to files, and I certainly would welcome progress in that regard.  It is absolutely correct that we should go in that direction.  I have noted what Senators have said, and I will take up the point with the Minister for the Public Service in relation to the general council, and with the Minister for Justice in relation to possible legislation on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put one question to the Minister.  If all the files are not to be transferred, will there then rest in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs an enormous collection of personal files on individuals who are no longer employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or will there be a big bonfire? Can the soon to be ex-employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs be assured that all personal records about them that are not transferred to their new employers will be destroyed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the intention to destroy those records because there are all sorts of reasons why they should be kept.  Like a lot of other files in the Department, there may be a need in the interests of individuals to have those files in the future when it comes to questions of pensions and so on.  I take the point raised and I will certainly consider it very sympathetically because, as I said earlier, I very much agree with the sentiments that lie behind what Senators have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas the Minister has said that he will consider this sympathetically, he has not stated whether the staff will have the right to look at their personal files before those files are transferred to the new company.  Access to personal files is a legal right in the UK at present and, even in the North of Ireland where the Special Branch have gone through the records of various members of the staff of the civil service, these files are available by right to the <Col N="574" /> civil service.  Where notations are taken by the Special Branch and recorded on files, one would imagine that these files might not be available to the public, but in the UK and in the North of Ireland, which unfortunately is administratively a part of the UK, the civil service have the right to look at their files at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said.  There are obviously areas where a person's own interests would be best served by not destroying his file, but there is a very simple answer and that is to let the individual see his file and he will identify what is in his own interests.  I would be very concerned, for instance, that reasons of what is usually described as national security would tempt people to hold on to very interesting information on 30,000 individuals working in a sensitive area of the State's operations, in other words, that we would keep records just because they might become interesting later on.  Perhaps the Minister could be a little more specific in his assurance that it will only be where the retention of information in his Department would be for the benefit of the individual in his future career that that information will be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel it would be very wrong that files in the Department should be used for purposes, as the Senator says, of national security.  This would be wrong, and I certainly would favour very strongly a move to have legislation covering the points raised by the Senators. RTE were transferred out of the civil service 20 years ago and we still have queries from RTE about people transferred, usually relating to the service of a person, pension rights, and so on.  We have to strike a balance between that need and the dangers the Senators are raising.  I can assure Senators that I personally will do everything I can to ensure that the files are kept only for what are benign interests, and not in any way extraneous interests, or for reasons which are inimical to the interests of the employees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be an end to the practice whereby supervisory staff may add private notes on all staff correspondence before forwarding it to the management who will decide on it.  This conflicts directly with the report on Administrative Justice by the then Chief Justice to the Devlin Report (Appendix 1, &ldquo;Note on Administrative Law and Procedure&rdquo; under Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, pages 456 and 457 on natural justice in procedures 1966-1969; Prl. 792).</P>
      <P>I would suggest that an amendment should be made to this Bill which would state that in the Minister's interests and in the interests of natural justice, each employee of the companies or company may inspect the files which are kept by the company recording details of his or her service and shall have made available all of the information recorded in the same way as it made available to any level of management which may have cause to take the records of the staff member into account; that an inspecting member of the staff may require an insertion which they furnish as a factual correction or rejoinder to be included in their files.  This would give the staff the rights which are now provided to people in the civil service in other countries.  It would equally give them access to their files, and if the supervisor in a particular section has made an amendment to a report the staff member would either be able to put a rebuttal into the files or his own comments, and this would be kept on the files as a permanent record.</P>

      <P>If I do not get the Minister to give me a specific answer this time, I will not pursue it.  If his intention is to ensure that only, as he said himself, benign information will be retained in his Department, then surely he can also tell us that it is his desire that the individuals in question should have access to that information.  After all, if it is benign and in their interest there should be no reason not to let them see it.</P>

I personally would very much welcome progress being made on that front, and hopefully progress will be made shortly.  I would also welcome legislation on it from the Department of Justice.  As I have said I will communicate to the Minister for the Public Service and with the Minister for Justice the views so well expressed by Senators here today with which I thoroughly agree.  It is a matter which is being discussed.  It is an area where we are behind other countries. We should be seeking to make progress and hopefully we can make progress in the not too distant future.  It is a question that arises not just in the case of my Department.  It arises within the general civil service and, indeed it arises outside the civil service as well.</P>

      <P>I accept that what the Minister said is probably the best we can get from this particular deal.  It is obvious that there are implications and complications. The point has been made and the Minister has accepted it.  I can see there are difficulties.  Naturally there will be difficulties because of the difficulty of interpretation.  The Minister has given an assurance and, while he has not given us the exact words some of us would desire to get, he has gone a fair distance to give them to us.  There is another type of informative person who gives out information and this is the type something should be done about, that is, the person who gives out information for political purposes.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are full of such people who leak information like sieves for political purposes, either for political party purposes or for their own purposes.  I hope the boards will be able to contain this problem.  I had an instance once in the Dáil and the Minister knows all about it. There was an alleged phone tap at a particular time on the Fine Gael headquarters. The then general secretary who is now head of Government Information Services made statements every day of the week about what this phone tap was and what it was not.  I honourably gave an honest reply in the Dáil at the time to all and sundry and I gave such information <Col N="577" /> as was available to us.  It was dragged on and on.  It was a sad occasion.</P>
      <P>We were out of Government not long afterwards.  I asked the then Minister the very same question that was asked of me. Phone tapping was dropped and changed to overhearing.  The politics of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been often and odd and it was sad to hear the abuse being dished out to technicians.  There were horrific and wild statements about alleged tapping and all this tripe that went on over the years.  I hope the new Bord Telecom will reserve the right not to answer such stupid questions in future.  I have instanced a typical case where there was no more of a tap put on that phone or that establishment than there was on the clock on the wall. Something happened and alleged facts were multiplied and extracted, and it was a disgrace.</P>
      <P>I hope the new board will be protected in some part of this legislation against such wild, extravagant remarks.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on what protection he will be giving them in whatever section of the Bill is appropriate. I raise this because matters relevant to staff were raised.  They were serious matters and they have to be handled delicately but firmly.  It is worrying the staff that private records of what happened in the Department are being handed over to the new board.  The theme now should be: &ldquo;Come home, James; all is forgiven. Whether you did right or you did wrong we will all start off equally again.&rdquo; I hope that will be the theme.  The ferocious lies &mdash; and I do not care what political party make the allegation &mdash; and whispers about listening performances in the Department and in certain exchanges in this city or outside it are total and absolute bunkum.  I know that from experience.</P>

He is a different person from the one out on the field. Going home in the evenings if he goes for a jorum to his local pub he must feel that all the lads will say, &ldquo;Well, what was going on today?  Did you hear the Secretary of Fine Gael talking to John Bruton about the Green Paper and the Blue Paper and all the rest of the papers?&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Seriously speaking, we must protect those workers from that sort of wild allegation and crazy talk.  It was admitted subsequently by the then Minister, Deputy Harte, that it was only an overhearing error but at first it was a phone tap.  That is typical of what was done.  I felt sorry for the workers then and I feel sorry for them now.  Somewhere in this Bill they should be protected just as the private records of other people are protected in the Bill.  We should stop this political carry-on that has gone on over the years, this nonsense regarding allegations. A very limited number of really top-class technicians run the exchanges throughout the country, and some protection should be given to them too.  The new board should be given protection against those crazy, Walt Disney performers.</P>

      <P>I will not delay on this, but I hate this self-destruction part.  I know it was the protocol in times gone by that if you were a Member of this House or the other House, dare you ever do anything for yourself.  I disagree with the principle that because you are a Senator you are barred from participating. The Leader of the House, for example, Senator Dooge, is a most learned man in his field.  There are very few like him in this country.  It is shocking that the board of a company should be unable to avail of his abilities, just because he is a Member of Seanad Éireann.  We are our own worst enemies in that we are always putting ourselves down.  It is a sin almost to be a politician these days.  In section 38 we are banning ourselves from becoming members of boards.  I do not agree with that.  If we do not have respect for ourselves how can we expect the public to have respect for us?  I do not think this section should be in this Bill or in any Bill.  There are many other people such as Senator Eoin Ryan.  Because I do not name other Senators when I look at them <Col N="580" /> that does not mean they are not fine people.  In his field, Senator Dooge is almost unique.  There are not many people with the same capability in that field.</P>

      <P>The Senator is being political.  I am being factual.  It is bad form and bad politics.  I thought there might be a change when this Government took office because they are to introduce reforms.  There is no reform here.  We are worse than ever.  Not alone are we tying ourselves to Ministries but we are tying one Ministry to another as well.  We are almost debarring ourselves from coming into Leinster House.  We used to have to get out of our cars, open the boot and show what we were carrying.  It is little wonder that the youth have little respect for us as public representatives.  We are saying we are not capable of serving on boards.  I know I would not be appointed, but I would dearly love to serve on An Post.  I believe I would have a tremendous contribution to make to it.  If I were lucky enough to be appointed a director of the philatelic section of the board I would have a tremendous contribution to make. That is a fact.  I will not be debarred from believing in my own ability.  Now is the time for Senators to back me on this.  We are downgrading ourselves and our abilities. God rest Johnny Callanan.  He was the man who put together and held together the wool council.  He was a Member of the Dáil.  He was a man of integrity and he was an example to this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that Senator Killilea has sat down, perhaps we can leap in and support him.  I agree with Senator Killilea.  I am saying this as someone who has suffered from this, because I was a member of the Board of the Voluntary Health Insurance before I was elected to the Seanad and I was sacked from the board promptly on being elected to the Seanad.  In one sense I rather resented that, because I was the only woman who had ever served on the board <Col N="581" /> and since at least half the unhealthy people in the country are women, I felt there was something to be said for having a woman on the VHI Board.  I do not agree that being a Member of the Oireachtas should debar one from functioning properly provided one has any sense of integrity.  This is included in virtually all Bills.  The same thing applies in the legislation on the Community Development Agency and, again, that was a field in which I had served for a considerable number of years.  Because I became a candidate for the Seanad I was not allowed to be appointed to that board.  I do not want to be running myself up and other people down, but you lose the experience of people who have served for a considerable length of time in a particular area.  It is not just Members of the Oireachtas who are debarred &mdash; for which there might be some justification &mdash; but candidates for either House of the Oireachtas.  You may not be elected. There are many people who have been candidates over and over again and who have never been elected.  Yet just because they were candidates they had to leave boards with presumably no guarantee that they would be taken back again.</P>
      <P>I would join with Senator Killilea in his remarks about Senator Dooge.  Boards have been deprived of his learned contribution for this very same reason.  There are other State bodies, for instance, the very valuable National Economic and Social Council do not operate this, and which have Members of the Oireachtas on their boards, and Members of the Oireachtas who make very considerable contributions.  Therefore this is not something automatic which has to be done.  I suggest that it should be thought about again and perhaps this section could be taken out of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of us had better watch out.  I raised this very early in my period in the Seanad on the Youth <Col N="582" /> Employment Agency Bill when the same provisions were introduced.  I have never understood why this form of discrimination was introduced.  On the question of a conflict of interests, I am a member of the board of management of the Cork Regional College, where I am employed, and two other members of the board of that college are in the same position.  You could just as easily disbar members of a college.  We take decisions about the allocation of the college budget and major decisions on resources and funding.  We as politicians have a habit of apologising incessantly for ourselves and, at the same time, giving the public every reason to believe that what is suspected about us is true.  I instance this, and also the performance of a party in another House did not do our image any good either.</P>
      <P>I am even more concerned about another section.  First of all, on the question of people who are nominated having to resign from boards.  I remember one case.  The former Vice-President of University College, Cork, was a member of the Higher Education Authority, a man with considerable expertise and knowledge in an area of education where he was badly needed, the area of agriculture. He chose to run for the Seanad but was unsuccessful.  Because he was a candidate he resigned from the Higher Education Authority.  That is very wrong. Whatever about Members of the Oireachtas, the idea that because a person is a candidate in an election he must resign is absolutely appalling and is offensive to politics.  The other part of it is the very bald reference to what happens to Members if they are elected to the Oireachtas.  I can understand the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say before we adjourned that, apart from my very strong objections to the fact that anybody who is nominated to a board, such as the board of one of these companies, must resign and the fact that Members of these Houses cannot be members of such <Col N="584" /> boards, there is another point I must mention.  Individuals who are elected to this or the other House or to the European Assembly must immediately stand seconded from his other employment and shall not be paid by, or be entitled to receive from the company, any remuneration or allowances.  As it stands, that is not unreasonable except that it is extraordinary to expect an executive of a semi-State corporation who becomes a Member of this House to live on the salary we are paid.  Admittedly many people are expected to live on this salary, but we do expect to entice people into this House and persuade people to take an active part in this House.  The average public service salary is of the order of £10,000 or £11,000 a year.  Yet if somebody in a semi-State corporation becomes a Member of this House, he stands seconded, loses that salary and gets paid £7,610.  That is not the way to encourage people to take an active part in politics.  Apart from the practicalities, the tone of that paragraph &mdash; and it is not unique to this legislation, it is in most legislation &mdash; instead of encouraging people in semi-State corporations to take part in politics, is more or less holding a warning over their heads saying they are not really to be approved of, that their role is elsewhere.  The opposite should be the case.  One major British private company, ICI, have taken a directly opposite view.  Their view is that because of the expertise people in business and industry have to offer, their employees should be encouraged.  For instance, in terms of seniority, service in the British Parliament would be recognised by this company as being a real service.  Can the Minister tell us why this clause is here, for some other reason than that it is in every other piece of legislation?  There must be somewhere in the records of some Government or in some obscure file an argument about this other than the argument that it was there before.  Can somebody explain what conflict of interest is involved, or is envisaged, that makes this provision necessary?</P>

      <P>He has stated the loss in salary, but I am not going to go into that. When Senator Killilea made the case that we are eligible for boards I loved the way he looked around.  He looked at the Government side and picked out Senator Dooge.  He said he was material for a board.  He spoke about himself and said he was material for a board.  Then he looked around at this side of the House but he was not too sure if the rest of us were suited for boards.  I can tell Senator Killilea that we may not have material for this particular board, but there are other boards for which we are suitable. It is on the principle of not allowing a Senator or TD to be a member of these boards that I absolutely and totally support Senator Killilea.</P>
      <P>I also do it at a time when we, the elected people, whether we be county councillors, corporation members, TDs, Senators or other elected persons, have come in for more criticism than ever before.  When criticising us, people are criticising the institutions of this State. We should not knock ourselves and say we are not the material for boards. Regardless of what other people might say about the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, I have a high regard for him.  In about six months' time when the other business has cooled down he might bring a glimmer of light into a Bill that he might bring into this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I came in here in 1977 I have seen this clause written into many Bills. <Col N="586" /> I think it is wrong.  We are knocking ourselves.  If we decide to have a vote on this this evening I will challenge Fine Gael and Labour: are they going to get into a queue and vote against themselves as elected persons and say they are not the material for any board?</P>

What really annoys me is that when you declare yourself a candidate for the Seanad elections, straight away you are unable to remain as a member of those boards.  Whether you are defeated or victorious, you are no longer a member of that board.  Most of us know that once you surrender membership of those boards, and those powerful bodies, it is very difficult to get back.  If there is a vote on this, I will support my colleagues on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I was very interested to hear the Senators' views on this section.  It has become an established convention almost, and it is included now as a matter of course in legislation, that Deputies, Senators, Members of the European Parliament and even candidates for those offices, should be excluded from directorships of semi-State bodies.  There is much food for thought in what Senators have said, but again it is a question which perhaps needs general review.  I will certainly note the comments of Senators and will bring them to the attention of the Government.  I do not think we could exempt in this Bill what has been established policy for many years, but in view of what Senators have said, the policy needs looking at.  It may be that some relaxation of the rule could be contemplated. I was very interested to hear Senator McGuinness's experience of being excluded from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  That one example highlights the sort of anomalies this gives rise to.  Certainly I will ask the Government in view of Senators' comments, to look at this general policy again.</P>

      <P>There are other bodies, not only semi-State companies which <Col N="587" /> debar them.  I also want to correct a little point in case Senator Honan took a wrong meaning from what I said.  I glanced around the Chamber and saw so many people that if I had mentioned every one I thought suitable to sit on boards, we would have been here all night.  I want Senator Honan to accept my apologies because I did not intend to offend her.</P>
      <P>I feel very strongly about this.  It is time we, as politicians, took a stand on it.  I am dismayed that the Government have not taken to their heels on this issue.  The sort of liberal strains expressed in the national media and other places would seem to extend to this House and to the other House.  The manipulation of the press personifies that and I am horrified that the Labour Party have not made a contribution on this because on matters of less relevance they make a hullabaloo around this House.  The first prerogative for an elected representative is self-respect. Consecutive Governments &mdash; maybe not deliberately and for reasons which may not have been apparent then but which are apparent today &mdash; have been transformed by the media to self-destruct. I appreciate what the Minister has said and we should strengthen his hand.  Without being political or trying to bring down the Government, or to do anything foolish, we should let the Minister know that at least the Seanad, if not the other House, felt deeply about this matter.  Because of that, we should have a vote on this.</P>

We are not the Holy Roman Catholic Church, perfection for all time.  We are made up of imperfect people and imperfect institutions.  My own attitude to the institutions of the State are similar to that of a former Deputy who supported the last Government of which the Minister was a member.  My support is qualified, critical and liable to be withdrawn at any time, and that is my attitude to institutions of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only am I responding to an invitation from Senator Killilea to respond to his observations, but from a conviction I have held for many years.  It is not right that Members of the Oireachtas should be excluded from participating as members of boards of various State or semi-State bodies.  I recall an occasion &mdash; I think Senator Killilea was a Member of the other House at the time &mdash; when I expressed views very similar to those that have been expressed by the Opposition this evening.  Senator McGuinness mentioned her experience in this area.  I almost had a similar experience.  I was an elected member of An Bord Bainne, one of the very few successful bodies dealing with agriculture over the years, and had I been successful in the first Dáil election for which I stood, I would automatically have had to surrender my seat on that board.</P>
      <P>In view of the sentiments expressed here tonight, I suggest there is ideal material for all sides of the House to debate a motion on the participation of Members of the Oireachtas on boards of semi-State bodies.  This could be discussed objectively and on its own merits. There is an element of gamesmanship &mdash; if Senator Killilea will excuse the term &mdash;&mdash;</P>

The reality of the situation is that Senator Killilea had ample opportunities over the years to implement the views he expressed here today.  I agree that Members of the Oireachtas should not be excluded and I am prepared to argue that in an atmosphere where the whole issue could be discussed objectively.  There may be an opportunity for the motion to be discussed here, which can be sponsored from both sides of the House.</P>

At the moment politicians are held in low esteem and that is unfortunate. <Col N="589" /> It is difficult to listen to a Member, who made a mockery of the Seanad by talking about Senators getting £750 a day, decrying others running down politicians. I, too, got a great deal of stick over that stupid comment, as did many other people here.  We must have some standards. If we are to have double standards, saying Senators are over-paid, how could one justify making a Senator a member of a board if he is getting £750 a day as a Senator?</P>

I also stand over the view that people should work in the House to which they are elected and their performance should be measured by the work they have done.  Any other yardstick of one's work is secondary, it is not relevant to the public's idea of what the Houses of the Oireachtas are about.  Therefore I make no apologies for what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever we as an institution may choose to do, we have no right to put into legislation something which suggests that we are inherently unfit for any area of responsibility.  That is a separate issue.  I have a commitment to make the Houses of the Oireachtas relevant to a lot of areas of society where they are entirely irrelevant, but that does not mean I am going to ignore them or that I am going to hamstring future generations with this sort of legislation.  There is no contradiction between anything I have said in the <Col N="590" /> past &mdash; which I stand over &mdash; and what I have said here.  They are simply two aspects of the same issue.</P>

I do not want to be associated with his remarks about a Senator receiving £750 a day.  A Senator's salary, as everybody knows, is only over £7,000.  A Senator's constituency work is different from coming here and punching in a few hours, as Senator Ryan may well have done.

I am also glad it is stated in section 39 (3) that the chief executive will be appointed by the board, and not by the Minister.  When the Bill says that the chief executive will be appointed by the board, does this mean that the selection process will be competitive?

I was not satisfied with the answer the Minister gave when he suggested that he was going to use an alternative use value as the valuation to be put on the land, and that this would be the criterion used by the Valuation Office in assessing the valuation.  Not alone will there be lands owned by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs transferred, but leases which have been taken out by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will have to be assigned to the new telecommunications board and An Post.  In relation to the letting of properties, what is the situation legally regarding the transfer of a lease from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to Bord Telecom or An Post?  It seems that in each case where you have an assignment of a lease, this lease will be assigned <Col N="592" /> not alone by the two boards but the lessor would have something to say in the matter, because he will be assigning a new lease.</P>

      <P>This section legislates for the transfer of all leases and ownerships from the Minister to the semi-State companies as if there had been no change.  That is literally what it does and it gives legal effect to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A property company is not going to assign a lease just because this Bill says that Bord Telecom or An Post will take over the responsibility.  If there is a change of responsibility from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, there has to be a re-assignment of the lease.  In a business situation, the owner of the property will consider the two boards as the new tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all right from the Minister's point of view.  The owners of the buildings now tenanted by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are going to look on both new boards as new tenants.  This section gives the Minister the right to assign the leases from the Department to the boards.  In effect, the Minister is changing the leases of premises from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the two boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does not give the Minister the power to assign.  It is legislating for the assignment.  It says:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="593" />&ldquo;All land vested in the Minister immediately before the vesting day and used partly in connection with functions assigned to one company and partly in connection with the functions assigned to the other company and all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with such land shall, ...without any conveyance or assignment, stand vested on the vesting day in the postal company...&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to continue with this point.  It is easy to assign lands which are owned by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the new boards, but throughout the country there are numerous buildings leased by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and there is no way the lessee can assign leases to new boards unless with the consent of the leasing landlords&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is one thing, but let us be fair, landlords at this stage have assigned leases to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It is only with the landlord's permission that a lease can be assigned to anybody else.</P>

      <P>I do not want to become involved in this, but we could be here all night because we are on two different wavelengths.  Senator Lanigan seems to be dealing with it as if somebody were going to lease something.  The Minister is explaining that he is transferring, more or less, the lease he already has and making it legal.  One of them will have to agree on something soon because there are two different points and it will go on all night.</P>

      <P>The final point on this. The landlord's rights are in no way affected.  Whatever rights he has <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Minister at the moment, he will have vis-á-vis the company.  It is just that the name of the lessee will have changed. The section gives that power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of what Senator Browne says&mdash;and we can be here all night&mdash;this Bill effectively takes away the right of a landlord to lease.  He makes an arrangement with a company and what we are doing here is taking away from him the rights of his own property.  The Minister in this Bill is setting up two separate companies, which is totally different from the situation in the past.  In doing so, he is telling the landlord that he has no rights in this and the Minister is just transferring the contract that he made with him to two separate companies.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to intervene in this, but I am inclined to feel, like Senator Browne, that if we do not do something sensible this will go on all night.  I do not like to disagree with Senator Lanigan.  However, what he is suggesting, in practice, is that because we are transferring the business of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to these two companies, many private landlords should be allowed to make a bonanza out of the transfer of the leases. That is what he is suggesting and there is no use in him shaking his head.  He is saying that because the Minister is simply allowing the leases to be changed into another name without the necessity for a conveyance or an assignment officially, we are taking away the rights of private property of the landlords.  If we are doing so, all I can say is let us go on doing so, I see no reason whatsoever why those persons who have negotiated leases with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; leases which no doubt are for a particular rent and for a particular term and which set out particular covenants and agreements &mdash; should suddenly be allowed to change their agreements simply because the Legislature sets up these companies and these companies need to become the people who are leasing those properties.  I find it very difficult to believe, in spite of recent judgments on the subject of rent control and so on, that the courts would uphold the idea that we must protect the rights of landlords to such an extent that they should be allowed to take advantage of a situation <Col N="596" /> like this by suddenly raising the rent or whatever it is, just because we are setting up these companies.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up all night, but I have a very strong viewpoint on it.  I did not suggest that there was going to be any raising of rents or any advantage taken by the landlords. We are taking away the landlord's rights to his own property.  If a landlord, with whatever size of property &mdash; and I have no interest in any property that the ESB or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have taken &mdash; makes an agreement with me as a tenant, I do not expect that, that tenancy will be assigned to somebody else.  No more do I see that why in this Bill the rights of the landlord who may have entered into an agreement with a customer, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, should be overruled by this section if he does not want to continue with the tenancy as agreed under the present arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I say finally that this could work two ways?  There may very well be landlords who would lose if we did not have this enactment.  Suppose the postal company and Bord Telecom decided that they did not want these leases that were not paying them, the landlord could lose.  The effect of this section is merely to transfer.  It does not add to the rights of landlords, or take away from them.  What it does is save a lot of time and many legal fees in going through each transaction one after another.  That is all it does.</P>

      <P>A chose-in-action is a <Col N="597" /> right to take legal action to collect a debt due or to obtain damages for injury done to one's property.  This is in line with other provisions in the Bill dealing with the transfer to the company of claims by or against the Minister, such as sections 42 and 47.  It is a standard feature of legislation transferring property to new bodies to refer specifically to chose-in-action as an item of personal property being transferred to them.  For example, this occurs in section 36 of the Health Act, 1970, and section 35 of the Gas Act, 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether this arises on section 42 but I will put it briefly to the Minister and perhaps he can tell me if it belongs to another section.  On the rights and liabilities with regard to the civil servants at present working in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, there is concern, I gather, among some employees of the Department concerning their rights under the Social Welfare Act.  Because they were civil servants up to now, their rights under the Social Welfare Act are somewhat curtailed and it will take them some time to build up the ordinary entitlement of private employees to such things as unemployment benefit and various other benefits that are concerned.  In the present situation if by any chance one of them became redundant &mdash; and there is provision made for their getting a redundancy payment &mdash; and then went to collect unemployment assistance which is means-tested, or any other benefit which is means-tested, the lump sum which they would receive for redundancy possibly would be counted as means in the assessment of their eligibility for this means-tested benefit.  I suggest that the Minister look at this situation to see if some kind of undertaking can be given that they be allowed to be in full benefit, as it were, <Col N="598" /> up to the time that they have built up the normal entitlement.</P>

      <P>A point comes to mind on subsection (2).  Take the point, in An Post, of the sub-post office people who are on contract to the Department.  I foresee a problem, on which the Minister should give a commitment, in the area of the smaller post offices which may not, in the view of the board, be viable any more.  Viability these days seems to be the key issue.  Those post offices by the decision of the board are going to be closed down.  Would the Minister envisage some protection in the contract signed with the sub-post office holders at the moment that this would not happen to them?  The contract is binding and in the transfer of the contract which we discussed a few moments ago, this would come under that heading, just as much as rents would.  I firmly believe that the Minister should and must give a commitment today to this House so that a guideline will be set for the board and the smaller post offices will be safe from the hands of the so-called viability-status-minded people.  These offices have a role to play and should not be closed down as we did with many of the railway stations in times gone by.  For example, if the Clifden to <Col N="599" /> Galway railway were running today, it would be our most viable carriageway, but it is not.  We have roads built on top of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, but the point I am making is that it is the same in sub-post offices.  There are many relevant matters, such as the small saver, for example, who would like the personal verification of the local sub-post master if he wants to invest money in the Post Office.  There is the delivery of telegrams, at times personal, private and confidential and often times very urgent, which must be made in the middle of the night or at other inconvenient times of the day. There are many relevant matters which apply to a sub-post office that viability would not come into.  As a service to the community, they are most viable and most necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister should here today state categorically that sub-post offices as they now stand shall remain.  It is up to the board to make them viable.  It is not up to themselves because they are prevented from becoming viable by the manner in which the Post Office runs them at the moment.  Rather than close them now, I suggest that we would look at them from another direction &mdash; instead of this viability clause being applied against them, that it be applied for them.  I suggest that the Minister should now make a commitment that many of those people who have given a tremendous personal service over the years will not now be in any danger from the clause of the contract and that this contract will transfer, as stated here on a previous section of the Bill when we were talking about the landlord's right. Those poor, misfortunate people who may not have a very viable post office should be protected, just as much as the landlord.</P>

Subsection (3) of section 16 says that &ldquo;The articles of association of the postal company shall provide that the company shall, in consultation and agreement with recognised unions and associations, set up a machinery for the purposes of negotiations concerning the remuneration and other contractual conditions of postmasters&rdquo;.  Section 42 transfers existing contractual obligations of the Minister to the new companies.  There is a section in the Bill later on, which was inserted at the suggestion of the Opposition in the Dáil dealing with the closure of sub-post offices because of changes in circumstances.  At the request of the Opposition, I will be deleting that section because it has been read the wrong way, as we thought it might be.  We will be coming to that later.</P>

      <P>This is a very important section of the Bill.  It deals with the security of tenure of the employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who will be transferred on vesting day to the two companies.  Firstly, I have paid more <Col N="602" /> attention by far to this than to any other section.  I have had very long discussions with many people on this &mdash; trade unions in particular &mdash; a number of Members of both Houses, especially Deputy O'Sullivan, but also Members of the Opposition and Members of my own and the Labour Party.  It is fair to say that there is broad agreement on both sides of both Houses that we should give the same security of tenure as at present exists and express that as clearly as possible.</P>
      <P>On the other hand the original request of some of the trade unions was effectively to retain civil service status, but that is simply incompatible with the central purpose of the Bill which is to transfer these two businesses out of the civil service environment and into a commercial environment.  Nonetheless, we felt that we could represent the same security of tenure in the section, so on Committee Stage in the Dáil I tabled an amendment which was a great improvement on the original section.  Following long discussion on it in the Dáil, I tabled further improving amendments on Report Stage and I indicated just before Report Stage was taken that I had been approached yet again on this section with further suggestions which I undertook to consider.  As a result of that consideration, I am proposing these two amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;; any alteration in the conditions in regard to tenure of office of any such member shall not be less favourable to him than the prevailing conditions in the civil service at the time of such alteration, save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union or staff association concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new section, if these two amendments are passed, will have quite a bit of repetition but I do not mind underlining and repeating three or four times, as we do in the proposed new section, the guarantees that my predecessor and I have given that the same security of tenure as they have today will accompany those who leave the civil service and join the semi-State companies on vesting day.  I <Col N="603" /> believe that the section as amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil adequately did that, but because of the worries and fears on Report Stage I brought in further improvements, or further repetition to underline that guarantee and I do so again.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading the entire section 45 cannot but be made aware of the intentions of Parliament in relation to security of tenure.  The guarantee is repeated, underlined and magnified, so that it is clear beyond any possible doubt.  I want to reiterate once again in this House and communicate through this House to all the employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs that their security of tenure is well and truly copperfastened. Indeed, I have been greatly encouraged by the response I have had from so many people and so many associations in the Department who have welcomed very much what we have tried to do in this section.</P>

This is the part where the great personal problems of security of tenure and security of work, which is just as important as everything else will be guaranteed to those people. On this issue the Minister has enlightened the House slightly by the addition of these two amendments and they are welcome. Those involved will welcome them, too, as a further explanation of what it is intended to do.</P>

    <P>There are a few problems which we must thrash out and clarify, arising in the transfer.  Firstly, in the very weakest section in the Department there are quite a number of temporary labourers who are not yet appointed to civil service status. They are the weakest section, one would suspect, of the entire work force of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Some are at present being interviewed to become officially appointed, but many have not been called yet.  I would like the Minister to clarify to all and sundry that those who have spent some time now in <Col N="604" /> employment and possibly some included in the alleged misdemeanours of recent times in the Minister's own constituency, will be given an assurance of employment also.  There are many more who are honourably employed &mdash; I am not saying that these are dishonourably employed &mdash; who have spent many years in the civil service and who have not yet been appointed.  They are the first people to whom we must turn our attention.  A guarantee must be given in this House by the Minister, either to the House or as a matter of instruction to Bord Telecom that their place of work is secure for them.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in paragraphs (a) and (b) what happens to the section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; a maligned section and one which has been maligned for many years &mdash; the telephonists?  The telephonists really belong to the section of the Department known as the Post Office.  They were always employed on that side, even though they were operating on the other side of the Department, the telecom side. I would be afraid that they would fall between the two stools.  We know for a fact that the Institute of Science and Technology said in their report of autumn 1981 that 3,000 surplus telephonists would be employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs by 1985.  I do not think we will have to reach 1985 to have that surplus.  I would like to know which board these people will be going to.  I would like to know if in the event of their jobs disappearing through new technology, is any training programme ready for them so that they may work in some other section of the present Department.  In 1981 I suggested that a training programme should begin immediately because we realised from day one that the surplus was going to be there.  On the completion of the retraining course there should be good employment for them.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, it should be clearly known that our telephonists, under very difficult circumstances, have given good service over the years.  This is despite the frustrations that we all may have sometimes when we ring 10 and get <Col N="605" /> no answer.  Do not believe that it is because the telephonists are sitting down doing nothing.  It is not.  It is because of lack of staff, bad switchboards and a whole series of things.  There is a whole series of technical reasons why there might not be an answer.  We should remember that.</P>
    <P>It is important from the point of view of the telephonists that the Minister should now clearly state what their position will be.  We are coming to the end of assurances, as one would put it, and very few opportunities are left to the Minister to make such a statement.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify the situation regarding the surplus telephonists. What does he propose to do with them; to which board is it proposed they be allocated, what will be their security of employment in some other field within the Department, or within a board and will a training course be made available? This is a matter which has been highlighted since 1978 and has been foremost in the minds of senior people and senior management in the Department.  If they are not going to have security then we would like to hear what alternative proposals the Minister has or does he intend to pay them compensation?  If he does intend to pay compensation will they be offered a choice?  They should be offered a choice.  The basis of the choice should be put down in black and white this evening. The opportunities for the Minister to do that are running out.  I would appreciate it if it could be done later this evening.</P>

      <P>This question arises not because of the new organisation but because of the automation programme, and there has been a great tendency to confuse the two things.  If there was never this Bill before the House and if we were to continue on with the Department we would have to face up to the question of what happens to all the operators we have in manual exchanges as those exchanges become automatic exchanges.  As the Senator is probably aware, there is already an agreement with the unions representing the telephone operators in relation to the security of their employment <Col N="606" /> or alternatively voluntary redundancy terms.  There are voluntary redundancy terms.</P>
      <P>Telephone operators will be assigned to Bord Telecom.  In the main they will work under the local postmaster, as they do at the moment, who will work for Bord Telecom in this instance on an agency basis.  Telephone operators will have the same security of tenure as any other category of staff entering the employment of the new companies.  They will be covered by the guarantee in section 45 (4) in the same way as anybody else and if it should be necessary to redeploy them in due course as the conversion programme proceeds they will, of course, have the protection of the other guarantees in regard to pay and conditions of service.</P>
      <P>Telephone operators are undoubtedly facing a time of change but as I said that is not the result of the proposed reorganisation of the service under this Bill.  It is the result of technological development. The same situation would arise where reorganisation would be carried out.  The various provisions in the Bill give telephonists the same comprehensive protection in regard to security of tenure and pay and conditions as well as all other transferred staff.  As I said before, there will be no compulsory redundancies. That is a guarantee that has been given and I am glad to repeat it now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister say that there will be no compulsory redundancies and to hear him going through the various ways in which he has attempted to deal with this major problem of security of tenure.  This is of the greatest importance to the employees of the Department and in particular to people working in the telephone service.  Perhaps one of the things that has made them feel particularly worried is precisely this element of technological change that the Minister has been referring to.  It is quite clear to them as it is to everybody else that as telephone technology advances there will be less demand for manual telephone operation.  In the past, my understanding is that when they brought up this matter <Col N="607" /> and there were agreements made about security of tenure they did in fact offer to be retrained for other kinds of jobs there.</P>
      <P>It is not that they are asking to stay on as manual telephone operators and saying, &ldquo;If we are not going to be used, we will have to sit around and be paid for doing nothing&rdquo;.  That is not their attitude and they are not so foolish as to think that that kind of thing could go on.  They are quite willing to co-operate in redeployment and retraining but what worries them is that perhaps the attitude in the past was inclined to be, &ldquo;No, you need not worry about this retraining and so on.  Do not worry, we will keep you on even if you have nothing to do&rdquo;, and they cannot see how a company in the more commercial environment of the new companies could possibly justify keeping on people with nothing to do.  Therefore they would welcome a reassurance that this kind of redeployment and retraining will be available to them rather than simply being made redundant.  I am very pleased that the Minister has gone to great trouble to try to deal with this situation of security of tenure.  I feel that he should in addition reassure them that the situation is that other jobs should be found for them if in fact the technological change he refers to means that their present jobs become non-existent.</P>

      <P>This section puts constraints on the two new companies which, commercially, would not be acceptable to any other type of company.  The constraints being placed on the two boards are that all the staff will be transferred without any loss of remuneration or without any loss of service.  We have 30,000 people being transferred here and it still does not place normal commercial constraints on the new company.  When the Minister says he is giving these civil servants security of tenure he is, equally, taking away from them their right to fight for jobs within their particular grades in the civil service.  He is giving them security of tenure but he is withdrawing from them the right they have at present to go for other jobs within the civil service. What will be the position regarding the <Col N="608" /> PAYE/PRSI situation where now they are under the lower PAYE/PRSI contributions system and equally are under the constraints that are on the public service as regards benefits?  Are they going to go into the new companies carrying forward the benefits that would normally have accrued to them by virtue of the length of time that they would have spent in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs?</P>

      <P>To deal first with Senator McGuinness's point.  She asked would we be guaranteeing alternative employment.  That is what security of tenure means.  If there is any disemployment of telephonists they will be offered alternative employment.  In relation to the point raised by Senator Lanigan, the same situation will pertain in the two companies as pertained in the ESB and RTE, and some other companies, where there was a transfer from the civil service into semi-State situations.  Where they will not be covered by the normal social insurance regime they will have their own particular regime similar to that in the civil service.  For instance, they will have a much better regime in relation to sick pay and non-contributory pension and that will all continue.  We are purely transferring out of the civil service into the semi-State company and transferring precisely the same benefits and conditions, etc.  There is no change.  This is already the position in the ESB and RTE and many other semi-State companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">

      <P>Without labouring the point, what the Minister is suggesting is that the benefits they will carry into these semi-State bodies will be the same as the benefits now being afforded to people in the other sectors, but the question that I asked originally was will they be able to compete for jobs within the civil service? This is a considerable right because if one is in a particular section of the civil service and one feels that one's talents could be better used in another section of the civil service it can happen now, but under the new regime it is not clear if this can happen.</P>

What Senator Lanigan said is true, that opportunities for transferring to other Departments could be cut off but it is also equally true that promotions into the Post Office from other Departments will be cut off.  It is a two-way process.  It is possible that they might lose out.  They are also going to lose in regard to competitions in other Departments.  It will work both ways.</P>

I am glad to clarify that point because Senators have been making comments throughout the day about politicians bringing each other down.

      <P>Under existing standards in the Department, after one year of successful job performance you are bound to give them full status and many of them have gone on two and three years.  That matter should be cleared up.  All those on that waiting list will have from now until January to clear up those matters.  The lower grades in the Department are very important people too.  They should be given total protection so that when they are being transferred they will have security of tenure too.  If it passes away now, people who have served for the last three or four years, many of whom are still awaiting to be appointed, can easily be told their employment is not legal.  Now is the time to do it.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give an assurance to the House that satisfaction will be rendered in this field and that all those who have given satisfactory employment for at least six months will find themselves ratified to full status.  Also, is the option being offered to many people in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who have been seconded from other Departments over the years, and who have given loyal and dedicated service for many years, to go semi-State, but still remain technically in the name of another Department?  Are they extended the right to transfer into the semi-State status if they so wish?</P>

      <P>In page 29, subsection (2), line 2, after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and nominated by Consumers Organisations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason we suggest this addendum is that we have certain consumer organisations who are very interested in the operation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and we feel that it should not be left totally to the Minister to appoint the members of the council.  If it is to be the Minister who appoints the members of the council, we should have representation from members of consumer groups who over the years have expressed on interest in this.  What has been said by them on many occasions has been taken into account by the Department of Posts <Col N="612" /> and Telegraphs in the operation of the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand and to a certain extent sympathise with the motivation underlying this amendment, I am afraid I am unable to accept it, essentially because it would be far too restrictive.  Following the basic model of the existing Post Office Users' Council, I would be concerned to ensure that membership of new statutory councils will be as broadly based as possible and will have a reasonable geographical spread.  Clearly, consumers' organisations would be an important category to be represented but I would also want to see the social partners and large users represented directly.</P>
      <P>On the matter of detail, which is nonetheless important, a statutory provision on these lines would create unnecessary practical difficulties which could hamper the establishment and effective operation of a statutory councils, in that it is not clear what &ldquo;consumers' organisations&rdquo; should take part in the nomination process envisaged in the amendment or on what criteria one could decide how representative a particular organisation might be or what weighting should be given to different organisations to nominate members.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that the basic function of each member of the Users' Councils' would be to work on behalf of all users of the postal and telecommunications services.  Any Minister will be concerned to ensure that users of the service will be well served.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend pressing this to a division.  The reason for the suggested change is that we feel the Seanad should take cognisance of the fact that we have organisations and individuals who over the past number of years have been involved in the debate on the running of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We had hoped that when the Minister was making his choice, he would take cognisance of the fact that the viewpoints of these people, whether they have been over-critical, critical, or selectively critical, should be taken into account.</P>

      <P>While I see the necessity for broad basing Users' Councils at the same time we must accept that the present Users' Council, no matter how worthy their membership may be, have not really been seen by the public as serving a tremendously useful purpose, or being very effective.  The public have probably seen themselves, in their justified or non-justified anger over some of the deficiencies of the telephone service, for instance, as being better represented by some of the consumer organisations that Senator Lanigan has referred to.  While I understand the Minister's point, that it would be unnecessarily restrictive to suggest that all members of Users' Councils should be nominated by consumer councils, I would ask the Minister that such members as are coming from consumer groups should be actually nominated by the consumer groups themselves, rather than simply appointed by the Minister.  While I am not saying that the present Minister necessarily would do so, this is something that will go on and on and whatever Minister happened to be in power could simply choose people from a consumer organisation who were not particularly vocal or particularly effective, to suit the purposes of the company, as it were.  I would be anxious, therefore to see the consumer councils having some voice in the actual appointment of members who represent them.</P>

      <P>If one looks back over the history of consumer councils and if one really looks at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, one will realise that the people who have done more to point out the problems are the elected Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Yet the people who have fought the case many <Col N="614" /> times, with frustration and difficulty, find themselves debarred from these councils under subsections (5) and (6).  This is where the Minister should consider the views of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They have a case for being members of these councils, but instead we find the Ministers debarring us from even the possibility of being selected by him for membership.</P>
      <P>I will say clearly and unequivocally that nobody knows more about the problems of the people in regard to telephones and the Post Office than public representatives. Here we are today, changing over to the board, taking away powers from the public representative because the Minister is handing over those powers. We are debarring ourselves from being selected, or being at the disposal of the Minister to select us to make the case of the public representative.  We are entitled to be eligible for these councils.  Honestly, Minister, you have taken the whole thing too far.  You have taken it completely and totally out of the hands of the public representatives who every day are mingling with the public; who understand the needs of the public; who are everyday listening to the frustrations of the public, and you are debarring them from offering themselves for selection to these important councils.  If the last Users' Council lacked bite it was because the work of the Users Council was done by public representatives.</P>
      <P>As a past junior Minister in that Department I know it because my hand used to be sore from signing letters in answer to representations made by public representatives.  I must say there were very few to the Users' Council.  I oppose subsections (5) and (6).  I ask the Minister to withdraw them so that all sections of the community will get fair play including the public representatives.</P>

I paid the money four months ago and it has not been put in yet&rdquo;.  The public representative comes up to Dublin and he writes a note to Bord Telecom Éireann.  If Bord Telecom Éireann are doing their job in accordance with what is laid down in the Bill they will write back and say that that is none of your business, Mr. Public Representative. That is now the business of Bord Telecom Éireann.  I am sure they will not be so discourteous, but if they wished they could be.</P>
      <P>Public representatives now find themselves with no forum in which to have constructive dialogue on such matters as the abuses or the errors that can sometimes be made in those organisations.  We are responsible for the financial affairs of the boards but if we make representations on behalf of constituents on a matter other than a financial one we will very quickly and abruptly receive back an answer telling us in nice, polite language that it is none of our business.

It is no excuse <Col N="616" /> to say &ldquo;What would the public think?&rdquo; What will the public think when they get a reply back saying: &ldquo;It is none of your business&rdquo;.  To whom are they to go?  Who will tell them the address, and telephone number of each member of the Users' Council?  There will only be 20 of them. If three or four places were reserved for public representatives other public representatives could drop them a note asking them to look after such and such a person because he was in a bad state.  The section should be changed so as to reserve at least five places on the Users' Council for public representatives.  In that way matters relevant to their constituencies could be looked after.  The point is that they are responsible to the people.  Contrary to what the Minister says, there must be a place for public representation and public representatives to make their case.  I do not see any place other than the Users' Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has been said by Senator Killilea.  There is one element in this section I disagree with totally.  It gives the Minister the right to establish the council in the first place and it then gives him the right to appoint the numbers &mdash; a minimum of ten and a maximum of 20 &mdash; and then it continues the situation whereby Members of the Oireachtas or people who are standing for Oireachtas membership cannot sit.  It gets down to the nitty-gritty in subsection (7) where it says that a council member may resign and on the date the Minister receives the resignation he shall no longer be deemed a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (8) it says a Minister may remove a member of a council from office.  The whole <i>rationale</i> of a users' council is to give to the user the right to have a say in the running of the Department and have an input into it.  I would have thought that if we are giving that right to a users' council there should be no ministerial responsibility for the removal of a person from that council. What we are doing then is giving a veto to the Minister on the operation of the council.  We will be dealing on section 49 with the operation of the council.  This item is on the setting up of the council. <Col N="617" /> There is nothing in this section more abhorrent than the fact that the Minister of the day can remove a member from that council.  It is implied that if somebody is critical of the operation of the Department or of the board, the Minister can eliminate that person.</P>

      <P>The provision in subsection (8) is a standard one.  If a Minister appoints a member to a board or a council he has the power to discharge or dismiss that person, if the circumstances warrant it.  It is something that happens very seldom. All Ministers have that power in relation to semi-State companies.  It is very rarely exercised.  Normally if it happens there are questions raised in both Houses.  It gives rise to debate in each House, which is a fairly effective sanction against unwarranted dismissal of members.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister suggest that people have not been thrown off boards and councils by Ministers and that it would not be the intention to throw anybody off.  We do not have to go too far from the timescale of today to discuss the elimination of members from boards of all descriptions by the present Government.  It is stated in this that the Minister must have the ultimate responsibility.  Let us be quite straight about it.  What is suggested there is that if one does not like somebody on the board or like what they are doing one can eliminate him.  It is not standard practice to suggest that because a Minister appoints somebody the Minister should have a right under a subsection of a Bill to remove him from office.</P>
      <P>I have the utmost respect for Ministers. I accept their responsibility, but sometimes their political responsibilities override their responsibilities to the boards over which they have control.  This Bill is not helped by that insertion.  Parliamentary draftsmen speak in archaic language generally, but there is nothing archaic about this language.  It is a straightforward suggestion that if one does not like somebody on a particular board or council, one just gets rid of him.</P>

      <P>Can I take the Minister away from the boards and bring him back to the reality of this situation?  We are not talking about a board.  Generally speaking a board is set up to run an organisation.  Here we have a safeguard so that the users will have an input into the operation of both boards.  This is totally different from the boards which the Minister has been talking about.  We are talking about Users' Councils.  The Users' Councils should be set up by the boards and not by the Minister.  If they were, the Minister would not have the authority which he has.  It is a weakness in the Bill to insert that provision.</P>

      <P>Let us suppose a member of the Users' Council got certain confidential information about Bord Telecom in order to assess a consumer complaint and then abused that confidential information and gave it to the news media to the detriment of the company.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 29, subsection (1), after paragraph (c), to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) to promote, by negotiation with the relevant Company, a code of practice governing the provision within the State by the Company of services under the powers conferred on it by section 63 or section 87 as the case may be and containing provisions relating to:</P>
      <P>(i)  the standard of service to be provided,</P>
      <P>(ii)  procedures for raising complaints and making inquiries, for their investigation where necessary and for resolving them, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  redress for complainants in the form of compensation for loss or injury and abatement or refund of <Col N="620" /> rental in appropriate cases where there has been a failure or interruption of service,</P>
    <P>(e) to ensure that the provisions of the code of practice are brought to the attention of users of the service,</P>
    <P>(f) to review from time to time the operation and effectiveness of the code of practice,</P>
    <P>(g) to establish a scheme of arbitration which shall be available in the case of a complaint which has not been resolved by the procedure laid down in the code of practice and in which the arbitrator's decision shall be binding on both parties but shall not diminish or remove any right of either party to bring an action in Court.  The conditions under which and the persons to whom the scheme shall be available shall be determined by the Council and, without prejudice to their general discretion in the matter, the Council may provide for:</P>
    <P>(i)  conciliation procedure prior to arbitration,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the payment of fees or deposits by applicants for arbitration, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  different conditions, fees or deposits, in respect of different types of applicant or different types of complaint.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be difficult for ordinary Members to follow the oratory of Senator Killilea in this kind of discussion, but in so far as I can, I want to put forward a very strong case for this amendment.  Late and all as it is in the proceedings, I hope the Minister will not mind me going into this at some length.  The reason I have tabled this amendment is basically because there is insufficient protection contained in this Bill for the consumers of the services to be provided by the two companies.</P>
    <P>It has been made clear by the Minister and everybody who has discussed the Bill that we are moving out of what is described as the civil service environment and moving into a kind of commercial environment.  As has already been pointed out by Senator Killilea, in the civil service environment consumers of <Col N="621" /> the services provided by the Department have the protection of the ultimate responsibility of the Minister to the Oireachtas.  They have the protection that individual public representatives can raise matters in connection with the Department's functions by way of Parliamentary Questions, Private Members' Motions, matters on the Adjournment, and by generally making approaches to the Minister.  They can get answers from him, whether through correspondence or through representations made in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is a certain protection for the consumer in the environment where the Minister is ultimately responsible for the service.</P>
    <P>In a normal commercial environment where companies are operating, the consumer is normally protected through the operation of the law.  The consumer whose rights are infringed or who is badly dealt with can sue the company involved. It is very noticeable that in recent years under various Governments we have gone to a lot of trouble to improve the position of the consumer <i>vis-a-vis</i> the person who is selling him a service.  We have brought in, for instance, the Consumer Information Act and the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act which greatly improved the previous situation of the consumer who was just protected by the 1893 Sale of Goods Act.  We have also established the position of the Director of Consumer Affairs and given him very considerable powers to deal with consumer complaints and injustices done to consumers.  We obviously recognise that consumers need protection and recognise that people who provide goods or services for consumers must have certain liabilities towards them.</P>
    <P>In sections 64 and 88 of the Bill we are specifically taking away that protection and leaving the companies with little if any liability to their consumers.  Yet these companies are basically monopolies and consumers cannot say, &ldquo;I'll go elsewhere for my service if you are not serving me properly&rdquo;.  Even where there is mention of the possibility of section 39 of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act applying to these companies, it is only said that it may apply in limited circumstances <Col N="622" /> if the Minister so orders, and there are other Ministers involved, and so on.  That section of the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 deals with the terms which must be implied into any contract.  These implied terms are things like that the supplier has the necessary skill to render the service, that he will supply the service with due skilled care and diligence, that where materials are used they will be sound and reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are required, that where goods are supplied under the contract they will be of merchantable quality within the meaning of section 14 (3) of the 1893 Sale of Goods Act.</P>
    <P>These are fairly obvious and minimal protections for the consumer.  Yet we are being told that perhaps, if several Ministers agree, the consumers of the services of these two companies will be given this sort of protection.  Unfortunately this section of the Bill was not discussed in the other House because there was a guillotine on the Bill.  There was no opportunity of discussing it on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I recognise that the Minister gave certain undertakings and amended section 49 to give him powers in relation to subsection (3) which helps the situation.  This does not go far enough.  I know that I am at liberty to say publicly that in bringing in this amendment I am acting on the advice of the Director of Consumer Affairs, after consultation with him.  He feels quite strongly about this and has been dealing with other consumer organisations and groups with the hope of improving protection for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Users' Council's duties and functions are set out in this section.  The council may well be of great benefit to consumers but there is very little guarantee that this will be the case because the council's powers are the rather vague ones that most of these kinds of councils have.  They can consider things, report on things, be advised or advise if they are asked, but they do not have very specific powers and rights <i>vis-a-vis</i> the companies. The council may well be able to contribute to overall questions of policy, development and so on but they will not <Col N="623" /> be all that powerful in dealing with the specific rights of consumers, consumer complaints and so on because they can simply advise, report and consider.</P>
    <P>As a result of this and because of the history of users' and consumer councils in the past which were part of various Government Departments, the role of these councils may well end up seeming very remote from the everyday concerns of the consumer which all of us, as public representatives, have to deal with &mdash; consumers who have a specific complaint or an immediate source of dissatisfaction with the service.  Whether they are right or wrong, they feel they have been hard done by.</P>
    <P>Any of us who has experience of public life must know that as regards the telephone service, the country is full of people who have specific complaints. Their point would not be met by a Users' Council which simply talks about policy and does not have any teeth in regard to the company when they are dealing with complaints.  I am sure the companies will try very hard to satisfy the consumers but they will not inspire any confidence if they are thought to be judge and jury in their own case, as it were.  Consumers will find it very difficult to accept the situation when the suppliers of the service seem to have exclusive powers to determine the rights and wrongs of any complaint and to be judge and jury in their own case.  There is no redress through the courts or through public representatives.</P>
    <P>It was because of that, that I put down this amendment suggesting two related ways of dealing with it.  First of all, the Users' Council should have a duty enjoined on it by the Minister to promote a proper code of practice in relation to standards of services and procedures for dealing with complaints, inquiries and redress where the company have been found to be at fault and so on.  They should be able to publicise these codes of practice so that consumers will know about them.  The Users' Council should also monitor and evaluate the workings of these codes of practice.</P>
    <P>However, the code of practice on its <Col N="624" /> own would not be sufficient.  It would be necessary also to add the other half of the amendment which states in paragraph (g) that a scheme of arbitration should be introduced.  The system of arbitration could be preceded by a conciliation procedure as there is in the Labour Court and other bodies.  When we have independent arbitration on a complaint, the decision of the arbitrator should be binding and the company should be bound by the decision.  The decisions should be published so that the public would know what was going on.  The result would be that the codes of practice would set out what consumers could expect by way of a standard of service, how they should go about making complaints and how the complaints should be dealt with by the companies and the circumstances in which the companies may be prepared to offer redress to aggrieved consumers. Therefore, the function of the Users' Council in this respect would be to develop the best possible codes of practice and monitor their effectiveness.  In addition to that, there must be referral to arbitration.  If we felt it was likely that this kind of system would mean there would be a great number of trivial complaints brought to arbitration we could, if we wished, impose a fee for bringing a matter to arbitration.  If the complaint was justified, then perhaps the fee could be repaid to the consumer.  It could work as a kind of deposit in order to prevent foolish use of an arbitration system.</P>
    <P>The fact that the arbitration existed together with the code of practice would mean that there would be a considerable incentive within the companies to deal properly with complaints.  They would know that if they failed to do so the arbitration sytem would be there waiting for them.  This is the importance of having the arbitration system.  It would ensure that companies dealt properly with complaints. They would have a certain liability towards the consumer, despite the fact that legal liability is being taken away by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Although at this point it would be impossible to estimate the cost of operating such an arbitration service, it need not necessarily be high.  The more effective <Col N="625" /> the codes of practice and the more effectively they affect the company, the smaller the number of complaints that would be referred to arbitration.  The important thing is that consumers would know what kind of treatment they could expect because of the codes of practice and, at the same time, they would have the ultimate possibility of referring their complaint to independent arbitration.</P>
    <P>This would be an effective system of dealing with the various complaints which would arise.  I have mentioned the fact that, in the recent past, there have been a great many complaints about the telephone service.  I do not intend to apportion blame for this.  We must be aware of public feeling about the way in which the telephone service works or does not work as the case may be.  If the companies are to operate effectively and are to be seen by the public to operate effectively there must be a real method with teeth for dealing with complaints &mdash; not simply writing to a Users' Council which deals with matters of policy, advises and makes recommendations. After all, the company can just turn around and say, &ldquo;Well, you have recommended or you have advised but we have not the slightest intention of taking any notice of you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the basic background against which I have proposed this amendment and I hope the Minister will be able to accept it even if not exactly in the form that I have put forward here but so that a system such as I have outlined would be set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted that when the existing <i>ad hoc</i> Users' Council was set up by my predecessor, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, it was quite an innovation.  It was then and remains the only Users' Council for any public utility. Here we are giving it statutory effect, and we are also extending it.  By way of amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil we widened the scope of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuinness referred to her discussions with the Director of Consumer Affairs, and we too had discussions with him.  We went into the ins and <Col N="626" /> outs of the sort of amendment now proposed. While undoubtedly it is well intentioned, it would be unwise at this stage to put provisions of such a detailed nature into the Bill.  We need to consider in a studied way and preferably after some experience of the operation of the statutory Users' Councils under the present provisions the most efficacious form of any further functions which might be assigned to the councils.  Another point is that it would be undesirable to specify functions in an over-detailed way in the Bill because such provisions could then only be changed by an amending Bill, even if mature consideration suggested that other provisions might deal with the matter better.</P>
    <P>Moreover, listening to Senator McGuinness putting her case, it seems to me that effectively she is suggesting the creation of another large bureaucracy.  I would be very slow to create another bureaucracy at a cost either to the taxpayer or the consumer, whose benefits may not be anything like its cost.  We have to weigh up all these things very carefully.  I would draw the attention of Senators to subsection (3) which was inserted in section 49 on the Dáil Report Stage, on my recommendation.  This enables me, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to make orders to confer additional functions on the Users' Councils in relation to protecting the interests of users of the services beyond the basic functions which are listed in subsection (1) which the councils will be starting with.  Subsection (3) provides the required flexibility to meet needs as they arise, particularly to enable developments in consumer protection generally to be applied.  I might add that the Bill is already setting a headline in the provisions for statutory Users' Councils, as the Department did in establishing the present non-statutory Post Office Users' Council.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that the prospective chairmen of the new boards of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann, that is the present chairmen of the Interim Boards, as well as the two chief executives, are particularly noted for the primacy which they accord in their business <Col N="627" /> philosophies to good consumer relations. I confidentially expect the new companies to respect this in their relationships with and responses to consumers. Regretfully, a Chathaoirligh, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The codes of practice should be defined clearly by the boards and stated to the public.  No matter what the Minister says, it is a fact of life that the greatest drag on a public representative over the past ten years was the amount of correspondence he had with his constituents concerning the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That is an undeniable fact.  Just because we appoint a board tomorrow morning all that will not vanish and everything will not become purified.  The water will not become clear.  For some time in the future tremendous problems will arise in different areas in the relationships between individuals and the boards.</P>
      <P>We had redress for those problems up to now.  In the other House a question could be asked and answered by the responsible Minister.  That is gone now. We are appointing those boards.  Responsibility must also be transferred from the public representative to the Users' Councils.  Somebody has to act as an intermediary to deal with the problems that will arise.  The Minister must acknowledge that fact.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator McGuinness on putting down this amendment.  It clarifies the situation in that it asks the board to set a code of ethics, to set a certain standard, to publicise that standard so that the public will know clearly what to expect from the board.  If the board are not doing their job, an intermediary is needed, such as a users' council, to act, as Senator McGuinness said as an intermediary in a personal problem between the board and a consumer.  Problems will arise.</P>
      <P>As public representatives we have thrown away all our authority.  We have handed it over to the boards of semi-State organisations.  This board will come back to this House only if they fail and they want more money, and the Minister knows that as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> The point has been made that we have one successful board, the board of Aer Rianta.  They do not appear before us. Nearly every other State board come here on an annual trip to collect whatever balances they need.  We all stand up like the learned, educated and elected sheep we are and deliver to them the taxpayers' money to squander for the next 12 months and then they will be back with another bill.  There is a lot of sense in what Senator McGuinness said.  There is a lot of reason in it.  If the Director of Consumer Affairs makes suggestions, it is only right and proper that they should be debated here.  We should have a code of practice and a standard.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a straight question about arbitration.  On 16 January next a person gets a telephone bill.  He says it is wrong.  He sends a note to Dublin.  If he is not satisfied with the reply where does he go?  He has not got his public representative any more.  We are to have 20 selected people on the Users' Councils. They will have to be exceptional people because they will be taking over a load of work which was done by public representatives. The Minister should reconsider Senator McGuinness' amendment because it clears the muddy waters in that they set codes of practice and standards by which the new boards will be judged.</P>
    <P>The Minister says they would cost money.  How much less will it cost public representatives not to have to write letters and make representations?  Did anybody ever estimate how much it cost Deputies and Senators to send letters and representations to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over the past four years to see if anything could be done to solve problems?  The Users' Councils should be broadened even further.</P>
    <P>The more I think about this the more logic there is in it.  We are not creating a vampire.  We will get good value for money.  There is no comparison when you take into account the number of secretaries employed to type all those letters, the number of people in the Department responding to them, the Ministers who are accused of not sending replies to representations made.  We all suffer the agony in our time.  I am sure the Minister <Col N="629" /> is suffering it today.  You would want to be a ventriloquist to survive in that Department at times.  Those problems will not vanish next January when responsibility will be transferred to the boards.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuinness has approached this logically and conclusively.  I am with her on this, and I hope she presses this amendment because it is the proper approach.  As she rightly says, the codes of practice should be defined clearly.  I do not see any reason why the Minister should not accept the amendment.  To say blatantly that it would cost too much does not hold water when you take into account the hidden cost over the years to public representatives in time and money and to the Department in dealing with those requests.  People were frustrated waiting for replies and in the Department there is a general choke-up in the whole system.  I hope Senator McGuinness presses this amendment.  She will have my total support and that of my party.</P>

      <P>On this section there are a number of problems that I see.  We get back to the original proposition that the Minister had to have a residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs after the two boards were set up.  Now we have the sham, as I see it, of the Users' Councils. Let us be quite specific.  A Users' Council is mentioned for each of the boards and on each of these Users' Councils there will be a minimum of ten or a maximum of 20 members.  The Minister will have the discretion to sack any member of these councils.  No specific jobs are being given to them.  The amendment put down by Senator McGuinness gives teeth to both boards.  We have had references to the Department of Finance, the Department of the Public Service and in this section to the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with amendment No. 5 and I am suggesting that the <Col N="630" /> Users' Council has no teeth.  The section provides that:</P>
      <P>the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the company concerned and any other Minister who appears to the Minister to be concerned, may confer on the Users' Council such additional functions in relation to protecting the interests of users...</P>
      <P>Not alone are we providing this residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs but the section provides that &ldquo;a Council may, with the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, employ advisers to assist the Council in its work.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a consumer protection group and consultation with Ministers. There is absolutely nothing in the Bill &mdash; apart from the amendment put down by Senator McGuinness &mdash; to give teeth to two Users' Councils.  Not alone are we giving extra powers to the Minister, but we are also providing in subsection (5) that the Minister &ldquo;may, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, employ advisers to assist the councils.  The further we get into this Bill the bigger the administrative monstrosity it becomes.</P>
      <P>We are supposed to be discussing the setting up of semi-State companies which are to be commercially viable.  We are putting on them constraints which are totally unviable commercially.  Unless we put into this Bill the protection for consumers proposed by Senator McGuinness, this whole section is a sham, a PR exercise by the Minister, with absolutely no power except the power to appoint advisers and give to the civil service controls over what are supposed to be commercially viable companies which they should not have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that I am so encouraged by Senator Killilea and Senator Lanigan, I feel even more inclined to press this amendment and to take it as far as I possibly can.  Just to reply to one or two of the points made by the Minister, as regards the setting up of Users' <Col N="631" /> Councils, and the fact that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are the first to do this, and this is the first Bill to set them up in semi-State bodies, I accept the virtue of all this.  I accept the congratulations of the Department to themselves for having done this.  I would say to the Minister that, just because he is good does not mean he cannot be better. If he is good enough to set up a Users' Council he could be better and set up a Users' Council which would actually work.</P>
      <P>The whole point of the amendment is that this should be a Users' Council which was not just a piece of windowdressing, but an actual effective watchdog for the consumer, the consumer who has no watchdog because of sections 64 and 88. The ordinary watchdog of the courts is taken away from the consumers by these sections and therefore they need someone else.  They have also lost the numerous watchdogs they had in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is the whole point of the amendment.  I do not think the amendment should necessarily be rejected because it is too detailed.  As I have said, the Minister could bring in a similar amendment himself which would be less detailed than the one I put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of my amendment were very carefully considered both by myself and by the Director of Consumer Affairs. These were the terms we felt were the correct ones to make the system work.  I accept the point the Minister made that if you put all these details into the Bill you would need amending legislation to change them.  Perhaps it would be possible to bring in these functions under subsection (3).  The trouble is that we have no guarantee that subsection (3) gives the Minister power to do things like this.  We have no real guarantee that this will actually happen.  Once we move into the situation envisaged by the Minister, where he says we should wait and see how the Users' Councils work, and so on, inertia then takes over and it is very difficult to make a change.  If we do not introduce it at the beginning, it will be much more difficult for those of us who want to introduce more consumer protection <Col N="632" /> to persuade whatever Minister is in power to bring it in at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise, as Senator Killilea has done, that the creation of these companies will not make all the consumer complaints in the area of the services provided by these two companies simply disappear by the wave of a wand.  The complaints will obviously go on, and we must provide not just a system which deals with them, but a system which is seen to deal with them.  I do not accept that it would necessarily be the creation of another large bureaucracy because, as I said earlier, the point in introducing the two things together, the code of practice and the arbitration, is that the fact that the arbitration exists as an ultimate deterrant, as it were, is much more likely to make the companies live up to the code of practice.</P>
    <P>I am not denying what the Minister said, that the people in charge of the companies at present are very orientated towards consumer protection.  I can never accept in the introduction of legislation this sort of argument <i>ad hominem</i>, where you say: &ldquo;Ah well, the particular person in charge is a grand fellow and therefore we should not mistrust him&rdquo;.  The present man may be a grand fellow, but we are legislating for 20, 30 or 50 years time, when that grand fellow will long ago have passed away and we may get a perfectly horrid fellow in his place who may not necessarily be directed towards consumer protection.</P>
    <P>It is like saying you can leave it all in trust to the bishop because the present bishop is a real nice fellow.  You just do not know that the next bishop will be the same class of person.  So I cannot accept that it is an answer to the amendment to say, &ldquo;Well, the present chief executives and the present chairmen are full of goodwill towards the consumer&rdquo;.  Perhaps by the time they have received the number of complaints public representatives normally receive about these kinds of services, their goodwill towards the consumer may become somewhat diluted, and they may actually begin to hate consumers after some time.  I do not think we can utterly rely on the continuation of their wonderful goodwill.  Again, as Senator <Col N="633" /> Killilea said, the present system whereby complaints are dealt with costs a great deal to the public and, even apart from the matters he has mentioned, if one looks at the Dáil Order Paper from time to time and adds up the very considerable cost of replying to the number of parliamentary questions on affairs to do with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs one sees that does away with quite a few pounds.  I understand the average cost of a reply to one parliamentary question runs into a couple of hundred pounds at least.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="634" /> have nothing further to add to what the Minister has said.  One has to be impressed by the strength of the argument made by Senator McGuinness, ably assisted by Senator Lanigan, and by my fellow constituency representative, Senator Killilea.  I advise Senator McGuinness not to pay full attention to what Senator Killilea said on this matter. Although he may be very genuine in his expression of his opinion, since he became a Senator the amount of correspondence he has had in this direction and the amount of effort he has put into it have been extremely large but, at the same time, I have lightened his load since I got the job myself.

    </Speaker>
    <P>After dealing with that elegant speech by Senator McGuinness on the amendment, which drew great attention from this side of the House, and we appreciate people coming in to support it, the Minister might realise that there is more to what we were saying than he thought. Before the next Stage consideration might be given to the many good strong and basically fundamental points made by many Senators.  It might also be appropriate if the Minister added part of the amendment to the Bill, taking into account the closeness of the vote.  That is the narrowest margin any vote on this Bill received in either House &mdash; a victory for the Government by one vote.  I do not say that to cause alarm but the seriousness of the situation must be taken into <Col N="636" /> account by those in authority and special consideration should be given to that amendment.  It would be wise for the Government to heed that amendment. Before the next Stage the Minister might give consideration to that point and the people who drafted the Bill may be able to produce a Government amendment based on Senator McGuinness's amendment. We will wait to see if the Government respond positively to that request.</P>

      <P>This section, and each of its subsections, takes away from the Users' Councils the reasons why they are being set up in the first place.  Subsection (2) says: &ldquo;The functions of a Users' Council shall not extend to the consideration of any matter concerning the services referred to in subsection (1) which relates to public order or security&rdquo;. Surely the Users' Council should have to take into account public order and security? This section takes from the Users' Council right along the line.  Because Senator McGuinness's amendment has not been accepted, section 48 and 49 are without teeth.  This sets up an administrative monstrosity where we have a council being set up for each board and the Minister shall be entitled to appoint advisers to each council.  The suggestion that the Minister should appoint advisers to the councils means the Minister will have a bigger input into the Users' Councils than was originally contemplated by the then Minister, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien. Whatever relevance the Users' Councils have, it has been taken away in subsection (11) which reads: &ldquo;Any difference between a company and its Users' Council as to the information to be furnished to the Council under this section shall, at the request of either party, be determined by the Minister whose decision shall be final&rdquo;.  Where are the teeth in this section for the Users' Council? Subsection (3) (a) reads: &ldquo;The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the company concerned and any other and any other Minister who appears to the Minister to be concerned, may confer on a Users' Council such additional functions in relation to protecting the interests <Col N="637" /> of users...&rdquo;.  There is a suggestion there that a conglomeration of Ministers will be giving consumers protection but there is no protection listed.  There is nothing mentioned in this section about the rights of the consumer in dispute with the board because he does not want to pay his bill.  He has no redress, and there is no redress being given to him under this section.  If you pay your bill the board will determine whether you have a valid point.  That is an outmoded type of business procedure.  Under normal circumstances if there is a disputed account, one pays the bill, but not the disputed amount.  Now we are asked to pay the disputed amount, and the Minister will determine whether it is valid.</P>
      <P>The Minister will set up the two councils and decide the remuneration for these councils.  He also provides advisers but in the long term, he can take away membership from any member of either council and, in the final analysis, if there is a difference the Minister makes the final decision.  This section does nothing to protect the consumers' interests.</P>

      <P>I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House as I have said most of what I had to say on the amendment.  I would re-emphasise that the very closeness of the vote on the amendment shows the importance of this issue in the minds of those who represent the public, and I would suggest to the Minister that at least he might undertake under subsection (3), which gives him powers to add additional functions to the Users' Councils, to set up some kind of system analogous to that suggested in the amendment which would provide real protection for consumers.  I agree with Senator Lanigan that this section, with-our any additional protection, leaves Users' Councils without teeth and that having taken away the liability of the company to consumers under sections 66 and 84, we are giving no protection in return.  I would ask the Minister to undertake to introduce some sort of system comparable to the one I have suggested, as he can do under subsection (3).</P>

      <P>I have a difficulty about this section dealing with the operation of the interim boards.  Subsection (4) reads:</P>
      <P>(4) (a) The Minister shall appoint to be a member of the Interim Postal Board&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the person who was appointed by him on the nomination of staff organisations as a member of the Interim Board for Posts (An Bord Poist) which was established by the Minister before the passing of this Act, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the postmaster who was appointed by him as a member of that Interim Board for Posts.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Minister shall appoint to be a member of the Interim Telecommunications Board each person who was appointed by him on the nomination of staff organisations as a member of the Interim Board for Telecommunications (An Bord Telecom) which was established by the Minister before the passing of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interim boards have done an enormous amount of preliminary work over the last two years.  The inference in this section is that only people appointed by the Minister on the nomination of staff organisations or the postmaster will be reappointed on the interim board to be set up prior to the vesting day.  This takes away total credibility from this section <Col N="639" /> because it does not give the people who are already members of the interim board the protection being afforded to certain people who will be re-appointed by the Minister.  I sincerely hope the Minister will consider the situation regarding the two interim boards and in deference to the fantastic preliminary work each member of the interim board has done, that they will be eligible for reappointment.</P>

It will not look fair if special consideration is given to the board because of the magnificent building that was built for them by the Department if their rates demand should be smaller than certain businesses around the city which do not have protection of the State but which are paying quite substantial rates for a smaller property to the Galway County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>This bears out the point I made today.  I asked the Minister of State with responsibility for RTE to explain the situation.  I believe the other Minister of State is responsible for kiosks and other things.  I make the point because I want to differentiate between the two Ministers of State.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, was not very clear.  We pressed him on the point of valuations.  Valuations are important because they mean money for the county councils, and we are coming to the balances of payments for properties to be valued by the Valuation Office.  It is important that we know about valuations. We will find out eventually bacause all we have to do is ask a question of our county council, but rather than do that, that information should be made available to us.  Heretofore the Valuation Office had been the arbiters in valuations set by county councils.  In this instance, they are going to be the actual bounty seekers.  If you are not satisfied, if the Department are not satisfied, or if Galway County Council are not satisfied with the application of the poor law valuation applied to the new building in Ballybrit, who is going to arbitrate?  Galway County Council will be demanding their pound of flesh.  They will be demanding and seeking an arbiter per valuation.  Everybody knows there is a valuation court, but these points should be written into this legislation because the hounddog could be biting at a different heel on the next occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be confusing the valuation of the properties, as quantified by the Valuation Office, with the rateable valuation.  All the properties are at present rateably valued and bounty <i>in lieu</i> of rates is paid to the same extent.  The amount due in rates by State companies will be equal in all respects to the money paid by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at the moment. Senator Killilea referred to the respective roles of my two Ministers of State.  He <Col N="642" /> mentioned that Deputy Donnellan was Minister of State for kiosks.</P>

Minister Donnellan is not allowed to go near RTE at all.  The Taoiseach was afraid that he might be interfering with section 31 as promised to a Sinn Féin member of the Galway County Council who only last week voted for his party again, abnormally on this occasion.  I often wonder if the Taoiseach is very happy with the performance of Minister Donnellan in that he has Sinn Féin, the Republican Party, allegedly behind him on all occasions in Galway County Council, as referred to last week in one of the Sunday papers. They are very peculiar bedfellows.  The significant difference is that my Taoiseach was not afraid to allow me to go near RTE, whereas the present Taoiseach is afraid to allow Minister Donnellan to go near RTE.</P>

      <P>I have considered these amendments very carefully. Indeed, the interim Postal Board and the unions were at one in seeking these amendments.  I have been unable to accept them.  The formulation of the exclusive privilege in terms of a weight criterion would certainly have advantages, for example, of simplicity and perhaps of ease of enforceablility, although the practical value of these could probably be exaggerated.  However, the difficulties raised by the proposal clearly outweigh at this point any benefits it may have.  The exclusive privilege or monopoly being granted to An Post under section 63 is no less and no more than the existing exclusive postal privilege of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under section 34 of the Post Office Act, 1908.</P>
      <P>In this, the Bill follows a general principle which was also followed in a number of other respects and which is a very good one, that is, the principle of &ldquo;no more and no less&rdquo;.  The amendment will cut across this in two ways.  Firstly, it would extend the monopoly to an area not at present covered by it and secondly, it would, in a different respect, restrict the monopoly in an area which is at present covered.  Both the extension and restriction would be objectionable.</P>
      <P>Parcels generally have not been regarded as being within the Minister's exclusive postal privilege.  The only parcels which will be within the exclusive privilege of An Post under the Bill are those which contain a communication. This is effectively a continuation of the present position under the 1908 Act.  The amendment would bring within the scope of the monopoly parcels up to half a kilogramme in weight.  While the proportion of parcels under this weight is small, the fact remains that other carriers, such as Córas Iompair Éireann and responsible courier firms, have legitimately carried such parcels up to this.  I do not believe that I should lightly or arbitrarily impose in this Bill such restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside parcels, the second undesirable consequence of the Senators' amendment would be that they would reduce the scope of the present ministerial monopoly in letters and other postal <Col N="645" /> packets by excluding items exceeding 500 grammes.  While again, the proportion of such items is very small, I confess that, in principle, I would very much dislike the idea of restricting the exclusive privilege in any way in the context of this legislation. I am committed to defending, rather than restricting the exclusive privilege of the postal service.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I appreciate the need for a clear statement of the exclusive privilege to be granted to An Post and I have given considerable thought to the matter at the request, as I said, of the interim board and the union.  I am satisfied that the formulation of section 63 is a significant improvement on the formulation of the existing postal monopoly of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. This improvement is achieved without affecting the scope of the monopoly as such.</P>
    <P>Section 63 grants an exclusive privilege to An Post in relation to postal packets &mdash; not letters, as heretofore &mdash; thus avoiding any problems, referred to by some Senators on Second Stage, caused by legal ambiguity in the definition of a letter.  The definition of a &ldquo;postal packet&rdquo; in the Post Office Act, 1908 &mdash; which for this purpose is carried forward by the present Bill &mdash; is that it is a letter, postcard, printed packet, pattern or sample packet and every packet or article transmissible by post.  Under subsection (7) the exclusive privilege does not extend to a newspaper or a parcel, unless a communication or, in the case of a newspaper, a communication not forming part of a newspaper, is contained in it.</P>
    <P>I have had to come down against this proposal for the very good reasons which I have outlined, but did so with regret, because I know that the suggestion was very well intended and had real, positive motivations.  I have asssured the interim board and I wish also to assure Senators, that in the unlikely event of the present formulation in section 63 giving rise to practical difficulties in implementation, which might be avoided by a revised formulation designed to be generally acceptable to the interests concerned, I would <Col N="646" /> certainly consider amending legislation in the future.</P>

      <P>The amendment was put in with the express hope that it would give greater protection to An Post.

      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan on that proposal.  The Minister has really put his finger on the issue.  This amendment has been rightly withdrawn, but highlights the problem at the same time.  This is a problem concerning the carriage of parcels for profit, or letters for profit, or all the words in the phraseology used by the Minister, many of which I used to use at one time, but which are gone out of my mind at the moment. He announced them there one after the other.  The tragedy of it is, of course, that there are many pirates on the scene, using inner city services and inter-city services around the country.  Something like the Minister's performance in another field regarding radio licences should be done between now and 1 January, before the vesting date comes, so that the board will have a clear run at the whole process. The Minister could give to the Minister of State, who seems not to have so much work to do in his Department, the task of clearing the road for An Bord Poist.  I am correct, Senator Browne.  That is the western Gaeltacht pronounciation, and Senator Browne as a teacher should know it too, but that is a reflection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for her latitude on the question. Something should be done between now and January in order to enable the interim board to operate in the meantime and the board after 1 January.  Pirates are absolutely unnecessary.  I do not see any reason, for example, why the board cannot operate an inner city service, morning and afternoon.  It is part and parcel of any programme that will have to come into operation.  We had envisaged this.  The inner city morning and evening delivery service must be implemented in order to bring the board up to its day-to-day required efficiency.  If the board are not capable of doing that, and the interim board must make the judgment on that <Col N="648" /> issue, then they should leave the service available now as it is.  However, in my opinion, the board are quite capable of doing it.</P>
      <P>The Department, the interim board and the board at a later stage, have to aim towards services like that.  I mentioned that this morning as not an unreasonable demand.  That is the type of outlook which the board must have.  In order to enable them to have that outlook, if it be their intention to do it, the decks should be cleared on this issue.  The matters relevant in the submitted amendments will then become irrelevant because they will be covered by the fact that the board are doing that job.  The Minister is quite right in that he should not preclude himself from doing anything by this amendment.  On the other hand, the balances on the other side of the scale must be arranged too, to be proper and thorough.  I would like to ask the Minister what his forecast in this field will be and how and when it will be implemented? Timely notice should be given to those operators who have given a service &mdash; a cheap service &mdash; over the last number of years in the inner city delivery of letters and postal packages up to the prescribed weights.  We should give them time to wind down and time for the interim board to wind up.  The people will thus be given an alternative service if not better than at least equal to that given up to then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one subsection which we must all welcome, subsection (5) which states that postal packets originating within the State shall not be taken or sent outside the State with a view to having the packet posted from outside the State to an address within the State for the purpose of evading the exclusive privilege of the company.  This is a subsection <Col N="649" /> to which we must all rigidly adhere.  I suggest to the Minister that he should keep a very close eye on this development, because it has been shown in the past 12 to 14 months that quite a number of people have brought post from inside the State to outside the State for posting because of a somewhat lower postal rate.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) states that a person who breaches the exclusive privilege should be liable for prosecution, being guilty of an offence.  I would like to know what type of offence is being committed.  What are the penalties going to be?  It seems that the penalties should be laid down in this subsection.  Maybe they are covered by some other subsection.  We should know under this subsection what the penalties will be for bringing post outside the State.</P>

      <P>In page 36, line 34, to delete &ldquo;not&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that postal packages or letters or parcels be delivered to the place to which they are addressed.  The Minister said this morning that with an office block arrangements would be made, but that is not what I was talking about.  There was a previous reference by another speaker this morning, with examples given, of procedures in the UK and Australia.  As far as I know the Australian system is such that they have post boxes at certain collection points and people may have to travel up to two and three miles to collect their post.  It is on this section that I wanted to get an assurance from the Minister that this was not going to happen in Ireland, especially as many parts of Ireland are so remote.  Having personal experience, I could see a position where the board would say that it is not financially viable in a certain number of areas to deliver post to the homes of the addresses.  I had not anything in mind about the cities because I was more interested in the remote parts of my own constituency and the constituency that I, as a postman, served down through the years.  I would like to know the Minister's view on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may be aware that at this moment there are pilot schemes going on in a number of parts of the country in conjunction with and in co-operation with the trade unions whereby post is being delivered to the entrance to an estate rather than all the way up through the estate.  The emphasis in this section should be given to the word &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Acceptable&rdquo; means acceptable to the consumer, acceptable to the trade unions.  In this day and age no company.  Government or Minister can act as if they were dictating without adequate consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Department always did this in the past. I do not see why the board should depart <Col N="651" /> from this in the future.  It may be acceptable in estates, but we also have the social aspect of it about which Senator Ferris was speaking this morning where very often a person only sees one or two people during the week, one of them being the postman and there are many of these in the remote parts of the country. This would be a very important consideration as far as I am concerned.  They are the people I am thinking about, the people who gave a life-long service to this country, the forgotten people, the old and the lonely people.  I would hate to think that we were handing over this power and this great service that we gave for 60 years, to a company which was just a money-making machine and to hell with the people.</P>

I can see difficulties arising.  I presume it would be postmasters who would deal with this matter in any local area and most postmasters are very reasonable people, but there may be a situation where a postmaster may not be a reasonable person.  In certain rural areas one can run into problems which could give rise to difficulties.  I would like to be assured by the Minister that &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; in this sense will mean consultation between all parties involved.</P>

      <P>I have already said that.  If you are living in the real world today, you cannot act arbitrarily.  No one acts arbitrarily and gets away with it, especially where trade unions are involved.  As I said, the emphasis should be on the word &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other thing I would like to say about this section is that times are changing, things are changing.  A lot of our deliveries in the country&mdash;as Senators will know&mdash;are becoming motorised deliveries.  It is often not as easy for a delivery to be made up a boreen when a car is involved, compared with a bicycle. If it suits everybody to change the mode of delivery and the point of delivery, <Col N="652" /> surely the possibility should be there to do that, especially if we can save money. Senator Cassidy was talking about a money-making machine.  I do not feel that anybody up to now has expressed worries about this being a money-making machine.  There have been many worries about whether it might lose money. I do not think it will lose money, but neither do I envisage it as a money-making machine.</P>

      <P>In page 36, line 45, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Bank Giro, my views on that matter are known to the Minister and to the House since the earlier part of the debate.  The hurtful part is the words used and the phraseology picked again by the Minister for the board.  It places upon them an immediate constraint that they have to go with&mdash;as I called it earlier in the day&mdash;a genuflected knee to the Minister for Finance to seek support.  Here again, it is not really to him that they should be going in this instance, but down to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank should make the decision and the Government should prepare the way for them to enable them to get into this market. I do not think pious platitudes are good enough for the board.  The situation should be made clear and the road prepared <Col N="653" /> for them.  The direction that the board are taking should be well known to the Central Bank and there should be no obstacles by 1 January, in the Central Bank or any other place&mdash;whether it is the Office of the Minister for Finance or any other place.  It is the job of the interim board, with the Minister now that the date has almost been set to work towards this goal.  It is essential, even at this late stage&mdash;perhaps late, but better late than never&mdash;that they move into this market place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to follow the points made by Senator Killilea, I feel that there is, within this section, an enormous element of possibility for the extending of services by the board.  The unfortunate situation at present is that partial banking services are being operated within the post offices, not full banking services. The board should move into this area.</P>
      <P>We have seen over the past number of years tremendous strides being made by the credit union movement throughout the country in the provision of virtually full banking services for the non-commercial sector of our population.  They are providing, from their own resources, tremendous benefits to people who would normally not have access to banking services.  We have seen the Trustee Savings Banks grow throughout the country.  The help being given to people of limited means by the Trustee Savings Banks is of enormous benefit.  The extension by the board into the full range of banking services would be something that the staff of the board would appreciate very much.  It would be an extension of a service to the public, capitalised by the public, and also of enormous benefit to the public.  Unfortunately, at present the Department of Posts and Telegraphs provide very limited banking services and also these banking services are provided in buildings which are not suitable for banking.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  Suppose the company in its commercial judgment found that this was going to be a loss-making operation.  I do <Col N="654" /> not think we should bind them to go into a business that they would commercially judge as imprudent.  I do not think that is likely because, as I said earlier today, I think this is a major area for expansion into the financial services.  It would be greatly aided by the improved Telecommunications Bill.  Senator Killilea mentioned computers earlier.  Computers are great if you have access to them.  With the improved telecommunications services, all post offices will have access to computers by telephone line and that is where the real potential for growth comes.  It must be optional: it must be left up to the company to decide whether it is prudent commercially or not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is now going to decide the future role of local authorities, the new powers to be given <Col N="656" /> to local authorities, and every other excuse one could think of to avoid having council elections next year.  The Tánaiste and his Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, have come up with this new idea that in order to avoid a shambles next year in local government elections we use this decoy.  We are to have a revamp of and a new powerful base for local government. Here, the Minister is cutting them all out.  Our Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has decided on this without the assistance of the Minister for Finance on this occasion, or the assistance of the Ministers for the Public Service or the Environment.  I thought he should have put in &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for the Environment&rdquo; because that has been the theme all day.  I feel the Minister is letting down the entire Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept our amendment because if we are going to play the game we must all play it and not just one half of us.  Otherwise someone will get caught in the sticks and I am sure the Tánaiste would not like to be the person caught, nor indeed his Minister of State, Deputy Quinn.  Our amendment would probably help him out in that it allows him out of the trap he has placed himself in.  He should accept it because it is genuine and tabled with sincerity.  I do not see how the local authorities are to get this huge injection, or revamp, which they are supposed to get over the winter, so as to avoid council elections next spring.</P>
    <P>Apart from the politics being played by the Government in this issue, the fact is that local authorities play a magnificent role and in acknowledgment they should at least be given, at the time of an election, freedom to give a letter to their constituents setting out their proposals. There are many people in these Houses who will have a very unfair advantage which they would be able to use.  I do not think it is yet agreed on that side to postpone it, but it is coming up.  The Minister should include local authority elections.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander.  It is hard to know who is the goose or who is the gander in this instance.  In order to give a happy balance all round I would assume that the <Col N="657" /> Minister would accept this amendment wholeheartedly and I would appreciate it if he would do it quickly in order to get the matter completed.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Killilea on this important amendment.  Most of us would not be here today were it not for the wisdom of the councillors of Ireland.  For that reason I feel I owe something to these councillors.  Although I not being one of them myself I can see that this gives an imbalance to a Member of the Oireachtas when he is going for council elections.  Councillors serve the people well.  They give of their time freely and get very little in return&mdash;a voluntary offering with very little thanks especially when it concerns politics.  They give their time not for only for one or two years but it seems, for five or seven year periods at a time.  This also throws light on the rumour that only rich men can become councillors any more.</P>

This amendment cuts out all the rumour and lies that if you have the talent and ability and your party wishes to put you forward you do not have to have a healthy cheque book to stand and you have as good a chance of becoming elected as your elected Oireachtas representative or as the man who has an enormous amount of money to put into a campaign.</P>

Some <Col N="658" /> members of these two parties have been here today and some of them have not, and I would like to hear their views on this sensitive issue.

      <P>I support Senators Killilea and Cassidy.  Regarding the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Quinn, I made a long contribution here last week to a Bill.  I read the report a while ago and the Minister did not even make reference to the fact that I was speaking.  I will deal with him again.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment to give members of local authorities the same concessions as other elected people.  They are equally as important as people of this House and of the other House and, indeed, of the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>Much as I sympathise with the amendment, what we are seeking to do is provide that those recoupments, which by law the Central Fund makes to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, will be made to An Post in the future.  Such matters as free postage at elections are decided on by the Minister for the Environment.  Should he introduce regulations extending free post to local authority elections then the section would be amended to meet points made by Senators.  I am very surprised that Senator Killilea did not refer to the fact that candidates for Seanad elections do not have free post except if they are lucky enough to run for the university panel.</P>

I do not accept the argument that we rely on the goodwill of the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for State, or any other Minister to give a facility which has parity across the board.  The local elections are fundamental and to bring in a sham proposal pretending that they were not is just another decoy.</P>
      <P>It is important that Senators on the other side of this House on this occasion make a positive contribution to this amendment, particularly those who were not given the sacrosanct lift of the masses on being elevated into this House and placed among the famous 11.  They will find a good bit of weight in this proposal and they will find it very difficult, either politically or in their hearts &mdash; I say it in that way because politically to politicians often comes before their hearts &mdash; if they do not contribute.  On this occasion, I am offering them both facilities.  We in this House can change the law and tell the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to include this amendment.  We would not have to depend on the good wishes or the goodwill of the Department of the Environment or the Minister.  We will have created the situation where those seeking election to local authorities will have it by the divine right of this House given to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on the issue of postage.</P>

      <P>In ascribing divine rights to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Senator Killilea is more than excelling himself in his magnificent contribution to this debate.  Many of us came from the nursery slopes of the local authorities and know full well that it is work which is given little or no remuneration. Local councillors, generally speaking, are out of pocket by virtue of the work they do on behalf of constituents in <Col N="660" /> pursuance of their political allegiance, careers and willingness to serve the community. This is not the area in which to pursue what is a very just claim.  Those of us who met local councillors very frequently within the last two years had the opportunity to discuss in a very heartfelt fashion how they felt about this particular situation.  This is not the Bill on which to raise this issue.  I ask the Minister to give his own personal feelings in this matter and whether he feels that any discussion with the Minister for the Environment along these lines recognising the just claims with members of local authorities would yield a fruitful dividend. It is long past the time when people who are involved in local councils and corporations should be expected, out of their own pocket, to finance their membership of a local authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister started his political career from the basis of Dublin Corporation. Living in Dublin city it is easy to have access to offices but those of us who live a distance of 40 or 50 miles from towns know the extent of expenditure that must be met out of the pocket of the local authority member.  Although the Minister and the Cathaoirleach may feel that this item is not specially relevant and it is straining credibility to include it under this section, nevertheless I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say on it.</P>
      <P>I am sure that there is not a Senator on any side of the House who does not feel strongly that this is a matter of justice and a matter of local democracy.  It is about the strength of local democracy. We must ensure that housewives who do not have a personal income and yet wish to make a contribution in the area of local authority are not prevented from taking their rightful place in the democratic system at the local authority level.  I am not sure that the amendment which you are espousing comes under the ambit of the Bill.</P>

His grasp of this Bill has equally been so.  What Senator Cassidy said about entering local authorities is quite correct.  Soon it will only be within the ambit of the rich to become members of local authorities because of all the meetings that have to be attended and because of the cost of postage and telephone bills.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the local authority in Kildare and we have free postage to a degree.  It is only for the secretary of the county council.  Local authorities need to be reviewed and restructured fundamentally. It is at that stage that these charges should be raised.  There would be agreement on all sides of the House that there should be a payment for county councillors and definite postage and telephone allocations.  As Senator Cassidy said, the burden on county councillors is so onerous that it could well preclude the ordinary working person from being a member of th county council.</P>

      <P>I join with other Senators in saying that local authority members should have the provision of free postage.  I do not think that the addition of these lines will take away from section 74.  That section does not enact anything. It suggests that a recoupment will be made for the loss of postage which it incurs by reason of any enactment providing for free postage in connection with any election.  If you leave &ldquo;with any election&rdquo; as the end of the sentence and then continue on &ldquo;that the company shall be entitled to be recouped out of central funds or the growing produce thereof for the loss of postage which is incurred by reason of any enactment providing for free postage in connection with any referendum&rdquo; and then a separate sentence stating: &ldquo;the company shall be entitled to any petition or address to the President, the Government or either House of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, the suggestion at present is that the Department are entitled to be recouped for postage in connection with elections to the Oireachtas, referenda or petitions.  As the Minister pointed out, the position is that people who want to run for the Seanad on the normal panels do not have the facility of free postage <Col N="662" /> but if one runs for the Seanad on the university panel one has the facility of free postage, which seems to be a ludicrous situation.  It would seem that people who run for the Seanad on university panels <i>per se</i> are better off than people who run for the Seanad under the normal panel system.</P>

      <P>I started my own own career in a local authority.  Some Senators referred to Dublin as being easier to represent than the country.  Throughout the country, local authority areas form part of constituencies.  I had a situation where my Dáil constitutency was part of my local council area.  My local council area was bigger.  One can imagine the problem of trying to communicate with constituents in such a big local authority area where there were 58,000 people.  I am very sympathetic to the points Senators have made.  A review of the facilities available to councillors and local representatives is long overdue.  I will put it to the Minister for the Environment.  A provision of this kind would rightly belong to legislation promoted by the Minister for the Environment dealing with local government and if that was introduced this section would automatically cover the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 40, subsection (1), line 23, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to make a contribution regarding the licence fees and their collection.  RTE have given a magnificant service over the last number of years.  For the last ten years the problem of collecting television licence fees seems to be getting worse. RTE say there are 150,000 unlicensed sets.  That is a scandalous number to have outstanding.  If we believe them when they say that the Post Office is not responsible for not collecting these unpaid licences, that is even a greater disgrace. They also claim there is around £8 million uncollected in television licence fees. They need this money badly in the light of competition from BBC, UTV and satellite television.  The Minister should look seriously at the system.  It is not effective.  I am not blaming the clerks of the Post Office because it is the system that is wrong.  If that money was collected we would not need an increase in television licence fees for the next two years. That money would enable RTE to keep up the standard that they have been giving. The big danger at the moment with three radio stations and two television channels is that we will have a shorter viewing time and a shorter listening time. It is very late in the night and I will go on about it.  The reality of it is that something will have to be done.  Is a computer system used for collecting television licences? I understand that RTE have a computer system out there with space available and perhaps the Post Office and the station could together collect these licences in a more efficient manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very interesting contribution by Senator Cassidy. He has spoken completely against the amendment moved in his name.  He is <Col N="664" /> asking us to change from &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;&mdash;the present situation &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be the situation rather than &ldquo;may be&rdquo; the situation.  I do not envisage any change in the situation.  We have a few hundred employees engaged on the collection of television licence fees.  I envisage that is how it will continue.  There have been difficulties.  It has not been as effective as it might have.  I should say that it has little to do with those employees concerned.</P>
      <P>This year we are having two campaigns. One was held in April and was very successful.  There will be another campaign later in the year.  There will be a lot of advertising and seeking out of people who have not paid their licence fees, otherwise known as TV spongers. We are also in the process of computerising TV licence records which will greatly facilitate the checking of households which have not got TV licences.  It will, of course, release many people behind desks and get them out in the field to check these things.  It is much better that we should leave it at &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On subsection (2) regarding information concerning transactions in television sets supplied to the Minister by television dealers under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1972, according to the electrical dealers' association at least 15 per cent of the sets that are sold in this country are coming across the Border. There is no control over the sale of these sets and, therefore, no information is passed to the Department about them.</P>
      <P>The advertising on radio, television and in the newspapers regarding the collection of TV licence fees seems to be a terrible waste.  It should not be beyond the technical staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as presently appointed, or Bord Telecom when it is constituted, to instal a computer signal into each set.  The signal could be transferred to a computer terminal in RTE and it would be virtually impossible for anybody to get away with not paying the fee.</P>

      <P>We discussed the problem of 3,000 surplus telephonists.  Here is an <Col N="665" /> area where after a training course, a positive contribution could be made by some of them.  In rural parts they would have a local knowledge and matters could he dealt with discreetly.  There are certain aspects of Irish life that no computer can cope with.  The human touch can.  Here is an area to which the Minister should give attention.</P>
      <P>I do not see any reason to go outside the scope of the section slightly, why in the future the compilation of the Yellow Pages should necessarily be handed over to private enterprise.  Some of the 3,000 surplus staff could be involved in this area as well.  I asked a question on an earlier section about whether it had been decided clearly and emphatically where the telephonists were going and I was told clearly that they are going to Bord Telecom.  I am not sure about the wisdom of that.  Somehow we are hiring out the services of the postmaster and perhaps we might be able to hire back the services of the surplus staff on the telephonist side.</P>

In a report issued by the Institute of Science and Technology in the autumn of 1981 it was clearly and emphatically stated that we would have 3,000 surplus telephonists by 1985. I do not know what the net figure will be at the end of the day, but I would say that the gross figure of 3,000 is not too far out.  Does anybody know what the figure is?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably more right than RTE.  A figure of 6, 7 or 8 per cent is probably a better figure than giving multitudes of noughts, as RTE are quite capable of doing.  We have the odd spasms starting in the morning at 10 o'clock usually.  We have this big spin-off rolling round for about an hour, and in another hour we get another set of figures. It is all feathering the nest.  I accept the Minister's figures of 6 or 8 per cent. At the end of the day no matter what the Department spend on advertising, there are that 5 per cent who will never pay their licence fees.  It may not be as urbanised as one would think.  There could be a rural implication in it too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister about his own constituency because I remember when the figures came out first in 1979 the first question I asked was how my constituency was doing.  It would not be long until the information would be leaked and a question would be asked in the Dáil about television licences.  Then a supplementry would be asked and you would be embarrassed to death.  I would hate to see the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs being embarrassed in any way.  I wanted to prepare him in case somebody in the other House might ask him a question and he might be embarrassed about the figure in Dublin South-West.  I know he feels those things deeply.  It would be a great personal load on his shoulders to think that his constituency would show such a low degree or such a high degree, whichever way you look at it, of nonpayment of their television licences.  I am sure somebody will ask him some day and <Col N="668" /> I will congratulate him if that figure is not the opposite of what I think it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the technology available whereby monitoring can take place from within RTE of the number of sets and where they are?  Because the way television sets are set up at present, certain sets sold within this country automatically go to RTE when they are turned on and certain sets automatically go to UTV or BBC.  This situation was brought to public notice recently in the controversy between &ldquo;TV-AM&rdquo; and &ldquo;Breakfast TV&rdquo;.  One of the reasons the BBC seemed to have a huge number of viewers as against ITV was that automatically when somebody pressed the button in the morning they got BBC1.  Now they have changed the system.  Immediately on changing the system of assessing viewers, the ITV audience jumped by about 200,000 viewers.  I do not think any more people are looking at it.  It is just that there is a different means of assessment.</P>

It is a telecommunications service&mdash; system in operation in our county and mostly throughout the west of Ireland for the reception of the multi-channel services.

We should legalise it, and stop this nonsense that there are alternative systems.  We are not rebroadcasting. We can put out only what comes in. We cannot change it.  There is no way you can twist it or turn it.  The ordinary simple people wish to have a choice, and it is a fundamental right to have a choice.

      <P>The Senator is talking about deflectors, a number of which were in the west.  I will be bringing in broadcasting and wireless telegraphy legislation. That would be an opportune time to consider it.  This does not deal with broadcasting or television.  It simply deals with telephonic communications.</P>

I do not think we have to bring in new legislation under the Wireless Telegraphy Act.  That is where we are going wrong.  We are complicating the <Col N="671" /> matter.  It should be simplified.  If you make a telephone call to Bangkok how does the signal reach Bangkok?  The signal is taken from the air and rebroadcast to my area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make this point since the Minister has been making the point that there is a difference between telecommunications and the provision of signals for television?  This section states that after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, the Minister may make regulations requiring persons engaged in the provision of housing and industrial estates and other building developments to provide such facilities as would enable telecommunications services to be provided in those buildings in the most expeditious and efficient manner. In quite a number of areas we have cable television.  In other areas there are applications for the licensing of cable television systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of the fact that there maybe remote areas in Senator Killilea's constituency where it might not be possible to get cable television, provision should be made for the telecommunications network and cabling should be provided for cable television in the near future.  With the development of the television service and the development of computer services, it is essential that we have this type of cabling installed as part of the overall development of housing estates.  Certain people will be using television as an educational process.  People will be using their television set as a video unit for communication in the educational field and in the computer field. Irrespective of the fact that the Minister has stated that we are dealing with telecommunications only on this section, the line between telecommunications and the provision of television cables is a very <Col N="672" /> narrow one and this section should include that provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that fact too.  We are talking about urban areas and the built up areas.  It is a further facility which should be included.  If we are talking about Councillor Ó Riain in the mountains in north Waterford and the problem he has in trying to receive a signal from RTE 1 or 2&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he?  The problem is that we differentiate on phraseology.  The masts have been erected.  Does the Minister realise the amount of services those masts could carry?  Can this House imagine the amount of services those masts could carry for the people of the whole of the island?  Instead of hiding our deflectors in concrete cells on the top of mountains, we should be proud of them and hang them on the mast and control them, and give them to people who have no alternative service.  I am talking about the utilisation of what we have paid for expensively.  It is nonsense to be hiding behind technical phrasology about rebroadcasting. Let us broaden our horizons.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan made a very important point about educational programmes. Take, for example, the open univerisity programme.  It is not fair that it should be available to the east coast and not be available to the west coast, south coast or parts of the north coast. We should have an equal right to recieve it by one device or another as long as it comes in via telecommunications.  I agree with Senator Lanigan.  If the facility can be made better in the urban areas, then let us make it better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the rural areas where there is no alternative, our magnificent monuments standing beside every new building should be utilised.  They were put up at an enormous cost.  They did not go up for nothing.  We should give the authority to the new board to do this.  Forget the nonsense about RTE being protected. RTE are not protected in this city.  Are <Col N="673" /> they protected where the density of population is along the east coast?  All have their rights there.  We should be legislating to utilise the facilities we are making available at great expense.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with much of what the Senator has said, but it does not arise on this Bill.  We will be introducing two Bills later in the year dealing with broadcasting and wireless telegraphy.  I will bear in mind the points raised by Saenator Kilillea and Senator Lanigan.</P>

      <P>The provision of banking services within the whole area of An Post must be looked at very carefully by the Minister.  There is an area here which needs to be developed.  The small saver has used this facility over a number of years.  We should extend into the bank Giro system.  We should extend into small loans.  We should allow this Post Office Savings Bank to be enlarged into a body which could issue cheques.  We should allow it be an addendum to the excellent services which are being provided in the small saving and lending schemes of the credit unions and the Trustee Savings Banks.  If we put the bank of An Post into a separate building with reasonable banking facilities, there would be tremendous opportunities available to the board.  There is a great need at present tor the provision of extra facilities for the small saver and for the small borrower. We should not allow this opportunity to pass without making proper facilities available for a banking system within An Post.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree totally with what Senator Lanigan said in relation to the <Col N="674" /> banking system.  There is immense opportunity available there for the small saver, and that is the person we are talking about.  There is a facility within the Post Office.  It is open six days a week and it is open between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. The county councils give loans to small borrowers hoping to build their houses and then they find they have to go to a commercial bank in order to get bridging loans.  Civil servants and gardaí have to go to the commercial banks to cash their cheques.  There is a tremendous potential here for a bank for the small saver and the ordinary person.  It has been overlooked for too long.  The opportunity is there now and the good will is there.  The services are definitely there and the people are there to man the services. There is a tremendous potential for the banking system in this Bill and it should be utilised thoroughly.</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the Savings Act, 1861, prohibits persons employed on savings bank duties from disclosing information about transactions to anyone other than properly authorised officers of the Minister.  This currently includes the <Col N="675" /> departmental investigation personnel and garda officers who are known to the Department to assist in investigating irregularities.  The same situation may not obtain when An Post takes over.  This section is designed to ensure that information about post office savings bank deposits may continue to be disclosed to the appropriate authorities in connection with the detection of offences.</P>

      <P>I regret the late hour of the night, but because of the fact that the other House is rising at the end of the week we had to complete this Bill tonight.  Our suggestions were made sincerely and positively, with good will and good wishes, and a desire that the proposed new boards will be what we hope they will be, a very favourable addition to the society we live in.  We made suggestions on certain sections which the Minister could not accept although in his <Col N="676" /> heart I think he believed in them.  I would like a comment on them from him.  It is important that the wish and the will of the House should be expressed.  I believe the line we were pursuing was the correct one.  It is sad that the Minister did not have more time to adapt to our attitude of mind.</P>
      <P>This is an opportune time to thank the workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who have given such tremendous service over the years for that service.  Despite what many critics might say, they have given a tremendous service in the field.  They are some of the finest people in the public service whohave dedicated their lives to the Department and who gave freely to this State.  Many of them will be making their abilities available to both boards.  We wish them well in that new project and we also wish the boards well.  I sincerely hope they have a great success.  I trust they will bring to fruition a great national and natural potential.  I wish both the staff and the new boards well.  I hope the staff who are daring enough to move with the boards will ensure that the boards become strong, powerful, forward looking and profit making which is most essential today.</P>

      <P>In view of Senator Killilea's complimentary remarks I want to compliment him and the Opposition side on more than 13 hours of debate. The Minister has taken on board many of the comments made.  I compliment the Minister on making many amendments with which the workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were associated. It is essential that the Minister has this Bill back in the other House by tomorrow.  He accepted amendments in this House.  With his voting power he could have insisted on the Bill remaining as it was.  He recognised the input from this House and accepted amendments which were to the betterment of the Bill. The contribution of Senators on the other side of the House is to be commended. Senator Killilea spoke with authority and experience in this field.  On this side of the House we enjoyed his contributions. <Col N="677" /> He had a great deal to offer on this legislation. The Minister has taken most of the comments on board and the workers involved will certainly appreciate input from both sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senators for the contributions they made from both sides of the House.  I very much agree with what Senator Ferris said about Senator Killilea's contributions.  I want to thank all Senators.  Even though the debate was long, I enjoyed it very much and welcomed it.</P>
      <P>I believe that in enacting this legislation we are taking a very major step indeed.  Half the civil servants involved will leave the Civil Service and go out into the commercial world.  These decisions, of course, were taken some time ago.  They were courageous decisions and right decisions.  Like any courageous decisions there are attendant risks, and there is no guarantee of automatic success. There is an overwhelming probability of success.  That will be all the more assured if there is the fullest determination and the fullest co-operation on the part of all the personnel involved.  If that determination is there and if that co-operation is there, the public, whom the services are there to serve, will benefit. The workforce will benefit, and the Exchequer will benefit.  That is the likely outcome.  Potentially there is a very bright future for both services.</P>
      <P>I introduced over 150 amendments to the original Bill which was introduced in the last Dáil by my predecessor.  Deputy John Wilson who indicated on Second Stage that he would introduce a number of amendments.  I have taken on board those amendments.  In the Dáil, on Committee Stage, I accepted quite a number of suggestions and amendments from the Opposition.  This Bill is very much a product of both sides of the House.  The debate in both Houses has been excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because I believe so much work has gone into this in the past I want to pay tribute to my predecessors, starting with Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, and then on <Col N="678" /> to Deputy Faulkner, who really instigated the Dargan Review and a number of other things besides, and also appointed the two excellent boards we have.  They are certainly model boards in my view.  I want to pay tribute to Deputy Reynolds and Senator Killilea who as Minister of State did an excellent job and continued the good work.  He took the important step of setting up Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited. Also, I include my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Cooney, and Deputy Wilson who was my immediate predecessor.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, an enormous amount of work has been done by the staff of the Department, as Senator Killilea will know.  This is a very big Bill with a huge number of amendments.  The work put in by officials in my Department not only in terms of long hours, but also in dedication, commitment and a desire to be positive has greatly impressed me. They deserve the thanks of both Houses.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the staff of the Department who will be affected by this re-organisation, that I thank them for the constructive way in which they approached us on the sort of amendments they proposed and I wish them and the boards and the chief executives every good luck and every success in the future. That success is very likely and very probable given co-operation all round.</P>
