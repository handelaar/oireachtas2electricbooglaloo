There is a possibility of additional business of public importance coming to the House during the day which would involve the circulation of a supplementary Order Paper and the House taking that business immediately. I hope to announce details of the timetable before we break for lunch which I propose would be from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.  I would anticipate that we would be able to conclude all business, including supplementary business, by not later than 10 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his Second Stage speech mentioned the fact that recommendations of the National Economic and Social Council on tourism policy, published in December 1980, suggest that future policy should concentrate on stimulating the upgrading of accommodation outside the hotel sector.  It is quite obvious that this has been done and we have seen a huge increase in the number of self-catering cottages and camping parks throughout the country.  Nevertheless, it must be stated that this increase which was recommended has possibly grown a little too fast and we now have a situation where the demand for this type of accommodation is not living up to the greater numbers.  We have seen companies which went into self-catering &mdash; very good development of the thatched-cottage type &mdash; now have very serious financial problems.  We should now be making certain that rather than giving grants to developments such as this any moneys that are available in the short-term, will be used to upgrade the stock of tourist accommodation that we have, whether in the self-catering sector or in the hotel sector.  This would seem to me to be the proper line to be taking at this moment. I would ask the Minister to have a look at this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Senator that his sentiments are in keeping with the Government's outlook.  Pending a complete assessment, which will be ready shortly, of the anticipated tourist requirements in the next five years, no moneys will be involved in any new development. The main concentration of any moneys that are available will be on upgrading the existing structures so as to make the <Col N="97" /> industry more competitive and more tourist-worthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that the money should be spent on renovation and improvement of hotel accommodation. The existing facilities have proved quite adequate in terms of accommodation and there has been a tremendous emphasis on hygiene measures and on fire safety precautions in hotels.  At this stage we might pay a tribute to the fire officers and to the health boards who have co-operated in great detail in this respect especially in the last number of years.  They have updated the regulations and are ensuring that they are complied with.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on Second Stage the problem regarding hotels.  Hotel accommodation is not being utilised to the full by tourists.  This is because of the crippling VAT impositions.  While a gesture was made in the last budget to alleviate the problem, in many ways this proved counter-productive.  I refer to the holding of the 18 per cent VAT rate in respect of bed accommodation while at all other levels in the industry the VAT rate is 23 per cent.  The amount of work entailed in book-keeping and the fall-off in bookings has rendered this concession almost useless.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister once again to try to impress on the Minister for Finance the importance of the hotel industry, what it means to this country and how effective it is with regard to job creation. The spin-off industries from the hotel industry from tourism are enormous.  It is a self-made provider of jobs.  Each tourist who comes into this country tends to provide jobs for our people.  That is what it is all about, and I am sure that is what the Minister has in mind in introducing this Bill, which we all welcome very much.  I welcome the Minister's approach and the whole concept and idea of tourism.  I specifically welcome his approach to the development of facilities of non-accommodation areas and particularly his interest in the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should re-emphasise the importance of the fishing industry and hope <Col N="98" /> that areas that have been neglected in terms of publicity, especially areas in the midlands, will attract the attention of the tourist board.  I mention areas like north Meath where there are historic areas which are not even listed on CIE tour guides.  Lough Sheelin which is perhaps one of the best trout-fishing lakes in Europe deteriorated slightly in the last ten years but I am glad to say that the measures taken to deal with the problem have been successful.  This year was very good from the point of view of fishing in the lake.  There are many places in north Meath which could be given more attention and be made even more attractive than they are.  We need publicity.  We need the accommodation and we need incentive.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to carry forward his views on matters I mentioned in this House previously with regard to the other aspects of the tourist industry such as the propagation of our culture and our heritage, our games, our music and our dancing and to give as much support as is possible to organisations such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who are promoting our culture and are a tremendous attraction to the tourist industry not alone in this country but by way of sending out groups abroad to let others know what Ireland is like, to let them know that they are not coming into an environment which is different from their own. I appreciate the Minister's interest in this regard.  I wish him well and hope he will have many years in office in which to bring his ideas to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the points made by Senator Lynch.  Section 2 is one of the most important sections of the Bill in that it increases the grant assistance which can be made available to the board for tourist amenities other than accommodation.  I would like to know what precisely the Minister has in mind.  Coming from a constituency where tourism is extremely important I have certain ideas.  Last year Ireland West Tourism in the Mayo-Galway region succeeded in bringing in revenue of the order of £80 million.  That represented a substantial increase and they deserve to be <Col N="99" /> congratulated on it.  There are areas where grant assistance available under this section could be constructively spent. We have facilities and amenities to attract tourists, for example, fishing and shooting.</P>
      <P>In Bord Fáilte's annual report there is mention of the fact that in the recent season one of their problems was late bookings.  They stressed the fact that the tourism season stretched mainly over the summer months.  I should like to see some grant assistance being made available to ensure that tourism is developed during the winter months.  The Department and Bord Fáilte could work much closer with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in developing the fishing and shooting aspects of tourism.  I should like to see local game clubs and sporting organisations having the opportunity of working in closer liaison with the Department and with Bord Fáilte.  There is a certain amount of suspicion between the two bodies at the moment.</P>
      <P>There are many shooting rights which have not been let.  If the money available under the section is used to encourage local game clubs, it could have the effect of attracting tourists in the winter season when hotels are lying idle and when employment in the tourism industry is at a very low ebb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have other facilities which we are in danger of losing.  I refer to the heritage houses.  There is the controversy regarding the Carton Estate at the moment.  If money were made available under this section it could be used very beneficially to encourage tourists to come here. There has been much talk within tourism circles of developing a folk park.  Perhaps Carton Estate could be used as a location for musical or sporting purposes.  Its proximity to the capital would make it very suitable for tourism development. in my own constituency we have Westport House.  Recently negotiations took place between a former Minister of State at the Department of Education and the owner of Westport House regarding grant assistance &mdash; this would be within the terms of this section &mdash; to allow the owner to make available the vast collection <Col N="100" /> of documents, documents that are lying there in trunks and which go back to the Siege of Limerick and which are of tremendous historical importance.  If made available to the public they would have the effect of attracting the more serious type of tourists who would come to study and examine them.  This would have the effect also of making Westport an even more attractive tourist centre than it is although it is one of the most attractive tourist centres in the country.</P>
    <P>Money under this section could be used to investigate the changing of some of our laws which would have the effect of facilitating tourism.  I refer in particular to the controversy which has raged in recent years regarding the inadequate licensing facilities available to restaurants. Bord Fáilte and the Department could use moneys available under the section to commission a report to examine this situation.  The existing situation is totally unsatisfactory.  Both local and foreign tourists visiting small restaurants are unable to obtain the service they require.  They can only have a glass of wine.  Many of our home-made beverages are not available to them.  That is a ridiculous situation but it is one that could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>One other facility that we should make money available to develop is our National Museum.  I had the opportunity in recent weeks of visiting an exhibition in Berlin.  This was an exhibition of treasures from our National Museum and I was extremely impressed to see displayed there in a very real way some of our treasures.  One cannot observe those treasures in our National Museum exhibited in such a satisfactory way.  We have treasures which should be publicised. The exhibiting of these treasures abroad is having a tremendous effect on tourism in that it is letting people abroad see what we have to offer.  It certainly encourages them to come to this country but when they come into the country we should be able to offer these treasures to them in a more sensible way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a follow through to what the Minister said in his opening remarks, there is a major review taking <Col N="101" /> place as to how best to support the industry. At present there are non-grant concessions being made through the ICC for people in the hotel and tourism business. As well as giving the concessions through the ICC, it would be beneficial to the business of tourism that some of this money should be got through the commercial banks.  This would help them in their day-to-day dealing with banks. One of the problems that people have is that if the banks feel you are borrowing outside their own sector they might not be as willing to help you when you most need the help.  Every business today experiences cash-flow problems.  In the tourism trade generally 23 per cent goes off the top straightaway to the VAT people and there is also the very high PRSI contribution that the employer has to make of 11.6 per cent, which means that before they start to make any profit these taxes must be paid.  It is very difficult to see how any business can survive such outlays before paying staff and paying for the very necessary upkeep of their premises and equally to put a few pounds in their own pocket.  It seems to be considered a sin if any businessman has profit left over at the end of the year.  If this trend continues there will be nobody in business.  Day by day we see people going out of business because of the very high contributions they have to make before they can have a legitimate profit for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point on section 2 (2) which raises the limit on non-accommodation grant expenditure from £10 million to £14 million is very important.  In the Minister's Second Stage speech he said that he was not totally satisfied that this was being channelled into directions which were profitable to the State or which were helping the tourism industry.  It is as long ago as 1975 that a major review or policy plan was undertaken by the regional tourism boards or by Bord Fáilte.  It is necessary to have major reviews on a much more regular basis than that in an industry which is changing rapidly.  The non-accommodation section is one that should be extended, because we have all seen the benefits that can be got from that section.  The product we are selling <Col N="102" /> in Ireland is not the product that is being sold in Spain or in Miami.  People do not come here to lie on beaches.  We have the best beaches in the world but unfortunately, except for this summer, one cannot say that the beaches are our most attractive feature.  We have wonderful countryside and we equally have wonderful buildings.  Millions of people flock to places like Egypt to see the tombs and the various artifacts that they have there but there are very few Irish people who have been to Tara, which is more ancient and more noble than a lot of what can be seen abroad.</P>
    <P>In the non-accommodation section there is an increase from £10 million to £14 million.  This could be extended because it is from there that we are likely to get the most benefit in the future.  In Kilkenny major changes in tourism were brought about by the splendid work that was done on Dunmore Cave, on Roth House and on Kilkenny Castle.  There is no doubt that it has changed the whole trend of tourism in the area.  What would have been considered to be a derelict building has been renovated lovingly by craftsmen from the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister of State, the Minister, the Director General of Bord Fáilte and particularly the Government for providing a much needed extra financial boost to the tourist industry.  In this difficult financial situation it must be encouraging for all those who do so much wonderful work in the tourist industry to find that the Government have included the industry in their priorities and are providing this healthy capital injection to the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended a very interesting seminar last week in Killorglin.  I know that the Minister of State is fully aware of the beauty of Kerry.  The seminar dealt with such features as the Kerry way, the Wicklow way and with walking holidays in particular.  What impressed me was the fact that there appeared to be a willingness to get co-operation, not just from the local authorities, the vocational education committees and the tourist boards <Col N="103" /> but from youth employment people and so many State agencies that can very well have an input into the development of amenities for people.  I am not one for walking holidays but I was inveigled to go on the Kerry way.  It was supposed to be two miles but I thought it was more like 12 miles.  However, it was a beautiful walk.  There are many people who can avail of and who enjoy holidays like that, especially younger people.  In many areas of the country there are outdoor pursuits centres which are being utilised by youth groups, scout groups, tourists and students, not only from our country but from many countries.  I hope that the Minister and Bord Fáilte, with the co-operation of the Forestry and Wildlife section, will open up many of the beautiful facilities and areas so that people can really see, not only at a distance, the 40 shades of green that Johnny Cash sings about but also the great wealth and variety of plants and trees and, indeed, of wild animals and of birds in the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that in the development of walking routes and paths through the State forests we should bear in mind the possibility of using some of the funds that are made available to the Youth Employment Agency whether for the environmental schemes or for the ordinary educational schemes.  This would be for many communities and I would hope that individual communities who want to see their particular areas develop and who would welcome the opportunity to attract people to their areas would look very closely at what is available by way of grants under the youth employment schemes.  Some of these schemes pose a difficulty for small communities because it is difficult for them to raise the capital required to pay for the material, but if we are thinking of developing walking routes for tourists, the capital cost would be very slight.  That is an area from which great benefit would accrue and it would be an interesting task for many people who would like to avail of the work experience programme.  It is important that young people should have a greater appreciation of the countryside <Col N="104" /> instead of just walking through it without really seeing the great variety that is there.</P>
    <P>Many people look on the present time as being a time of a great rip-off, but if people who want to develop and who have development plans were given interest-free loans so that the grant would take the form of the entire interest on loans for capital development, this could take a lot of pressure of people and perhaps the amount of money at the disposal of the Minister might go that little bit further.  It is quite noticeable that so much of the development grants made available are in the traditional or the best-known areas or the areas that we accept as tourist areas, whereas there are a number of midland counties where one could count the amount of grant aid to the tourist industry on the fingers of one hand because it is said that we do not have a tourist industry there even though tourists pass through coming and going from one recognised or traditional beauty spot to another.  This is where the regional boards should be given somewhat greater autonomy and perhaps be able to provide accommodation in all of the country towns across the Republic where there is a demand for that kind of development.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>A former Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy Coveney, while on a sales promotion campaign in America, said that Ireland has probably the furthest flung empire in terms of people throughout the world and that to a large extent it is untapped.  He mentioned specifically those Irish Americans who have succeeded in business to an enormous extent and have enormous wealth and funds and so forth and who have this love for the mother country and would like to do something for it but would like to be recognised for such efforts.  Deputy Coveney made the point that because we do not confer honours upon people we could in fact appoint international directors of Bord Fáilte.  I have said to the Minister on another occasion that this is an idea that ought to be followed up, that we could have international directors of <Col N="105" /> Bord Fáilte in Australia, America or in any country where there is a segment of the population which is of Irish descent. This accolade given by the State to people in powerful positions of influence in these countries would be a very worthwhile exercise.  I would ask the Minister of State to look at it again.  It is probably unique that a Government should decide to put into this position a Minister who knows a great deal about the tourist industry. Usually it is the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be no harm to mention on this Bill the efforts which have been made down through the years by the Tidy Towns Committees and Bord Fáilte with their Tidy Towns awards Great efforts have been made to improve the general appearance of our cities, towns, villages and countryside.  Unfortunately in many areas when the competition stage is over people tend to revert to their original routine and the country in general deteriorates.</P>
      <P>Meath County Council are using the slogan &ldquo;Keep Meath Tidy&rdquo; and are doing everything in their power to prevent litter and indiscriminate dumping.  Because of lack of funds the measures which can be taken at local authority level are very limited.  Fines have been increased but the detection of the offending parties is very difficult.  The public should be made more aware of their responsibilities to their country.  We have the most beautiful country and yet we treat it otherwise in many ways, especially in regard to indiscriminate dumping.  Many of our beauty spots are destroyed by such dumping.  It would be appreciated if the Minister could help the local authorities to improve this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in Meath, have a very short coastline, about six miles stretching from Bettystown to Gormanston.  There are problems regarding coast erosion.  The hands of the county council are tied because of lack of finance.  There are many areas which need to be protected.  It would be helpful if the Minister would note my remarks, especially with regard to indiscriminate dumping, and try and encourage and, if possible, fund some type of <Col N="106" /> incentive scheme to prevent this in conjunction with the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my appreciation to all the Senators who have spoken.  It clearly demonstrates their interest in the further expansion and development of Irish tourism.</P>
      <P>Senator Lynch made one point with which I am very concerned.  There are a number of areas that are excluded from the promotional list of Bord Fáilte.  It is Bord Fáilte's responsibility to sell all Ireland and not any particular part.  If there are any areas Senator Lynch feels merit inclusion in the development of tourism, certainly Bord Fáilte would be very quick to investigate and see that any injustices or wrongs will be corrected.  I would ask for Senator Lynch's co-operation in that field.</P>
      <P>Senator Durcan mentioned the development of fishing and shooting.  These are vital segments of our total tourist development.  It has been and will continue to be a major area of promotion.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with sections 2 and 3 because we are combining accommodation, expenditure and capital development expenditure.  For the information of the Senators I would like to give the capital expenditure from 1979 to 1982.  In cruising development, which is a major development in the Shannon area and elsewhere, Bord Fáilte invested £1,042,000 from 1979 to 1982.  That is a growing development.  In the waterway development under the Office of Public Works and other developments in this field over the same period, up to £86,000 has been expended.  The upgrading of regional tourist offices is a major feature in order to make for better facilities and over the same period expenditure amounted to £934,000.  Expenditure on recreational facilities, concentrating on swimming pools, tennis courts, rock-climbing, hang-gliding etc., over the same period amounted to £844,000. Expenditure on national and forest parks amounted to £445,000 over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has considerable angling resources and in this area there has been an expenditure of £534,000 mainly to improve public access to the fishing areas <Col N="107" /> and the provision of angling facilities. Expenditure on sailing and water sports amounted to £300,000.  Expenditure on historical and cultural joint projects undertaken with agencies, the Office of Public Works and local authorities amounted to £229,000.</P>
    <P>The question of the importance of great houses and gardens has been mentioned. They have a considerable attraction for tourists and expenditure in this field amounted to £227,000.  Expenditure on environmental and community projects over the same period in association with local authorities amounted to £229,000.  The provision for plaques and signs for the direction and information of tourists amounted to £115,000.  Entertainment, capital projects, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, Siamsa etc. amounted to £125,000.  Horsedrawn caravan development amounted to £111,000.</P>
    <P>This demonstrates that Bord Fáilte have shown a very keen interest and have backed up that interest with reasonably considerable expenditure.  I agree that much more remains to be done in order to exploit to the fullest the potential in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the review of the regional tourism organisations. This is a matter of great importance.  In the near future it would be desirable to look and see if they have fulfilled the purpose for which they were originally set up and whether the eight regional bodies could be adjusted or re-structured in any way to improve further the development of tourism.  This is under consideration at the moment.  I can assure all the Senators that over a period of time searching investigations will be carried out to ensure that the regional tourism organisations are structured to achieve the expansion in tourism which we all desire.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner mentioned overseas markets.  Last week I had the opportunity of attending a major convention in Chicago which is the annual hosting of tourism development agencies in a variety of countries.  I was glad to see that the existing structures and officers of Bord Fáilte are working very effectively, but it is <Col N="108" /> worrying that of the forty million in the American tourist industry with Irish connections we are attracting less than 300,000 per annum.  That is not a reasonable figure for tourism development.  The most worrying feature is that four-and-a-half million travelled to Europe in 1982 and approximately two million to Britain. Not only must we investigate the possibility of substantially increasing American tourists directly to Ireland but we must also investigate encouraging the British and American tourists who come to Ireland for part of their holidays.  The American market, properly handled, has colossal potential for a massive growth in Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>We must properly promote our tourist industry, we must provide accessible facilities and we must ensure that our tourist organisation will act responsibly to ensure through standards, through courtesy, through hospitality and through the development of our amenities that our tourists will leave us feeling that they have got value for money.  If we fail in that, no matter what promotions are done in America or elsewhere we will not succeed.  We are in a worldwide competitive market.  It is our job to make our facilities, our standards and our prices attractive enough to encourage tourists to visit Ireland regardless of competition elsewhere.  We have a country to develop and we have a heritage that is the richest in the world which is a major tourism attraction.  A satisfied tourist leaving this country is the best ambassador we could have.</P>
    <P>The matter of loans has been mentioned. Senator Lanigan asked why private banks have not been utilised.  The ICC have been providing money at very acceptable rates.  Loans at reasonable rates for tourist development is very essential for the development of the industry.  Investigations were carried out with the private banks.  There have been no major complaints from the private banks that the ICC are unreasonably interfering.  Bord Fáilte and the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism are very appreciative of the co-operation they have got from ICC in their involvement in the development of tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> The question of tidy towns is of vital importance.  Last Sunday I was present in Terryglass on the shores of Lough Derg where they were celebrating the winning of the award.  They are a small, united community who worked on a voluntary basis.  We will not legislate completely towards the elimination of litter unless we get the co-operation of the local people.  We had 900 entrants in the tidy towns competition.  It should be substantially more, especially from the larger urban areas who are so deeply involved in tourism.  Bord Fáilte will continue to give every encouragement to the communities who involve themselves voluntarily in upgrading the image of their areas, not only to their own advantage but to the national advantage.  Tourists appreciate a tidy, well kept, litter-free centre.  All communities should involve themselves not alone for the purpose of winning prizes &mdash; it is an attraction &mdash; but by taking pride in their environment and ensuring that it is not unnecessarily destroyed by carelessness.</P>
    <P>Serious discussions have taken place over the last 12 to 18 months regarding the basis on which a properly constituted licensing system can be introduced. While it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, my Department are in agreement with a properly structured licensing system for restaurants who can demonstrate that they have a reputable tradition in the provision of meals of a high standard.  We would be opposed to the loosening of legislation to provide for the issuing of licences to premises whose main function would be the sale of drink rather than food.  The Minister for Justice will have the full agreement of the House when he decides in the interest of tourism on the licensing of well-established restaurants whose primary function is the provision of high-grade meals for tourists. There are problems in finalising it but I hope that in the not-too-distant future the Minister for Justice, having met the Irish Restaurant Owners Association and the Irish Vintners Association, will find a basis for the introduction of satisfactory legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner raised the question of appointing directors of Bord Fáilte internationally. <Col N="110" /> This will be examined.  That covers the main points raised by the Senators. I thank them for their immense interest, demonstrating their commitment to the development of this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the upgrading of Board Fáilte's information offices.  I ask him to have a further look at this matter.  Due to lack of finance in the regions, these offices close at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m.  With the type of mobile tourists we have at present, people tend to arrive in a town when the tourist information office is closed and we see people rambling around the area of the tourist information office.  Unless there is some local person around who can tell them where to go and what type of accommodation might be available, it can be extremely difficult for them.</P>
      <P>Another point he made was that he was at the ITME Conference in Chicago. I have heard comments from certain sectors that we are not going to get the type of tourist that we have been looking for in the past.  Bord Fáilte spent enormous amounts of money bringing travel agents here from Austria, Germany, Sweden and other places and they put them into the major grade A type hotels where they are being charged at least a third more for their food and discretionary purchases. They are being overcharged in the bars and in the restaurants.  This is the type of price structure they feel exists throughout the country.  If they were brought to the normal type of Irish hotel, the normal type of bed and breakfast accommodation or indeed where the Irish people themselves go, they might have a better idea and we might get a better feed back from the amounts of money that are being spent by bringing in these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one point on the tidy towns.  I was disgusted to see on yesterday's paper the picture of the committee of the town which won the Tidy Towns competition standing beside the signpost which was erected outside this particular town.  Similar signposts are erected outside every town which has won the Tidy Towns competition.  It is a metal structure which is about six feet by six feet.  To put <Col N="111" /> that outside a town which has won a Tidy Towns competition seems ludicrous.  It is taking away from the natural attributes of the place which has won the award. Bord Fáilte should have a look at the design of that particular sign before they put up any more of them.</P>

      <P>I refer to a point made by the Minister in regard to the issuing of restaurant licences.  I hope that in all these discussions both the Minister and the Minister for Justice will bear in mind the part the ordinary publican has played in the development of our tourist industry through the years.  This is a sector that is badly hit at the moment.  The Minister mentioned that as well as the restaurant owners association, he would also have talks with licensed vintners association so that their points of view could be put. We cannot issue <i>ad hoc</i> licences here and there to every Tom, Dick and Harry who is out for a quick kill.  I agree with that, but I would reiterate the part the publican has played down through the years. People like to go into the ordinary pub and have a drink.  We still have a few pubs where we have Irish music and the odd step is danced.  It is a tourist attraction and it is something that we must preserve.</P>

      <P>Regarding the point made about the staffing of the regional tourist offices, Senators will agree that the limitations on the finances of Bord Fáilte, which mainly have to be spent on promotion both overseas and at home, leave a certain shortcoming there. People who register with the different regions pay a flat rate fee to Bord Fáilte and they pay on a voluntary basis if they so desire to the regional tourism board. The money which can be used for additional staffing and additional information offices comes from the resources of the region itself.  This is an area which will have to be looked at.  Bord Fáilte's limited financial resources are confined to selling Ireland as a whole rather than going down into the nitty gritty.  Local regional boards have the capacity and the right to set up certain financial structures <Col N="112" /> that could possibly enable them to provide for better staffing.</P>
      <P>I can assure Senator Lynch that the sentiments he expressed are fully under consideration by the Minister for Justice, who has the final responsibility on that, and nothing will be done other than what is considered to be in the best interests of all concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one sector here that needs looking at, and I do not think that the fundamental problem will be solved by an increase in penalties.  I refer here to the holiday caravan parks.  There is no doubt that the existing legislation regarding standards and the issuing of licences is more honoured in the breach than in the observance.</P>
      <P>I carried out a survey in one county where there were approximately 26 caravan parks and found that 11 of them were licensed by the local authority and 12 were licensed by Bord Fáilte.  The 11 that were licensed by the local authority were not licensed by Bord Fáilte, and it is ridiculous that there should not be legislation giving one authority, and I suggest that it should be the local authority, the power to license these places.  Caravan parks and halting places for campers are going to become more and more important in tourism.  No matter what country one goes to, the one thing one sees in tourism is the enormous growth in the number of people with small caravans and huge growth in the number of young people who are travelling, using either hostels or camping sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland in the past there was a feeling that these people should not be made welcome.  If we do not make these people welcome when they are young, when they have their packs on their backs, we might lose a lot of future tourism potential. When they are here they are at least spending on their food and possibly in the local pub.  They might not spend a lot <Col N="113" /> of money per person but generally speaking these people get the urge to travel at that age and when they are older and have enough money to spend on holidays abroad we may miss out on them altogether if they have not travelled through Ireland in their youth.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficulties in certain areas regarding caravan parks as to whether they are going to be hard stands for itinerants or whether the caravan parks set up for tourists would tend to deteriorate.  Even though the increase in penalties suggested in section 3 will ensure that increased penalties will be imposed on people who break the regulations, unless the regulations are brought together not much good will be done.</P>

      <P>I am glad that Senator Lanigan raised this matter again because there is a growing demand for properly structured caravan and camping grounds.  I am conscious of the problem that we have some grounds which are registered for sanitary standards with the local authority but are not registered with regard to the overall standards with Bord Fáilte.  We have engaged in discussions with the Department of the Environment in an effort to eliminate this and bring the whole lot under one structure.  This is a segment that has to be encouraged because it is a growing new phenomenon in the tourist industry.  There is a growing volume of people looking for reasonable facilities and it is up to us to provide the best standard of facilities for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome section 3 in so far as it increases penalties.  However, I should like to ask the Minister if it is absolutely necessary that the penalties be fixed by statute?  Is it not possible that the penalties could be fixed by statutory instrument?  Many of these penalties were fixed by legislation which was enacted a considerable time ago and inflation has taken its toll in regard to the relevance of these penalties.  It is interesting that section 5 allows the imposition of fees which will be imposed by the board for various purposes to be fixed by <Col N="114" /> statutory instrument or ministerial order. I wonder if it is possible to do the same as far as fines are concerned.  A fine is a penalty and I am a little concerned that, leaving aside the question of prosecuting an offender, Bord Fáilte are, on occasion, adopting other approaches for penalising a tour operator who breaches the Tourism Acts.  I refer very bluntly to a case about which I made representations to the board.  It concerns the Westport House complex where many types of tourism activities are carried on under the same umbrella, from the opening of Westport House as a historic house to horse-drawn caravans, apartments and various tourism activities.  This year they were in breach of one rule whereby their advertising literature contained details of holiday apartments and one of these apartments did not comply with Bord Fáilte regulations.  As a result, Bord Fáilte refused to carry any of their literature dealing with any of their activities in any Bord Fáilte office.  This tour operator is providing a tremendous incentive to tourism in the west Mayo area.  It came as a very severe blow to those interested in the development of tourism in the area that all his literature should be withdrawn for the entire season.  I welcome the power given to Bord Fáilte under this section to prosecute and the increased penalties provided for.  However, I do not welcome the taking of arbitrary decisions by Bord Fáilte to penalise somebody independently of the courts.</P>

I do not see that mentioned in section 8 and there should be a continuing fine for every day upon which the offence continues.  It is something that the Minister should consider even at this stage unless the matter is covered by some other legislation.  I am very anxious to be assured that where somebody displays certain information there should be more than a mere penalty <Col N="116" /> because it is vital to tourism that the correct information be displayed.  It seems ridiculous that people would have to wait for a court to fine them while the information was being displayed for a considerable time.

However, pensions are a subject of public concern at present, especially the payment of pensions to people in this House, although I suppose I should not mention it.  As public money is involved I should like the Minister to clarify what exactly section 9 is going to do for members, staff, their spouses and children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this section, it is reasonable to assume that there would be some confusion here because it is generally established that Bord Fáilte is a part-time board.  The necessity for this section arises from the 1952 Act which indicated a possibility of the appointment of some members as a full-time board.  As of now, no members of Bord Fáilte as at present constituted come within the qualifications that would be required for the disbursement of public funds by way of gratuities, widows' allowances, children's allowances, etc.  It is only a technical provision in case at some time in the future fulltime board members will be appointed to Bord Fáilte.  This would require specific <Col N="117" /> approval.  The section is at present noneffective and non-implementable.  It was included on the advice of the legal profession in order to co-ordinate this legislation with that of 1952.  There are no members of the board eligible for these gratuities at present.  It would only arise if the projections of the 1952 Act were implemented by the appointment of full-time members to the board.  This section also deals with staff who are now being brought into line retrospectively in relation to their overall entitlements in national agreements for full-time permanent staff in a semi-State body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy about the staff end of it but I was concerned about board members because I was aware that board membership tends to change.  I was not quite sure what period of membership of the board would qualify a person for a pension and it could be tying up valuable funds that Bord Fáilte will require for this section but I welcome it on behalf of the staff who become permanent and would be giving their duty full-time to the board.  I was concerned because they were not differentiated in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little worried about this section, particularly in connection with 9(1).  Why bring in this section now?  It is not envisaged that full-time members of the staff, or full-time board members, will be appointed even though it does state that this can happen.  It worries me that 9(1) is brought in by civil servants to protect themselves. I see absolutely no reason for it.  It always worries me when somebody says, &ldquo;We put this in just in case at some future date the protection would be needed if and when full-time members of the board were appointed&rdquo;.  Section 9(1) is superfluous and dangerous.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator Lanigan's position.  This is the first time legislative provision has been made in respect of the staff for gratuities and pensions.  They have been dealt with retrospectively. It is now giving effect to the <Col N="118" /> retrospective position regarding the proper payments due to these people. The draftsmen thought in doing that on this occasion they also should take into account the basis of the 1952 legislation in relation to the possibility of having full-time board members at some time and that this was the occasion to do it.  It does not apply at present as there are no full-time members and there are no proposals to do that.  If and when a pension scheme does come, it would have to go before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I can understand Senator Lanigan's position when he says it is an oddity at the moment and his observations will be borne in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again I feel because this section is now in the Bill pressure will come from the professionals within Bord Fáilte to ensure that they have full-time board members.  It is one of the facts of life that the professionals do not like part-time board members who have an interest in tourism and have an expertise in certain areas.  They are looked down on in certain areas by the professionals. I suggest that because this is now in the Bill, it will give them a further impetus to try to force the situation whereby, because the Bill states it, we will have, following that, full-time board members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not differentiated in respect of board members whether we are talking about temporary or permanent board members.  When does a board member become permanent?  Is it after three years?  It needs to be clarified as it is somewhat unclear as it is.  I do not agree that parliamentary draftsmen always do the right thing.  They have the right reason for doing it but the final wording may, as Senator Lanigan said, leave room for interpretation by other people in a way that would be beneficial to themselves.  I am concerned about this. Members of the board, as the Minister confirmed, change from time to time. There is nothing wrong with that if they make an input.  But at what stage will somebody decide that they should become permanent?  Will the board itself decide?  Can they decide or can we stop <Col N="119" /> them?  If this is written into the Bill who can stop them?</P>

      <P>Within the legislation providing for Bord Fáilte is comprised a board of part-time members with a limitation of three years' service.  If the aspirations of the 1952 legislation were to be implemented they would require the approval of both Houses.  It was merely included as a technical introduction at this stage to regularise properly the superannuation of staff.  That is the position and there need be no fears.  The existing legislation deals with a part-time tourist board.  They are not covered in the proposals for remuneration, pension or superannuation rights within this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doubtful about the necessity for this section at all.  I am a little worried about the fact that somebody who has to make an arrangement with his creditors should be disqualified from being a member of the board of Bord Fáilte bearing in mind that if we are to introduce legislation of this kind the section does not go further and prohibit other people from maintaining their places on the board.  It is unfortunate that we penalise somebody who may be guilty of a commercial offence which may be entirely outside his control yet somebody who may be guilty of an offence under the Litter Act or Fisheries Act &mdash; perhaps somebody who was convicted of poisoning an entire river and damaging an entire area &mdash; may still be eligible to sit on the board of Bord Fáilte.  A person convicted of drunken driving two or three times is still eligible to sit on the board of Bord Fáilte.  A hotelier who was convicted repeatedly under the Tourist Acts may continue to sit on the board of Bord Fáilte.  Yet somebody who unwittingly commits a commercial offence is not allowed to sit on the board of Bord Fáilte. <Col N="120" /> That is extremely unfortunate and I am unhappy about this section.  If one is to disqualify at all, the disqualifications would be endless.  The question of qualification is something which falls within the discretion of individual and successive Ministers.  Successive Ministers in the exercise of their powers in appointing people to the board have shown excellent discretion.  Over the years there have been excellent members on the board. This is what I would describe as bridesmaid legislation.  It is unnecessary and I do not like to see it going on the Statute Book.  More thought should be given to it.</P>
      <P>There is another technical point.  We say that a person who is sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to suffer imprisonment shall be disqualified.  What happens if somebody is convicted of a driving offence and he refuses to pay the fine?  If he does not pay the fine he must suffer imprisonment.  Does that mean that such a person is disqualified from being on the board?  It is not what the section says, it is what it does not say. This is an unnecessary and unfortunate section.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the job that he is doing for tourism since he took office. Equally, even though much has been said here which might seem to be critical of the workings of Bord Fáilte, in general there is no question or doubt that Mr. McNulty and his team and the regional managers in general have done an excellent job in selling this country.  However, at this stage of the year when we are getting into third degree considerations I should like to impress upon the Minister for Finance the grave need that there is for a reduction to a realistic level of the VAT rates that apply to hotels and the tourism industries.</P>
      <P>If a realistic rate of 10 per cent were to be placed on the industry as a whole the State would not lose in terms of revenue because it would increase the discretionary amount that tourists would have to spend on items which already bear a very high tax content, and the more of them that would be used, the more revenue would accrue to the Government.  Petrol gives a very high tax yield to the Government. If people had more to spend they would travel more and the State would benefit.  Again, if we take tax off alcoholic beers, the discretionary amount of money people on holiday would have would be used in spending it on such drink.</P>
      <P>The VAT threshold is much too high. If the tourism industry is to survive, the high level of VAT will have to be brought down to a realistic level or everything that we have been talking about here today cannot be fulfilled.</P>

I fully agree with Senator Lanigan when he says that Bord Fáilte have done a tremendous job down through the years. This Bill will enable them to carry out their work with an injection of much needed cash and capital which will be wisely used.  However, I again stress to the Minister in conjunction with Senator Lanigan's remarks, that he should do something to relieve the restrictions that we have placed on the tourist industry in regard to the imposition of high taxes. We have gone a long way towards killing the great potential that is still there.  I agree with the Minister when he stated that there is not one part of this country that is not a tourist attraction.  It is up to us to promote it.  At the same time, the Government should give back the incentive to people to work towards attaining that goal and give back the incentive to the tourists to come here.</P>

I believe this is one industry that is really about people and I hope that the management of hotels and catering establishments will always bear that in mind.  Four of us drove from the south a few weeks ago and we ordered three meals.  I was driving and I did not want anything.  No one would be served unless I had a full meal also.  That is absolutely stupid.  The only option we had was to go from this motorway inn in Limerick back into town to look for some other place.  Asinine regulations like that would surely put tourists off.  Being Irish and knocking around myself I would understand the way people employ these house rules.  But surely tourism should cater for each individual's needs.  That is where we would expect the Irish charm and what we would have to sell.  Hotel managements have a big responsibility to put a personal input into this industry to be able to earn the very much needed foreign currencies to keep the balances right.  I have every confidence in the Minister to continue with the good job he is doing.</P>

Tá sé beagáinín ait, b'fhéidir, bheith ag tosnú inniu agus bheith ag tagairt do na cainteoirí a bhí romham mar is fada an lá ó bhí siad anseo &mdash; seachtain ó shin.  Dúirt mé an t-am sin go raibh a lán cainte faoi airgead agus foirgnimh agus mar sin, agus dúirt mé freisin gurb é mo thuairim nach leor airgead &mdash; cé go bhfuil sé tábhachtach &mdash; ar bith chun an teanga a thabhairt ar ais ach go mbeadh suim ag daoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Muna bhfuil dea-thoil ag na daoine agus muna bhfuil suim acu an Ghaeilge a labhairt ní thiocfaidh sé ar ais.</P>
      <P>Bhí daoine ag gearán faoi na múinteóiri nua agus dúirt mé gur cheap mé go raibh siad chomh maith agus a bhí na sean-mhúinteóirí.  Níl a fhios agam, ach bhí na sean-mhúinteóirí go maith ach níl Gaeilge á labhairt ar fud na tíre.  Taispeánann sé sin, sílim, dá mbeadh an dea-thoil ann bheadh an Ghaeilge á labhairt ar fud na tíre.  Tá sé furasta milleán a chur ar an Rialtas, b'fhéidir ar an Roinn, faoin gcúlra.  Is cuma, is féidir an milleán a chur ar gach éinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dubhuirt mé freisin an lá faoi dheireadh nach bhfuil go leor Gaeilge anseo sa Seanad; níl ach nuair atá an Cathaoirleach ag teacht, agus an paidir ansin. Sílim féin go mba chóir go mbeadh Gaeilge ar siúl anseo go hoifigiúil agus go mbeadh sé go hoifigiúil sa Dáil freisin. Dubhairt mé go bhfuil an tionchur ag an teaghlach, go mór mhór nuair a théann na páistí abhaile ón scoil.  Má bhíonn an Ghaeilge acu is féidir leo í a labhairt; má bhíonn daoine ag gearán sa mbaile faoin rud sin cuireann sé go mór isteach orthu agus tá sé sin soiléir uaireannta nuair a bhíonn tú ag caint le páistí ar an teileafón <Col N="125" /> nó ar an mbóthar, má labhrann tú trí Ghaeilge leo má thugann siad freagra dhuit gan scannradh a bheith orthu.  Uaireannta féachann siad ar dhuine nuair a labhraíonn sé Gaeilge taobh amuigh den scoil.  Taispeánann Sé nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith sa bhaile nó nach bhfuil suim ar bith acu sa nGaeilge sa bhaile.</P>
    <P>Bhí caint an lá faoi dheireadh mar gheall ar an scrúdú béil.  Ba mhaith liomsa go mór dá mbeadh an moladh atá sa four-year plan glactha; go mbeadh 33 faoin gcéad ar a laghad de na marcanna don scrúdú béil.  Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach, sílim, go mbeadh marcanna ar fáil don Ghaeilge agus ní féidir an Ghaeilge a chur ar aghaidh ó thaobh labhairt de muna bhfuil marcanna le fáil dó.  Rinneamar go léir Laidin agus Gréigis agus mar sin, fuaireamar marcanna dóibh ach ní féidir linn an Laidin ná an Ghréigis a labhairt.</P>
    <P>Caithfimid tacaíocht a thabhairt do labhairt na Gaeilge.  Ó thaobh an ráitis go mba chóir go mbeadh áiteanna faoi leith do scoláirí ón nGaeltacht i gColáiste Naomh Pádraig, nó mar sin, ní aontaím leis.  Ní aontaím ach oiread go mba chóir go mbeadh na coláistí ullmhúcháin ar ais. Bhí siad ann, agus cén fáth nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ag dul ar aghaidh go tapaidh? Bhí na sean-mhúinteórí ann. Tháinig a lán dóibh as na coláistí ullmhucháin agus nílim cinnte go bhfuil feabhas ar an Ghaeilge.  Arís, ní ar na múinteóirí atá an milleán, agus nílim ag tabhairt cosanta do na múinteóirí os rud gur múinteoir mé féin.</P>
    <P>Bhí Gaeilge againn le blianta.  Níor labhair na daoine sa bhaile í: níl sí le chloisteail in áiteanna go mba chóir an Ghaeilge a chloisteáil.  Bheadh sé an fhurasta ar fad a bheith ag rá dá mbeadh na coláistí ullmhucháin arais nó dá mbeadh áiteanna ar leith dos na daoine ón nGaeltacht go mbeadh feabhas ar an nGaeilge. Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh.</P>
    <P>Bhí gearán freisin an lá faoi dheireadh ag na cainteóirí go raibh moill ar scoil Ghaeltach amuigh i Léim an Bhradáin, ach níl sé sin ag baint le scoil Ghaelach amháin.  Bhí mé féin ag feitheamh beagnach 10 mbliain le forgneamh nua ins an scoil a bhfuil mé féin ann, agus tá moill ar scoileanna ar fud na tíre agus ní haon chomhartha é sin nach bhfuil suim ag an <Col N="126" /> Rialtas ins an nGaeilge.  Tá sé soiléir nach bhfuil airgead ag an Rialtas chun gach scoil a thógáil, ach déarfainn go ndéanfadh sé dochar da mbeadh daoine ag gearán nach raibh suim ar bith ag éinne sa scoil Ghaelach.</P>
    <P>Ag an bpoinnte seo ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis na scoileanna seo.  Tá scoil Gaelach thíos i gCeatharlach againn atá ag dul ar aghaidh go hiontach.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil daoine ag obair go dian ann agus tá, ach tá na scoláirí go hiontach ansin cé nach raibh siad ach an chéad bhliain ann, agus tá siad ag tosnú an dara bliain anois agus tá Gaeilge líofa acu.  Chuir sé ionadh an domhain orm nuair a bhí a bhí mé istigh ann, agus tá an-suim ag na tuismitheóirí ann agus creidim féin go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó dóchais i rudaí den tsaghas ná in aon rud a dhéanfaidh an Rialtas nó aon rud a dhéanfaidh daoine a bhéas ag cur éigin ar éinne an Ghaeilge a labhairt.</P>
    <P>Sa bplean atá ann, tá cuid de go h-anmhaith. Ó thaobh éifeachta de, chaith mé tréimhse sa Ghaeltacht nuair a bhí an fo-toghchán ar siúl agus bhí sé mar aidhm ag ár bpáirtí go mbeadh cainteoirí Gaeilge ag labhairt ins an nGaeltacht. Nuair a tháinig mé ar ais ón gcruinniú, dúirt na daoine ins an áit.  &ldquo;Ná bac leis sin, ní thuigfidh na daoine anseo an Ghaeilge atá agat.&rdquo;  Dé réir dealraimh, b'fhéidir nár thuig mar theip orainn sa toghchán, ach ní dóigh liom gur ormsa atá an milleán.  Ní raibh aon ghríosadh ag na daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Nuair a chuaigh mé isteach chun na paipeirí a fháil gach Domhnach agus d'iarr mé ar an siopadóir as Gaeilge go raibh paipéir ag teastáil uaim, labhair sé as Béarla liom cé go raibh sé ag labhairt as Gaeilge le gach éinne eile sa teach.  Bhí a fhios aige gur strainséar a bhí ann ceart go leor ach bhí mise ag labhairt trí Ghaeilge agus ní dóigh liom go ndéaneann an Ghaeltacht an méid ba chóir dóibh a dhéanamh.  Tá sé ceart go leor a bheith ag lorg airgid agus gach rud, ach caithfidh muintir na Gaeltachta an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Dubhairt mé an lá faoi dheireadh go gcreidim féin go ndéaneann daoine ón Ghalltacht i bhfad níos mó ó thaobh labhairt na Gaeilge de agus go ndéaneann na múinteoirí an Ghalltacht i bhfad níos mó ó <Col N="127" /> thaobh Gaeilge de ná mar a dhéaneann cuid de na múinteoirí a thagann on Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh an phobail de, caithfimid dea-thoil an phobail a fháil agus is dócha go gcaithfimid dea-shampla a thabhairt dóibh go bhfuil an Ghaeilge beo agus creidim féin go bhfuil sé beo.  Caithfimid a dhéanamh soiléir dóibh go bhfuilimid i ndáiríre agus go bhfuil gach cuid den Rialtas agus gach Seanadóir agus gach Teachta Dála i ndáiríre ó thaobh labhairt na Gaeilge de agus go mba chóir go mbeadh &mdash; faoi mar a dúirt mé cheana &mdash; níos mó anseo.  Ó thaobh an Stáit de ba chóir go mbeadh cearta ag na daoine sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba chóir go mbeadh siad in ann pé obair ba mhaith leo a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge agus má bhíonn siad sa chúirt ba chóir go mbeadh breithimh ann a mbeadh Gaeilge acu.  Ó thaobh na Státseirbhíse de, ní thuigim cén fáth nach bhfuil Gaeilge sa Státseirbhís agus is dócha go bhfuil, cé go mbíonn ionadh orm uaireanta nuair a labhraím trí Gaeilge le cuid de na daoine anseo &mdash; ní rachaidh mé siar ar an Seanad.  Táim cinnte go bhfuil daoine ar fud na tíre ag déanamh, trí dea-shampla agus trí úsáid na Gaeilge, i bhfad níos mó ná mar is féidir le Rialtas ar bith a dhéanamh, agus thíos i gCeatharlach &mdash; ní féidir liom a rá go bhfuil sé sa Ghaeltacht ach ní féidir liom a rá go bhfuil sé sa Ghalltacht mar fuair sé an chéad duais i <i>nGlór na nGael</i> an bhliain seo caite.  Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh le <i>Glór na nGael</i> mar táim cinnte go bhfuil obair den tsórt sin ag déanamh a lán maitheasa don Ghaeilge.  I gCeatharlach bhí fógraí sna siopaí: &ldquo;Labhartar Gaeilge anseo&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Gaeilge agus fáilte&rdquo; agus rudaí den tsaghas sin.  Tá an spiorad ceart sna daoine agus ní bhíonn éinne ag brú Gaeilge orthu ach ar an láimh eile bíonn suim ag na daoine sa Ghaeilge agus creideann siad go bhfuil na daoine atá i gceannas i ndairíre mar labhrann siad Gaeilge.  Creideann siad go bhfuil na daoine atá i gceannas ansin dáiríre.  Bhíos ag cruinniú cúpla seachtain ó shin agus bhí slua an-mhór ann ó na heagrais eagsúla agus cuireann siad suim sa Ghaeilge.  Cuirim an milleán ar Chumann <Col N="128" /> Lúith-Chleas Gael, cé go bhfuilim i mo bhall leis na blianta &mdash; nach ndéaneann siad go leor, ach tá cuid amháin de agus is é sin Scór agus Scór na nÓg agus creidim féin go bhfuil obair den tsaghas sin ag déanamh a lán don Ghaeilge.  Is é Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann an chuid is fearr, sílim, ar fud na tíre mar bíonn daoine ag labhairt Gaeilge lena lámhaí agus lena gcosa agus le gach rud, mar ní hé amháin go bhfuil Gaeilge á úsáid acu ach tá cultúr agus sprid na hÉireann ag teacht ar ais agus tá siad ag déanamh togha obair.</P>
    <P>Cuirtear an milléan ar Teilifís Éireann go minic.  B'fhéidir gur féidir leo níos mó cláracha a chur ar siúl a bheadh ag chur béime ar an Ghaeilge, ach ar an lámh eile, is dócha go bhfuil deacrachtaí acu féin: ní féidir leo cláracha a chur ar siúl muna bhfuil suim ag na daoine iontu.  Bhí suim ag na daoine i gcláracha cosúil le &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; agus &ldquo;Trom agus Éadrom&rdquo; agus bhí suim acu sa Ghaeilge a bhí á labhairt iontu.  Má bhíonn fonn ar dhaoine rudaí a chloisteáil beidh siad ag éisteacht leo, fiú amháin má tá siad trí Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá Radio na Gaeltachta ag déanamh a lán.  An t-aon milleán atá agam féin ar an radio sin ná nach bhfuil sé le cloisteáil ar fud na tíre mar níl VHF ina lán de na gléasanna radio atá sna tithe agus muna bhfuil VHF agat ní féidir é a chloisteáil, i gCeatharlach pé scéal é.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé mar an gcéanna i ngach áit eile.  Bíonn VHF ag na déagóirí agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil siad ag éisteacht le Radio na Gaeltachta.  Níl a fhios agam.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom na Gael-scoileanna agus na naíscoileanna a mholadh freisin. Is rudaí den tsaghas sin atá ag déanamh maitheasa do athbheochaint na Gaeilge, sílim.  Tá sé an soléir gur plean an-mhór an Plean Cheithre Bliana agus go bhfuil airgead ag teastáil uaidh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an t-airgead le fáil ach níl mé cinnte go ndéanfaidh airgead amháin an maitheas atá ag teastáil i gcóir athbheochaint na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ní maith liom bheith ag dul siar, ach ba mhaith liom rud eile a rá faoin Ghaeltacht agus eile.  Déanann na coláistí samhraidh a lán maitheasa don Ghaeilge agus tá páistí ag dul go dtí na coláistí agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuil cuid de na coláistí <Col N="129" /> sin sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá cuid acu sa Ghalltacht ach bíonn an-suim ag na páistí sa Ghaeilge.  Foghlaimíonn siad a lán, agus níos mó ná sin: nuair a bhíonn an samhradh thart leanann an samhradh ar aghaidh trín gheimreadh agus bíonn cruinniú gach Satharn acu, i gCeatharlach pé scéal é.  Bíonn cluichí agus caint agus rincí acu agus bhí agallamh acu leis na daoine a bhí toilteannach freastal air. Tá caighdeán an-ard ag na páistí, agus suim an-mhór acu go minic.  Bím ag caint leo mar tá mo íníon féin ag dul isteach ann.  Bíonn siad ag labhairt Gaeilge nuair a thagann siad amach, déarfainn agus gurb é sin an príomh rud atá ag teastáil anseo, go mbíonn an spriod ag na daoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt nuair a bhuaileann siad le duine go bhfuil Gaeilge aige nó aici mar tá sé deacair labhairt trí Ghaeilge muna dtuigeann na daoine atá ag éisteacht cad tá ar siúl.</P>
    <P>Mar sin molaim go mór na heagrais atá ag cur na Gaeilge ar aghaidh.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh airgead ar fáil ach nílim ag cur iomarca béime ar an airgead mar ní dóigh liom go ndéanfaidh sé aon mhaitheas faoi leith do athbheochaint na Gaeilge muna bhfuil na daoine toilteanach an Ghaeilge a labhairt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an-áthas orm caoi a bheith agam cúpla focail a rá sa díospóireacht seo agus mo thacaíocht a thabhairt don tairiscint atá romhainn:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the Action Plan for Irish 1983-1986, published by Bord na Gaeilge, and calls for the setting up of an all-party Oireachtas Committee to consider that Plan, to review the present condition of the language both in the Gaeltacht and outside it, and to make recommendations to the Government on an Irish language policy for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní fheadar cén fáth nach bhfuil an tairiscint romhainn i nGaeilge seachas i mBéarla.  Sílim féin gur cheart go mbeadh.  Ar aon nós tá dhá chuid sa tairiscint seo.  I dtosach báire iarrtar orainn ár n-aire a dhíriú ar an bplean a d'fhoillsigh Bord na Gaeilge ar a dtugann siad Plean Gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge 1983-1986.  Chomh maith leis sin iarrann <Col N="130" /> an tairiscint go gcuirfí coiste den Oireachtas ar bun chun staid na Gaeilge a iniúchadh sa Ghaeltacht agus taobh amuigh di agus chun moltaí a thabhairt roimh an Rialtas ar pholasaí i leith na Gaeilge do na blianta atá le teacht.</P>
    <P>Is í an chéad ceist gur chóir dúinn a chur orainn féin ná: An gá plean mar seo &ldquo;at this point in time&rdquo;, mar a deireann siad.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil an freagra ar an gceist sin sa chéad abairt i mír 2 anseo mar tá an abairt sin faoin gceannlíne i dtreo an dátheangachais &mdash; straitéis mheantéarmach mar atá:</P>
    <P>Tá baol mór ar an nGaeilge mar theanga phobail agus an baol sin ag géarú in aghaidh na bliana.</P>
    <P>Má admhaimid go bhfuil an abairt sin fíor agus má táimid i ndáiríre maidir le dul chun cinn na Gaeilge caithfimid a fhreagairt go bhfuil géarghá leis an bplean seo. Tá sé in am agus thar am dúinn gníomhaíocht dearfach a thionscnamh ar son na Gaeilge le go dtiocfaidh sí slán.</P>
    <P>Séard atá sa doiciméad seo, im thuairimse, ná plean a chuideoídh go mór linn an aidhm sin a bhaint amach.  Mar a deir an doiciméad féin tá na spriocanna a luaitear sa phlean réasúnta agus intomhaiste agus má shroichtear na spriocanna atá luaite beidh an teanga slán sa ghearrthéarma ar aon nós.</P>
    <P>Creidim go dteastaíonn ó fhormhór de mhuintir na hÉireann go leanfaidh an Ghaeilge ina teanga beo ach cé go bhfuil an dea-thoil ansin níl beart dá réir á dhéanamh i gcás an phobail i gcoitinne. Chun go mbeadh toradh fiúntach ar an bplean seo caithfidh muintir uile na tíre a nguaillí a chur leis an roth agus iarracht níos fearr a dhéanamh ná mar a rinneadh cheana féin chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Tá an-áthas orm go nglacann an doiciméad leis an bhfírinne nach ar mhúinteoirí agus scoileanna agus scoláirí amháin atá athbheochan na Gaeilge nó sábháil na Gaeilge ag braith.  Caithfear an teanga a thabhairt amach thar geata na scoile.  Caithfear í a bheith le cloisteáil anseo sa tSeanad, sa Dáil, san ollscoil, san eaglais, sna clubanna sóisialta, agus i gcúrsí gnó agus i ngnáth-chúrsaí cumarsáide <Col N="131" /> na tíre.  Nuair a fheiceas an páiste óg gur cuid den seol mór í an Ghaeilge glacfaidh sé léi agus labharfaidh sé í.  Ach níl an páiste óg in ann an teanga a shábháil gan cabhair agus cúnamh ón bpobal, is cuma céard a dhéanann na múinteoirí agus na scoileanna.  Is snámh in aghaidh an easa é do mhúinteoirí bheith ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn muna mbíonn beart dá réir á dhéanamh lasmuigh den scoil.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuirtear leanaí chuig an Ghaeltacht d'fhonn a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhsú is é an rud is mó a chabhraíonn leo agus a chothaíonn gean agus meas iontu don teanga ná go bhfeiceann siad go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar theanga beo. Caithfidh siad í a fheiceáil mar theanga beo lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht freisin.  Mar sin tá sé thar am don phobal agus don Stát a léiriú go soiléir go bhfuil siad i ndáiríre i leith na teanga agus d'fhéadfadh siad é sin a dhéanamh trí glacadh leis na moltaí atá sa doiciméad seo.</P>
    <P>I support this motion and at the outset I would like to compliment Bord na Gaeilge on the production of this fouryear action programme.  The targets set out in the programme are reasonable and measurable and achievable, given a genuine effort and commitment on the part of all concerned.  The fact that the action plan will not cut across the wide-ranging promotional work for the language which is being done by a variety of individuals and organisations and agencies is to be welcomed, as is the fact that it is envisaged all this work which is being done by those individuals and organisations and agencies will continue parallel with the plan.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that it is proposed to issue a revised version of the plan in 1984 which will take into account submissions received from various community organisations in relation to their language objective.  It was a good idea to set out the proposals in the plan under the four headings which are used, namely, the Gaeltacht, the community, education and the State.  I sincerely hope that the additional funding and staffing which will be necessary to ensure the <Col N="132" /> implementation of the total plan will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The statistics which are given in relation to the decline of the Gaeltacht are frightening.  Statistics which were given during the course of this debate as well as other documents apart from this document, came as a great surprise to me and, I am sure, to many other people.  I was amazed to learn that only 1 per cent of our population can be said to be native speakers, using Irish as their normal day-to-day language in Gaeltacht areas. This, combined with another statistic that was given that fewer than 50 per cent of Gaeltacht children attending national schools qualify for the £10 grant paid by Roinn na Gaeltachta to children of school-going age living in the Gaeltacht and whose home language is Irish, would lead one to the conclusion that there is very little hope Irish will survive as a community language in the Gaeltacht beyond the end of the century unless the decline of the Gaeltacht is arrested before it is too late.  If the proposals contained in this document are implemented their implementation will certainly arrest the decline of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>One would have to agree with the conclusion contained in the plan that only emergency measures will ensure that the Gaeltacht areas will survive even at their present strength until the end of the century. The proposals in the plan in relation to the Gaeltacht, particularly the proposal that a co-ordinating group be established to review and develop all Gaeltacht language schemes and to implement the other proposals which refer to the Gaeltacht, are practical and well thought out.</P>
    <P>In relation to education in the Gaeltacht, it is important that there should be no further closures of Gaeltacht schools &mdash; other speakers have made this point. I also believe a special curriculum suitable to the particular needs of Gaeltacht children should be developed.  I understand that in the Gaeltacht there is a great lack of suitable text books in Irish.  This is a serious problem at primary level but I understand it is an even more serious problem at second level.  It is one which should be tackled immediately.  The <Col N="133" /> responsibility for providing the solution to this problem rests with the Department of Education because the provision of suitable text books in Irish will have to be subsidised.  The publishing companies will not produce them because it would not be a commercial proposition for the publishing companies to produce an adequate range of text books in Irish. Therefore, it is something to which the Department of Education will have to address themselves very seriously.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an Irish language television service, suggested in the plan, in my view would do more than any other single measure to counteract all the anglicising influences which have put pressure on the Gaeltacht in recent years.  In addition, the further development of Radio na Gaeltachta is necessary.  I agree with the point made by Senator Browne that it is regrettable that Radio na Gaeltachta is not received in every home in the country.</P>
    <P>I, too, had the pleasure of working in the same Gaeltacht area as Senator Browne during the course of the by-election campaign and I have to agree with all the points Senator Browne made.  It was rather surprising to go into a shop and hear the shopkeeper speaking in Irish to the other customers and then when one of us asked for some item he spoke to us in English.  Suppose he recognised us as strangers; he probably thought we were not as articulate as Senator Browne is &mdash; I am not quite as articulate in the language as Senator Browne.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzsimons made a point the other day that had been made to him by a taxi driver who said that sometimes people who are very líofa i nGaeilge appear to use it to embarrass others who are not quite as líofa.  The taxi driver made the point that continentals never do that.  Certainly the people of the Gaeltacht went out of their way to be understanding as far as our shortcomings in the language were concerned.</P>

      <P>On the question of the business of the House, before we resume I can confirm that the Insurance Bill which was circulated this morning will be debated by Dáil Éireann this afternoon and it is anticipated that that debate will be concluded at 6.30 p.m.  Accordingly, it would be suitable if we took it at 7.30 p.m.  We would then have to deal with item No. 2 which is in progress, item No. 3 which requires three hours, with the Insurance Bill and with an earlier signature motion.  If we are going to sit late, Members of the House might like to take a break between 6.30 and 7.30 p.m. and if we are to allow three hours for the private motion in the name of Fianna Fáil Senators it will be necessary to commence that motion at 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Before the Adjournment I was speaking about Radio na Gaeltachta and the many opportunities we had of listening to Radio na Gaeltachta during the by-election campaign in Donegal and what a great pity it is that Radio na Gaeltachta cannot be received in many parts of the country.  The broadcasting hours of Radio na Gaeltachta should be considerably lengthened and the range of programmes increased.  Having said that, I must say that I found the programmes on Radio na Gaeltacha very interesting.  I believe that RTE should consider broadcasting Radio na Gaeltachta on a wave band apart from VHF.</P>
      <P>Regarding Irish in the community it is essential, as the plan says, that an environment be created in which people would feel encouraged to use Irish in their everyday lives, knowing that they can rely on positive support from the State and other authorities.  The position of the Irish language would be greatly improved if every Government Department and official body ensured that bilingual versions of all forms and informational material were made available and if the use of Irish in dealing with these bodies was encouraged and welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basic to the success of this plan so far as the community are concerned is that the general public be made aware, through the media, of what precisely the plan contains and what the targets are. This is one of the areas in which radio and television have a very important role to play if this plan is to be successful.  Part 3 of the plan deals with education.  Down through the years teachers, especially at primary level, have provided a great service in regard to the Irish language.  If the language is in grave danger today, the teachers are not the ones to be blamed. The efforts of teachers in relation to the language was not matched with a similar commitment on the part of parents or of the public.  The implementation of the recommendations contained in this section of the plan is desirable and can lead only to an improvement in the position of the Irish language in the educational system.  The last section of the plan deals with the role of the State in the promotion <Col N="136" /> of the language.  As in other sections of the plan, the proposal and the recommendations are reasonable and feasible. I welcome the proposal that Bord na Gaeilge will present a yearly report on the progress of the plan to the Minister for the Gaeltacht who, after consultation with a Cabinet sub-committee especially appointed for this purpose, will place this report before the Dáil.  It will then be published.  I would hope that this House, too, will have an opportunity to debate that annual report.</P>
    <P>The final proposal in the document is that a Joint Oireachtas Committee be set up to consider the plan.  This is what is called for in the motion we are debating and I support that call.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir be mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil mé thar a bheith sásta go nglacfaidh an pobal i gcoitinne leis an bplean seo mar feicfidh said go bhfuil ciall agus réasún ann agus go bhfuil géarghá leis más mian linn an teanga a shabháil agus a chur chun cinn.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach báire Bord na Gaeilge a mholadh as ucht an doiciméad seo atá curtha le chéile acu. Tá an-ghaisce agus obair curtha isteach ann agus an-chuid dea-mholtaí déanta ann maidir le cúrsaí Gaeilge a chur chun cinn &mdash; obair phráinneach i láthair na huaire.</P>
      <P>Ón doiciméid seo tá sé soiléir go bhfuil meath ag teacht ar an teanga labhartha fiú ins na Gaeltachtaí agus caithfear stop a chur leis seo láithreach sara mbeidh ár dteanga náisiúnta caillte ar fad.</P>
      <P>Sa phlean seo tá scrúdú déanta ar chúrsaí teangan sa Ghaeltacht, sa phobal i gcoitinne, i gcúrsaí oideachais agus i gcúrsaí Stáit agus tá moltaí áirithe curtha ar aghaidh.  Maidir leis an nGaeltacht tá sé ráite sa doiciméad go bhfuil úsáid an Bhéarla éirithe coitianta de réir a chéile sa Ghaeltacht ina lán cúrsaí sóisialta, tráchtála agus oideachais agus le blianta beaga anuas i réimse an teaghlaigh féin. Tá sé deacair na rudaí seo a shéanadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir leis an bpobal i gcoitinne deir an plean seo nach bhfuil Gaeilge labhartha ach ag an gceathrú cuid de na daoine lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Tá creidiúint ag dul don 25 faoin gcéad seo agus is trua <Col N="137" /> nach féidir an uimhir a mhéadú.  Ó thaobh oideachais de, deir an plean go mbeadh sé sásúil ag deireadh an chéid seo dá mbeadh cumas maith labhartha sa Ghaeilge ag train den phobal ar a laghad, cumas réasúnta i labhairt na teanga ag tuairim is trian eile agus eolas bunúsach ag an gcuid eile.</P>
    <P>Deir an plean freisin go bhféadfaí níos mó Gaeilge a úsaid sa Dáil, sa Seanad agus ins na heagraíochtaí Stáit eile. Caithfear a admháil go bhfuil faillí á dhéanamh ins na reigiúin seo agus feictear go bhfuil dearcach neodrach ag an Stát i leith na teangan.</P>
    <P>I welcome this plan for the restoration of the Irish language and I agree with the headings under which this aim is to be achieved, that is, (1) Gaeltacht, (2) community, (3) education and (4) State and I look forward to the next number of years when I expect that with the implementation of this plan we will have a bilingual society by the end of the century. To achieve this we need to take a look first at the present Gaeltacht areas where spoken Irish is on the decline for a number of reasons.  In the last ten years a combination of economic, social and cultural influences has led to the increasing use of English in the Gaeltacht areas. These anglicising influences have included the impact of television transmitting the majority of its programmes in English &mdash; a figure of 95 per cent has been quoted &mdash; the linguistic effects of industrialisation brought about by the gradual influx of English-speaking residents and the reliance of the Gaeltacht people on entertainment in English.</P>
    <P>In relation to television and radio, I strongly recommend that we have a minimum of 20 per cent of programmes in Irish and that the broadcasting hours of Radio na Gaeltachta be substantially extended.  Both of these points have been made already in this debate.  This should be the immediate and first step only, eventually working towards an all-Irish television service.  Lack of finance should not be taken as an excuse in this area if we are serious about the restoration of Irish as our national language.  At a time when the Cabinet are having meetings to discuss the Estimates for the coming year <Col N="138" /> I urge the Minister for the Gaeltacht to make as much money as possible available in order to help the restoration of our language.  The availability of Irish language newspapers and radio and television programmes in the homes is a basic requirement for this restoration.  It is necessary also that there be further development of the theatre and the production of films in Irish.  One pleasant experience I had was when I attended Siamsa Tíre in Tralee recently.  That would broaden one's views and instincts in relation to the way that Irish culture and language, dance and song can be promoted.</P>
    <P>In relation to industrial development within the Gaeltacht, Udarás na Gaeltachta have been reasonably successful and jobs at home are of prime importance for the survival of the Gaeltacht areas. However, this has had a damaging effect on the Irish language due to the influx of English-speaking personnel and is at an alarming stage in some of the Galetacht areas.  To curb this trend we need to establish more Irish pre-school groups for children in the two-and-a-half to five years age group.  In my parish we have one of those schools in existence and it is proving to be very popular and very successful. We need also to increase the number of Irish language youth clubs operating on a regular basis in Gaeltacht parishes.  We need to see that Irish is adequately provided for in adult education courses.  I would welcome the appointment of a cultural officer on a regional basis to revive and promote urban culture.  In my own Gaeltacht area of Baile Mhúirne we recently opened an ionad cultúrtha which will help to promote culture in the area and also conserve aspects of local lifestyle that are being eroded.  The establishing of similar cultural centres in other areas is to be highly recommended.  The community at large have a big part to play in the restoration of the Irish language.  I was pleased to have been invited recently to the opening of Scoil Uí Riordáin scoil lán-Ghaelach in Ballincollig on the outskirts of Cork City.  I would like to pay tribute to the people who were involved in the establishing of that school.  It is a <Col N="139" /> fitting tribute to Seán Ó Ríordán, a man who was born in Baile Mhúirne and who lived most of his life in the Iniscarra-Ballincollig district.  There are about 16 new all-Irish schools of similar nature in the Dublin area.  Local communities have demanded these schools and they have been responsible for establishing them. If this approach could be adopted in other parts of the country we would not have to fear for the survival of the language. The community can play a big part in the establishing of the Irish centres around the country with the help of staff officers from Roinn na Gaeltachta.  These centres will promote the Irish language and will also provide entertainment facilities.  The entertainment aspect would be covered in conjunction with Gael Linn, which would promote musical and other activities. The Irish language would be an essential part of these activities.  The GAA also have a big part to play in the promotion of the language.  They can help to organise special competitions, they can increase the number of clubs with Irish language officers and increase the use of Irish at county board level.</P>
    <P>Living in a Gaeltacht community, one of the events we look forward to annually is taking part in the Comórtas Peile Na Gaeltachta competition, a competition that is held in the different Gaeltachtaí on the June bank holiday each year.  Baile Mhúirne had the opportunity of hosting two of those competitions.  It does tremendous good for the language to bring people together in sports, dance, song sean-nós singing and every aspect of cultural education.  I had the opportunity of being in Connemara on a couple of occasions and in Gweedore in Dún na nGall and one would certainly benefit from such experience.</P>
    <P>From an educational point of view it is important that the Department of Education play their full role in the <i>Action Plan for Irish.</i>  My belief is that Irish is taught in the schools in the same way as Latin.  In other words it is taught as a dead language.  We must ask whether our teachers are properly trained for the actual teaching of Irish.  There should be more emphasis on developing ability in <Col N="140" /> spoken Irish rather than in written Irish. I would agree with the suggestion that renewal courses be provided for teachers in the Gaeltachtaí to improve their ability in Irish and in teaching methods of Irish.</P>
    <P>It is important also that the Department of Education assist the day summer colleges outside the Gaeltacht areas which provide Irish courses for students and grant aid the cost of attending such courses.</P>
    <P>As a Member of the Seanad I believe that I have a duty to become fluent in the Irish language.  I am presently taking steps in that direction.  While I am now living in a Gaeltacht area, I was not born and reared in the Gaeltacht.  I would like that the facilities now available to me would be available to others around the country who would like to become either bilingual or fluent in Irish.</P>
    <P>Ar bhonn an méid atá ráite agam, bheinn ag moladh go mbunófaí comhchoiste Oireachtais chun an plean seo a scrúdú níos déine.</P>

Níl mé in ann comhrá líofa a dhéanamh, to sustain a conversation, ach déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall an méid Gaeilge atá agam a chleachtú anseo agus in áiteanna eile nuair a fhaighim an deis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the biggest failures in the revival of the Irish language is that people who have the language are not encouraged to use it.  This has been a failure in the whole concept of the revival of the language.  Most people are able to say words like dún an doras and lá breá é agus rudaí mar sin but they do not use the language sufficiently.  Efforts should be made to ask people who have the abairtí to use them as they know through their English language version.  We have not succeeded in generating a proper motivation in the school programmes. The entry into the civil service was clearly a deterrent in the revival of the Irish language.  Most of us have phrases or words in our native language but we do not use them as we could and as we <Col N="141" /> should.  We have built up some form of dislike, and if this attitude prevails then we will not generate a great love for the language.  Mistakes probably have been made in the past but we should be careful to avoid this and set about developing a new spirit of motivation for the language. The State can play a bigger role in the revival.  Certainly the civil service can help more because there are many people who speak the language freely and fluently and have done so down the years but they see the futility of continuing that. What they would like is a continuation of the speaking of the language right through their normal lives into Government offices, insurance offices and so on and not to be referred to as they have from time to time as being cranks.  Many of those people in the past who were involved in the revival and teaching of Irish with Conradh na Gaeilge and other organisations felt in some way that they were being let down by the State.  You will find today that very few civil servants can sustain a conversation right through as Gaeilge.  Therefore this great interest that was prevalent in the years past has died down.  The Government, particularly by way of television and radio can play a major role in the revival of the language.  To be fair, Radio na Gaeltachta have been very successful in this regard but I would urge that they might extend their wavelengths to other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Television could do more because the programmes we see at the moment are simply chat shows between a recognised gaelgeóir and somebody who knows the language.  If we had, for example, a Glenroe as Gaeilge, or some of these programmes, it would help greatly.  Also, if personalities such as Gay Byrne, who may not be fluent in the Irish language, were to use abairtí it would be helpful. The same applies to sport personalities. If people such as Eamonn Coughlan were to be heard speaking the Irish language, again perhaps not fluently but using such phrases as tar isteach, cá bhfuil tú ag dul and so on, they would be showing very good example, particularly so far as young people are concerned.</P>
    <P>Greater emphasis should be placed on <Col N="142" /> advertisements as Gaeilge.  We can all remember the famous one &ldquo;tá said ag teacht&rdquo;.  Everybody knew what that meant.  If more of that were implemented it would help greatly in the revival of the language.  If there were more goodwill on the part of the Government and of the Government agencies, if the important people in these instutitions would speak the language, it would be helpful.</P>
    <P>The Department should have special responsibility in the area of planning. Many of the Government agencies have the facility of exempted development. An organisation such as Muintir Chronáin in the Clondalkin area of Dublin having problems with a planning permission whereby they want to set up a cultural centre is not going to do any good for the language.  I would ask the Minister to examine that case and to help these people in so far as the planning permission is concerned.  They are obviously willing and enthusiastic and want to see the Irish language and culture revived in their area and therefore should be given every help possible.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the Gaeltacht and, as other speakers have said, the Gaeltacht is the cradle of the Irish language but the use of the language in fíor-Ghaeltacht areas is shrinking.  That is a fact of life as I know, having been there for some time ar mo laethanta saoire.  The areas within which people speak Irish are definitely declining.  More and more people, especially the young, are using the English language more than they should.  This is to be deplored.  We need the base of the fíor-Ghaeltachtaí. There are Gaeltacht areas being set up in Dublin and in other large cities and towns and this is to be welcomed.  In so far as the Gaeltacht itself is concerned, the anglicising influence is well known and we do not have to study the position too well to realise that that was bound to happen.  We have far too many people who use the English language either living in or having holiday homes in these Gaeltacht areas.  Factories exist in these areas by way of Gaeltacht grants but the workers are not speaking the Irish language. In those areas, too, the courts are taking place as Béarla.  If we are to have <Col N="143" /> Irish spoken as it was spoken previously in the Gaeltacht areas, changes will have to be made in the areas I have suggested. It is known also in the Gaeltacht areas that families are beginning to speak English rather than Irish to their children. Again it comes back to a lack of confidence in the Irish revival movement. If we lose slight of the fíor-Ghaeltacht and of the language there, we will have an uphill battle to revive the language totally.</P>
    <P>We have had reference to a Bill of rights.  I should like to pay tribute to the great work that Conradh na Gaeilge have been doing for the language throughout the years.  The present situation in so far as the Irish language is concerned requires a serious effort in terms of finding a remedy.  The Bill of rights that Conradh na Gaeilge are suggesting would help greatly.  The purpose of a Bill of rights would be to ensure that the language would get full support and that every Department of State would be obliged to implement the statutory obligations laid down by the Constitution.  I do not have to remind Senators that the Irish Constitution states that the first official language shall be Irish and that English shall be regarded as a second language.  I hope that support for the Bill of rights will be forthcoming and will be positive as a result of this particular debate.  It should be supported right across the country.  I understand that local authorities are supporting it.  I should like to add my voice of support for such a Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Nuacht, it is the opinion of many people that the speakers use too much &ldquo;blas&rdquo; agus is deacair a thuiscint cad tá á rá acu.  Perhaps people with less &ldquo;blas&rdquo; might be easier to understand and consequently more helpful to people who want to understand Irish better.  Tá mé i bhfábhar an plean seo agus déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall é a chur chun cinn.  Aontaím leis an dá theangachas.  The bilingual approach is the right approach at this time.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé cheana ba cheart do dhaoine oiread abairtí agus focail Ghaeilge a úsáid gach lá agus is féidir leo.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> I support the action plan.  Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall at all times to have it implemented.  I sincerely hope that it will be successful and I look forward to reading the progress report from time to time.</P>

Molaim Bord na Gaeilge, dream atá ag déanamh a ndícheall ar son ár dteanga thuairim láidir go bhfuil pointe criticiúil sroichte ag an tír seo faoi láthair ó thaobh eacnamaíochta agus cultúir de.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Our identity and viability as a nation are in my view now at a critical point in our history in both the economic and the cultural spheres.  Although many now see our problems as primarily economic, our distinctiveness as a separate race is also under threat.  The main reason for this is the influence of our mass media dominated by commercialised Anglo-American super culture.  A complementary factor has been the failure of our own national media to provide a service which would fully reflect traditional Irish values and customs, or certainly those of rural Ireland.  I believe that an entire generation of Irish men and women have now grown up under the daily influence of Anglo-American values, customs, music, terminology and so on.  It is not surprising, therefore, that we hear of children in traditional Gaeltacht areas now using English as their first language and in breac-Ghaeltach areas only a few elderly native speakers remain.  Even in the rest <Col N="145" /> of rural Ireland terms such as a ghrá, a stór or alanna are no longer to be heard. They are replaced by imported terms such as &ldquo;dear&rdquo; or &ldquo;love&rdquo; or &ldquo;honey&rdquo; and so on.  This is not the ideal the founders of our State hoped to achieve.  Can we really as a race not see that our traditions and customs are being invaded, submerged, if not indeed obliterated, by the very powers from which we had striven for so long to liberate ourselves?  One would certainly feel that terms such as a stór or a ghrá were indigenous to the soil of Ireland, things which were there for centuries.  Of course there is the odd Irish word which has gone into the international vocabulary such as smithereens for smidiríní but they are few and really the exceptions.</P>
    <P>To be realistic, however, we must recognise that if the language is to survive or develop it must be functional.  An Bord Gaeilge have indicated that the Irish language could be used more in the commercial, social and cultural activities of Irish people and a more practical approach could be adopted in the educational sphere.</P>
    <P>In the area of commerce Irish manufacturers have used Irish terms such as Cara matches and Tintawn carpets, Troscán furniture and Siúcra which we will be hearing more about this afternoon. We are being continually advised by the Irish Goods Council to buy Irish, and the vast majority of Irish people would immediately recognise products such as Siúcra, Cara and so on.  Why can we not extend it to bróga, cóta, feol agus mar sin?</P>
    <P>I was thinking this morning of the success Bord Fáilte has achieved.  They have been engaged in promoting tourism to foreigners and yet they have been foremost in using Irish terminology.  We have terms like céad míle fáilte and sláinte and so on as well as Irish folk music and customs which are used with great skill to attract foreign tourists.  Other nationalities when they come here expect us to be different and to have our own distinctive culture.  Even for those reasons, why should we abandon it?</P>
    <P>Bord na Gaeilge have focused on the problem of affording people an opportunity <Col N="146" /> to use the amount of Irish they know.  One way would be for a person to join a branch of Conradh na Gaeilge or the Gaelic League or Ógras, where those exist.  The GAA and Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Eireann have each played an important role in preserving Irish culture.  In the case of Páirc Uí Chaoimh in the south, even our most Anglicised of commentators are able to use that phrase when the necessity arises.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount of goodwill towards the language throughout the country, and a concerted effort should be made by all the national and cultural organisations to stimulate this goodwill. The bilingual question has been mentioned many times throughout this debate, and there is the temptation for people who have the opportunity of using the language in their ordinary daily work to be a little smart and to give the impression that they are a little bit superior. This is a great difficulty experienced by people who should like to improve their language but if it is not all that perfect some of those who think they promote the language are inclined to look down on people who are lesser versed.</P>
    <P>RTE could be used to foster and preserve our native culture just as easily as it has been used to diffuse the Anglo-American slang to areas of Ireland where it was completely foreign.  Of course RTE use lack of finance in reply to every question put up to them about providing more Irish programmes.  Thousands of Irish children of six years and over have not had a single programme in Irish suitable for their age group.  Surely it would be practically as cheap to produce a programme like &ldquo;Bosco&rdquo; in a bilingual fashion as in English, especially as all the other imported programmes like &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; are in the English language. I suppose every age group could claim a somewhat similar situation.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what goes on in other countries.  In Belgium they too have two official languages, French and Flemish. If there is a French film the sub-titles are in Flemish and vice versa and, indeed, if it is a film in the English language it is sub-titled in both languages.  As a start an effort should be made to introduce a similar <Col N="147" /> system in this country.  If we are hard on Radio Telifís Éireann, the pirate radio stations take the biscuit altogether.  I suppose one could expect to have Irish spoken on these radio stations since English is rather scarce on them also.  There are altogether too many colloquialisms, and I look forward to the introduction by the Minister for Culture of his legislation on that issue.  Standards must be set for local and community radio stations whenever they are licensed.</P>
    <P>It is also somewhat sad and disappointing to many Irish people that some of our main churches have neglected to say even the occasional prayer in the language of our forefathers.  Of course they would acknowledge the part the language played in preserving the faith in times past, but for an institution which places so much emphasis on tradition there appears to be something of a contradiction here.  This is surely a great pity, as in almost every greeting in the Irish language there is a blessing invoking the power of the Almighty.  For example, &ldquo;Dia Dhuit&rdquo;, &ldquo;Go mBeannaí Dia Tú&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dia is Muire Dhuit&rdquo;.  In fact the Irish word for &ldquo;greeting&rdquo;, that is, &ldquo;beannacht&rdquo; is synonomous with a blessing &mdash;&ldquo;Beannacht Dia leat&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that our Celtic friends across the Irish Sea in Wales have preserved their own language. This must be partly due to the constant use of their language in Church services.  We must also remember that they were under British rule for over 60 years longer than we.  There is a message there somewhere for us.</P>
    <P>I believe that funds should be more readily available for the encouragement of students and I would like to see a greater use of scholarships, especially for the summer schools.  At present only students of vocational schools qualify for scholarships to the Gaeltachtaí.  This is something that could be remedied.</P>
    <P>On the question of a bilingual approach I should like to see more bilingual application forms for various Departments.  I would object to having English on one side and Irish on the other because in that case people ignore the <Col N="148" /> side printed in Irish.  If we had some of the questions asked with one line in English and the other in Irish people would be able to see before them the translation and perhaps a little of the language and a little understanding would rub off on them.  At the same time you would be taking care not to confuse elderly citizens who would need to complete the application forms for the various Government services.</P>
    <P>There is a competent level of bilingualism in local authorities and they can be relied upon to co-operate with Bord na Gaeilge.  I am sure they have offered a positive response to the board's suggestion. I hope that all State and semi-State organisations will play their part to ensure that the report before the House will get a positive response and that by the time we have the opportunity to consider this programme there will be a very definite improvement in the status of the language.  All that is necessary is a little effort by every citizen in the State.</P>

      <Col N="149" /> Irish was the language of our ancestors for thousands of years and, indeed, continued to be the language of our people until relatively recently.  It was the central theme of our cultural heritage and from time immemorial has played a very important part in the moulding of the Irish nation.  To allow the language to pass into oblivion now would be disastrous. In the last quarter of this century there has been an increase in the number of smaller national groupings, the Basques, the Bretons, the Catalans, to name but a few, who have proclaimed their right to be different and their desire for a separate cultural identity.  The most distinctive characteristic of cultural identity is the use of a common tongue and, therefore, wherever a distinctive language continues to exist its revival is regarded as the keystone of cultural autonomy.  Thomas Davis said:</P>
    <P>A people without a language is only half a nation.  A nation should guard its language more than its territories.  'Tis a surer barrier and a more important frontier than fortress or river.</P>
    <P>Unification of this country will come some day, be it sooner or later, but if the language is lost by this generation it is gone forever.  Many speakers have referred to the fact that the number in the Gaeltacht areas who now speak Irish has been very much on the decline.  It is now at a dangerously low level.  I feel, however, that the Gaeltacht cannot survive unless the people in the rest of the country are making a realistic effort to revive the language and show that they believe in what they are doing.  As well as revitalising the language in the Gaeltacht areas, positive ways must be found to encourage the use of Irish in everyday lives and help towards a better understanding by adults of the need for its revival.</P>
    <P>Emphasis has been placed in this debate on the competency of our schools to teach and create a love for Irish.  I contend that we need to do more in our schools, but it will not be sufficient just to rely on the schools.  For the past 100 years many hundreds of thousands of young children have come out of our <Col N="150" /> national schools only to experience the suffocation of Irish in the living world outside the school.  Why then have we failed?  Why is the revival of this language so difficult?  Because each one of us has to make a commitment.  Each one of us has to be prepared to make a greater effort than we have been able to do so far.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the revival of the language has not the same emotional appeal as unification. The same effort on the part of the individual is not so obviously necessary. The State has not done enough and in many ways has been hypocritical in the matter of language revival.  Irish, as Senator Fallon says, is our first language but Irish is not essential for State appointments. Native Irish speakers who want to transact their everyday business through Irish cannot do so and sometimes are positively discriminated against.  In these Houses of the Oireachtas we must show better example ourselves in the use of Irish.  I am not one to advocate the State becoming any more involved in the administrative, commercial and other sectors of our lives; in fact I have advocated many times here considerably less State involvement.  However, the least we can expect of the Government and State organisations is help to create an environment which is conducive to and positive towards the Irish language.</P>
    <P>We inherited a British-type Legislature and administrative machine and have done precious little to change in order to meet the vastly different kinds of needs and demands.  We have over-centralised and paralysed initiative and created a totally over-dependent society.  The State, however, is only one domain for language renewal but it must be a greater source of inspiration and we must remove the barriers in our legal system.  After all our talk we cannot anywhere in the country transact our legal business through the medium of Irish.  In the Netherlands we find that the Frisians have their own courts but we cannot have them here.</P>
    <P>However little effort the State has made, there is a wide open gap in the commercial and industrial areas where very little at all has been achieved.  Any proposals in the document before this <Col N="151" /> House must take this huge gap into account and that stream of business activity where the use of Irish has never been seen as being helpful has in some way to be penetrated so that we can make some advance.</P>
    <P>As scholars try to evaluate the impact on our people of a Germanic language which is displacing a Celtic language spoken over thousands of years, there are some positive signs.  I remember a few years ago when Galway won the all-Ireland hurling and Joe Connolly, the captain of that team, in accepting the trophy, spoke in Irish only.  As far as I can recall over a long involvement with the GAA it was the first occasion that somebody accepted that all-Ireland trophy and spoke completely in Irish.  Many who listened to him perhaps did not understand everything that he said but there was something in the way he said it which electrified people and almost matched the fluency of hurling with the fluency of Irish, which English is unable to do in that kind of sense.</P>
    <P>We have had, as other speakers have said, a fantastic, musical revival &mdash; men like Ó Riada, Ó Riordáin, Ciarán Mac Mathúna, organisations like Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and others who have contributed enormously to bring people, especially young people, together through our traditional music.  Music, like hurling, expresses our culture in emotional terms.  The question then is how we can best interlock this broad cultural movement and get people to use our own Irish language much more in everyday life.  Somehow these strings must be tied together and the self-help groups that have grown up around the country, the co-operative organisations and these organisations that have been frustrated by the lack of State activity, must take the initiative themselves to channel these forces for good so that we can derive greater national inspiration from our language.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to radio and television and there is no need to over-emphasise them.  For the past 20 years the influence of television particularly has been enormous, enormous for good in <Col N="152" /> some way and enormous for harm in others.  It certainly has a role to play, which at present is not being played, in portraying the Irish language, encouraging it and having programmes that are suitably geared towards the development and the revitalisation of our own language.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned some positive forces; there are of course other forces at work also, economic drift, unemployment, the poverty and the confusion that is in our society.  We need a central binding force &mdash; in short, a national inspiration.  The State, the schools, the home, the Church, our laws and business activities &mdash; can this generation find the course where these vital organs can be interwoven in a national effort to save our Irish language without compulsion and where they can be encouraged to know that it is in our national interests to try to make that language live again and find from that living of the language an inspiration to solve some of the other problems that beset society today?</P>

    <Title>Tuam Sugar Factory: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to make available the necessary finance to the Board of the Sugar Company to continue production of sugar at the Tuam Sugar Factory and is concerned that the development of agriculture will be impaired by the cut-backs in State assistance, and calls for a full Government commitment to the agricultural sector in the overall interests of economic recovery.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion I want to highlight again the saga of the Tuam sugar factory because this saga has been going on for a long time now.  Efforts have been made by public bodies, public representatives, community leaders and, indeed, Church leaders to bring home to the Government the importance and the necessity of keeping this plant operating in Tuam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past 12 months we have been listening to promises that reports are being prepared and studied, and so on. I can tell you and this House that the morale of the workers in Tuam is very low indeed because they do not know at <Col N="154" /> this stage whether this is their last campaign in Tuam.  They have a right now to hear from the Government where they stand in relation to the continued operations of the Sugar Company in Tuam. The reports, I understand, have been presented to the Government and the Department of Finance have made their observations.  The Department of Agriculture have also given their observations and it is now up to the Government to make their decision.  For the sake of the workers, the farmers and the local community in Tuam it is now time for the Government to make that decision and to make it known to the workers and the people of Tuam.</P>
    <P>Both my colleague, Senator Killilea and I, have highlighted in this House before the problems relating to the proposed closure of the Tuam plant.  I want again to put into the record of this House the factual position as regards the Tuam sugar factory and what it means to the local community, to the workers and indeed to the national economy.  Tuam sugar factory was set up in 1934, not solely to make a profit but to promote regional development and employment in the west of Ireland.  Indeed, these social reasons are as valid today as they were in 1934.  It is an excellent production unit for its size but because of the lack of capital investment in the past it is unable to match the large capacity savings of its sister factories.  In 1981 when the possibility of closure was considered, the workers decided that they must play their part in improving the situation and a plan was adopted to this end with three main elements in that plan.  The first was to increase the acreage to 10,000 acres. Over the past three years, because of the work done by the workers themselves, the support they got from ACOT and from the Sugar Company personnel, they have succeeded in increasing the acreage from 4,600 acres in 1981 to 8,500 acres in 1983.  The 1983 figure of 8,500 acres could have been 10,000 acres but, because of the high national demand, a restriction of 8,500 acres was placed on Tuam with similar restrictions on the other branches.</P>
    <P>The second element of that plan was to reduce the losses by the installation of <Col N="155" /> capital equipment.  In 1981 a list of capital equipment was submitted which would have been of significant benefit.  Two specific areas were of particular importance, firstly, the sugar packaging equipment which cost £170,000 and would effect a saving of some £210,000, and, secondly, sugar extraction equipment which cost £120,000 and would effect a saving per year of £90,000.  But, in spite of these arguments, unfortunately low cost capital equipment was provided.  The third element in that plan drawn up by the workers was to reduce the work force by 50 over a three-year period by natural wastage and so on.  By the end of 1983 the permanent work force in Tuam will have fallen by 90 people with a saving of £900,000 per year to the Sugar Company. This has been achieved by natural wastage, early retirements and non-replacements without any friction and has been made up for by greater productivity.  This is evidenced in the production costs of 1982 which increased by a mere 3 per cent, the lowest in the company so far. That shows the commitment of the Tuam workers to maintaining their factory in Tuam and to maintaining their jobs.  The fact that they were prepared, by natural wastage, voluntary redundancies and so on, to effect a reduction in the work force of 90 people by the end of 1983 shows that they are really concerned about the continued operations in Tuam.</P>
    <P>A lot of noise has been made about the losses sustained in Tuam.  We were told that in 1981 there was a loss of £2.5 million.  That loss has been reduced to £1.1 million in 1983.  That has been achieved principally by increased productivity with fewer workers and greater acreage.  This trend of reduced losses can be maintained and, the workers having indicated their willingness to increase further their productivity, a further labour saving of £500,000 is possible.  That, together with the capital equipment savings, will reduce the loss to an insignificant level.</P>
    <P>If you consider the return which this factory is making to the company, to Tuam and the western region in particular, then I do not think any Government <Col N="156" /> in their right senses could even contemplate closure, because Tuam factory contributes £12 million directly to the national economy by way of return to its growers, workers and to the State. Bought-in goods and services for 1982 amounted to £3.5 million.  The cost to the Exchequer in the event of Tuam closure would amount to £2.2 million by way of loss of PAYE, PRSI and the payment of unemployment and PRSI benefits.  That shows that in the present circumstances it would be absolutely ludicrous even to consider the closure of that plant.</P>
    <P>In these days of recession and massive unemployment, factory pull-outs and closures, it is imperative that every job that can be saved must be saved.  We know that the Oireachtas sub-committee some years ago recommeded the closure of this plant, but only after alternative employment would be found.  That alternative employment has not yet been found.  For that reason, we are asking here today by this motion that this factory be allowed to continue its operations in Tuam.  The workers have shown that they can do so and can do so economically.  For that reason I hope that the Minister today will be able to give us an assurance when he replies to this motion that this factory will continue in Tuam.  From the figures that I have quoted it would be absolutely ludicrous even to contemplate its closure at this time.  If the economy was booming and if there was a possibility of some big industry coming to Tuam which would take up the slack from the sugar industry, then maybe one could contemplate a switch over from the sugar factory to that industry.  But there is no possibility of any major industry coming to Tuam and the Government realise that.  Accordingly we are demanding that this factory be allowed to continue and the position of the Government in relation to the factory be made known right away because we cannot allow the despair, gloom and despondency to continue any longer. That is all I will say on the factory.  My colleague, Senator Killilea, will be elaborating further on it in a few moments' time.</P>
    <P>The other part of this motion deals with the agricultural industry in general. <Col N="157" /> This motion has been tabled for some considerable time and even though we were concerned at the time we put down this motion that things were bad in agriculture, they have got steadily worse over the last few months.  It is not just the Fianna Fáil Members of this House who are concerned about the cut-back in State assistance to agriculture.  Every farmer and everybody involved in agri-business is worried by Government's lack of interest in the agriculture industry.  The Government have been in office for almost one year.  During that period they have destroyed the confidence of our farmers by their dismal failure to show leadership at a time of crisis in the agricultural sector.  If one examines some of the decisions made by the Government in the past year, one cannot be blamed for believing that the Government are hell-bent on destroying our greatest industry.</P>
    <P>With one stroke of a pen the Government withdrew in the region of £11 million from the agricultural sector by refusing to accept applications for grants under the farm modernisation scheme. This was a retrograde step and one which the Government should not have contemplated, at least until they had a revised scheme ready to replace the farm modernisation scheme.  The Government may boast that they have saved the Exchequer £11 million but the loss to Irish agriculture and to the building industry is far greater than £11 million. These grants were an incentive to farmers to improve their farm buildings and to make their task easier.  It also gave an opportunity to small building contractors to get useful employment in their own areas.  Unfortunately, those people are now going to their local Garda stations to sign on for the dole.  They would not have had to do this if the Government had not withdrawn applications under the farm modernisation scheme.  Any builders' supplier will tell you that the cancellation of those agriculture grants was the biggest blow they have ever received because they have had to lay off or introduce short-time employment.</P>
    <P>We are told that a new scheme will come into operation in November but we <Col N="158" /> are not told what kind of a scheme it will be or who will qualify for the grants.  I am convinced that only development farmers will qualify for those grants.  If that is so, the Government should tell us, in relation to the west in particular, what they are proposing to do for the 95 per cent of farmers who have no hope of achieving development status.  Are the Government going to say to those farmers, &ldquo;Sorry boys, you have no part to play in our scheme, you had better find some other means of subsistence&rdquo;?  Western farmers are not going to accept that kind of treatment.  They have enough handicaps already to overcome in relation to land structure, fragmented holdings and even the weather without being excluded from any development scheme being introduced by the Government because they will be excluded if this scheme is confined to development farmers.  Fewer than 5 per cent of farmers in the west are in the development category.  The Government have also deprived many part-time farmers of grants under the headage schemes by reducing the qualifying income limit from £5,100 per annum to £3,500 per annum.  Many of those farmers were leaders in their areas because the money they received they ploughed back into the industry and the whole economy benefited as a result.  The last straw, as far as agricultural development is concerned, was the decision by the Government to bring all farmers into the tax net.  Because of this decision, farmers are reluctant to undertake an investment plan.  Coupled with this is the Government decision to impose a charge of £20 for each visit by a Department officer dealing with farm development plus a cut-back in mileage allowance to farm advisers.</P>
    <P>That is the picture of the continued efforts by the Government to undermine the agricultural industry.  Agriculture, despite the continuing concern about structural surpluses, is, and will continue to be virtually the only industry which enjoys a guaranteed outlet at remunerative prices for the greater part of its output. At a time when workers in many other industries face the prospect of a reduced working week, early retirement <Col N="159" /> or, or at worst, unemployment, and when every effort is being made to create additional employment, the income level, stability, dignity and independence of farming, even on quite small farms, cannot be ignored.  The Government should take note of that fact before they introduce any more austerity measures in this area.  The curtailment of grants, the taxation issue and cut-backs to the advisory service to agriculture are nothing short of a direct attack on our greatest industry which in times of recession has demonstrated its ability to survive and a resilience not commonly found in many of our heavily subsidised industries which rely on imported raw materials.</P>
    <P>It now seems that agriculture alone can save the national economy.  The introduction of suitable schemes backed up by an advisory service has made a great impact in the past as can be seen from the result of the small farm scheme, the farm modernisation scheme and the World Bank livestock scheme.  In the small farm scheme, output of participating farmers increased seven and a half times faster than non-participating farmers.  As a result of the World Bank livestock scheme, livestock numbers increased 47 per cent over the first two years of the plan.  Labour income increased by 192 per cent between stage 1 and stage 2. These figures show what can be achieved if the Government have the will to promote suitable schemes instead of disbanding existing schemes as they have been doing for the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Ireland has unique advantages for the production of agricultural commodities and products.  Results from a number of studies have concluded that there is enormous potential for increasing output in agriculture even with our existing technology and our present resources in land and livestock.  However, we need to investigate more fully the human, financial and marketing resources essential to the realisation of that potential.  Ultimately our success in realising the potential of our agriculture will depend on how successful we are in developing viable and profitable agriculture based commodities and products which will compete <Col N="160" /> successfully on both the home and foreign market.  While our performance on foreign markets may be quite impressive, we have been less than successful on the home market in competing with imported food items.  This is evidenced by the level of food imports, which amounted to approximately £753 million for the preliminary year 1982.  This is a very sad statistic.  Clearly, a large percentage of our home market is being captured by goods of foreign origin.  A considerable proportion of this imported food could readily be produced here, providing much needed employment on farms and in processing plants.</P>
    <P>Many food imports are branded products which benefited from very effective marketing, and consumers may develop loyalty to a particular brand. This helps to insulate the branded products against competition.  This makes it more difficult to compete effectively with branded imports.  In order to achieve even partial success we must improve our overall marketing quickly and adopt a very positive approach towards advertising and promotion.  We can increase sales by better packaging and presentation and a better product service.  This is very essential, and it has been brought home to all of us in recent years when we see what we have to compete with from abroad.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the professional approach of our competitors, our marketing seems to be unplanned and ineffective. While millions of pounds worth of potatoes were being imported during 1982, thousands of tonnes of potatoes produced on Irish farms could not be sold at any price.  It appears that a substantial proportion of the home grown crop was left to rot on farms where the potatoes were grown.  This is a national disgrace and should not happen.</P>
    <P>The situation highlights the urgent need to implement a national plan for agriculture which would involve a co-ordinated approach by farmers and processors and take due account of the market needs and opportunities both on the domestic and export market.  The necessary marketing machinery should be established to enable the implementation <Col N="161" /> of suitable marketing plans which would synchronise with the national plan.  The implementation of such a plan integrated with suitable marketing programmes would contribute enormously to the rational and profitable development of Irish agriculture.  Many years ago the Dutch, Danes and the Swedes developed advanced marketing structures &mdash; machinery which made an immense contribution to the development of their agriculture.  Their farmers have the confidence to produce in the knowledge that there will be a stable market for their produce.  It is vital that we also adopt a market orientated approach to the development of our agriculture.</P>
    <P>The implementation of a national plan, coupled with more effective marketing, will help boost our exports and protect our home market from the inroads being made by imported food products.  In the absence of a plan, effective marketing of many products on the domestic or foreign markets becomes very difficult.  At this late stage, a national plan for agriculture must be implemented.  The plan should be a comprehensive and co-ordinated one, designed to facilitate and promote rational development and more effective marketing.  It is important that agencies such as CBF, the co-ops, CSAT, ACOT, the farming organisations and farmers themselves have a very positive market orientation.  The experience and expertise of those organisations already involved in the development of agriculture and in the processing and marketing of agricultural produce should be harnessed in order to achieve the co-ordinated development of a dynamic food sector.  Without this type of approach it may not be possible to maintain agricultural output at its present level.</P>
    <P>In the limited time available I have tried to highlight some of the difficulties that farmers experience in the present climate.  I have put forward some suggestions that might help to eliminate those serious problems that are affecting the agricultural sector at the present time. Everybody agrees that there are problems. A number of people have signed an amendment to this motion here tonight, but most people believe that the Government <Col N="162" /> are not doing enough to help farmers and agriculture in their present difficulties. That has been highlighted by me in the cuts that have been made in grants and so on.  I would ask the Minister, who is present at this debate, to pay more attention to the problems affecting Irish agriculture.  If the agricultural industry fails then there is no point in trying to build up the other sectors, there is no point in encouraging foreign industries and trying to pay them large capital grants to set up their industries.  We have an industry here that has a solid foundation. It has a good future but it needs the determined leadership and support of the Government.  For the past 12 months the agricultural sector has not been getting that support or leadership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I gladly second this motion.  In my contribution to the House, I am going to pay particular and singular attention to the situation regarding the Tuam sugar beet factory.  In saying that, I may be pre-empting the movement of an amendment to the motion which is on the agenda, but I want to point out clearly that the Cathaoirleach should not have accepted that amendment because it is not relevant to the motion that we have down concerning the Tuam sugar factory. I am disappointed and annoyed to think that the Government benches could, on an occasion like this, broaden the sphere by a few simple words and get it through on the agenda with this motion.  It is not relevant to the question we ask.  We are specifically talking about Tuam and Tuam only and we are not talking about the sugar industry in general.  I want to be emphatically clear on that.  It is on the Clár and it probably will be moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to commence by saying clearly and emphatically, and reiterating Fianna Fáil policy as prescribed and as described by the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party both as Taoiseach and Leader of the Opposition when motions similar to this were discussed in the other House, but in particular when he was Taoiseach.  I want to quote from a speech made by him in Tuam at a time when it was very important to the town that the Tuam sugar <Col N="163" /> factory issue would be dealt with at the highest level in Government.  I refer to the statement of 14 July 1982, page 3, where he stated clearly and emphatically</P>
    <P>The location of a sugar factory in this town was not motivated by profit considerations alone but rather to promote development and employment in the West of Ireland.  Special social considerations were and still are a vital factor.  In the view of this Government, the Tuam sugar factory is a necessary and integral part of the whole sugar company complex providing badly needed employment locally and producing a quality product to the Irish consumer.  That is the reasoning behind the Government's commitment to the retention of the Tuam sugar factory and will remain so.</P>
    <P>That still is and will continue to be the Fianna Fáil policy towards the retention and the continuation of not alone the sugar factory but the sugar industry in general on the west coast.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to a volume of the sugar factory monthly magazine called <i>An Biatas</i> in which the Chief Executive, Mr. Maurice Sheehy of the sugar company was questioned on this particular aspect in a question and answer basis, Volume 27, No. 1, May 1983.</P>
    <P>Question: But what is the position now regarding the Tuam Sugar factory?</P>
    <P>Answer: The last Coalition Government decided that Tuam sugar factory should stay open for one year.  Subsequently, the decision was made by the following administration that the Tuam plant would stay open indefinitely. The situation now in May of this year is that we have to produce further plans to the present Government based on the profitable operation of all activities.</P>
    <P>There can never be a denial that this Government changed the course of events by that demand to the sugar company prior to May of this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> I read all of that article from the executive of the sugar company and I looked on it with awe.  Mr. Sheehy was defending the Irish sugar industry and the state that nationally it finds itself in.  In my time associated with the Tuam sugar factory and the life of that county, the factory has been very close not alone to my heart but to the hearts of all the people of Galway.  I claim that the problem of the Irish sugar industry today has not been created by the farmers of this country, by the workers in the sugar industry, but by consecutive Governments in one way, but in particular by the management structure and by the performance of the most recent executive management of the Irish Sugar Company.  If they want to challenge me outside the House, I will back that with facts.  Taking into account the importance of that industry in the west of Ireland, I ask Senators on the Government side to urge and persuade the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture that forthwith the decision will be made that the Tuam sugar factory and the whole catchment area of the west be given the amount of money necessary so that the industry can continue on a viable basis.  The members of the workers' action committee have come to the Minister and the Taoiseach not on one occasion but many times and they have made their case.  The case they made most recently has been the most fundamental part of it.  I would like to refer to one part of their report.  In a letter to the Minister on their submission they made the following statement:</P>
    <P>Our operating loss for this year should be approximately £1.1 million which includes both depreciation and interest on working capital, both of which would remain if the Tuam sugar factory was out of the system now.</P>
    <P>We have arrived at the financial stage when Tuam sugar factory and its operation are no longer a strain on the economic life of the sugar industry in general.  If I am wrong and if the knowledge made known to the workers and subsequently to the Minister is to be contradicted, today is the day it should be done by the Minister.  Today is the day when the Minister <Col N="165" /> for Agriculture, who is here with us, should stand up and say to the people of the west of Ireland, &ldquo;Yes, we will retain the sugar factory and we will make the finances available for it&rdquo;.  That is the catch 22 situation he is in.  The company will still have the losses if it is closed. They will have a lot to gain if it is kept open.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the reasoning behind that statement.  Two years ago when the workers in the factory were asked to make an effort to modernise themselves and to synchronise themselves into the industry, they did so.  As Senator Hussey rightly said, more than 80 jobs have not been filled, so there are 80 fewer working in that industry.  Yet the secret vibes that one gets back from St. Stephen's Green House are that if Tuam ever be reprieved it will be through 100 more redundancies.  You cannot have it both ways.  They started the Tuam campaign today with 86 fewer people operating a bigger tonnage in a campaign than three years ago.  That is a fantastic achievement, something that must be credited to the account of the workers of the Tuam factory.</P>
    <P>Having said that, there is another aspect which one must also take into account.  Since 1974, £46 million has been invested in capital expenditure in the Irish sugar industry in their plants.  Of that total figure, £1.1 million is all that was spent on the Tuam plant.  Is it not plain from that statistic that the executive management of the Sugar Company have feared a nose dive for the Tuam factory and they hoped the people would accept closure?</P>
    <P>I do not know who is going to speak from the other side on this motion but I do not want to hear a general synopsis of our sugar industry as a ploy against this motion.  I beg and beseech those who will be speaking to remember that we are specifically here today talking about and talking on behalf of the retention of the Tuam sugar factory.  We will talk then about the other aspect of it, the farming aspect.</P>
    <P>Last year for the second time in the history of the sugar industry in the best efforts were made by people who wished <Col N="166" /> the Tuam factory to continue.  A few years prior to that, great efforts were made to ask the farmers to grow beet. Last year they over-produced.  This week alone, because the Sugar Company had not made a decision or the Government had not made a decision concerning Tuam, 500 acres of beet will be lost to next year's campaign.  We beseech the Minister to make a statement concerning Tuam here and now so that the programme for next year can begin.</P>
    <P>The people in general do not know the youth involvement in the growing of beet.  The statistics show that in the west 80 per cent of all beet grown is being grown by young farmers.  We hear all this talk about levies for youth and employment for youth and all the balderdash that goes on, and here it is working for itself in the west, but the Government will not give a fair slice of the cake, will not make moneys available to Tuam, or make a statement concerning it.</P>
    <P>The workers' action committee in Tuam have committed themselves totally and unequivocally to making a more viable unit in Tuam.  We have seen the great efforts of the farmers in growing more beet and meeting the demands of the sugar factory for the raw materials. Organisation like the Tuam Chamber of Commerce have travelled from Tuam today to be in the Seanad for this debate, to show how important this decision will be for the whole economic fabric and the commercial working of the town of Tuam and its surrounding district.  That is how serious this is.</P>
    <P>Fifteen minutes is a short time and I have to omit many of the things I wanted to say.  I will end by saying I am personally aware that the inter-Departmental committee who sat to make recommendations on the Tuam sugar factory have sent them to the Government.  Governments have sat on them for some time and failed to make a decision.  I beseech the Minister for Agriculture to make that decision now so that we can go ahead and make a fruitful conclusion so that the sugar industry, the growers and the workers, can be relied upon in the forthcoming year.</P>
    <P>I expect to be calling a vote on this <Col N="167" /> issue here this evening.  In so doing I will note the names that the Government side put to the amendment to this motion.  I do not see one west of Ireland Senator having his name attached to it.  They went further afield to lay the decoy and throw the scent as it were off the Tuam sugar factory issue.  I appeal to Senator Michael Higgins from Galway, from the county in which we live, to sit out on this vote this evening in this House.  I call upon another constituent, Senator Ulick Burke, to sit out on the vote in this House this evening.  I call upon the Roscommon Senator Connor to sit out on this vote. I call on Senator Durcan and Senator Higgins from Mayo to sit out on this vote this evening; and of course to finish it off I call on the Donegal Senator, Senator Loughrey, to sit out on this vote.  I do not mean that by sitting out they want to bring down this Government.  I want them by sitting out to claim for us that Seanad Éireann is a functional place and a decision-maker, that we will ensure by our votes in the strongest possible terms that this Government will make the correct decision in favour of the retention of the Tuam sugar factory.  I have long gone past my time.  I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. I want to say in conclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Give me one minute.  I note the absence from this House today on a most important issue of Senator Michael Higgins.  He must come out from under the bed and make the necessary decision to impress upon the Government, and to tell the Taoiseach that he will no longer serve on that side, if the right decision is not made for Tuam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after Seanad Éireann and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;supports the efforts of the Government to put the sugar industry on a viable footing and to ensure <Col N="168" /> the continued progress and expansion of Irish agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In moving the amendment I would like at the outset to make it very clear to Senator Killilea that the amendment in no way was put down to distract attention from the sugar factory in Tuam.  Tuam is part of an overall scenario &mdash; it cannot be taken in isolation.  It is part of the Irish sugar industry and for that reason we must be sensible and reasonable.</P>
    <P>Time being very limited, one cannot deal with all the matters one wants to. Very briefly, I believe earnestly that when we refer to the Irish sugar industry and its pitfalls and weaknesses we do not in any way suggest the closure of the Irish Sugar Company plant in Tuam.  That is an important point.  Senator Killilea assumed, incorrectly, that the omission of names of persons from the amendment more or less automatically suggested that.  That is not the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why are they not on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like briefly to run through some facts in relation to the Irish Sugar Company in its totality.  The sugar company was profitable every year except for three, between 1934 and 1979. The company through all those years was one of the most progressive in the semi-State sector.  It contributed greatly to rural Ireland and to the development of Irish agriculture through beet processing, sugar manufacture, importation of fertilisers and making them available to farmers, developing and manufacturing agricultural machinery especially for the beet crop, breeding and developing beet seed varieties especially adaptable to Irish conditions, providing an agricultural advisory service for the farmers and many other services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition it set up a food industry, Erin Foods with many factories located in rural areas providing employment in remote areas like Skibbereen, Glencolmcille and so on.  In recent years, let us be factual and frank, in 1979-1980 we saw a loss of £11 million.  In 1980-81, the loss was £12 million; and in 1981-82 the loss <Col N="169" /> was £22 million.  That makes a loss of £45 million in that three-year period.  Unfortunately we can look forward to a further loss at the end of the current year.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for these heavy losses, such as large investment of capital in sugar factories, heavy losses sustained in Erin Foods, the unsatisfactory financial base of the company, high inflation in Ireland with relatively low price increases for beet in the EEC.</P>
    <P>While conceding that some of those points are very relevant, there is no doubt that we must look back and see where things went wrong.  I would submit that failure to modernise our sugar plants before entering the EEC caused one of our major problems.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that Erin Foods has been a major loss maker since its inception. Yet nothing appears to have been done either to contain the losses or to bring the company into profitability until the last couple of years by closure of a number of plants such as Carlow, Skibbereen, Tuam, part of Matterson's in Limerick, east Cork and so on.  I would say that had rationalisation taken place at an earlier time many problems could have been avoided.  Erin Foods had been subsidised by the sugar industry down through the years and it appears that the board and management were negligent in letting this situation continue to the extent that the sugar company itself was put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Killilea that there has been negligence on the management side of the sugar company.  The company got from the State £30 million in October 1982.  A Bill was passed by the Oireachtas to enable the State shareholding to be increased to £75 million.  The company, however, previously got £7 million in shares from the State.  The balance that could be provided by the State to bring the shareholding to £75 million is £38 million.  We now understand that the company is requesting that this equity be provided almost immediately.</P>
    <P>I would say that the Government are most anxious that this once great semi-State body should be properly structured and financially organised.  The Government <Col N="170" /> want to see it return to profitability including, I would submit, a Tuam dimension.  They must ensure nevertheless that the taxpayer will get value for the money he invests.  At present all the sugar companies within the EEC are showing substantial profits.  The British Sugar Corporation showed a profit for last year of £60 million.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that there is a major problem at management or executive level in the Irish Sugar Company.  Senator Killilea referred to this and I agree on that point.  The management problem was highlighted by the major fraud that took place in Erin Foods which has not been satisfactorily explained.  A further fraud recently occurred in Carlow for which prosecution took place a short time ago.  These two factors, together with a claim from the worker-directors requesting on behalf of the workforce that the Chairman and Managing Director should resign, leave one with an uneasy feeling that all is not well at high level in the sugar company.  Clearly the Government must satisfy itself on these issues before taking action.</P>
    <P>The Tuam sugar factory, as part of an overall rationalisation programme, requires rationalisation, and when we talk about rationalisation we must mean rationalisation in the true sense of the word.  It must not be just a cover-up phrase.  I suggest that the social dimension which applies in Tuam must be taken into account by the Government before any decisions are reached with regard to that factory.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that the Government will weigh up all these decisions very fully.  We should be thinking very seriously as to how we can increase our A quota from 182,000 tonnes at present, which this year we will reach and which last year we reached, and our B quota of 20,000 tonnes.  These quotas should be increased to a level of 200,000 tonnes in the A quota and 30,000 tonnes in the B quota.  We ought to have a situation which obtains within the rest of the European countries where 25 per cent of the total A quota is the B quota.  At present the percentage is ten.  That is important.</P>
    <P>Having said that about the sugar company <Col N="171" /> I want to make some remarks about the rest of the agricultural scene.  We talk here about expansion of Irish agriculture. Reference was made earlier to lack of confidence, to the erosion of confidence in the last 12 months.  It is ridiculous for anybody to ignore the fact that long before 12 months ago confidence was well and truly shattered in Irish agriculture. This is something that has been coming for many years particularly since 1979 but with Government direction and the introduction of their plan for agriculture we will see that confidence changed and improved significantly.  The Farm Modernisation Scheme will be reintroduced shortly and that will help.  The present taxation system was referred to. There is nothing wrong about assessing people for tax provided the system is equitable and fair.  Of course, tax assessment and tax liability are different things.</P>
    <P>Our success or failure as a country which relies so heavily on agriculture will depend on our success or failure in securing from the EEC the very best deal we can.  At present we have a very serious situation confronting us in the proposal to introduce a milk super levy.  I believe that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, backed by the entire Cabinet, are doing trojan work to make certain that we will come out of this as unscathed as possible.  Our leaders have been fighting a very tough lone battle in Europe on behalf of the Irish people.  The same can be said of the Irish farming organisations.  They are very much alone at farming organisation level in Europe.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the super levy proposed, or a quota system, call it what we like, suggests that £200 million would be taken out of the Irish economy.  That would reduce our net beneficiary situation, which is £500 million, by £200 million, which would erode very seriously the advantages of being in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We must look at the situation realistically. The Government need the support of all farming organisations and of all political parties in ensuring that we get <Col N="172" /> from the European discussions at the present time the very best arrangement possible.  If we can succeed in getting exemption for a realistic period of time &mdash; we would hope for from five to seven years &mdash; we can then move forward. Farming is very much part of the economic situation at present.</P>
    <P>There are a lot of farmers in serious financial difficulty, and without the opportunity of their moving forward and developing their enterprise, there is no way they can solve their problem.  We must ensure that for the future the price increases will accord with inflation.</P>
    <P>The national plan which the Government will soon be producing will be concentrating on livestock number increases, on credit and on those vital areas that will move agriculture forward.  Taking this composite motion dealing with the Sugar Company and dealing with the economy there are three important factors.  The whole structure of the Sugar Company has to be looked at with particular reference to management.  We must consider also the Tuam factory and have regard to the social implications as well as to economic factors, bearing in mind that the Sugar Company want to close the Tuam factory.  This is no secret.</P>
    <P>We must address ourselves very seriously to the financial problems at European level, because without succeeding at that level there is no point in engaging in smaller things, important though they may be in their own right.  Irish agriculture will move forward very firmly.  It gives me great pleasure to move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to partake in this debate.  I regret I was unable to be present for all of Senator Hussey's speech but I am sure that as usual it was very constructive and well ordered.  One of my problems these days is that I do not have enough time to attend to all the business in my Department.  In the media today I note that I have been criticised for not being in Germany.  It is physically impossible <Col N="173" /> to be there, having returned from Luxembourg after two days of almost non-stop meetings and having to attend the Dáil and Government meetings today and tomorrow.  I would have loved to have gone to Cologne and Munich but if I had gone I expect that I would be accused of being on a junket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a motion of two parts covering as it does the specific subject of sugar, specifically, Tuam, and the more general agricultural development area.  Dealing first with sugar I might mention that Senators already have had the opportunity on three occasions in the past three years of considering the affairs of the Sugar Company. Those who were Members of the House at the time will remember debating, in March 1981, the excellent report on the company drawn up by the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  They will recall the committee's identification of the fundamental problems facing the company: how to set their finances in order, and how to tighten up the operation on a strengthened capital base, so that losses would become a thing of the past.  Since then, Government action has concentrated on these two separate but interdependent areas, the restructuring of the company's capital and the rationalising of their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before considering what has been achieved so far under these two headings, I should like to place once more on the record of this House the reasons for the Sugar Company finding themselves in their present condition.  It is not, by any reckoning, a condition which we can view with complacency.  For the past four financial years &mdash; Senator Killilea alluded to this in his contribution and he said he did not want to hear all the same reasons repeated &mdash; losses have been substantial: £11 million in 1980, £12 million in 1981 and £22 million in 1982, though there were extenuating circumstances for that very large figure.  The accounts to be drawn up for the year ended on 30 September last will not be much more <Col N="174" /> encouraging.  On that same date, the company's borrowings were well in excess of £70 million.  The pattern of payments for beet in the past year means that borrowings will be little short of £100 million by the end of February next.</P>
    <P>This is, by any standards, a pretty black picture.  It depicts an enterprise which, if it were privately funded, would long since have gone to the wall.  It is a measure of the Government's concern for the future of the sugar industry that this was not allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>What, however, they are doing is to insist that the hard decisions necessary to bring the company back to profitability be taken.  Indeed, some hard decisions had also to be taken by our predecessors in office in relation, for example, to the closure of food processing at Carlow and Skibbereen.  When mentioning figures and the number of people who have been let go from the Sugar Company and the various factories in recent times, I might point out that three years ago the Sugar Company employed more than 3,700 people.  Today they employ 2,795 people so there has been a massive reduction in numbers right through the company's operations and not specifically in Tuam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the closure of Erin Foods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It has been very broadly based throughout the company's operations whether it was Thurles or Carlow, Mallow or Tuam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister should respond to interruptions from Senator Killilea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>How could one resist interruptions where Senator Killilea is concerned? He is at his best when he is being interrupted.  We always say one should not provoke him.</P>
      <P>That is a very substantial figure of redundancies, virtually 1,000 in the past three years.  This Government have set the standard of commercial viability of the Sugar Company as a target and have directed the company to perform accordingly. Funds are being committed to the task of getting the company back on their financial feet, of getting the balance-sheet right.</P>
      <P>Up to this, rationalisation has struck most directly at the industrial food business. It gives me no pleasure to say this but we have to recognise that what appeared in the early sixties as an adventurous home-based initiative in the field of agricultural processing is now not so successful as had been hoped.  Of the original Erin Food factories, only Mallow will be remaining in the industrial business, that is the business of preparing bulk-dried vegetables for incorporation into soup mixes and other products. Thurles still has the branded food business and the meats end of Matterson's in Limerick is also profitable.  The East Cork Foods plant at Midleton is on the point of closing down and the canning operation of Matterson's in Limerick closed last March.</P>
      <P>We have, of course, learned lessons from this experience, hard lessons which will be of considerable help in our commitment to the food industry and which are also of vital relevance in securing the future of our sugar industry.  The sugar industry must receive our full attention. If we are not competitive in producing sugar we will be up against it in terms of imports just as in the case of vegetables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the capital base of the company was broadened last year, one of the conditions attached to the provision of the additional funding was that a rationalisation plan be produced by the company pointing the way towards their return to <Col N="176" /> viability.  This plan, backed up with projections and relevant financial data, was submitted in June.  It has been examined by the Departments of Agriculture and Finance in great detail and further clarifications and explanations have been sought and obtained.  The conclusions drawn will form the basis of the decisions for action on various fronts that the company propose to take in the next three years.  In recommending to the Government any further injections of capital I propose to monitor closely the efficiency and effectiveness of the company at all levels and the extent to which they meet the targets they have set themselves.  I emphasise the words, &ldquo;at all levels&rdquo;, from the top right down to the bottom.</P>
    <P>As I stated, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Finance have been scrutinising the report from the Sugar Company for some months past.  It went to the other Departments in the Government some time ago and we have had their views on that report and on our observations.  The matter is now being submitted to the Government for decision.  I hope we will be in a position to decide within a reasonable time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen. The Senator probably knows from reading the newspapers that we are discussing the Estimates at the moment in considerable detail, and it may be as long as a month before a decision will be made.  I would not like to be too categorical in that regard, but I would be asking for a decision as soon as we can possibly have one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

      <P>It was Harold Wilson who said that a week is a long time in politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action plan by the company covers the whole spectrum of their activities. Improved plant will lead to savings in manpower and energy.  Computerisation will lead to a more efficient use of resources.  Reorganisation will eliminate unnecessary duplication of functions. This is all non-contentious, and in line <Col N="177" /> with good, I might say essential, business practice.</P>
    <P>One item in the plan is not non-contentious, however, as the terms of the motion before the House remind us.  The company have indicated that progress on their path towards viability requires that they cease sugar production at the Tuam factory at the end of the 1983-84 campaign. It is hardly necessary for me to say that the future of this factory has been under consideration for some time past. The broadly-represented joint committee I referred to at the outset made the first formal proposal in relation to the closure of Tuam.  Since then the matter has come before Government on two occasions, in September 1981 and in June 1982.  Very shortly the present Government will be asked to consider the future of the Tuam factory.</P>
    <P>What will the Government have to decide?  They will have to assess whether the considerations that up to now have led to postponement of closure are such as to justify the subsidisation of more than 200 full-time jobs and about the same number of seasonal jobs, to the extent of some £3 million a year.  That is what it is costing the company to produce sugar at Tuam instead of producing the same quantity elsewhere in their more efficient factories.  This is about £12,000 per annum for each full-time job equivalent at the factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen that figure debated and contradicted, but those are the figures which we have received from the company.  This is what the taxpayer would have to provide to keep Tuam open.  It will be for consideration whether the taxpayer can do better for Tuam and the west in other ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have met the Tuam workers' action committee.  I have been impressed by their attitude, their genuine desire to safeguard the factory and their willingness to consider possibilities for greater efficiency and economies.  As I have said before, I have been impressed very much by the attitude they have adopted.  They realise the predicament the Government <Col N="178" /> find themselves in and are doing everything possible.  I said to them I would like if they would agree to some more economies and efficiencies but by and large I find that they are doing their best.  I impressed on them that the Sugar Company as a whole must be viable.</P>
    <P>The Government will also have to bear in mind the whole question of the future of the sugar industry in Ireland.  Sugar is a product covered by a market organisation under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Economic Community. Within the Community there is complete freedom of movement for sugar produced within Member States' A and B quotas.  The total quotas for the Community come to about 11 million tonnes of white sugar.  Community consumption is about 9.5 million tonnes a year.  Therefore, 1.5 million tonnes are surplus to requirements.  Usually this surplus is exported from the Community.  Therefore milk is not the only commodity that is surplus in the European Economic Community.  Sugar is also fairly considerably in surplus.  However, if one of our EEC partners were to decide that the Irish market offered a more profitable outlet for its sugar, such a development would have serious reprecussions indeed for our relatively high-priced sugar market. It must be remembered that we could not block such imports, that we could not set up a system of protection.  This is something that some politicians in this country conveniently forget when it suits them.  Within the Community we cannot stop imports of agricultural produce, or any produce for that matter, from our fellow members of the EEC.  It so happens that some of those members, particularly the French and the Belgians, and the Germans for that matter, are able to produce sugar at considerably smaller cost than we can produce it in this country. If they decided to export sugar to this country it would place our sugar industry in considerable jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware even from today's news report of the presence of imported Community sugar on our market. I think the news report stated that we were importing as much as 10,000 tonnes per annum.  My information is that <Col N="179" /> we import about 6,000 tonnes per annum. Such imported sugar has had most effect, so far, in the manufacturing sector and has severe implications for overall sugar pricing.  Unless sugar production costs can be cut to something approaching those incurred by our EEC partners, imports will continue, will increase and will force us out of our own market.  The claim has been made that French sugar can be sold here at £10 a tonne cheaper than Irish sugar.  That is something we must look at very seriously, bearing the possible consequences in mind.  Let there be no doubt about it, our sugar production costs are high.  They are reflected in retail prices which are above the European norm.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the difference is accounted for by differences in the cost of production.  These differences extend right through the process from field to factory.  On the field, our been yields and sugar contents are lower.  The distances over which we are prepared to transport beet to factories are, in continental eyes, quite unacceptable.  Our unit energy costs are high, partly because of under-utilisation of plant, and partly because more energy is needed to get the sugar out of the beet, given the lower sugar content.</P>
    <P>I notice that Michael Dillon in <i>The Irish Times</i> today comments on the fact that while the yield in the sugar beet harvest is quite high, the sugar content is well below average.  That will create problems for us this year.  Also we draw sugar beet to factories from considerable distances whereas on the Continent they draw their sugar beet from within close proximity, generally within a radius of ten or 15 miles of the sugar beet factory itself.  That contributes to the fact that they can compete on much better terms.</P>
    <P>Finally, by European standards, our factories are overmanned.  All of these disadvantages are particularly acute in the case of Tuam.  I remember being in Tuam during the summer.  It was one of the few pleasant and relaxing days I have had since coming to office.</P>

      <P>Some of those people who make most noise and who are most unreasonable might bear in mind that there is a very definite pattern about the growing of sugar beet in this country.  I heard it argued in Galway that twice or maybe ten times as much sugar could be grown if the contracts were provided by the company.  That very same argument applies in every county.  At Christmas I was inundated with constituents of mine who wanted beet contracts for 1983-84. That was the time when contracts were being drawn up.  Sugar beet is probably the best money crop at present.  Farmers are intensely interested in growing more beet.  But, unfortunately, we cannot give them the acreage because of the quota system which exists in the EEC.  We are extremely restricted in that regard.  I have here a list which I requested from the Sugar Company as to the sugar beet acreage grown in the various counties in Ireland.  This list is rather interesting.  The fact is that a sugar plant can exist by getting sugar from virtually any part of the country.  The factory does not have to be on the spot itself.  For instance, Wexford has not got a sugar beet factory yet it grows more beet than any other county in Ireland, even more than is grown in Cork.  It does not have a factory of its own.  It grows 21,000 acres approximately while Cork grows 20,000 acres.  On the other hand, Sligo, or Leitrim do not grow any beet while Mayo grows 467 acres. Galway grows 2,973 acres.  Waterford, half of which is covered by mountains&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not include Limerick in order to save Senator Kiely embarrassment. In that county is grown the vast area of 90 acres of beet.  I take the Senator's point.  The Government have yet to decide on the future of the Tuam factory. They will have to decide on the basis of the kinds of considerations I have mentioned. For my part I am convinced that the sugar industry in Ireland has a future. I am also convinced that the will to put the industry back on a sound footing exists within the Sugar Company itself. When the Government make their decision they will do so in the light of the same convictions.  As I stated some months ago, I have an open mind, as have the other members of the Cabinet, as to the future of the Tuam factory, irrespective of the recommendation of the Sugar Company.  The same applies to my colleagues in Government.  But there are tremendous financial pressures on the Government at present, and one would <Col N="182" /> have to accept that we must bear all points of view and all those matters in mind.</P>
      <P>Turning now from the specific sugar area to the overall area of agricultural development, I should like to focus what I have to say on the economic problems which the people of Ireland face today and on how the agricultural sector can contribute to their solution by making better use of our land.  It is essential that the precise nature of our current economic situation be fully appreciated.  In this connection, we must consider not only the position here in Ireland but also the wider international front, since we in this country are so dependent on external trade.</P>
      <P>Our current economic situation is extremely serious.  The extent of the problem can be seen from the five main economic indicators &mdash; growth, employment, prices, the balance of payments and the national Exchequer situation.</P>
      <P>In terms of economic growth, since 1980 there has been no increase in the gross national product.  The prospect for 1983 is no better.  Indeed, taking account of changes in the population, which during the past decade has been growing at 1 ½ per cent per year, it is evident that on a per-head basis our economy has declined since 1980, by some 4 per cent. We are, of course, not alone in this situation, but the fact that other countries have had similar experiences does not make our problem any easier.</P>
      <P>The growth in population in the seventies was accompanied by a similar increase in employment, but compared with the position two years ago the level of employment today shows a considerable disimprovement.  For this reason, the Government continue to give a high priority to policies that will increase the level of employment, particularly youth employment.  However, the problem of increasing employment has to be seen against the background of large redundancies, some of which unfortunately have occurred in the businesses of major traditional employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will, however, only succeed in increasing our present level of employment and creating new jobs if the rate of <Col N="183" /> growth in costs is brought down below the levels prevailing in competitive countries. This means that we must achieve a substantial reduction from the present 10 per cent level of inflation to a level of around 5 per cent.  This reduction will have to be achieved in spite of the difficulties of reducing the current deficit and the problems on the external front.</P>
    <P>The other economic factors I want to mention have perhaps a less immediate impact on the man in the street but are just as vital to our future national wellbeing. The first is the balance of payments position &mdash; the extent to which we pay for the food, materials and services that we buy from abroad.  During the years up to 1978 we had run a small adverse balance on our current account; this deficit was easily sustainable because of the growth of capital investment with which it was associated.  Since 1978 the balance of payments deficit had increased to reach £1,400 million in 1981.  It has now been brought under control, and is forecast to fall this year to only a quarter of the 1981 level.</P>
    <P>Our national Exchequer position is far more serious.  The budgetary measures which we have already taken mark a positive and determined effort to return to the principle of living within our means.  Even with the increases in taxes and the cuts in expenditure announced in the budget last January, we will expect a deficit of £968 million on current account this year.  The Government's objective of ending borrowing for day-to-day purposes over a period of five years involves a reversal of the recent trend towards increasing Exchequer deficits.  To achieve this aim will involve many difficult and unpopular decisions.  We will not, however, bring down our high rate of inflation or bring our economy back under control unless we succeed in making the Exchequer pay its way in its current spending programme.</P>
    <P>It is against this economic background that we must plan the development of our agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>The Government, as their record of action on their programme for the agricultural <Col N="184" /> sector has shown, are determined to implement new ideas and new policies.  The achievement of our basic economic and social objectives will, however, depend primarily on the response to these initiatives.</P>
    <P>There are three basic sources from which improvements will come.  I do not want to put these into any special order &mdash; progress in the agricultural sector depends on all of them.  These three sources are the Government, the EEC and the farmer.  The Government fully recognises their own responsibilities and, as I have said, we have already put into operation many new measures.  However, the severe limitation of resources has eroded our capacity to complete our programme in full.  Notwithstanding this, the Government have committed additional expenditure towards the support of farmers' incomes.  For example, over the 12-month period ended March 1980, some 100,000 direct payments totalling £23 million were made to farmers under the various headage schemes.  In the current 12-month period, over 400,000 payments will be made, totalling over £105 million, of which about half comes direct from the Exchequer.  This represents a substantial underpinning of farmers' incomes by Government action.  The balance comes from the European Community which, as I mentioned, is the second source of farm improvement.  The other main contribution from the EEC takes the form of support through the CAP for the prices of our principal agricultural products and also through special aid measures.  As Senators know, I have a little problem in Europe at the moment with one of those products, that is, milk. Since Ireland's accession to the EEC, the Common Agricultural Policy has given enormous benefits by way of market supports for our farm produce.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey said that we are not doing enough for the farmers.  When I was in Opposition I said the same thing to the Government of the day.  I want to point out that I have no objection to Opposition Deputies or Senators, or Government and Independent Deputies or Senators saying publicly that the Government should provide more money <Col N="185" /> for agriculture.  I need a little push a lot of the time.  We all do, whether it is Deputy Lenihan, Deputy Dukes, Deputy Gibbons or Deputy MacSharry.  If the farming lobby outside in the farming organisations or here within Leinster House is criticial and demands more, I do not think that is such a bad thing.  I do not object to it.  It gives me a little more leverage at the Cabinet table, provided the demands are made in a constructive way.  We can never do as much as we would like to do for our own Department, our own industry.  There is only so much to go around.  One must have a very broad aspect in life&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Conditions in the agriculture sector here have improved remarkably, albeit from a very low starting point.  However, at the same time, sizable problems of over-production now exist in the Community, giving rise to considerable budgetary commitments and difficulties. It would also be quite unrealistic to maintain in 1983 that the Community arrangements should remain totally unchanged.  This is not to say that we go along with those countries who would wish to see a dismantlement of the CAP guarantee system &mdash; quite the reverse.</P>
      <P>At the European council at Stuttgart the Taoiseach was quite clear in his statement on Ireland's position.  He indicated that any future discussions would have to take account of such important elements as farm income and food security, as well as the wider issues of trade and employment. He also spelt out the unacceptability of any proposals which could freeze existing production levels, for a country like Ireland, with low productivity and heavy dependence on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always defended and will continue to defend the basic CAP principles of market unity, financial solidarity and Community preference.  I want it to be plainly understood that Ireland will vehemently <Col N="186" /> resist any attempts made to dilute these fundamental principles, and it is primarily because the Common Agricultural Policy is of such importance to us that we will continue to be its defender from unjustified attack.</P>
    <P>The Community must find a solution to the problem of market imbalance which is posing such a threat to its continued survival, and we will be prepared to support reasonable and equitable measures to this end.  It is now obvious to all that we can no longer depend on the generous EEC price increases negotiated in the past.  The reality is that we will have to generate much of what we gain through our own efforts.</P>
    <P>The solution adopted at the end of the year will have far-reaching consequences if it is to resolve the persistent financial problems which have plagued the Community for so long and inhibited the expansion of existing policies and the development of much needed new ones. However, I am confident that these decisions will be taken in a Community spirit, that they will be acceptable to all member states, and will ensure the future development of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Given the serious economic situation, we cannot resolve the difficulties of our agricultural sector, or of any other sector, through recourse to even larger external borrowings.  There is no such easy panacea that we can turn to in order to obtain an instant relief to our ills.  Recovery must come from our own efforts, not from further props in the form of greater borrowing from outside.  Government policy involves a reduction in the current budget deficit and a reduction in borrowing, particularly borrowing from outside the country.  We must make better use of our resources by our own efforts.  This policy must apply not only to our national situation but right down to the individual farm.</P>
    <P>We have a major task in the agricultural sector, one that requires the most positive efforts of all of us who are directly involved in it.  As I have said, we must see that we get the best possible return from all the resources that are already available in the agricultural sector; we can only expect more resources <Col N="187" /> when we have achieved a high level of efficiency in the use of the resources we already have.  This policy must pervade every level of the agricultural sector.  The Department of Agriculture this year will spend a total of about £339 million of which £256 million comes directly from the Exchequer.  We shall be examining every aspect of this expenditure, as well as public expenditure in other areas, to ensure that Exchequer resources generate the greatest possible return.  The availability of Exchequer finance will depend upon the maximum return being derived from the resources already available.</P>
    <P>Every farmer needs to adopt the same approach.  He must look at all of his resources &mdash; land, labour and the capital invested in the farm, as well as his day-to-day expenditures, to see that they are giving the best possible returns.  Of course, many farmers already do this, but the time is now opportune for a further and an even closer scrutiny.</P>

      <P>There is a certain sacredness about agriculture in this country in the way that somebody like myself who does not have a direct connection with-agriculture can often get the impression that he is walking into very dangerous ground by daring to speak about agriculture at all.  But certain industries in this country have very substantial lobbying abilities and are noticed in a very substantial fashion.  I am a member of a branch of the engineering profession <Col N="188" /> which works in an area of manufacturing industry which produces exports almost equivalent to those of the entire beef industry of this country, that is, the chemical industry.  Yet I would not take exception to anybody in this House talking about the chemical industry.  I would be delighted to hear the whole area of manufacturing industry discussed by people from farming backgrounds, from legal and business backgrounds and so on. There is no real reason why people should not speak on the whole area of agriculture and its future in this country, because quite obviously the future economic prosperity of the country and the future of agriculture are inextricably linked.</P>
      <P>The motion, in the best traditions of this House and of Fianna Fáil, is full of noble sentiments.  Nobody, with one or two exceptions I suppose, could disagree with the motion.  The details we could argue about forever, but as the Minister said everybody believes that everybody should lobby vigorously on behalf of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the realities of Irish agriculture? The realities are that it is, as we have had to state publicly in Europe in recent times, pathetically under-developed. As recently as this afternoon in the other House I heard the Taoiseach explain yet again the inadequacy of our dairy industry on the basis of 100 years of commercial exploitation by the other island and so on.  There is, of course, some truth in that, but it is about time that we got away from pointing the finger everywhere else except at ourselves for our own inadequacies.  It is not anybody else's fault that we have a desperately inadequate research budget on agriculture. It is nobody's fault but our own that in the whole area of market research, product development, product research and marketing we have a most inadequate, a most incompetent, a most disorganised agricultural industry.  That is our fault and nobody else's.  The fact that we have not in 60 years of independence managed to develop a single successful innovative product based on agriculture is a reflection on the whole agricultural industry and, indeed, on the whole political <Col N="189" /> system.  The most recent success of an agricultural-based product, the cream liqueur being produced in huge quantities at this stage, was the product of the research of an English-based research laboratory.  Fortunately for us it happens to be manufactured in this country, but the fact that it was not a product of Irish research is a reflection of our inadequacy and the inadequacy of our agricultural development.</P>
    <P>The inadequacy of agricultural education is nobody's fault but our own.  The fact that we have the lowest level of participation in third level education in the area of agricultural education almost anywhere in the world is nobody's fault but our own.  That we produce fewer third level graduates in the area of agriculture is nobody's fault but our own.  That we have a very scrappy, very disorganised system of agricultural education, that we have the most poorly educated farming community in the whole of western Europe, is nobody's fault but our own. Least of all it it the fault of the agricultural community; it is the fault of our tradition and our values and our attitudes to agriculture, and it is a matter for politicians and political leaders to change those values and to create the conditions which will promote different values.  My father used to talk to me at great length about the whole idea of leaving the fellow who would not be good at school at home to do the farming, and this has been the ruination of huge areas of Irish agriculture. Again, it is a matter for politicians and for political leadership to change that.</P>
    <P>Central to the whole idea of a thriving agricultural industry must be the re-structuring of the ownership of agricultural land.  Forty-five per cent of Irish agricultural land is owned by people who are 55 years or older, most of whom are unmarried and none of whom has any great incentive to produce at the higher levels of productivity that will be needed if we are to reach European productivity levels. Note that I am assuming the Minister is successful in his herculean efforts to prevent the super levy being imposed on Irish agriculture.  He has my full support, for all the difference that will make. <Col N="190" /> Nevertheless, for what it is worth he has my support.</P>
    <P>The re-structuring of the ownership of land is fundamental to the success of agriculture in this country.  I do not, do not wish to and never will advocate nationalisation of land or State farming. I do not believe it is necessary.  I do not believe it is the most efficient way and I do not believe it is in any way creative to suggest it.  We have to create a combination of incentives, inducements and pressures that will transfer that 45 per cent of our under-utilised, inadequately farmed, inadequately maintained land from those who will not work it to those who will.  It has been one of the great shames of Irish politics that our two major conservative parties, who are so busily competing with each other to retain the image of conservative agriculture, have been intimidated from really facing up to that problem.  They will not talk about it.  They pretend, they will circumnavigate it, they will run around it.  But the facts are that those who are in occupancy of that land will not farm it and there are many who would like to farm it who cannot get their hands on land.  That is a central problem, and there will be no real development of Irish agriculture for as long as that situation is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Killilea and I will have to discuss this elsewhere.  I would quote two figures from the Professor of Agriculture in UCC, not the ones that have been most recently quoted. People have abused him but they have never contradicted his facts, which is <Col N="191" /> often the experience of those people who tell the truth.  They are abused for what they say but nobody ever contradicts them.  One thing he stated is that milk production could be increased by 40 per cent by proper management without any significant increase in input costs.  There are many people here who would claim to be far more expert in agriculture than I am.  If Professor Rafferty is wrong, will they please tell me?  I will accept the fact, if they give me the sources.  If he is right, people would do well to explain to me and those like me who are concerned about the future of agriculture why it is that we could produce 40 per cent more milk without any increase in input costs, and we do not.  He also stated that with proper management calf mortality could be reduced, without any extra cost but simply by proper management, to the extent that would increase beef exports by about £100 million a year.  They are two figures of several that he produced. It is a challenge that I would put to those who claim to be close to the industry to explain why we do not and cannot do it.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding its recent difficulties and recent problems the Sugar Company has been a success.  It has been a successful State enterprise which has produced employment and has also created wealth. There are those who accuse the likes of myself who stand firmly on the left of politics of ignoring the necessity to create wealth if we are ever to create justice. Let them note that I welcome both the success of the Sugar Company in creating employment and also its success as a viable manufacturing industry which has until recently managed to fund most of its own investment from its own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that what would otherwise have been an even more successful story has on a number of occasions been hindered by Government interference to protect the private sector.  I would refer to the reference of the former general manager, Lieutenant General Costello, to the link-up with Heinz, which he saw as a deliberate attempt by the State and the then Fianna Fáil Government to prevent the Sugar Company entering into competition <Col N="192" /> with major private sector food processors.  That was his view on it. People may contradict me on it.  It was one of the reasons that precipitated his unfortunate early resignation from the company.  The other one was the prevention and vetoing of plans by the company to move into the area of fertiliser blending because of howls of pain from the allegedly much more competitive private sector which obviously did not like the idea of an efficient, effective State organisation competing with them.  That is not the way to encourage a State-owned public company to maintain its viability and profitability.</P>
    <P>I support the motion.  There are overwhelming economic and social arguments for the retention of the Tuam sugar factory. Those who propose this motion &mdash; and if there is a vote on it I will support it &mdash; have an obligation to address two questions.  One is the question of agricultural education, not just training people in agricultural colleges for one year after leaving school but the whole gamut of third level education, research, graduate and post-graduate training.  Agriculture is a business.  It requires the whole paraphernalia of education and training which other business takes for granted and which agriculture does not have.  If there is to be a viable, successful agricultural industry, all major parties will have to face up to this dreadful imbalance in the structure of land ownership which is the basic, fundamental problem of Irish agriculture.</P>

I lay that blame on him and his party because they had an opportunity to put down a motion specifically about Tuam sugar factory but they withdrew it and entered this broader motion which deals with the factory and the whole area of agriculture.</P>

      <P>It allowed the kind of amendment that was lodged to it.  It gave the Minister an opportunity to deal with the very broad area of the total agricultural <Col N="193" /> scene.  I listened with interest to what the Minister had to say about the Sugar Company as a whole and the attitude of the Cabinet in their consideration of Tuam specifically.  In his address the Minister said that in Europe it is unheard of to travel long distances with beet from various parts of the country to where the factories are located.  When he is making a decision on the Tuam sugar factory he will consider this.  It would be totally unacceptable if a very large area west of the Shannon were without a processing industry for the beet grown in that area. That is a valid point if one is talking about rationalisation.  From the producer's point of view, the closer the producer is to the actual processing industry, the better it is.</P>
      <P>There is a sugar factory in my own county in Thurles and I believe there should be regionalised capital investment in the sugar industry.  It should not be designated to one particular area.  We must look at the total social consequences of losing a factory in any part of the country.  The Minister in dealing with the sugar industry has pointed to the anomalies. There is an obvious need to look at how best we can produce our raw material and have it processed as close as possible to the producer.</P>
      <P>The Minister also mentioned how important sugar is in the EEC context. Receipts from levies on sugar quotas amount to about one-seventh of the total funding of CAP.  Sugar in the European context is a very important commodity. There is now a surplus problem, not alone in milk but sugar.  It is a challenge to the Irish industry to ensure that we are as efficient as possible in the production of sugar so that we can compete with the possibility of imports of sugar from other European countries, which at present is unheard of.  We would be in the same position as in the case of other vegetables imported which could and should be produced and processed here.  A company given the statutory responsibility for looking after the industry must meet that challenge.  If the motion or the amendment or Cabinet discussions take these into consideration, this debate will have been a useful one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> We must look at the overall agricultural problems facing us and the fact that agriculture is of such importance to the Exchequer and to the country.  The number of people employed in agriculture, although falling directly at farm level, together with those employed indirectly by agriculture, whether in processing or in the service industry, accounts for almost 40 per cent of the total workforce. It is very important that agriculture should be treated in a very important way by any Government.</P>
    <P>The previous Government set up a committee which made an interim report to the then Minister, Deputy Lehihan, looking for budgetary action.  As a member of that commitee, I was very disappointed when the Minister ignored the interim report and was inactive in regard to many of the recommendations which were of vital necessity then, and some of them still are now.</P>
    <P>Admittedly this Government have met some of these challenges.  They increased the compensation in the disease eradication programme by about £3 million in the last budget.  They have also ensured that the Youth Employment Scheme money is available through the Youth Employment Agency specifically to help to train young farmers to make them more efficient in the production of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The four-year plan which is just finished and will shortly be on the Minister's desk will point to the fact that farmers can do quite a lot without State assistance. Senator Ryan referred to some of these points and I will not repeat them. Much is possible within the farm gate itself.  The Government have a major responsibility and the provision of over £300 million in the last budget is a contribution towards that.</P>
    <P>Our sustenance since we joined the EEC remains with the Common Agricultural Policy which is under threat at the moment.  We had a lot of agreement at political level and at farm organisation level about how we should approach the problem.  I was impressed by the Minister's admission when leaving to address his colleagues in Athens that he was naturally nervous and apprehensive because there were nine member states against <Col N="195" /> what he was trying to do.  Before he arrived in Athens a spokesman from the Opposition tried to pull the carpet from under him, looking for resignations. There may be political points to be made but in the national interest when a Minister is fighting for our survival he needs the support of all parties in this House, whether the Labour Party, the Fianna Fáil Party, Independents or the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister proved during those deliberations that he was capable of fighting a battle, which has been recorded in many documents.  In the October edition of the Community report the Minister is reported as having accused the Commission of breaching the Treaty through failing to protect Community farmers from competitive goods produced elsewhere in the world.  The President of the Commission, Mr. Thorn, was reported as being offended by that charge.  Anyone who can accuse the Minister of not having sufficient courage is not living with the reality that he has proved to the rest of Europe that Ireland has a very special role within the Community.  Agriculture, as our main industry, is so important to us that if the principle of the super levy in any form were accepted by us we would be literally re-writing the Treaty of Rome and the principle of CAP which states that the common prices achieved by common organisation of the market would have access to all member states, that Community preference would be achieved among member states behind the tariff wall of protection against others.  Common financing involving the sharing of the cost of this policy on a Community basis is a fundamental principle of CAP.  The super levy re-writes the whole of those principles.  I do not accept that the Minister will settle for that.  In his contribution today he reiterated what the Taoiseach said on this subject. My party Leader is on record as stating our party line on this, not alone here but with our colleagues in Europe where they have quite a lot of political clout within the Community.  The importance of CAP to agriculture can be judged from the total income over the <Col N="196" /> past ten years from FEOGA which represented a transfer of £2,500 million in the ten years up to 1983.  The receipts for last year alone under these headings amounted to £400 million.  If CAP is to benefit anybody, obviously it must benefit Irish agriculture.  It was one of the reasons why our farmers and the vast majority of the people agreed to go into the Community, not for political unity but for the economics that the European Community have brought to our farmers and to the farming structure.</P>
    <P>More emphasis will have to be placed in the future on the restructuring of our farms and the restructuring of disadvantaged areas which will benefit under other headings from Europe apart from CAP. We should not be fobbed off by agreements to increase the regional or the social funds if it is to be done at the expense of the principles of CAP.  Anything the Minister has done in this regard to date confirms that we have an ally when he is fighting, whether in Athens or in Brussels.  I am glad that he got his priorities right today, that he is with us to discuss this very important motion and that he was not, as he said, junketing in Germany, although the promotion of Irish products in Germany is also very important.  However, we have a good delegation there from the industry and I have no doubt that they will do their job in their own inimitable style.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate in a discussion on Irish agriculture and its developments if I did not put on the record of this House our appreciation of the work that has been done by An Foras Talúntais, who yesterday celebrated their 25th anniversary.  They have made a major contribution to agriculture through ACOT.  With the acceptance by the Government of the staff agreement plan for the workers in ACOT, they can now get down to the job, that is out on the field advising farmers, particularly those who want to specialise in areas of production, whether it is beet, cattle or dairying.  The Director of ACOT is committed to this challenge and with a revitalisation of that programme farmers can themselves do a lot.  They must be assisted by the State.  We should not get <Col N="197" /> into the game of national aids, because we can never compete with our European neighbours in that area.  If we can ensure that the fundamental principles of CAP are maintained by the Minister and his team in Europe, there is no doubt that Irish farming will continue to prosper as it has in the past, although in the last three or four years farm incomes have dropped some 40 per cent.  In that period my colleagues on the other side of the House were in office.  I cannot say that they share all of the blame.  The weather was to blame.  If the weather improves we will no doubt take the credit for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him for not sending the buachaill on this occasion.  The Minister is well aware of the criticism for not being at Anuga International, the greatest agricultural fair held annually and at which we should have been represented.  We have two Ministers of State at the Department of Agriculture and one of them should be out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see a very appropriate heading &mdash; in the <i>Evening Press</i>&mdash;&ldquo;£50 million loss of sales threat to Sugar Company&rdquo; to an <Col N="198" /> article written in Cologne by Stephen O'Byrnes.  I am not going into details as I have too much to say, but it is a red herring.  The Tuam sugar factory means more to Connacht and the west than the super levy means to the nation and that should be borne in mind by the Minister. This factory has had its problems down the years.  Since the first red light was flashed the people at Tuam and surrounding districts, both in my own county and in other counties, have been making an effort to increase the acreage grown in that catchment area.  In 1981 2,500 acres were grown in that catchment area and it went to 3,600 in 1982.  In 1983 we had a total of 4,500 acres.  I have a fairly accurate account from the procurement committee that that would have reached 10,000 plus the 3,500 from County Offaly coming into Tuam if they had got a free hand.</P>
    <P>An acre of beet at 16 tonne per acre at £30 a tonne realises £480 per acre and 4,500 tonnes would mean something in the region of £2.6 million to the catchment area of Tuam for growing alone. We have also subsidiaries of the Tuam company: the turf cutting operation is worth in the region of £1.750 million which gives employment in that region to 6,000 workers.  That is a very sizeable number of people employed in the turf cutting subsidiary of Tuam.  We have also the haulage and harvesting of beet.  The 1.5 ratio for one worker in the field would create five jobs in the industrial and processing of that product.  There is also the question of a subsidy of £32 per acre and a freight subsidy of £2.50 per tonne which brings up the amount of earnings to that region, plus the by-products of about £1.5 million.  A factor that will never be assessed in Civil Service departments is the after crop product that comes as a result of the growing of an acre of beet. An acre of beet tops realises something in the region of £45 to £50 per acre in that region, the equivalent of one acre of swede turnips.  That is a sizeable figure and I defy contradiction of these figures regarding the after crop.</P>
    <P>Tuam factory employs 200 temporary workers during the harvesting and hauling and the beet campaign period.  They <Col N="199" /> are earning in the region of £250 a week, which is a very sizeable figure to a small farmer in that region.  There is a total of 230 employed in the factory, with roughly 50 in the engineering section.  A decision from the Government is urgently needed because this is the time for planning for 1984.  The farmers of that region are now deciding on what plan or programme they have for agriculture and for the growing of beet in 1984.  Now is the time when people make contracts for conacre, and land is signed up at this time.  There is also the preparation of land by early ploughing so that the frost will get a chance of breaking down the soil and having a good bed in the early spring for seeding.  There is an anti-western bias towards the western counties from Coalition Governments, not alone at present but in the past.  We have plenty of evidence of that.</P>

      <P>Industrial relations in Tuam are unique.  There are 93 redundancies already in that plant.  That is a fairly sizeable redundancy, and the Minister spoke about the overall redundancy in the sugar company over a period of time.  The mention of £12,000 to retain a man working in Tuam must be either a misprint or a clerical or typing error.  I do not believe that it takes £12,000 and I <Col N="200" /> should like more facts and figures.  Tuam is not going to close while we are in the west.  I appeal, as Senator Mark Killilea appealed, to the Senators and Deputies for the west to fight tooth and nail to ensure that this factory is kept viable. The sugar industry may not be too healthy, but I do not think they should focus their attention on a factory in Tuam that has a social aspect, an employment content and which is very necessary.  If you close Tuam you might as well put four or five gates around it because that will be the end of it.  This is the hub of all the activity.  It is there to generate employment, its status will be lowered and employment around that area will be damaged right into County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The farm modernisation scheme which was discontinued is a great loss to the west.  I hear it is going to be reintroduced, in what form I do not know.  I do not know what the impact of the super levy will be.  I am totally against the two year period.  The Minister will probably be issuing statements on this.  If the sheep subsidies, cattle headage grants and the in-calf heifer grants are going to be discontinued then you can put gates on the Shannon because that will be the end of the west.  They are only surviving at present with barley at £200 a tonne.  They are going into the winter trying to produce a store animal in the west because they are unable to raise beef on that terrain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also termination of group fodder grants, and in Mayo we had 1,942 grants for group fodder schemes terminated. That is a big loss to Mayo.  I do not know what the national figure is.  The mobile machinery grant has been discontinued. Grants for keeping farm accounts have been discontinued.  The guidance premiums have been discontinued.  There has been no appointment of either temporary instructors or otherwise.  The client board service that has now been introduced is the greatest farce ever.  An instructor from the client board service from now on will only be allowed to have 120 farmers on his list.  I can assure you that the agricultural instructor will go for the 120 good farmers in his area, with the result that the other type of farmer will not be able to get any advice whatsoever. <Col N="201" /> He may go into the local town whenever there is some type of seminar held and that is the only advice he will get.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware that there is a shift of all the temporary instructors in the west to the east.  There has been a reduction from 35 instructors to 28.  That is right across the board in Sligo, Galway and other counties.  Only applications for 1981 are now being considered in my county in the farm development services.  That is the state of agriculture in the west and I am delighted the Minister is here to look after it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said that the reason for the state of agriculture is because the worst educated people were kept at home on the land.  There was a very able farmer in my area who had three sons going to the secondary school in Westport.  He said to the headmaster, &ldquo;Tell me the truth, have they any brains at all&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Of course they have&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;You have three brilliant students coming here to Westport&rdquo;.  The father said, &ldquo;If I thought they had no brains, I would send them on to the university and I would keep the good lads at home&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and the amendment to the motion.  Coming from the constituency in which Tuam is situated, I should like to say that there are two sides to the problem of Tuam.  One is the realistic side and the other is, by and large, the hypocritical side that we often see displayed, re-emerging time and time again.  This motion is premature and repetitive in so far as last June we were here debating the very same topic.  I agree with Senator Ferris in that I query why the original motion was withdrawn and substituted by a watered-down motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community, the workers and the farming community of Tuam have shown that there is genuine concern about the future of Tuam.  This Government have shown real concern with regard to Tuam and the Sugar Company.  There are people who say that they have not, as we have heard here this evening.  The very fact that the Minister came down last summer and briefed himself first hand on the whole situation was most welcome <Col N="202" /> and beneficial, not only in regard to his recommendations, which we await, but also to the people involved because they were not aware that there was concern; they were misled and told otherwise. They have now seen for themsleves that this Government are concerned about the retention of Tuam as a viable part of the Sugar Company's operation.  Many figures have been tossed about this evening; it has been said that the Sugar Company lost £22 million last year.  I should like to say to the Minister that Tuam's portion of that loss, as he is already aware, was very small.  I should like to say also that when the Minister read out the list of areas of production throughout the country, we in Galway and the catchment area of Tuam, have a record of achievement which compares favourably with other enterprises in the west; the acreage for sugar beet has increased in spite of very difficult circumstances. Great credit is due not only to the farming community but to the people in the Sugar Company who have done their utmost to expand the acreage in Tuam.  These are all positive steps taken by the Tuam community themselves to make sure that the processing of sugar in Tuam will be continued.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that I have to mention the hypocrisy shown here this evening.  I cannot let the opportunity pass without mentioning four points which will illustrate to all that there is hypocrisy here which re-emerges at various times.  Earlier in the debate Senator Killilea mentioned 14 July 1982 when the then Taoiseach came to Tuam and said that he was allocating £30 million to Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann for the expansion and retention of Tuam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaJnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator quoted from the Taoiseach's speech in Tuam.  I was in Tuam on that day.  Not one penny of that has been spent in Tuam to modernise it and that was under the last Government who said they had a commitment to retain Tuam at all costs.  That was Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of <Col N="203" /> the House tonight to a statement made in the debate in the other House last June when one Fianna Fáil TD from another part of the country was reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> as having said that Deputy Hugh Byrne supported the Government's decision to close the Tuam sugar factory.  He is still within the ranks of Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, there is hypocrisy which must be shown up for what it is worth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the other party made those statements and they are on record in various places.  Since 1974 the only Government that put money into Tuam by way of modernising it to stop the running-down of that factory was a former Coalition Government when the then Deputy Mark Clinton, as Minister for Agriculture, allocated £1.5 million for the modernisation of that plant.  Not one penny has been spent on its maintenance, and it is only due to the workers in Tuam who have handled it under very difficult conditions that Tuam has remained a viable factory in the production of sugar. Credit is due to the workers and the people involved in working outmoded machines.  When the Minister visited it on the last occasion he could not believe the condition of the plant, although he had heard many of the rumours beforehand. On that occasion he complimented the people who maintained it in such condition over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government's recommendation comes forward, I should like to remind them that they will have considered the various people involved in this problem.  Tuam has been the backbone of the population of that region.  It has a tradition there.  Before a decision is taken, great consideration has to be given to those social and economic policies also &mdash; you cannot divorce one from the other.  There is a commitment within the <Col N="204" /> work force to make sure that the production costs there are equal to all other operations of the Sugar Company. Maybe they have been surpassed under the condition in which they now find themselves and there will be a far greater commitment there for the future when the commitment to Tuam is given.  When that is given the Tuam plant and the people operating it will show that the decision taken to maintain it in Tuam will be the right one.</P>
    <P>We had to wait to hear Senator O'Toole for the last straw and the publicity gimmick that has gone on about Tuam.  It is unfortunate that down the years it has been dragged on to all political platforms, on all election occasions, but here tonight we had it used again as a yardstick for withdrawal from the west.  Here again we had the anti-western bias that Senator O'Toole referred to.  These are cliches that are now well worn, and I could not resist the opportunity to highlight them again, and the hypocritical way in which they are used.  That always has been the tradition within Fianna Fáil on that aspect.  When we say that farm advisers are leaving the west and going to eastern areas and that we will soon have none, I believe that we have a commitment to ACOT and that ACOT have got a commitment and that there is no such desertion of the west.  Many of the advisers within the ACOT system in the west find it a challenge and enjoy the challenge to work in the western part of Ireland.  Having been to the other areas they can improve agriculture in the west.  If Senator O'Toole cares to do a small piece of research he will find that many of the ACOT officers in the west had been in operation in other parts of the country before they came to the west.  It is a very important point that when such advisers come to the west they will improve agriculture. So Fianna Fáil should not be running down the whole service of agriculture and the commitment of this Government to it.</P>
    <P>Before I finish I must mention that we will honour the commitment to the west. When the western package was being operated during the previous Fianna Fáil <Col N="205" /> Government not one penny was spent, though we had at that time a Minister of State for Agriculture in the west, and he is not too far away from Senator O'Toole. When we say that there has been no commitment by this Government to agriculture we can see that we have retained the lime subsidy, the calf premium, and despite Senator Killilea's best efforts in the local press last week to show that we were not paying the disadvantaged areas premiums he will be glad to know now that last Friday £8.5 million was sent out on that scheme.  The Senator was making one more effort to demoralise the farming community there by saying that this Government have no commitment to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I will finish by saying that I believe, and the majority of the farming community believe, that no Government ever have shown such a commitment to maintain agriculture as our Taoiseach, our Ministers for Agriculture, Foreign Affairs and Finance have done in recent months in their efforts to fight off the largest powers within the EEC.  They have gone no small part of the way to achieve that.  When we have the final results from the EEC with regard to the milk super levy this Government's work will be shown up for what it is.  This Government, without the headlines or anything else, will go about their business in a positive way and not in the destructive and propaganda way we have been accustomed to in the past.  We will go on from here and this Government's commitment to agriculture will be seen in the months and years ahead.</P>

In doing so the Minister was cutting short the time that Members of this House would have had to express their grievances.</P>
      <P>We all know that the Tuam sugar factory is about to be axed by the Coalition Government.  When I say &ldquo;being axed&rdquo; I am being kind to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance. With regard to Tuam, the Minister has not put to this House the facts and figures as they should be presented.  He presented a conglomerate of figures and as Senator O'Toole pointed out, the Minister said each job in Tuam costs £12,000 a year.  I wonder who was to blame for that.  If that is the case, the people to blame are the sugar company because they failed to reinvest in Tuam over the years, the net result being that Tuam is being run down to the detriment of the west.  I am asking the Government and the Ministers for Agriculture and Finance to give the necessary capital injection to Tuam to allow it to continue as one of the prime agricultural employers in the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving on to the second part of the motion and to the deplorable state that agriculture has been allowed to decline to in this country in the past six months, we have a Minister for Agriculture who is outstanding in his own field, and outstanding particularly in the way he has cried and bemoaned the fact that he is not able to handle his counterparts in Europe mainly because he is not aware <Col N="207" /> of everyday happenings in farming.  We have seen this Government suspend the Farm Modernisation Scheme, the net result being that progressive farmers are now being handicapped due to this Government's lack of commitment to put in the necessary finance to allow them to develop.</P>
    <P>We could go on and on.  We were promised on at least two occasions that we would have the restoration of the Farm Modernisation Scheme under a new guise and new guidelines.  I am requesting the Minister of State to ask the Minister to put before the people now his plans for agriculture for the next four years.  As far as I can see he has no plans except to roll from one crisis to another and to go to Europe and to cry and bemoan the situation and to state that Irish farmers are in need of special treatment. We all know that, but what is he doing on the home front or what are this Government doing to put the necessary cash injection into agriculture which it needs if it is to be competitive among its European colleagues?  European farmers at present have got advantages over their Irish counterparts, not alone in the terms of availability of capital to them but also with regard to their marketing strategies. We know what has been done about marketing by this Government.  Today the Minister explained why he could not be in two places at one time.  If the Minister could not be in Cologne at the big European food fair that takes place during the year, at least one of his Ministers of State should have been there.  No excuse will be accepted by the Irish food industry for the fact that nobody went to represent us there.</P>
    <P>In regard to drainage schemes, Senator O'Toole pointed out that it is 1981 applications that are being processed.  That is a fact.  What also annoys me is that the rate of grants which farmers are receiving in the west under this scheme are now down to a mid-30 percentage though it was originally planned to be 70, mainly due to the fact that the Government are not prepared to put in the necessary cash injection or make the necessary adjustment <Col N="208" /> in costings to allow drainage grants to be upgraded.</P>
    <P>We had another red herring from the Coalition which was dragged around the country by the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, with regard to land leasing and land policy.  He used this to gain publicity, but has he gone back and studied what he was putting before the people?  The policies that he is propounding are totally unworkable and unacceptable to Irish farmers, especially to the ageing farmers.  Down through the years too much time was spent fighting for the rights to land.  Now we see policies being introduced which are unworkable.  With present returns from farming how can one farm support two people?  What magic wand has Deputy Connaughton? Farming is in such a state and the future is so uncertain that many farmers, among them the most productive, are winding down their operations.  This is evident in dairying, livestock and other sectors.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that I should refer to the infamous super levy.  As far as I can see the Minister is going to try to get a two-year derogation for Ireland on it.  If he succeeds, what is he going to get to help Irish farmers in those two years to build up and to be able to compete with the factory farms of Denmark and Holland as far as milk production is concerned? Is he going to give the necessary cash injection to the dairy sector to allow them to compete?  Is he going to find that in two years' time he will have Irish farmers, epecially the small farmers, the small producers of milk, being crippled by the super levy when it will be imposed here?</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister, and it may not appeal to some people in this House, that he should look to the future as far as the dairy sector is concerned.  If the need arises he should consider a tiered system as far as the super levy is concerned whereby the first 50,000 gallons of milk produced would be exempt from any levies which might come in the future.  I believe that 50,000 gallons production is sufficient to sustain any family farm unit. That should be our basic belief.</P>
    <P>News of the talks which have taken place recently about the EEC subsidies for sheep and cattle headage payments is <Col N="209" /> very worrying.  If the Minister is not careful he will allow himself to be put into a position that in order to get the derogation for two years he will be forced to allow these payments to be withdrawn.  I hope that the Minister will not allow himself to be put into that situation and that he will approach the negotiations with his European partners for special treatment for Irish farmers until such time as they are in a position to compete with their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>I regret, as I said earlier, that the time left for Senators to speak on this motion has been so short.  We are now discussing the only industry which can take this country up by the bootlaces and bring it back to its rightful place as an economic unit in Europe.  Therefore, I would say to the Minister that the future of this country lies in his hands and he will be judged on his stewardship by the farmers and especially those in the west whenever the opportunity may arise.  It appears that at the rate the ship is sinking it will not be long until the people will get an opportunity to elect a Government capable of governing the country and of putting the necessary input into the various Departments to allow the country to develop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who have spoken on this motion.  The putting down of this motion was a very worthwhile exercise.  I want also to thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, who has come here to listen to the various points made.  I compliment the Tuam Chamber of Commerce, the members of which have travelled here to show their interest in this motion and their solidarity with and support for the people who put down this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the various speakers there seemed to be unanimity as far as the first part of the motion goes.  I did not hear any speaker either from the Fianna Fáil side of the House or the Government side speak against the retention of the sugar factory at Tuam.  For that reason I hope that when the division bells sound later this evening all those people, and particularly Senators from the west, will vote solidly for the retention of that factory. <Col N="210" /> If they vote otherwise they will be highlighting and showing to the whole country where the hypocrisy lies in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>Many points were made during the debate and I will try as briefly as possible to reply to some of them in the few minutes that remain to me.  The Minister in his speech said that it is costing £3 million per year to produce sugar at Tuam.  I dispute this figure.  He also said this represents about £12,000 per annum for each full-time job equivalent in the factory, that this is what the taxpayer will have to provide to keep Tuam open.  They are the Minister's figures.  I dispute them because I do not think they are correct.</P>
    <P>In giving those figures of what it costs to retain the factory at Tuam, with 200 full-time jobs in Tuam and about the same number of seasonal jobs, the Minister should also have given the other side of the story.  That is what I propose to do now so that the Minister, when he joins his Cabinet colleagues to make a final decision on this issue, will have before him both sides of the story, that he will have the factual situation in relation to Tuam and that he will be able to convince his colleagues in the Cabinet that the case is so impelling for the retention of this factory in Tuam that the Cabinet will have no option but to support our motion and plea for the retention of the factory. I will give the figures which have been prepared by the workers' action committee in Tuam and which have been verified by the Sugar Company themselves.</P>
    <P>The value to local and national economy of the Tuam sugar factory: primary value, the value of the beet crop to Tuam growers, £4.600 million; value of wages paid after PAYE and PRSI deductions, £2.105 million; tax paid to State, £1.160 million; animal feeds, value of pulp products produced, £1.550 million; value of beet tops as feeding £200,000; turf cutting operations; referred to by Senator O'Toole, 75,000 tonnes of turf cut each year at £30 per ton £2.250 million; primary total value, £11.865 million; goods and services bought in Tuam town and district, £187,000, and in the rest of County Galway, £580,000; goods and services bought in the rest of Ireland, <Col N="211" /> £1.535 million; payments to CIE and the Beet Haulage Association, £529,000; payments for fertilisers, £630,000; secondary value total, £3.461 million.  Added to that are the losses to the Exchequer in the event of CSET Tuam closure, PRSI, PAYE paid in the year ending April 1983, £1,036,570; VAT lost to Exchequer paid year ending September 1982, non-claimable items, £98,000; unemployment benefits and PRSI payments, £1.113.  The total lost to the Exchequer in the event of the closure of the Tuam factory under those headings would be £2,247,570.</P>
    <P>They are the figures the Minister should analyse and balance.  When he comes up with a figure of £3 million as a loss for the Tuam operation he has also a right to allow for the other figures.  I have given them so that he can study them and be able to convince his Cabinet colleagues that if the case is so convincing for the retention of this factory they will have to give that decision.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that that decision is not being given now because I was hoping that this debate was giving an excellent opportunity to the Minister to announce his decision here.  Sufficient time has been spent considering various reports.  The reports have gone from one Department to the other over the past couple of years. They have been discussed and analysed. Anything that is to be known in relation to the Tuam factory is now known to the Cabinet.  I am sorry that they have to allow the despair, the gloom and the despondency in the Tuam factory at present to continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that it would possibly be another month before a final decision would be given.  It is disgraceful that workers who are so committed to the retention of that factory and the farmers who have committed themselves this year to grow 10,000 acres of beet if they had got the contracts for them, should be denied the right to know whether their jobs will be there next year or whether their contracts will be there next year.</P>
    <P>For that reason the Minister should have given us his decision here this evening. It is no excuse to say that the <Col N="212" /> Government have been involved in preparing Estimates for the Departments or for the budget.  We know that that is a seasonal thing.  This situation in Tuam has been going on since 1981 or earlier. It is definitely going on since 1981 when the Coalition Government gave their decision to retain the factory for a further year.  If they have not made up their mind now after all this time, I do not know what kind of reports they want; I do not know what has to be done in order to get a decision, but as far as the public representatives in the west are concerned, as far as the voluntary bodies in the west of Ireland are concerned, the leaders of the Church and everybody who has any voice in the affairs of the western region, all have expressed their opinion and have called for the retention of the factory.  I hope that call will not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The workers have made an excellent case.  They have pruned their operations there as far as possible.  They have accepted voluntary retirement.  They have increased their productivity.  They have done everything that is open to them to do in order to encourage the Government to retain the factory there, and it is now up to the Government to give their decision.  If that decision has to wait I plead with the Minister to please give us that decision and let us work on it, but do not keep the thing going indefinitely as it has been going since 1983.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator Burke should try to engender any kind of bitterness into this debate.  That would not be my idea, and I do not think it was anybody's idea on this side of the House.  We wanted to discuss this motion in a cool and clam way.  Statements made by the Fianna Fáil Leader and the commitments given by him towards the Tuam sugar factory were referred to.  Those commitments are well known: we spelled them out on every platform in Tuam and in East Galway. We said quite clearly, and we got the backing of our parliamentary party and our leader, that we would retain that factory in Tuam.  At the last general election we said that if the Coalition Government were prepared to close it we would re-open it on our return to office.  That commitment still stands.  That is the situation <Col N="213" /> as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, and I want to state that clearly here tonight and to have it in the records of this House.</P>
    <P>I say to the Senators particularly from the west of Ireland, it is our fight today for Tuam, it is vital to us in Tuam, it is vital to the western region.  It may be their fight tomorrow in some other situation. We have the Ballyforan situation staring us in the face, which is another postponement.  I am not going to dwell on that.  I hope that commonsense will prevail at the end of the day and that the Government will not continue to prune those industries that are getting their raw materials from the land, from the bogs and so on; that they will encourage and promote them.</P>
    <P>How can foreign industrialists be encouraged to come to this country?  How can the Minister go to Japan, America or England and try to encourage industrialists to come in here and set up industries if we cannot support our native industry? That is why the Irish Sugar Company, Bord na Móna and the other industries should be supported, promoted and developed.  They should be expanded in order to give some relief and some ray of hope to our thousands of young people who are tramping the roads doing interviews and trying to get jobs that are not there, and in many cases are gone before they go for interview.  That is the situation, and it is well known to all of us who have any interest in the future of the country or who have any interest in the youth of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan said that the lack of confidence started in 1979.  Perhaps that is so.  There was a certain lack of confidence at that time, but the difference is that in 1979 and 1980, when agriculture was on the downward trend, Fianna Fáil <Col N="214" /> did something about it, and they tried to restore confidence by injecting money through the Farm Modernisation Scheme and by introducing other schemes such as the silage scheme for first time makers of silage, by increasing headage payment grants and so on.  That is the difference between that Government and the present Government.</P>
    <P>Instead of putting money into the agricultural sector the Government decided to cancel grants under the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  They decided to wind up the Irish Land Commission.  They decided to reduce the headage grants for many of our part-time farmers.  Those people are often the leaders in their own areas because they have the earnings to plough back into the land.  They give a headline to the rest of the community. Now they are being deprived of those grants because the earning ceiling is being increased to £5,100 from £3,500 for qualification.</P>
    <P>These are a few of the things that have gone wrong since the present Government took over.  I cannot see why the members of the Government can support this amendment.  I would appeal to them to consider their position.  As far as agriculture is concerned there is no development at present, there is no expansion, and unless some leadership is given by the Government lack of confidence will remain for some time.  That is a sad situation for this country because we are depending so much on our agriculture.  It is our main industry, and while agriculture is thriving the rest of the economy is on the up and everybody is doing well. That has been the situation down through the years.  But that is not the situation today.</P>

There are no procedures for limiting debate in this House and nobody has seen fit to bring me officially into any sort of trust about the matter which is coming before the House later.  The Leader of Fianna Fáil in the House was informed, I understand, in some detail about the necessity for and the urgency of this Bill.  I have not been so informed.  However, I accept the word of the Leader of the House that it is a matter of great urgency but I would point out that when there are matters which are of an emergency nature which require urgent consideration, there is an Independent group in this House and that they deserve and are entitled to be consulted and informed of the reasons for any emergency legislation being brought before us.</P>

I consulted with Senator Lanigan, the Leader of the Opposition; I consulted with Senator Ferris who is the Leader of the Labour Party in this House, and I consulted with Senator Catherine McGuinness who is the representative of the Independent group on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.

The suggestion is that the Minister should be called <Col N="218" /> to conclude the Second Stage shortly after 9 o'clock, say between 9 p.m. and 9.15 p.m.  This should allow the Senators themselves, apart from the Minister, some 45 minutes for Second Stage, plus the Minister's introduction and conclusion, and then 45 minutes for Committee Stage.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for the spirit in which they have accepted the legislation which is before us.  I am very conscious that they have accepted the sense of urgency which accompanies this Bill.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill, which is of general application, is to amend existing insurance legislation by adding to the range of actions which can be taken to deal with situations arising in the event of uncertain solvency of non-life insurance companies.</P>
      <P>In 1964 the Oireachtas accepted the principle that the State should not be responsible for the failure of private sector enterprises engaged in the non-life insurance market.  At the same time it decided that it would be desirable to establish a compensation fund, to which all companies would contribute in accordance with their share of the market, and out of which eligible claims could be met in full.  The details are set out in the Insurance Act, 1964.  Subsequently, the United Kingdom Parliament introduced legislation to much the same effect, and similar arrangements now exist in other parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While leaving the basics of the 1964 legislation unchanged, and it has worked <Col N="219" /> quite well in the case of the collapse of the Equitable Insurance Company, we are now proposing a number of significant amendments.  The House will recall that at the time of the Equitable episode, the view was accepted that, while arrangements should be made to compensate people who had claims for injuries or damage to property, those who had simply paid premiums and were going to be out of pocket only in respect of the unexpired period covered by the premium could be left to fend for themselves. With the greatly increased cost of insurance I feel that a different view ought now to prevail on this question and that people who have paid premiums should, in the case of a company being wound up, be entitled to present claims in respect of the unexpired period of their policies just the same as other claimants on the compensation fund.  That principle is now enshrined in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an even more important consideration which arises in this connection, and, again, Senators will recall the experience of the winding up of the Equitable Insurance Company.  At that time my predecessor secured an order of the High Court for the winding up of the company as it was clear that its affairs were beyond all hope of redemption. I do not think that any other solution would have been possible at that time.  Nonetheless we must recall what the effects of the winding up order were. The position is that as soon as such an order is made, the policy holders, leaving aside entirely the position of persons having claims against the company for accident, etc., are no longer effectively insured and are thrown upon the insurance market to do the best they can in seeking replacement cover.  Even in the case of a small company like the Equitable Insurance Company this caused considerable dislocation, and in present market circumstances it is clear that the consequences of the winding up of an insurer would be very serious indeed. Nowadays, insurance of certain classes is not something which is immediately available for the asking over the counter. Members of the insuring public are often, <Col N="220" /> because of the cost and other considerations involved, obliged to make diligent enquiries to secure the best deal for themselves. We cannot contemplate the possibility of very large numbers of people, including many of whose livelihood depends on having insurance cover, left without insurance through no fault of their own, being sent from Billy to Jack with, possibly, the consequences that a significant increase in the number of uninsured drivers on our roads is brought about, a situation which, as the House is aware, places intolerable demands on all concerned.</P>
    <P>It is primarily to deal with this problem that the present legislation has been designed.  Its object is to ensure that while the affairs of a company in difficulty are brought within the purview of the High Court in much the same way as those of a company being wound up, its business can nonetheless be continued without interruption on a going concern basis by an administrator appointed by the court. It is a basic principle of company law that in an insolvent winding up the board of directors becomes defunct and its powers are assumed by the liquidator.  This is in recognition of the fact that it is those in control who have the power to do harm. Their removal is therefore almost invariably an essential preliminary to any remedial action, and such removal automatically occurs on liquidation.  In this Bill we are proposing to apply this and other winding up principles in the case where an administrator is appointed by the court, and it follows therefore, that, for so long as an administrator stands appointed, the powers of the directors will cease.  In applying the winding up principles we have been very conscious of the scope for conflict between some of them and the discharge by the administrator of his main duty to maintain the business as a going concern with a view to placing it on a sound commercial and financial footing.  There are obviously certain winding up provisions which would impede the administrator in such a task and these are being adapted or repealed to remove any doubt there may be about the commercial credibility of an insurer under administration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> I think it is important to refer specifically to one particular adaptation, the effect of which will be that &mdash; contrary to the automatic consequences of a winding up &mdash; contracts of employment, transactions, debts, proceedings etc., will not, by virtue only of the appointment of an administrator, be avoided, cancelled, stayed or otherwise affected.  The underlying rationale, and it is important that this should be emphasised and accepted, is that the administrator of an insurer from the outset should be able to carry on business with as much freedom as is reasonable and that as far as possible only normal commercial rules and procedures apply, subject of course, to the entire proceedings being within the domain of the court.</P>
    <P>To facilitate further the attainment of the main objective of this Bill, the Act of 1964, as we now propose to amend it, will give the administrator access to the compensation fund so that he will have the resources to meet claims on the company and to place it on a better financial footing for the future.  The general mechanisms of the 1964 Act will continue to apply, with the fund's resources being provided as before by way of levying contributions on all non-life insurers.</P>
    <P>The limit of £1 million on the size of the fund established in the 1964 Act is being removed.  This removal has been dictated firstly because its significance has been almost completely eroded by inflation in the intervening years and, secondly, it is considered inadvisable to pitch the fund at a particular level in general legislation when the circumstances in which the fund would be drawn upon could vary substantially from case to case.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate insurers in their task of providing for their liability to the fund, the Bill proposes that the contribution by insurers will be limited to a ceiling of 2 per cent of premium income in any year.  The House will appreciate that a contingent liability of this size could create some difficulties for insurers. It is only right therefore that the insurance industry should not be prohibited from providing for any liability to the fund in the premium rates which they <Col N="222" /> charge.  This is a principle which has already been well established.  I think it appropriate at this point to record that the behaviour of the insurance companies in regard to their obligations under the Act of 1964 has been exemplary.</P>
    <P>The net result of the new provisions to which I have referred is that policyholders will not need to scramble around looking for alternative cover, as their insurance will be continued, and the rescue of the enterprise can be put in hand under new management with the least disruption to its ongoing commercial activity.</P>
    <P>Many non-life insurance companies have connections with other entities, whether by way of subsidiary or dependent companies for property and other investment purposes or by way of other associated entities within an overall group structure.  In endeavouring to deal with the fortunes of an ailing insurer it would be inconceivable that the administrator should not also be in a position to exercise control over the affairs of any such entities.  The Bill provides, therefore, for the exercise of such control by the administrator as is considered necessary for the purpose of successfully discharging his primary duties.  The ability to act in relation to such bodies and the degree of control to be exercised will be subject to the sanction of the court.  The Bill also defines the connection in such a manner that action could only be taken in relation to a body which is significantly linked with the insurer under administration. I must emphasise, however, that the inclusion of this element in the Bill is not to be seen as a vehicle for the extension to such bodies of the appointment of the administrator, with a brief to maintain them as going concerns and return them all, if needs be, to a sound financial footing. That would be totally impractical and unrealistic, and it would be unreasonable to expect policyholders to provide funds to rescue enterprises outside the insurance sector.  On the other hand, it seems safe to make the general assumption that where the main enterprise in a group is being rehabilitated, the effects on connected enterprises must be beneficial.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="223" /> A series of other consequential amendments is being effected to the Act of 1964 for the purpose of facilitating the successful application of the scheme I have outlined.  The opportunity is also being availed of to repeal certain provisions of the Act of 1936 relating to the ownership of shares in, and the nationality of directors of, insurers.  The existing provisions are discriminatory in the light of our obligations under the Treaty of Rome, and while they have not been applied against nationals of other member states in recent years, their continued presence in the statute book is not warranted.</P>
    <P>I think it only right at this stage to inform the House that it is my intention, as soon as this Bill becomes law, to petition the High Court for the appointment of an administrator to take over the management of a certain insurance company whose affairs are in a state of considerable disarray.  Since these proceedings are imminent and the relevant petitions have already been prepared, it would be inappropriate for me to go into further detail at this stage, but there will, presumably, be other occasions on which this matter can be debated in the House.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the recent history of insurance business in Ireland, one is, I think, entitled to ask certain questions. Indeed events now happening in other countries also have their relevance.  In our own case we had in the late thirties the mismanagement of a number of life companies whose funds, on actuarial valuation, were shown to be inadequate to meet future liabilities to policyholders. To deal with that situation the Irish Life Assurance Company was established by the State and I think we are entitled to say that it has been a resounding success. In 1963 the Equitable Insurance Company collapsed and it was clear that the most serious offences had been committed in carrying on its business.  The 1964 Act resulted from this.  We are now faced with a third problem.</P>
    <P>To be fair, I am obliged to say that the affairs of insurance companies are, by and large, managed by responsible people who are fully cognisant of their duties to the insuring public.  They cooperate <Col N="224" /> fully with the Department in filing the returns required by law and in answering any questions which arise in connection with them.  This is all very well as far as it goes, but it has to be recognised that, so far as the supervisory authority is concerned, the system still depends largely on the competence and honesty of those who prepare these returns and, even more so, on those professional people who certify the returns.  Unusual vigilance is called for and, partly because of the complexities of Irish law, the process is not an easy one.  Directly and indirectly, the various powers provided by the Oireachtas in regard to the supervision of insurance companies have been availed of relentlessly by myself and my predecessors in office, and the case which is now pending is the end result of the exercise of these powers.  One can, I think, take it as a certainty that if the supervisory powers had not existed and had not been used, we would in due course have been confronted with a disastrous situation which would have been extremely difficult to deal with.  What we need now is effective remedies to deal with certain situations brought to light by the supervision process.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House provides a very desirable addition to the range of options available to the insurance supervisory authority.  It provides an option which avoids the disastrous consequences of winding up and, although confined to a large extent within existing winding up law, it creates an environment which should allow of the resuscitation of an insurer while carrying on business in a normal fashion.</P>
    <P>I would now ask for your co-operation in carrying this Bill through the House. Although it is a Bill that is not large in physical dimensions, a great deal of work has been put into it and it meets the requirements and aspirations of all parties in the House.  There are people out there at the moment who need to be looked after and the object of this Bill is for us to do our best for them.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of speculation during the day as to which company might be referred to in the Second <Col N="225" /> Reading speech.  I have pointed out that I am not at liberty to elaborate on what I have said to the House.  There is a considerable amount of concern amongst policyholders, not confined to any one company and the purpose and the main objective of this Bill is to ensure, unlike a situation under the present law which will exist until this legislation is passed through this House and signed by the President, that policyholders are protected. In the circumstances that exist the Minister &mdash; myself in this case &mdash; would have no alternative but to apply to the courts for winding up proceedings.  In those circumstances people who had taken out insurance would find themselves through no fault of their own left without effective cover.</P>
    <P>There is also the consideration of a number of jobs.  All too often in the recent past we have seen situations where liquidations were necessary and the people who were most severely affected were those who had absolutely no say in the management of policy pursued by those firms.  It is my determination that this will not happen in this case, and I am sure that determination will be shared by all Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>This must be regarded as a sad day.  Any day a Minister can come to us with this type of emergency legislation must be seen to be a sad day for business in Ireland.  Certainly that is the way I see it.</P>
      <P>I saw the Bill this morning for the first time, having been told earlier that there was a possibility of emergency legislation, although I was not told exactly what it was until I read the Bill itself.  I identified in my own mind the particular company and I can understand the Minister's reluctance to name that company.  It is totally acceptable that he should not, for many obvious reasons.  I have a company in mind.  Its name has been mentioned already in the other House and I read it on the papers this evening.  It may be speculation and I will wager that it is more than that.  I am basing my remarks on the belief that it is a certain company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having read the Bill I saw it as appropriate to a particular problem today. <Col N="226" /> Whilst it may continue as a permanent piece of legislation, I feel that the Minister has a specific once-off situation in mind and will act tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>A lot of questions have to be asked about this matter.  I, like other Senators and Deputies, am hearing about this for the first time.  I must compliment the Minister and his Department because in my opinion this was one of the best kept secrets of a lifetime.  I can see the reasons why it had to be kept secret and I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would still have to ask whether he is dealing with it in the right way.  I do not know and I am not privy, as clearly the Minister is, to reports, whether they be from accountants, auditors or whatever.  I know that in the blue book of 1981 the accounts of that company showed them to have an underwriting loss of X pounds and a slightly better investment profit of X pounds, which meant that they were OK. This kind of legislation that the Minister is now introducing is not for small amounts, and I am certain that the Minister is not introducing this Bill because of a few million pounds.  It must be a lot more than a few million pounds.  If in 1981 the accounts were all right, how 18 months later are we suddenly faced with crisis?  A few things come to mind and maybe the Minister would give us some indication if he is allowed to do so.  In regard to this particular company it was suggested to me many years ago that if the affairs of the company were investigated by the same people who investigated the Vehicle and General in England they might be asked to stop trading. That was eight or ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I know that insurance accounts can be very difficult to present because an insurance company can have a lot of assets in every city in Ireland.  They might have a building worth £20,000 if sold on the open market the following week, but it might appear in the accounts at £100,000.  I know that the very serious business of underestimating motor claims and liability claims in general can be woven into an estimate very cleverly.  In other words, the claimant's injuries might warrant £200,000, but the company might have <Col N="227" /> inserted in their books a figure of £10,000 or £20,000.  That certainly would put accountants on the beam, as it were.  If that were the case would there not be some responsibility on the accountants to go into it and fine comb it before it was actually signed?  I am working in the dark and the Minister knows the facts.  I am only anticipating, seeing it as I do from my knowledge of the business.  For the people who are insured, and I believe there would be over 300,000 policyholders in this company, it can be very serious and worrying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the company was mentioned and I happen to think I am right in my approach.  This whole area is one that needs to be looked at.  I find that the problem is a difficult one and the former Minister, Deputy John Kelly, asked for an inquiry into the costs and methods of providing insurance.  If that had been done many years ago and acted upon we would not be in the position we are in today, not just with the company concerned, but with insurance companies in general, because I know well that many insurance companies are running down their operations in this country.  They are finding that the jury system, which is the kernel and the bugbear right through, is putting insurance companies in very serious financial straits.  Liability insurance in this country is a very serious loss-maker at present.  I suggest that this country is fast becoming uninsurable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whilst the Minister last week made some attempts, which I welcome, with the discs and with the extra fines to be imposed for uninsured vehicles, if we want to get realistic premiums then there is only one measure to be implemented, the elimination of the jury system.  I am stating this as a factual situation.  There is no question that the jury sympathy in all of these cases is absolutely and totally on the side of the plaintiff.  The amounts of awards that are offered are often <Col N="228" /> halved or divided by four on further appeal to the Supreme Court, which proves that this is the case.  Ireland and Northern Ireland are the only countries in Europe who have this system.  In England, for example, they can tell to within £20 what a particular injury is valued at.  The greatest defect of the jury system is the inconsistency of the awards. No insurance man will dispute that.  Any person working in the insurance industry, in the liability side of it particularly, will say that if the jury system was eliminated there would be reasonable premiums in this country.  Not alone are they deciding the amount of the awards but they are also determining the liability, which is totally wrong.</P>
    <P>When people know what company we are talking about they are, naturally, going to be worried.  They will wonder what is going to happen.  Will their insurance continue?  Although the Minister has given the assurance that their insurance cover will continue, many people will still be worried.  I believe that many of the customers of the company concerned will leave the company fast.  No matter what exercise is engaged in to save the company &mdash; and I applaud that &mdash; people will not be happy and will feel that they should move.  They will experience many difficulties in what is already a very difficult motor insurance market.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that we have nine Irish companies, 14 foreign companies and a few other Lloyds syndicates, very few of them are accepting motor insurance. None of them is going out looking for it. They are taking it as a gesture in many instances to the brokers and people of Ireland.  Even allowing for that you will find company X will not take people who are under 30 on transfer with a full bonus. The car must be registered 1977 or more recently.  Company B will not insure cars registered after 1977 and policyholders must be over 25.  Company X or Y will not insure cars registered after 1978 and will not take transfers from another insurance company.  Another company will only give a quotation for a car which is over 1978 and they must have a full bonus.  The market is totally limited.  We <Col N="229" /> are going to have many customers leaving this company because their confidence has been eroded.  The same company have been, in fairness, the only company that will accept young drivers, at colossal premiums.  They were at least taking them whereas the other companies who were licensed with the Minister's Department will not accept young drivers as a risk.  That situation will have to change.</P>

      <P>It is a very serious matter for the staff involved, a worrying time for them and for the policyholders.  I hope that we can overcome this problem, and the Minister is right in doing it this way. I can remember the problems of the Equitable Insurance Company, and that was not a happy experience for policyholders at the time.  This episode is going to have very serious repercussions for the insurance industry.  It is a sad day for them.  I hope the Minister gets on well with this legislation.  He will have a fight on his hands because &mdash; knowing the company as I think I know them &mdash; they will not give up their company without a fight.  The Minister can expect a tough battle in the courts because he is taking away the board of directors, directors are being deleted and Mr. X, an administrator, is being put in to run the company. For any company that is a huge worry and the administrator will find &mdash; I do not know who the Minister has in mind or who appoints him &mdash; he will have a difficult task in hand.  There are many problems and I sincerely hope that you can bring this very important matter to a successful conclusion for the benefit of all.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister spoke in the other House this afternoon things have moved rapidly.  Those of us who saw the 6 o'clock news this evening or who saw the evening papers have seen the finger pointed at a company.  There is consent on all sides of the House to let this measure through, to achieve certain things, to secure the position of policyholders and the employment of people involved.  In some way we have to convey that that security is being provided to policyholders and to the people employed by whatever company is involved.  In the light of the reports in the media, it is essential that the action of this House and the other House and the Minister's urgency in relation to it are recognised and known.</P>
      <P>Senator Fallon complimented the Minister on a well-kept secret.  I join in that, but I should like to add that the Minister is to be congratulated for being prepared and being ready to move in this situation. He deserves our congratulations on the speed with which he has moved, and with a measure that will bring security to the categories of people I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill is passed, the Minister will then be in a position to enter the High Court, apply for an administrator to be appointed and the administrator will take responsibility for the affairs of the company.  The cover &mdash; and it is very important that policyholders would know this &mdash; will continue, their policy-holding will be protected and in that way what the Minister in the course of his speech described as the possibilities of a disaster situation arising will have been avoided. It is also important, but perhaps it has not got the same urgency in the context of where we are tonight, that the mandate of the administrator at the end of the day <Col N="231" /> will be to rescue that company and to restore it to solvency, if that is possible.</P>
    <P>On the more general aspects of the Bill, I accept the principle of an administrator being appointed by the High Court.  I concur with the Minister that it is a more acceptable way of dealing with situations like this than, for example, bringing in a liquidator and winding-up the company.  Indeed, the Minister pointed out very clearly the implications of that alternative.  It will leave the policyholders with cover, the premiums are secured and, as the Minister stated, there will be no additional uninsured drivers. The method proposed by the Minister for installing an administrator, by petition to the High Court, is simple, straightforward and effective.  I accept that the speed by which it can be achieved is necessary and that it is satisfactory.  I also accept that the powers which the Minister proposes to confer on the administrator through this Bill are also necessary and satisfactory.  However, in reading the Bill, the Minister's speech and the explanatory memorandum, there is one aspect of the appointment of the administrator that concerns me &mdash; perhaps the Minister will be able to clarify the situation &mdash; that is, the extent of the powers the administrator will have in relation to subsidiary or dependent companies or groups within it.  I know I will be sailing close to the wind but I will stay away from the shore if I say that the group some of us have in mind are reputed to be a combination of 74 companies.  As I understand it, access or control by the administrator to subsidiary or dependent companies is more or less at the discretion of the High Court.  Some of these subsidiary companies &mdash; and I want to emphasise that I am speaking in general terms now &mdash; could perhaps financially be very healthy but their financial health could be related directly to the level of funding that was diverted to them from the insurance company with the problem. Therefore, I am concerned that access of control by the administrator to the affairs of these subsidiary companies could be delayed by a protracted legal battle in the High Court, so that valuable time and, <Col N="232" /> perhaps more significantly, valuable resources could be lost during that period.  That is the only point that I am uncertain about, but I hope my uncertainty will be clarified by the Minister in due course.</P>
    <P>I welcome the assurance given by the Minister in relation to contracts of employment, debts, transactions, proceedings and so on.  With regard to the Insurance Compensation Fund, the Minister proposes to remove the limit of £1 million set 19 year ago and to raise it to more realistic levels.  That is acceptable and there is no reason why we should have reservations on that score.  I accept the point the Minister made that it is inadvisable to pitch the level of the fund at a particular level, and I think the ceiling of 2 per cent is reasonable.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that the Minister is availing of the opportunity to repeal the relevant sections of the 1936 Act in relation to the nationality of directors. We are doing no more and indeed the Minister is doing no more there than fulfilling our obligations under the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied in his speech that were it not for the effective use of the supervisory powers that he and his officials in his Department had, a very difficult situation could have emerged, or at least a situation which it appears could be difficult would not have been observed as early as it was.  I should like to conclude by saying that the Minister and his officials or whoever was responsible for finding the apparent difficulties deserve not alone our congratulations but the congratulations and thanks of the people who will be preserved from a disastrous situation by the passing of this Bill and I support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister and the other speakers, I appreciate the urgency in relation to this Bill and to having it passed here tonight. While we may be bound by anonymity, this legislation will mean the virtual nationalisation of a particular company tomorrow morning.  While questions have been asked and most of them have been answered, the policyholders, the <Col N="233" /> staff and claimants in relation to this company or a particular company in the future would like it spelled out as to where they will stand when the situation as envisaged by the enactment of this legislation will arise, be it tomorrow or in a year's time.  Senator Howard touched briefly on how the situation has arisen at this particular level, be it a well-kept secret or not.  I should like to know if the Minister explored all the avenues to help this company to keep it solvent and will all avenues be explored in the future to help to keep companies solvent who are on the verge of disintegrating financially? The company should be given the opportunity to solve their own problems.</P>
      <P>What amount of discussions were held or will be held in the future at all levels to help to save a particular company, its employees and its subsidiaries, should such subsidiaries exist?  We would all naturally be concerned about the large number of policyholders who are customers of any company and how their cover will be protected.  The Minister has explained this but what guarantee have we if, for instance, a court case should arise, and delays should occur?  Will the premiums be State-guaranteed as a result of a company being taken over under this Act and will their premiums be increased?  It worries me that as a result of this legislation here before us this evening we might have other panic applications for increases in insurance premiums in general across the board.</P>
      <P>Senator Fallon referred to the fact that there are obviously a very substantial number of policyholders involved, who are naturally concerned.  We are showing our concern by being here tonight to see how they will be affected by the legislation before us.  Will the employment of companies' staffs be guaranteed?  Will the subsidiaries of this company be wound up or will they be made solvent?  The Minister referred to that in his speech but there are many questions that we would like answered here tonight.  Will they be kept as on-going concerns or will they be just investigated and if they are not paying their way, will they be discharged to offset the liabilities of a particular company?</P>

      <P>I shall be brief because I know that the Minister wants to come in and reply in about 15 minutes' time. However, it would be inappropriate if, on behalf of the Labour group at this side of the House, I did not put on record our appreciation for the manner in which the Minister has so speedily and courageously dealt with what is a very urgent problem.  In the brief discussions we had with him today, each one of us complimented him, because there is no point in closing the door when the horse has bolted.  Many Ministers have been accused from time to time over the last number of years of being inactive when the national interests were at stake.  It can be said tonight of the Minister that not alone was he not inactive but he has been most active in this field since this problem came to his notice and he was prepared to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the first sitting day of the Dáil with this emergency legislation and to do so in a forthright manner.  Although some Senators seem to be obsessed with who the company may or may not be, I am only interested in the principle involved in this.  This principle which we are now enshrining in this legislation can be applied in the national interest to people who, through no fault of their own, could find themselves, in spite of having paid their premiums, uninsured almost overnight.  The Minister is to be complimented on behalf of all the workers tomorrow who want to drive to work in the knowledge that they are insured, having paid their premiums, whether it was six or three months ago or yesterday, or whenever it was.  If any company abdicates their responsibility to insure drivers overnight &mdash; and we have reason to believe that it might happen &mdash; the Minister was prepared to initiate legislation in the House that protects the ordinary common good.  We are very proud that the Minister saw fit to bring in legislation like this.  Not alone does he protect and reassure drivers to go to work tomorrow or even to go home tonight but he is reassuring the employees within the insurance industry who would naturally be concerned about their jobs because <Col N="235" /> other companies have folded up.</P>
      <P>The last person to have a claim on any winding up of a company is the worker engaged even if he has PRSI contributions, redundancy payments or any rights that workers might have in an industry. I am sure the workers in this industry would be pleased tonight to know that there is a Minister capable of initiating legislation as quickly as this.</P>
      <P>We must also remember the small-time savers who put in their money on the advice of economists to this kind of savings on the basis that it was not a risk-saver, that it could be a valuable asset to their income by putting their small savings into it.  Those people are also protected. So we have a three-fold insurance in this Bill for people who want to go to work safely, who are working within the industry and who have invested their savings in the same industry.  So from our side of the House we want to congratulate the Minister.  We will assist him in every way.  I hope his petition to the High Court to appoint this administrator will also be successful and that the principle has now been enshrined in this House that we are prepared to take action where the common interest is at stake.</P>

Clearly, this is in the nature, in a sense, of a fire brigade action which must be taken in order to protect policyholders and employees of the company involved and to protect the public generally.  Quite obviously, as the Minister said, we do not want a similar situation arising as arose in the case of the winding up of the Equitable Insurance Company when a large number of people who have paid for insurance to cover them, say, for the coming year should suddenly find that they are uninsured, particularly in such a dangerous area as motor insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill raises rather larger questions about the whole area of motor insurance. It is not just the question of us being able to rescue people when a company gets into trouble.  It is a question of looking at the whole background of this type of <Col N="236" /> insurance and the difficulties that arise in it by its very nature.  Some of these have been touched on by Senator Fallon.</P>
    <P>The difficulties that arise in motor insurance are often due to the combination of a number of factors, first of all, the fact that for very obvious reasons such insurance is legally compulsory and, therefore, all motorists must be insured. Obviously this has to be so, but it does mean that companies who are taking on motor insurance basically ought to be willing to take on the bad risks along with the good.  We have reached the position in this country where there are certain motor insurance companies operating in a system where they only want to take the good risks and the people who have large no claim bonuses already &mdash; the people who are regarded perhaps like ourselves as being respectably middle-aged and unlikely to have accidents.  They do not want young people.  They do not want high risk people, so that any company willing to take on perhaps the high risk people is, therefore, put at risk itself.</P>
    <P>There is also the position &mdash; I am not going into the rights and wrongs of the jury system here &mdash; that high awards make for high premiums at the other end. Again, because the thing is on one side a statutory compulsion for an insurance, on the other side we expect private companies to provide this insurance, and we have the situation arising where accounting practices can, to some extent, conceal what is really going on in the background.</P>
    <P>This has a number of end results.  First of all, it has the end result that has been seen in some of the Minister's announcements in recent days that the premiums for motor insurance can be so high that a great many people will risk driving without insurance and risk the kind of fines that are provided against them because they feel they simply cannot afford the premiums and it is worth the risk.  Second, we get the situation in which companies must try to recoup underwriting losses by investment profits.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fallon pointed out, we have this situation in which a company, <Col N="237" /> and it is not the only company which might be in this position, was trying to offset underwriting losses by investment profits and perhaps by diversifying its interest and to use the cash flow funds as profitably as possible to offset these losses.  Problems can arise, particularly in a difficult economic situation, when one has not got the kind of assurance that if one invests money properly it will turn out a profitable investment, because one cannot be sure what one is doing.  There are also difficulties in rendering clear accounts about what is happening.</P>
    <P>In recent days the Minister announced new methods of cracking down on the uninsured driver.  Anybody who knows the plight of the person who has had his vehicle damaged by an uninsured driver realises how important it is to stop uninsured driving, However, the imposition of bigger fines and higher penalties or this type of fire brigade legislation that we are having today will not solve the basic problem of motor insurance.  Though we should welcome and pass this Bill today, it is necessary to look into the whole background of this very difficult question.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate this is a Second Stage speech and that the Minister wants to get the whole thing through together, there are a couple of queries I would like to put to him.  Section 6 is one of these usual sections giving the Minister power to make regulations.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us what type of regulations he is envisaging.  Second &mdash; perhaps this is an unfair question but I think it is one of the questions that must arise in Senators' minds and in the minds of members of the public &mdash; when the Minister is bringing in this Bill in connection with whatever company it happens to be, is he doing this by agreement with this individual company or is he doing it unknown to the company so that it will come as a surprise to them that he intends to prosecute a petition in the High Court in the morning? Is he doing it against the wishes of the company? Will he be going into the High Court to fight them rather than to rescue the operation by agreement? I do not know whether he will be willing to answer this question but it is <Col N="238" /> one that is bound to arise in people's minds.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House &mdash; I know we want to finish this debate quickly &mdash; but I would come back to the fact that this kind of legislation and the kind of measures the Minister announced a few days ago really stem from the basic insecurity problem of motor insurance here.  Until we have solved the underlying problem we will continue to get this kind of thing happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be long because I know other Senators wish to contribute. First of all, I would like to say that the Bill has my enthusiastic support.  Senator Howard has already expressed a similar view on behalf of the party.  It is an extraordinary Bill by any interpretation. The amount of power that is being given and the creation of a new type of legal operation in a piece of emergency legislation such as this, pushed through the Dail and Seanad, understandably in such a short period of time, will present some extraordinary problems for the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who depend to a large extent on advice which they can receive from specialists who are not available to them at such short notice.</P>
      <P>It behoves the Minister, therefore, to take particular notice of the points that will be made here this evening so that some kind of review procedure of this legislation, after an appropriate period, would be initiated so that any difficulties which might arise could be tackled in an organised and calm fashion.  After an appropriate period, the Minister on his initiative, in the other House, or ourselves, on our own initiative in this House, might ask an appropriate committee, for example the Committee on Legislation, to review the provisions of the Act, which the Bill will become, so that any problems which might have arisen could be dealt with in another piece of legislation, or the matter could be tidied up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not to suggest that there is anything in this Bill that will not work. However, it is inevitable that when a new type of operation, a new kind of insolvency <Col N="239" /> control system is being applied for the first time in Ireland, it seems inevitable that problems will arise.  The Minister should be willing voluntarily to submit the Act at a later stage for a more leisurely and critical examination by a committee representative of both Houses.  That is the main point I want to make.</P>
    <P>Second, the provisions which the Minister is making are very wide and sensitive and it is important that we should preserve this structure so that he can say calmly in due course what he wants done with it, that is, the structure of any company which might be in difficulty.  A structure of the size of an insurance company should not be abolished overnight.  The office of administrator will enable the Minister and other people to look calmly at any situation which may arise and make a decision which will be appropriate in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are four problems I have identified with this.  They are not problems which I am seeking to have solved this evening but they are the kind of problems to which, at a later stage, we can address our minds calmly.  The first problem is what are the long term arrangements we can make so as to ensure the smooth transition from the administrator to the more normal form of operation, whether that is ownership by the State, the shareholders or by anybody?  The circumstances in which this is likely to come about are provided for in the Bill, but realistically speaking the paying back of any money might not be a realistic proposition. The Minister should give further consideration to that point.</P>
    <P>The second point deals with the provision whereby a receiver cannot be appointed over any of the company's assets.  This seems to be a considerable restriction on the rights of anybody who might have advanced money to a company to which an administrator has been appointed.  This is a considerable restriction on the rights to the security which a charge over a specific item of property normally gives that person, because it will not be a receivership or a liquidation but something different and because, <Col N="240" /> during the course of that administration, a receiver cannot be appointed except with the approval of the court.  That section itself does not give the court any indication as to what criteria it should establish in deciding whether to appoint a receiver, because it clearly states:</P>
    <P>No receiver over any part of the property or undertaking shall be appointed without the prior sanction of the court.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have a big problem with regard to subsidiaries because to appoint an administrator and automatically to have that person appointed an administrator over all subsidiaries or connected organisations would be very extreme, and the Minister has not done that.  The idea of a separate application in respect of each subsidiary will be very difficult, very time consuming and a waste of the administrator's time.  More important, who will control the subsidiaries in the period that must elapse between the appointment of a provisional administrator and the actual application by the provisional administrator for powers to control the subsidiaries under the provisions of the Act?  There could be a period of weeks during which I would assume that the directors of the subsidiaries would continue to be in control of the subsidiaries. That is a considerable temptation to people who might be dissatisfied with regard to the action over the main insurance company.  It appears that the control of the subsidiaries will remain with the directors of the subsidiaries in the period between the appointment of the provisional administrator and the period in which the administrator will decide to make a separate application to the court in respect of the individual subsidiaries. I do not see why hearings should be otherwise than in public.  I understand why the maintenance of confidence might be important, but I suggest this provision will give rise to difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister can depend on our good will and co-operation in solving these and any other problems that might arise. Bearing those things in mind, the scheme is an imaginative one which will meet the real needs caused now or in the future by <Col N="241" /> the sudden insolvency, or other such problem, of a main insurance company in the Irish market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the speed with which he acted in bringing forward this legislation.  It is emergency legislation and anything done in a hurry is bound to carry a certain amount of weakness.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Leary.  I was going to make the same point, that the Minister would consider, and indicate to the House if he is in a position to do so, that matters of insurance legislation will be dealt with in the near future.  That will be essential as a protection to the Minister, who did an excellent job in bringing forward this legislation in such a rush.  He needs the protection of this House.  There are many people who will set out from the start to be non-co-operative, who will try to find the loopholes in this rushed legislation, even though they agree it is essential.</P>
      <P>There is something very new in appointing an administrator.  It is certainly new to me.  I am particularly happy that the Minister has seen an alternative to the liquidator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Never, in all my years of business in the city, have I seen anybody benefit by a liquidation except the liquidator. Anybody who knows the Minister is aware of his concern for workers. Nobody will dispute that.  I am particularly pleased that he is taking steps to help the many workers who may be involved in an insurance company.  Often it is easy to bring in a liquidator.  With all due respect to the civil service in Departments, we have seen Ministers, having washed their hands of a problem putting it over on somebody else and saying: &ldquo;It is no longer my problem &mdash; it is somebody else's.&rdquo;  But in this case they have appointed an administrator instead of a liquidator.  There are a number of questions that must be asked and I ask them in a spirit of co-operation.  If the Minister is reluctant to answer them I am not going to insist on it because I appreciate the <Col N="242" /> emergency that exists.  When the Minister gets time to think he will have to bring in legislation again, because even though this is emergency legislation it is permanent until such time as it is repealed.  I am quite satisfied it will come back to the Oireachtas, for the Minister's protection if for no other reason.</P>
      <P>What is the function of the administrator? Is it to examine the company, to manage it and bring it back as a going concern? The ideal situation would be that the administrator goes in, examines, manages the company and brings it back as a going concern.  What happens then when it is brought back as a going concern? Does he step out of the way and hand it back to management?</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary made one point that is not relevant to this debate.  When he was talking about restricting the powers of the receiver he said that creditors need to be protected and that bringing in a receiver gave them that protection.  If Senator O'Leary had to think of that he would not have been quite as positive about it because he would have accepted the point that receivers only do well for themselves.</P>
      <P>At present, throughout the country there are a number of people who have claims listed for hearings in the courts and I would expect that there is considerable concern among such people.  I am talking about people who have been injured and who have been waiting three to four years to have their cases heard. Are we to have a situation in which the administrator will postpone the hearing of these cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that that should be made clear.  What are the implications of the current situation for premiums in the industry generally, and does the Minister foresee any increases in the company's premiums?  If this Bill is brought in because of any one company &mdash; I do not know &mdash; is the Minister going to have companies suffer who did everything the right way in all their years of existence?  Does the Minister foresee any tightening up of reporting procedures to <Col N="243" /> the Department as a result of what occurred?  I think that is important.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is prepared for my next point &mdash; I do not know if he can give a positive clearcut reply: he will probably merely indicate his attitude on this one.  What would his attitude be if there is a delay on the part of the court of the appointment of an administrator? That is a serious one.  In the event of a refusal by the court to appoint, what are the options open and what would the effect of such options be?</P>
      <P>The Irish Life Company has been very successful.  It was established in the thirties. I understand the company is owned 97 per cent by the Minister for Finance, that is, he holds the shares for the State in that company.  Has the Minister given any thought as to whether the State should adopt a similar approach to the question of general insurance?  Seeing that motorists are required by law to be insured, would it not seem reasonable that the State should ensure that cover which motorists are bound to have by law would be provided by the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House.  I hope I will be given another opportunity to speak on insurance in this House.  I hope the Minister will take into account what has been said by Senator O'Leary and myself.  We open up a whole new thing by the appointment of the administrator. We could have started something very worthwhile even though this has been rushed and even though it is an emergency.  Perhaps I can look forward to the day in this House when we might be discussing legislation for an administrator in the place of a liquidator.  Forgive me for straying slightly from the point, but it was raised and I want to say a few words about it.  I feel it might be worthwhile for the Minister to note that there is acceptance of what he is doing.  The appointment of an administrator is a new thing as far as I know.  The Minister has done the right thing, the wise thing, all he has ever claimed, he has looked after the interests of the workers.  I hope that in the future some Minister, preferably Deputy Cluskey, will introduce legislation to provide an alternative to the liquidator, <Col N="244" /> under whom nobody wins but the liquidator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Hanafin, who said that the only person who profits from receivership is the receiver.  I join with him in congratulating the Minister for showing imagination in dealing with the problem he proposes to deal with tomorrow morning.</P>
      <P>I rose primarily to say that in the age we live in, one of widespread cynicism about politicians and the House of the Oireachtas, it is very edifying, to say the least, to see the rapid response of the Department, the Minister and his officials on the one hand, and the generosity of the Opposition on the other both in this House and the other House today. The absolute co-operation given by the Leader and members of Fianna Fáil should be noted.  It is to their credit that it is possible to take this Bill in both Houses in such a short time.</P>
      <P>I am extremely pleased that the formula which the Minister proposes and the way he intends to proceed will have the direct benefit of securing the jobs which would otherwise be lost as and from the application that would be made in the courts to wind up this company under the normal procedures and practices that we adopt here in this country. If something is wrong &mdash; we have seen it before &mdash; you dispose of the problem rapidly by sending in now probably one of our best-known public figures, a receiver, and you wash your hands and say goodbye.  I am delighted that a Minister from my party has decided that there are other and better ways to do things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a bit disappointed when Senator Fallon said that the public will lose confidence in whatever company is in trouble, because in his opening speech the Minister refers to the ability of the administrator to have access to funds which quite conceivably are not available to any of that company's competitors. Therefore, I submit that the company that will be the subject of tomorrow's hearing could be in a much better financial situation than most of its competitors. I will go back to what Senator Hanafin said, if this is a new way of <Col N="245" /> approaching company failures in Ireland, then it is up to us to say to the public that under this system they are not at risk.  It is very important that that message would be carried by the media tomorrow. Otherwise you may as well send in the liquidator and finish it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal to those people who at present express a lack of faith, that the obvious rebuttal of such a lack of faith is contained in the Minister's opening speech.  Because it is emergency legislation and one cannot talk forever, I simply finish up by congratulating the Minister and the Department and, as I have already said, the Opposition both in this House and in the other House for their generosity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for its constructive contribution on Second Stage.  Members of the House on all sides have taken a constructive attitude throughout the debate on this piece of legislation.  There is, I am very glad to see, an awareness of the necessity for a sense of urgency.  The debate has been remarkable for the absence of any attempt at party political advantage in the approach to it.  It has been extremely encouraging to see that the potential problem that has been presented to the House is being approached in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable number of questions were asked during the course of the contributions and I might not have the opportunity to deal with them all individually. One of the observations made by Senator Fallon in his opening remarks was that this legislation &mdash; and this was referred to also by a number of other speakers &mdash; is being dealt with in a short period and it does not give an opportunity for the full discussion that one would like to have on legislation of this nature.  That is something I agree with, and I have considerable sympathy with the House in that respect.  I might also say that I find myself, because of certain inhibitions which of necessity are there, without the full range I might wish to have in replying to the House.  I am sure the House has accepted that while Members may speculate <Col N="246" /> as to what company may be involved, that is not a luxury I can afford. In all my remarks and replies I will keep to the provisions of the Bill and their general application.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon said that a lot of questions would have to be asked about this at possibly some future date.  He referred particularly to returns that were made on the financial position of companies as they are required by law.  This is an extremely important aspect of the present situation.  The Minister and the Department have responsibility for supervising the insurance industry with particular reference to whether companies are solvent.  In order to do that effectively it is necessary that one must rely on the competence, the integrity and the honesty of professional people who make certified returns in respect of accounts which have to be furnished to the Department. It would be a matter of very serious concern to the House if there were any reason to believe that all of these necessary requirements were not complied with.  It would most certainly be a matter of serious concern to me.  If a situation of that nature revealed itself, appropriate steps should be taken, because unless one can rely on that very important supervisory link in that chain the whole situation would become impossible.  If there was any departure from the standards that one would be entitled to expect, suitable sanctions would be imposed.  I accept that that is an extremely important aspect of it.</P>
    <P>As Senator Magner and a number of other speakers have indicated, what is most important at this stage, having regard to speculation in the media and to discussions all over the country, in pubs, at wakes, weddings and bridge parties as to who is involved and what the consequences are, is that we get it across that if this legislation is passed here tonight, and if the necessary procedure for early signature is passed and if the court, under the terms of this legislation appoint an administrator &mdash; and I have no reason to believe they will not &mdash; there is no need for concern on the part of anyone holding a policy in the non-life area with any insurance company who may be the subject <Col N="247" /> of an administrator being appointed.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my Second Reading speech, all obligations, transactions, policies and commitments, including contracts of employment, will be observed as normal and that no action or default on any legitimate commitment would cease to be an obligation solely by virtue of the fact that an administrator had been appointed.  Many people are extremely worried and we have an obligation to reassure them.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner raised other questions, too.  He said that I might end up with a fight on my hands with regard to applying to the courts for the appointment of an administrator.  He was speaking in terms, I understand, of a particular company.  I have no company in mind.  I am speaking about the general application. I have had several fights on my hands in my time but this is one I do not anticipate having in that I am not looking on this as a fight.  Neither am I looking on it with any degree of relish.  It is not an action that anyone in his right mind would lightly undertake.  The circumstances as they present themselves to me left me with two alternatives.  I could apply to the courts for a winding up of the company with all the subsequent disaster that that would entail for a great many people, or I could adopt this approach and with the co-operation of both Houses of the Oireachtas be in a position to take a different approach in the courts.  After the necessary formalities are dispensed with by way of petition, affidavit and presentation to the court, it is for the court to decide.  It is not my fight.  It is a presentation to the court under the responsibilities I have by virtue of my office and the matter is then in the hands of the court.  I am quite confident that the court will take an objective and responsible view of the matter and that every-one's rights will be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to the position in the event of the court not agreeing to go along with this.  All I can say is that we certainly would be no worse off than we were this morning in the circumstances that have arisen.  We are taking the <Col N="248" /> only feasible approach open to us.  But the court, under the legislation, if it so wishes, and by way of an <i>ex parte</i> application without hearing anyone else, will have the power to appoint a provisional administrator until such time as they have had an opportunity of going into all the relevant facts.  I have no fears in that regard.  The information made available to me left me with no other course of action.  I have every confidence in the court's ability to deal impartially, objectively and in the public interest with the facts as presented to them irrespective of what company may be involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard and others, including Senator O'Leary and Senator McGuinness, spoke about the major legislation being taken in these circumstances.  I am in agreement with that view.  It is not the most desirable way to have to deal with legislation.  There is no doubt that this legislation is of major importance so far as insurance law is concerned.  It is a radical change in the situation prevailing up to now.  Some Senators have indicated that to change now is justified because of a certain set of circumstances and it might be subject to review.  I do not accept that, because I see it as a very desirable change which should be permanent legislation in this sphere.</P>
    <P>There is a limited range of action open to a Minister who finds himself in a position where he is trying to fulfil his obligations so far as supervising an insurance company is concerned.  Some of the options open, were one to take them, would in fact precipitate the very consequence that one was trying to avoid.  A predecessor in a Fianna Fáil Government illustrated this earlier today when he indicated that there were certain avenues open to a Minister under the existing law, that he could, for instance, send in an inspector.  If a Minister has reason to believe that there is something wrong with a company's finances which justifies sending in an inspector, the very fact of doing so can put that company under.  As Senator Fallon well knows, the insurance world is not that big, word gets around fairly quickly.  A lot of business is done through brokers by way of inter-business, re-insurances and so on, so while there <Col N="249" /> are theoretically certain powers to insure supervision, the reality is that if one utilises those powers, one can put the company over the brink and into an insolvent position.</P>
    <P>This legislation is extremely useful because it gives an alternative to seeking the winding up.  That is not to say that I do not agree with the point that has been made.  Maybe it is time for us to have a much more comprehensive look at the whole insurance area.  That might be a very useful exercise indeed.  It would be my intention to go into this in considerable depth.  At the moment this legislation is necessary to get through all Stages tonight.  I shall try in a general way to deal with the many questions that have been asked.</P>
    <P>First, most of the questions are ones that would normally come up at Committee Stage, but as we are not likely to reach the Committee Stage in any detail here tonight, I will try to deal with them in a more global way.  The situation is that I would apply to the courts for the appointment of an administrator.  The courts, if they so decide, would appoint that administrator and he would not be answerable to me.  He would be answerable to the courts.  He would be totally independent of me.</P>

      <P>If one were seeking to have a provisional administrator appointed, under the terms of the Bill that could be done without the other party being present, the provisional administrator being put in for a limited period of time.  Then the court naturally would arrange a full hearing with all the interested parties having access to the court and being able to make their case before the courts.  I have no doubt and I am sure the House would have no doubt that so far as the courts are concerned they would ensure that the rights of all parties are taken into consideration in determining whether an administrator should be appointed.  While the court, <Col N="250" /> under this legislation could appoint a provisional administrator for a limited period of time to enable them to go into the thing more fully, everyone would have their day before a final decision was made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Business in relation to an insurer is defined as including the business of managing investments and assets held by the insurer.  Let us assume that a company have many and diverse activities. Are all these activities covered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The updated definition of insurer is contained actually in section 7.  It should be noted that in the Insurance Act, 1964 the definition of insurer is confined to non-life insurers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words it refers to the insurance aspect only?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that business as defined in section 1 refers to an insurance company and just the insurance aspect of that rather than other activities that the company may be involved in?  In other words, if a company have other interests, for example, investment interests or what they regard as being investments, garages and so on, are these included in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be clear about this.  I have said that it is also connected with section 7 because while the primary responsibility of the administrator on his appointment would be to ensure that the insurance company as such would be carried on in a business-like manner in their day-to-day activities his main responsibility <Col N="253" /> would be, over a period of time, to return it to a viable financial position.  It also states in the legislation that as well as the powers of an administrator, he would assume most of the powers of a liquidator, and that would give him certain jurisdiction over certain other aspects of related or subsidiary businesses or companies.</P>
      <P>The degree of the connection between the insurance company and the related businesses would be a major factor in determining his jurisdiction, and he could at any time resort to the court for advice if he was in doubt or if he thought that any action being taken or not being taken by any subsidiary or associated company was detrimental to the interest of the insurance company or was impeding him in carrying out the main function which he had as administrator to return the business to a viable concern.  So it is not possible to answer the question in the narrow definition of the first section.  It has to be taken in relation to other sections also.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I will have to make this clear as I have tried to do all along, and which I have done successfully all day.  I am not in a position to speculate about a particular company.  This Bill has a general application.  I have indicated that under its provisions, if it is passed, an application will be made to the High Court in the morning but I cannot speculate on a particular company.  What the Senator is asking me is a matter for the courts.  If the presentation is made in such a way that the courts do not think it has <Col N="254" /> been properly prepared or properly conducted or that someone's interests are not being catered for, I am quite confident that they will deal with that situation. So it is not appropriate, and in fact it might be totally inappropriate, for me to go into detail as to what may or may not happen in court proceedings.  All the Oireachtas does is to pass legislation which creates a framework in which the court operates and interprets.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in at this late hour.  After such an exciting day he can see what a packed Chamber we have.</P>
      <P>I hope when I leave public life that if I have done nothing else I will have left my mark not only on the services of the mentally handicapped in Clare but also in some way at national level.  I remember 19 years ago, when I was the back-up to another person then serving in public life, I saw this dreadful gap in this nation when there was no service whatsoever for the mentally handicapped.  It was in that way that I became involved.  This is a little unusual for somebody who has nobody in the family who is mentally handicapped. People at conferences and with the national association with which I am affiliated are usually parents or relatives of mentally handicapped children.  I have a lot to be thankful for to God and this is a field in which I will continue to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an extraordinary set up in dealing with the mentally handicapped. The Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department <Col N="260" /> of Education, the OPW and the Department of Finance are all involved.  If ever there was a case for one Minister for one section in our community it is certainly in the field of the mentally handicapped.  If it is not done by this Government it might be done by the next Government.  It is something that I will talk about again.  If such an appointment were ever made I would hope we would not have the confusion we have in the Department catering for youth at the moment where the junior Minister does not know what the senior Minister is doing.  We have all the schools, workshops, aids and grants, and trying to deal with them is really impossible.</P>
    <P>I will certainly give credit to the Minister because the services which exist for the mentally handicapped are probably the best in the world.  Unfortunately we have not yet reached out to give all the essential facilities that should be available to all mentally handicapped people. Parts of the country have no services at all; that is quite common and the Minister is aware of it.  Normally where there is a good service it is where there is a very good back-up organisation at local level. The Acting Chairman who is from my own constituency is well aware of what I am talking about.  If you get the people to support you, eventually the politicians see commonsense and then you get the service.</P>
    <P>Some mentally handicapped people have to live in special residential care centres where care and development services will be available to them.  It is estimated that 1,500 extra places are needed and the majority of those have not yet been provided.  The working party report also draws attention to the fact that some 2,500 mentally handicapped people are in psychiatric and geriatric institutions.  I have got into trouble locally and at conferences because I feel so strongly that no mentally handicapped child or adult should be in a mental hospital. I have the greatest regard for the people serving in the field of mental illness but in 1983 we should not have mentally handicapped children in wards in our mental hospitals.  I am not putting the blame on the Minister here tonight.  I am <Col N="261" /> blaming successive Ministers.  Because I have gone on record in making that statement I have not been popular in certain areas with certain professional people. Popularity does not worry me once I have the popularity in the right circle to enable me to make a case here for mentally handicapped people.  I am not worried about my popularity with certain professional people.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to residential units.  I have reservations about these big impersonal institutions like Swinford and Loughlinstown.  I have seen the smaller unit work.  I have bought houses and put the children into them and I have seen them going to school and going into a workshop situation.  I am sure the Minister knows that I am right in this. Nobody will sell me the big institution again for mentally handicapped children and for the young adult.</P>
    <P>What worries me is the embargo on the recruitment of staff for the services of the mentally handicapped, together with the compulsory reduction of numbers of staff in the service.  In March 1983 we had a cut of 2 per cent and I understand a further 3 per cent cut is being mentioned. That is too great a cut-back in a service where there is still much to be done.  I am not being dramatic or unreasonable.</P>
    <P>No Minister for Health in recent years has shown as much concern so quickly as the Minister here tonight.  He has singled out the service of the mentally handicapped. For that I am grateful.  The National Association for the Mentally Handicapped are grateful to the Minister. We may be able to help him at the Cabinet table to leave the service and take another look at the staffing.  I would worry about the reaction of staff coming in and serving in the field who would not be as committed as old staff were.  If we keep cutting back and asking them to do more with less staff there probably will be a deterioration in services, something which I would not like to see.  It is a most satisfying field to serve in and people are very grateful.</P>
    <P>The stigma that has attached to having a mentally handicapped person in a family is gone.  There is no such thing as <Col N="262" /> a mentally handicapped boy or girl or teenager being down in the lower bedroom of a farm house.  Years ago if you were not in the right party they hardly produced the child at all.  They are coming to one now almost with a joy and pride and it is because the service has been laid on.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Government may be considering a reduction of expenditure in some areas.  I know how rough it is going to be to leave the money and to try to give the service that we need.  With the cutting back of staff it is a field where we may not have such committed people coming in and serving.  If we had any hassle it could spread very quickly and I would worry greatly about it.</P>
    <P>In Ireland it is possible for anyone who is ill to have access to a full range of medical services.  For the mentally handicapped that is not possible and it is an indictment of society to have to say that. I appeal to the Minister to try to provide more and not fewer resources for this marvellous and valuable section of our people.  We call on him and the Coalition Government to adopt reasonable and clear-cut policies for the development of a comprehensive and caring system which will provide the disabled people of Ireland with a lifestyle to which they are entitled.  We hear about constitutional rights but I am not going to go into rights. I thank the Minister for coming in here tonight.  It again shows the concern there is, although the Chamber is almost empty.  I appreciate that it is late but 10.30 p.m. is not too late for a debate on this subject, to which people pay such lip service when it suits them.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the Leader of the House, Senator Dooge, for remaining for my few words, and also Senator Fitzsimons. It is a pity that people who pay lip service to this matter thought 10.30 was too late to take this motion.  I ask the Minister not to cut the money, and if there is anything the voluntary bodies who are serving in this field, and the National Association for Mentally Handicapped, can do to strengthen the Minister's hand at the Cabinet table, he can call on me and I will see what we can do. <Col N="263" /> I again sincerely thank the Minister for coming here.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Treas Honan for her concern on this question.  The involvement and commitment of the Senator have been readily acknowledged in the past by, for example, her nomination for Seanad Éireann by the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland.  That of itself is sufficient tribute.</P>
      <P>I want to deal in specific terms with some of the points raised by Senator Honan.  We are very fortunate in having built up in a relatively short space of time, a wide range of specialised services for our mentally handicapped people.  The quality of the services now in existence, particularly over the past six or seven years, is recognised internationally.  It has been in no small measure due to the fact that we have in the area of the mentally handicapped a wide range of various lay voluntary organisations doing quite remarkable work.  They, together with the dedication of the numerous religious orders who are involved in the area, have produced an outstanding service.  Admittedly the number of religious orders has diminished over the years and a number of voluntary organisations have found increasing difficulty in finding resources. Nevertheless, the work has been quite splendid and admirable.  A great deal of the credit for the improvement in recent years must go to these organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have at the moment 8,600 mentally handicapped people in receipt of residential and community services under the general auspices of the Department of Health.  I share the concern of Senator Honan that no person who is mentally handicapped should be either residing or receiving treatment in a psychiatric hospital. Unfortunately, a small number still are, and it is our ambition, mutually shared, that specific services should be produced from within our resources to bring an end to that situation.  I am acutely aware of the need for more rapid change in Senator Honan's health board area in that regard.  Our country and successive Governments have been <Col N="264" /> spending a great deal more money in the past five or six years.  I will just give three figures.  In 1978 we were spending £35 million.  In 1980 we were spending £58 million.  This year, on current account, we are spending £100 million.  In a very short space of time the increase in allocation has been quite remarkable.  The capital allocation for the mental handicap services was £4.6 million last year.  In 1978 it was only £2 million.  It has increased considerably over recent years. Over a thousand new posts were approved in the mental handicap services in the late seventies.  These basic statistics demonstrate that the Irish people, rather belatedly admittedly, have in the past five or six years spent more resources in giving priority to the treatment of our fellow citizens who are mentally handicapped, and particularly supporting their families.  I do not cavil with Senator Honan in this regard.  It was for this reason that the services for the mentally handicapped were exempted from the restrictions imposed on revenue allocations in the other areas of the health services in July 1982 and early in 1983.  In the cutbacks in the health services in the middle of last year, services for the mentally handicapped were wholly exempted.  Again in early 1983, when I discussed the revised Estimates, the Government again confirmed their decision to exempt the services from any cutback.</P>
    <P>I was pleased earlier this year to confirm that policy of the outgoing Government to exempt certain new priority projects of the mental handicap services from the effects of the embargo on the recruitment of staff.  That allowed 150 new jobs to be allocated to the mental handicap services so that these units which had been lying vacant could be opened.  I am acutely aware of the shortfall of the services because with modern medicine, rehabilitation and modern methods of support, young people who are mentally handicapped, as Senator Tras Honan will readily confirm and as Senator Dooge as Leader of the House well knows from our own constituency, either Dunmore House or any one of the other areas here, have a much longer life. <Col N="265" /> A large number of young people are coming out of the special schools and of course require continuing residential care.  This is imposing a great deal of strain both on parents, many of whom are quite elderly, and on the services provided by the health board.</P>
    <P>We recently had a census.  Arising out of these trends there has been a substantial increase in the number of mentally handicapped persons in the moderate, severe and profound categories, much higher than the general increase in population because of longer life.  There is a great need for extensive new projects to meet these particular needs.  I invite Senator Honan to come down with me to Swinford, because there are still only the drawing board plans for Loughlinstown. In terms of Swinford, Cheeverstown or Loughlinstown, I assure Senator Honan that there will not be enclosed ghetto type housing for those who either require residential care or day care support.  There is a concept of village integrated, tigín type, family-oriented support, where three or four mentally handicapped persons would live together with a house mother or father and learn to do their shopping together in a shopping centre in that area.  That is why we are spending £11 million in Swinford.  We have already spend £6 million in Cheeverstown.  We hope to spend £6 million or £7 million in Loughlinstown and to have 500 or 600 persons between all three, especially those whose parents have died.</P>
    <P>Many women in Ireland have mentally handicapped children because they married very late in life and they had children in their mid-forties.  There is a much higher incidence in Mayo, Galway and Roscommon of mental handicap for a variety of reasons that are well known.</P>
    <P>I conclude on the basis that I have made on special effort in which Senator Tras Honan might be interested and might have some consultations with the CEO in her own health board area and with the programme manager.  In the past couple of weeks I have had discussions with the Department of Finance and the Department of Labour about using the youth employment schemes in the services for the mentally handicapped.  I <Col N="266" /> have had many difficulties in these discussions, but I am happy to report for the first time in public that voluntary agencies have been informed that they are eligible to avail of the grant scheme for youth employment.  The scheme will enable the voluntary agencies in the field of mental handicap to recruit young people to facilitate the release of existing staff wishing to pursue training courses and also to assist in the introduction of new programmes and developments which were approved in recent years.  I am glad to say that in the past three weeks more than half of the agencies eligible have already applied for approval to recruit young people for these activities.  I find that among young people who are fortunate enough to have the best of health, there is enormous commitment and dedication to assisting those who are mentally handicapped.  I commend that scheme to the Senator, particularly in her own health board area.</P>
    <P>I have approved a number of minor capital grant schemes totalling £600,000 to enable the residential and day centres to expand their maintenance programmes, thus creating a higher standard of accommodation and services.  That sum has been allocated in recent weeks to a wide range of services.  The nearest to the Senator's area is St.  Vincent's in Limerick.  They got additional moneys for maintenance.  I regret that in the Clare area we did not have particular applications, but that is not my responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are at the moment very severe financial constraints.  I am determined to continue to give the services for the mentally handicapped the highest possible priority and to ensure that the present standards for their care are fully maintained. I look forward to continuing this work with the support of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and, in association with the many voluntary agencies, I have no doubt that we can expand these services even in times of the most severe financial constraints facing the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing this matter to be raised.  It is the first issue raised in our new session and I cannot think of a more <Col N="267" /> appropriate one to be discussed on the Adjournment.</P>
