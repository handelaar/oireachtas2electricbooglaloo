      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in that order.  Regarding No. 3, it has been agreed with the Leader and the Whip of the Opposition that the House will be allowed facilities to have a debate on CIE, which is involved in this Bill, on Wednesday, 25 January.  It is intended to allow Government time for a full debate on CIE.  That is to facilitate the Minister to get all the Stages of his Transport Bill today.  No. 5, which is a Private Member's motion, may not necessarily be reached.  In other words, it is our intention to finish Government business first and we will not be interrupting business at 5 o'clock to take that motion if there is still Government business to be dealt with.</P>

      <P>What is the situation regarding the Twenty-First Report?  It seems that we will not reach this January 1983 report until at least February or March 1984, if we are to take the Appropriation <Col N="910" /> Bill when we come back, and then the debate on CIE &mdash; and presumably there will be a certain amount of legislation as well.  Perhaps this item should be removed from the Order Paper altogether and we could take the Twenty-First, Twenty-Second and Twenty-Third Reports together.  We keep saying this is an historical document, but the position is getting out of proportion.  It is urgent that we discuss in this House what is happening in Europe but we are not getting an opportunity to do that and something will have to be done to get this matter dealt with as soon as possible.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan) John F. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose <Col N="911" /> of this Bill is to provide for implementation by Ireland of the Protocol amending the International Convention relating to co-operation for the Safety of Air Navigation, commonly known as &ldquo;Eurocontrol Convention&rdquo; together with the new multilateral agreement on route charges.</P>
      <P>The Eurocontrol International Convention relating to co-operation for the Safety of Air Navigation was signed on 13 December 1960.  The convention was brought into effect in Ireland by the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1963.  The main reasons for the establishment of the Eurocontrol Organisation lay in the new requirements of air traffic control &mdash; the growing number of aircraft flying at higher speeds, the pace at which the aeronautical sciences were advancing and the greater inter-dependence of the industrialised countries of western Europe.  All pointed to joint action as a means of producing a multinational concept of air traffic control at high altitude &mdash; above either 20,000 or 25,000 feet.</P>
      <P>The organisation initially consisted of six members &mdash; Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom.  Ireland became the seventh member in January 1965.  Technical or co-operation agreements have been concluded with a number of non-member states including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, Austria and the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisation has its headquarters in Brussels.  The organisation is composed of two bodies; the permanent commission, a deliberative body, and the Air Traffic Services Agency, an executive body.  The Permanent Commission formulates common policies on certain matters relating to air traffic control and also exercises the power of general supervision of the agency's activities.  Member states are represented on the commission by Ministers.  The office of the President of the Permanent Commission is assumed by the representatives of the member states in turn for a period of one year. The Irish Minister has held the office of President of the Permanent Commission for two periods, that is to say from July <Col N="912" /> 1969 to June 1970 and from July 1976 to June 1977.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Jim Mitchell, has been appointed President of the Permanent Commission for the year beginning 1 January 1984.</P>
    <P>The agency is administered by a Committee of Management and a director general assisted by an international staff. The director general is at the head of all the agency's services and in conjunction with the Committee of Management is responsible for the general administration of the agency.  The present Director General, Mr. Horst Flentje of the Federal Republic of Germany, took up his appointment on 1 July 1983 for a five year period.</P>
    <P>The original purpose of the Eurocontrol Convention was to provide a common system of air traffic control in the upper airspace &mdash; that is to say above 20,000-25,000 feet &mdash; of member states. This was achieved through an air traffic control organisation which had legal responsibility for the provision of air traffic services in the upper airspaces.  In Ireland's case new operational facilities were communally financed through Eurocontrol's budget and the Department of Transport provided the staff to operate these facilities under a bilateral agreement with Eurocontrol.  Certain other member states &mdash; the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands &mdash; also operated services through bilateral agreements.</P>
    <P>Under the Eurocontrol Convention the facilities that were provided in Ireland under the common financing system were the Shannon Upper Airspace Control Centre and the Mount Gabriel County Cork, and Woodcock Hill, County Clare Secondary Surveillance Radar Stations.  We were obliged to provide these facilities by virtue of our membership of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</P>
    <P>In 1971 Ireland decided to participate in an international scheme under the aegis of Eurocontrol to collect charges from airlines for the use by them of enroute air navigation services provided by us.  The Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1971 provided for the payment of a single charge by aircraft operators for <Col N="913" /> en-route air navigation facilities, other than aerodrome navigation services.  The charges are made payable by the operators in US dollars to Eurocontrol which, by virtue of a bilateral agreement made between Ireland and that organisation has undertaken to refund to this country the amount of the charges collected in respect of the services made available in Irish airspace, less the cost of collection. Similar agreements exist with the other states in the route charges system which are the seven states of Eurocontrol plus Austria, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. In 1982 our route charges receipts amounted to £9.5 million and the receipts in 1983 exceed £11 million.</P>
    <P>One of the major differences between the present and the new convention is that all air traffic control facilities and services will be national instead of communal. At the transition date each member state will take control of the direct investments, for example, upper airspace control centres and secondary surveillance radar stations, sited on their territories. It was agreed that the host country would &ldquo;buy in&rdquo; the direct investments sited on their territories at their amortised value at the transition date and that the fund thus created would be distributed among all member states in GNP proportions.  However, there was sympathetic recognition on the part of all other member states of the need for special treatment for Ireland because of our important location for trans-Atlantic civil aviation and the fact that the Eurocontrol facilities in Ireland are more elaborate than those required for Ireland's own needs.  The cost of installing the facilities in Ireland was about £9 million.</P>
    <P>In our case it was agreed that the Shannon Upper Airspace Control Centre, together with the Mount Gabriel, County Cork and Woodcock Hill, County Clare, Secondary Surveillance Radar Stations would become the property of Ireland on the entry into force of the amending protocol. As these facilities were financed by the seven member states, transitional financial arrangements have been agreed to the effect that Ireland's route charges receipts will be reduced over a period of four years after 1984 in respect of the <Col N="914" /> amortisation element only of the capital cost of these facilities up to a maximum of £2.5 million.  Any costs incurred in the future replacement of these facilities will have to be borne by Ireland but these costs can be recovered in full from airlines under the route charges system.</P>
    <P>The principle changes in the role and activities of Eurocontrol proposed in the amending protocol are as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  The organisation's responsibilities for the planning of air traffic services will be extended to the whole airspace, not just the upper airspace &mdash; above 20,000-25,000 feet &mdash; as at present.  The primary task of Eurocontrol will thus become the development of the air traffic control system in the member states according to a common basic concept in such a way that the national plans are effectively co-ordinated in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>(b)  There will no longer be any obligation on the part of member states to transfer responsibilities for air traffic services to the organisation.  This has no relevance for Ireland as we had not handed over executive functions under the old convention.</P>
    <P>(c)  The current programme for the communal financing of expenditure on operational facilities in the member states will be discontinued.  It is considered that the implementation of this communal finance system has proved to be extremely complex and the effort devoted to it has hampered concentration on the organisation's real role in the development of air traffic services.</P>
    <P>(d)  Eurocontrol will play a key role in the development and operation of a European system of air traffic flow management, in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</P>
    <P>(e)  The Eurocontrol route charges system will continue on its present lines.  The new multilateral agreement on route charges has been signed by the seven member states and the four non-member states now associated <Col N="915" /> with the system, Australia, Portugal, Switzerland and Spain.</P>
    <P>During its 20 years of existence, Eurocontrol has established an experimental centre at Bretigny near Paris which undertakes studies, tests and simulations on behalf of Eurocontrol to improve efficiency of ATC.  It has also set up an Institute of Air Navigation in Luxembourg which undertakes the training of ATC controllers and assistant controllers and which carries out work in connection with data handling, information, analyses, programming and maintenance. Air traffic control centres and secondary surveillance radar stations have been set up at Brussels, London, Shannon, Maastricht in Holland and Karlsruhe in Germany.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the states concerned that the Maastricht Air Traffic Control Centre, which at present controls the upper airspace of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Hannover area of Northern Germany, will in the next couple of years assume control of total air traffic control above flight level 10,000 feet in the states of Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Northern Germany.</P>
    <P>Under the amending protocol, various powers which were vested in Eurocontrol will revert to national control.  In our case these powers related to such matters as the provision of land by the Minister for the organisation, the acquisition of land and of water rights by the Minister at the request of the organisation and the obligations on aircraft operators to comply with relevant ATC authorisations.</P>
    <P>This Bill effectively removes the supra-national authority vested in Eurocontrol by virtue of the 1960 Convention and the Act of 1963.  This supra-national authority was never given full effect in Ireland and the facilities provided and owned by Eurocontrol were operated by the Minister under bilateral agreement. Provision is also made in this Bill to give effect to Articles 18 and 23 of the protocol which relate to the inviolability of persons and documents in the course of their duties connected with Eurocontrol and <Col N="916" /> to Article 22.7 which makes special provisions in relation to the position of the director general of the agency.</P>
    <P>Article 36 of the protocol provides that states which accede to the convention shall also become parties to the multilateral agreement on route charges.  This Agreement continues in force a system &mdash; introduced in a multilateral agreement of 1971 &mdash; under which Eurocontrol acts as agent in the collection of route charges for navigational aids.</P>
    <P>The new multilateral agreement introduces provisions stating that a legal decision taken in a contracting state against a user of the system who has defaulted in the payment of route charges shall be recognisable and enforceable in other contracting states.  Provision is made in the Bill to amend the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1971 so as to implement Articles 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 which contain the provisions on recognition and enforcement.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being taken to up-date the level of penalties provided for in the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1963 and the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1971.  The remaining amendments are editorial in nature.  I recommend this Bill strongly to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, I would like to take this opportunity of welcoming this Bill.  We are in an era of developing air transport and not just on an international level.  If we examine the scene in Ireland we see that small airports of varying sizes have been built and there is a possibility that that trend will continue.  For that reason anything we can do to improve transport in the sky would be welcome. This Bill seeks co-operation for the safety of air navigation, and we must all welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I again refer to the fact, more on a local than an international level, that our skies are overcrowded with planes of one kind or another.  Unfortunately, that situation is going to bring about more accidents involving planes of different sizes.  There were catastrophes in Spain and other countries recently, all of which highlight the need for more control.  Our <Col N="917" /> record has been excellent and it is one we can be proud of.  Nonetheless, we must make every effort to become part of an overall international team to keep the safety of air navigation in everybody's mind.  The number of small aircraft in this country and the number of licensed pilots have increased massively.  In 1973 there were 173 licensed pilots and I have no doubt that number has increased fourfold by now, which would indicate that many people have a great awareness of flying. We hope that the training of pilots will guarantee that they have full knowledge of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is not my intention to delay the passage of this Bill but in the knowledge that there are different standards of air control in so many different countries it is important for us to seek to achieve greater interest and greater coordination which must be done on an international level.  Obviously it cannot be achieved by us alone.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a very important Bill and a very complex Bill and it is one that all of us in this House will recommend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to welcome this Bill.  We are dealing here with a Bill which is intended to be an enabling measure dealing with the Eurocontrol Convention, together with the multilateral agreement on route charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as I understand it, deals with the upper air space, that is safety control relating to aircraft flying at over 20,000 to 25,000 feet, which is obviously part of the convention relating to seven other states.  The secondary surveillance radar stations in this country, as is well known to Members, are situated at the Shannon Upper Airspace Control Centre, at Mount Gabriel, County Cork and at Woodcock Hill, County Clare.  I would like to ask the Minister to give us some indication of when the Mount Gabriel Radar Station, County Cork, which was the subject of attention by subversives some years ago, will be brought back into full operation.  As I understand it, there is a major building operation required there and I would like to know what this <Col N="918" /> building operation will cost in terms of subvention.  Presumably the Eurocontrol Centre in Europe will be funding this project, although I know and appreciate that these stations are now the property of Ireland and that to some extent the Department of Transport may have to pay the cost of what occurred there a number of years ago.  In the absence of one of our three radar control centres, which was badly damaged by a bomb attack some years ago, are we offering the facilities we had hoped to offer when we provided the three centres?</P>
    <P>Another detail I would like to raise &mdash; and an explanation from the Minister would be welcomed &mdash; relates to the route charges that apply in various parts of Europe.  From reading the Dáil debate I noticed that the route charge applied to the radar station in Shannon has a charge of $142 whereas the appropriate charge in London is of the order of $683.  That is a very alarming difference in contributions by international airlines.  I could understand if the difference related to airport charges but we are talking of route charges and there is a distinct difference between one and the other.  Presumably when facilities are offered by this State through the existing radar installations at Shannon, Mount Gabriel and Woodcock Hill, we should be able to get a greater level of revenue input into this State.  Is that something to do with the dollar exchange?  Is it because they are paying us in punts and others are paying in other currencies?  An explanation would be welcome when the Minister gets an opportunity.</P>
    <P>My main contribution today deals with a broadening of the Bill, but relates to aviation.  First, I would like to make a strong plea to the Minister on two counts: in the immediate future he should attempt to get a plan for the aviation industry before these Houses and before the country.  Because of the continuing existence and the role Aer Lingus plays both nationally and internationally and the arrival of the shorthaul aircraft, which are very familiar features of our airports, with the arrival ten years ago of Aer Arann and Avair in the last three years which provide a carrier service <Col N="919" /> between our cities and towns &mdash; it is necessary for us to slot into the transport programme, particularly on the aviation side, a plan for the future and to roll-over in the public mind the kind of thoughts that the Minister and the Department must have, and to get from the Department a response to the demands that have been made now for a number of years for an aviation authority which would be responsible for the licensing of aircraft and the control of aircraft movements in this country.  There are similar bodies in Britain, the Civil Aviation Authority, and the United States, the Federal Aviation Authority.</P>
    <P>There are anomalies and difficulties in dealing with the Department of Transport. I understand that a British carrier is running a flight from London to Dublin and a series of applications relating to that particular route have been made to the Department over the past year and a response has not been forthcoming.  I am wondering why we do not have a more formal procedure.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the Civil Service and the Department of Transport, an aviation authority would make recommendations to the Minister.  I appeal strongly for a plan for the aviation industry and I am doing so not just because of the arrival of shorthaul aircraft into Dublin, Cork, Shannon and our regional airports, but because of the arrival of our regional airports, and the need to plan for them.</P>
    <P>Although we have laid airstrips in other locations &mdash; and there is a magnificent one in Knock, County Mayo &mdash; we have airports in centres like Sligo, Waterford and Galway which require financing and I know that there is a need for an additional runway in Galway.  In Waterford we have a need for increased emphasis on safety in air navigation.  Sligo is probably our best developed regional airport which could have the standing of an international airport and thus give much greater scope for air traffic into the west of Ireland.  I wonder whether planning of this kind is envisaged for an airport on <Col N="920" /> which there has been major capital expenditure in recent times.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am sorry the Minister who introduced it today may not be introducing measures of this kind in the foreseeable future.  He will be dealing with other areas of public policy.  He will always be welcome to this House.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning for the aviation industry, planning not only for the increased use of shorthaul aircraft but also for the complexity of our services and the demand for both passenger and freight input into our regional airports, when will we have a plan which will give those of us who are interested some indication of the future for our aircraft, our airports, and our air space?  When will such a plan be put on the map in a serious fashion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I share the concern for the improvement of the safety of air navigation and for co-operation with other countries to that end.  The measure which the Minister of State has introduced today is a highly technical Bill in a very complex and technical area.  Like the other Senators who contributed, I should like to focus on the questions raised and hope that in his reply the Minister of State can deal with them and provide some answers to them.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to implement part of a protocol amending the international convention relating to co-operation for the safety of air navigation and also to implement parts of the multinational agreement on route charges.  We do not have the original documents before us, but that is the purpose of the measure.  I listened very carefully to what the Minister had to say in introducing the Bill.  I have also looked at the debate in the other House, a rather brief debate on this measure, and there are a number of questions to which it would be helpful to have responses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, why is the Eurocontrol Convention participated in only by rather a small number of European countries? As the Minister pointed out, Ireland was the seventh country to join the six original members.  It does not include fellow EEC countries like Denmark and Italy <Col N="921" /> and, significantly, it does not include other countries like Sweden, Switzerland and Austria which have very developed policies in the area of non-alliance of a military kind and policies of neutrality. Why did Ireland decide to become a member in 1963, and have we ever reconsidered that decision?  Have we ever reexamined the original decision to participate as a full member of Eurocontrol?</P>
    <P>In relation to the facilities established in these countries to which reference has been made, the radar surveillance facilities, apart from the role they play in the safety of civil air navigation, do they play a role in relation to military flights over Irish territory?  If so, could the Minister give the House information on this?  In the monitoring through the use of these radar surveillance installations, who has access to that?  Do we share that with fellow members of Eurocontrol and are there implications in sharing that information for Ireland as a non-member of NATO and as a country with a policy of neutrality?</P>
    <P>These issues arise increasingly in the kind of world we live in, a world of inter-dependence, and also a world where there are countries which would like to extend the scope of their military strategy and surveillance, particularly their surveillance. The extent to which, by virtue of our participation in Eurocontrol under the auspices of safety in civil air navigation, we might be drawn into a wider military surveillance circuit, or the extent to which we might inadvertently become part of a broader surveillance certainly concerns me.  Clearly this lay behind one incident to which Senator FitzGerald drew attention, the blowing up of the installation in Schull in County Cork in 1982.  Obviously I condemn unequivocally any such action, but it is evidence of a growing concern, a concern which perhaps breeds on rumour and lack of specific information.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful to have on the record of the House as full an answer to these questions as the Minister feels able to give.  Let us know precisely and as fully as possible what the position is, so that we may be better informed and aware of where the lines are drawn and how the <Col N="922" /> Minister is able, if he gives this assurance, to assure the House that there is no danger of undermining our policy of neutrality, of having us drawn into a military strategic monitoring role in relation to our participation in Eurocontrol.  These are the issues on which I should be grateful for specific replies from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  I welcome the Minister of State.  I want to compliment him on his introductory speech which omitted no aspect of the work of Eurocontrol.  I join with Senator FitzGerald in saying the Department of Transport will certainly miss the expertise he has acquired in such a short time. I wish him well in his new Department.</P>
      <P>I support this Bill because there is a great need to have adequate and top class air navigation controls and safety measures in operation at all times.  We in this country must surely subscribe to that ideal.  This was the first of these European organisations with which we got deeply involved.  During the mid-seventies when I was President of the Transport Commission in Europe, on a number of occasions the Director General of Eurocontrol mentioned the fact that the civil servants who represent us on Eurocontrol made a tremendous contribution to the work, the evolvement, the expansion and the upgrading of the services this organisation provides.  It is very important that we should be part of this organisation since most of the busy air routes across the Atlantic come within our air space.</P>
      <P>One aspect of this Bill that I welcome especially is the fact that, as far as the Irish operation is concerned, it becomes more national.  We had a problem here some years ago when a very small number of persons in the service of Eurocontrol had European type salaries in our rural areas where these installations are sited. This caused a problem with those operatives' superiors in the Department of Transport.  So, while I hope there will be an easy way of readjusting to national standards, at least we will not have the problems these small matters are sometimes inclined to create.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Government will press <Col N="923" /> ahead to replace the facilities which were damaged in Mount Gabriel if that work has not already been carried out successfully. The organisation who sabotaged this installation at Mount Gabriel also take it on themselves to slaughter ordinary people at worship.  The areas in the world where all these freedoms are not available are confined to specific regions. We do not need to apologise to anyone for playing our part in providing the safest possible facilities for the large numbers of people who now use air transport. The fact that flights pass over our territory means that we have an obligation to ensure that the safest possible facilities are available.  We are reimbursed for supplying that service.  The population should be happy that we can be of assistance to people who wish to use the air navigation aids the Irish Government have supplied since 1965.  The standard of efficiency and the excellence of the work of all concerned with Eurocontrol in the Irish context are highly regarded in air navigation services.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on the very full explanation he gave the House and I support the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principle of the Bill and realise that it allows us to implement a protocol.  I want to reiterate the point made by Senator Robinson. The first thing that occurred to me while I was listening to the Minister was that we should avail of every opportunity to ensure that in an area such as this &mdash; an area of radar control and radar facilities &mdash; our neutrality is stated over and over again.  We should never allow any doubt to arise, in people's minds, whether they are members of this group or indeed any other group, that our neutrality is very precious to us.  Any facilities we have are used for the purpose for which they were designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mount Gabriel installation was sabotaged &mdash; and nobody condones that &mdash; because for propaganda purposes people purported to believe these services somehow had a hidden purpose. We should lose no opportunity to redefine <Col N="924" /> our neutrality and restate the fact that we are not part of NATO.  In our International Affairs Committee the Labour Party always emphasise this throughout the world.  We have a very special pride in our neutrality.  Because of our standing in the world as a neutral nation our voice is respected in the United Nations.  Every opportunity should be grasped to restate our neutrality and the fact that we have nothing to do with NATO.  Any facilities we have by way of radar stations located at Shannon, Cork or Clare are used specifically and only for the purposes for which they were designed.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister is replying he will spell that out for the doubting Thomases.  There are still people who have doubts about where we stand, particularly after the recent debacle in the European Parliament on the question of the deployment of missiles and so on. People voted with groups because they felt it did not involve our neutrality.  This is an opportunity for the Minister of State to restate those points which are fundamental. I am glad Senator Robinson raised the point.  It was my intention to do so.  It is very important to spell out what these facilities are for and who has access to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as well that my position would be made clear anyway. Because I do not understand the Bill, I do not think it should be before the House as it is now.  I am sorry to have to hold the Minister responsible for the delay which has attended the bringing in of this legislation and the apparent urgency of getting it passed.  I am blaming the Minister because the rules of the House do not permit me to place the blame anywhere else.  If the rules of the House permitted me to place the blame elsewhere, I might do so, but as they do not I will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> This is a very technical measure pursuant on two agreements entered into on 12 February 1981, and this is towards the end of 1983.  It is my understanding that this is to come into operation in 1984 and, consequently, its early passage through this House is essential.  I do not deny the accuracy of that, but I do not see why we should have to wait until 15 November 1983 to have a measure like this placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the kind of legislation which should go to a specialist committee of the House.  It is unreasonable to expect Members who are not properly briefed on matters like this to make sensible contributions, whether it be on the Second Stage or Committee Stage of this important Bill.  Of course there are those who might say we should have the consideration of these matters to our betters, but they would be wrong in that because that is what we are being paid for &mdash; to examine the detail of this legislation and to see whether the detail conforms with the general principles as laid down.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any disagreement in this House on the general need to have control of European air space of the type envisaged.  That is not the problem. Genuine fears have been expressed concerning the effect or possible effect this might have on the neutrality of Ireland.  These are serious matters which should have been considered by a committee of this House, or a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>Similarly, there are extremely complicated sections of this Bill which give the most extraordinary privileges to various members of the organisation in question, including the privilege that the director general of the agency is to enjoy immunity from jurisdiction in respect of all his acts, apparently, other than road traffic offences.  That is the most extraordinary immunity to give to anybody.  There might be a very good reason for it, but Members of this and the other House are entitled to the kind of explanation which you can only get in committee.  I am not talking about a committee of the whole House.  I am talking about a specialist committee.  I wonder why the persons employed by this organisation should <Col N="926" /> enjoy, in respect of their official papers and documents, what is described as inviolability.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to answer these points on Second Stage.  The purpose of my contribution is to bring them to the attention of those whose duty it might be to listen.  As a Member of this House I am not satisfied with the way the House is being treated in this regard.  This is not a Bill to be dealt with in the ordinary way in this House.  It is not a Bill which should be brought in at the end of a legislative session to be rushed in a day or two through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I object in the strongest possible fashion to this approach to this kind of technical legislation.</P>
    <P>There are other proposals on the Order Paper today concerning the increase in the amount of money for various organisations. Those Bills are suitable to be dealt with at short notice by the House at the end of a session.  When you bear in mind that these agreements were entered into on 12 February 1981 and the relevant legislation was not laid before either House of the Oireachtas until 15 November 1983, that is not acceptable as far as I am concerned.  We should not be expected to dance like monkeys at the end of the year so that we can pass the relevant legislation.  That is just not good enough.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the actual detail of what is included in the Bill, obviously from what the Minister said there is a need for the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill to be amended to take into account the provisions of the protocol amending the previous convention.  I hope &mdash; but I have no evidence to prove it &mdash; that what we are asked to approve today will achieve that purpose.  I hoped that we could have considered in greater detail the possible effect this legislation might have on our neutrality.  In fact, from my limited understanding &mdash; and it is very limited &mdash; I do not think it will have any effect.  It is not good enough that I should have that general feeling. We are entitled to go into the problems of the possible military uses to which this kind of service could be put, and the alternative to our participation in anything <Col N="927" /> of that nature.  It should be possible for us to look into that in detail in a committee such as the Committee on Legislation.</P>

That is the purpose of the Committee on Legislation. They should meet to examine the details of Bills like this.  I know it is boring work, but those of us who were given the responsibility of being on that committee should expect to do that kind of work.  If a few people on that committee were given the task they would very quickly become specialists in that area.  We would then have legislation passed which would have the confidence and active support of Members on all sides of this House, rather than the acquiescence of Members of the House, which is all this Bill will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a couple of points.  One of them relates to Mount Gabriel.  The Minister mentioned that the cost of providing the services for the control of aircraft was about £9 million and that, under the new arrangement, where Eurocontrol will revert to national Governments rather than be controlled in a general way, it is suggested that from 1984 we will have only to pay up to £2½ million by way of buying out the buildings already there.  The question was raised as to whether or not Mount Gabriel has been rebuilt.  I do not know whether it has, but it seems to me that the facilities there would cost much more than £2½ million to replace.  Will we have to pay for the building of a new station at Mount Gabriel and find that it could cost up to £8½ million even though, from the time of the take-over, it is suggested that it will cost us £2½ million only? <Col N="928" /> There seems to be some difference here. Perhaps the station has been rebuilt.</P>
      <P>I am at a total loss as to why, at this stage, when we have had a co-ordinated approach to air controls throughout Europe, we are now reverting to national control.  I cannot see the <i>rationale</i> for that.  Basically Ireland takes the brunt of the traffic that comes from the west.  We have to pass that traffic through to somebody else, wherever it is going in Europe. I cannot see the point in breaking up what was a very good system and reverting back to a national Government system.</P>
      <P>I should like to follow up the points made by Senator Robinson and Senator Ferris in relation to the control of these stations and the information which can be disseminated from them.  Can the Minister tell me that every piece of information which goes into a station such as Mount Gabriel cannot be taken by the very high technological innovations over the past number of years and used by receiving stations which could possibly be 1,000 miles away?  The degree of sophistication in the communications area would lead me to believe that you cannot have a fail safe system of control.  We have seen the changes that have taken place in areas such as the Middle East. In Israel they can pinpoint conversations taking place ten miles from their base.  I cannot see how this control will be maintained. I have fears that the type of information going in there could be used for military purposes.</P>
      <P>My first query is on the cost to this country.  Will it be £2½ million or will it be a lot more?  Secondly, it is suggested that the collection of fees will be carried out by a European organisation and will then revert back to the national Governments. Surely that is duplication.  Why do the national Governments not collect the fees?  Thirdly, can we be assured that the stations to be used, which will now be under the aegis of the national Government, are safe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank all those who took part in the debate.  I will try to deal as clearly as I <Col N="929" /> can with the points which have been mentioned. Senator Fallon talked about private pilots.  As the regulatory authority the Department exercise strict control over the issue of licences to private pilots. It will be of interest to the House that there are now about 1,000 licensed pilots in the State.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald raised a number of points, including the matter of Mount Gabriel.  Mount Gabriel is essentially a stand-by facility for the Woodcock Hill station near Shannon and we hope it will be restored to full operational service early in 1984.  He also talked about charges.  The charge is based on the cost, both current and capital, to each state of providing navigational facilities and it includes the cost of staff concerned. These costs, which vary from state to state, are then divided by the estimated level of traffic to give a flat rate.  The rate in turn is adjusted to take account of the weight of a particular aircraft as well as the distance flown.  The charging system is therefore based on the distance flown by a particular aircraft in a given air space.  The charges referred to by Senator FitzGerald relate to tariffs levied on aircraft flying trans-Atlantic routes only. They do not relate to charges levied at particular aerodromes but rather to route charges incurred when flying to or from these aerodromes from points within specified zones over the Atlantic and along particular routes.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald also talked about the Irish Aviation Authority.  The Department act as the Irish Aviation Authority.  His remarks about the desirability of an aviation authority, which does not come under this Bill, will be conveyed to the Minister, Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the planning and development of regional airports are not directly relevant to the Bill, the House will be glad to know that the Minister is at present considering the report of an inter-departmental committee dealing with the matter. A number of airports were mentioned and I was particularly interested in the airport at Galway, but I see from the Estimates that there is no allocation of money to Galway.  Indeed, the <Col N="930" /> entire allocation for regional airport development in next year's Estimate is £700,000, of which £600,000 will have to go to Knock for some contractual obligation there.  The remainder goes to Farranfore in Kerry and Abbeyshrule is also to get some money.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned a number of points.  We decided to join Eurocontrol in 1963 because of the growing complexity of modern aviation which necessitated complex and expensive control equipment.  Mount Gabriel relays radar data to both Shannon and London. This data is based on the electronic interrogation of transponder-equipped aircraft when the transponder is switched on.  Aircraft not transponder-equipped cannot be seen by a secondary surveillance radar system.</P>
    <P>The remarks of a number of Senators have been concerned with the connection with military aircraft.  There is no connection whatsoever because the radar that we have available at these particular places could not detect military aircraft and could not detect any aircraft if there were not a transponder in the aircraft.  If you do not have a transponder you do not know exactly who is up there.  That is the position.  There is no military contact at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's participation in Eurocontrol does not involve the country in any form of military alliance, either explicit or implied.  The upper air facilities near Shannon and in County Cork have no connection whatever with NATO or any other military grouping or agency.  I would refer Senators to two articles which appeared in the &ldquo;Saturday Column&rdquo; of <i>The Irish Times</i> on 3 December 1983 and 10 December 1983.  In the first of them, on 3 December 1983, they talked about a Bill going quietly through the Dáil, as if somebody was trying to put something through the Dáil in a quiet manner to try to hoodwink the public in some way.  This is not a fact.  They came back on 10 December with an article headed &ldquo;Eurocontrol is Innocent.&rdquo;<Col N="931" /> Eurocontrol are innocent and I can guarantee we have no connections of the kind alleged.</P>
      <P>In regard to the air space, certain types of military flights operate regularly through international air space, all or part of which are associated with civil aviation environment of controlled air space.  Such flights include military aircraft transporting military personnel and their families, as well as cargo and equipment handing, in relation to peace-keeping missions, also military aircraft carrying VIPs, top Government officials and so on engaged in official business.  Our own Government's small jet is basically a military aircraft.  Is anybody going to suggest that it is involved in something other than transporting Ministers to and from Europe?  When military aircraft operate in a civil environment there is a transponder on the aircraft and there is a flight plan, just as in the case of any other civil aircraft.  Diplomatic clearance of such flights is provided.  When operating in the civil aviation environment, the flights comply with the civil aviation rules and regulations.</P>
      <P>Mount Gabriel radar station near Schull, County Cork monitored civil aircraft in the upper air space within a radius of 240 miles.  The facility consisted of two radar heads, one duty and one stand-by. The station was damaged by an explosion on 20 September 1982.  As a priority, Eurocontrol decided to restore one head to operational service.  The facility in Cork is basically a stand-by for the one in Shannon.  Installation of the replacement equipment is now almost complete and operational evaluation of the facility is scheduled to commence early in January.  A preliminary estimate of the cost of restoring Mount Gabriel to its pre-1982 state is approximately £2.5 million, not the type of sum suggested by Senator Lanigan.  Malicious injuries claims were lodged with Cork County Council both by Eurocontrol and by my Department.  Both claims are due to be heard in the Circuit Court in Skibbereen in January 1984.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Leary complained about a number of things.  He complained particularly about the lack of opportunity for himself and other Senators to have a more detailed explanation of this Bill.  I must admit that I am not the best one in the world to give a detailed account of it. As junior Minister at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I had very little to do with transport.  Then it became my job to deal with this Bill and in the time available to get the best knowledge possible. If there are any points I am not answering adequately please re-iterate them.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Leary asked why there should be any hurry.  The ratification procedure has been completed in France, Luxembourg and Portugal and we hope all the states will complete their procedures by mid-1984.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the amending protocol and multilateral agreement.  The main provisions cover the recognition and enforcement of judgments of foreign courts against airlines which default in payment of on route charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan and Senator Ferris referred to aircraft fitted with transponders. If you do not have a transponder in an aircraft, or if the transponder is not switched on, the secondary type of radar that is available from the station we are talking about in Ireland does not have any record of it.  One cannot pass on any secrets to anybody in relation to any of <Col N="933" /> these things unless the aircraft have the transponders switched on.</P>
    <P>Eurocontrol collect the route charges because they can do so more efficiently than a national collecting agency.  It makes more sense to have one central collection point rather than have a variety of collection points right around all the member states.  There is another reason for it which I mentioned in my speech. Let us say an airline owed us a certain amount of money because of the number of times they used our air space and there were no properties here belonging to the airline.  In some of the other contracting states they would have collateral.  As a result of that we could follow them for the amount of money they owed through Eurocontrol.  Not alone that, if they did not have property within any of the member states it would be than taken up internationally against the particular carrier. As a result we would get a refund whenever there would be judgment given, provided that they had any funds.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned reverting to a national system.  We are not reverting to a national system.  The supra-national concept was never given full effect in Ireland, nor for that matter in the UK, France or the Netherlands.  The amending protocol recognises this fact.  However, co-operation between Eurocontrol member states remains the major goal and purpose of the organisation.  Eurocontrol will remain the body within which air traffic control systems will be developed according to a common basic concept.</P>

      <P>I found myself in agreement with the criticisms voiced by Senator O'Leary about the difficulty of trying to examine this Bill without having an opportunity to get more information about exactly what is in mind.  For example, under section 1 (2) the Minister for Foreign Affairs may by order declare that any state specified in the order is a party to the agreement, but we have a definition of &ldquo;contracting state&rdquo; which means a state, including the State, which is a party to the agreement.  Does that mean that whether the State is a party to the Agreement or not, the Minister for Foreign Affairs can deem a country to be party to the agreement?</P>

    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the concern amongst many people in Ireland about the link-up there appears to be <Col N="938" /> between Mount Gabriel, Slyne Head, Keflavik, Bishopscourt, Dublin and London. There is a feeling that this is part of an information-collecting process which is involved in NATO.  He may have defused some of this anxiety but I would like to reinforce the question put to him by Senator Lanigan.  It does seem a little extraordinary that we have a system which cannot detect unless the people who need to be detected decide they want to be detected.  Has the Minister any information on the difference that exists between what is taking place in Bishopscourt and the other systems that exist in the Irish Republic and whether the situation he has outlined as existing in Mount Gabriel and other stations here is, in fact, the same as exists in Bishopscourt?  If not, why not, if there is a link between them all?</P>

      <P>I would mention under section 2 the problem concerning the granting to the director-general of this agency immunity from jurisdiction in respect of acts, other than acts which would constitute a road traffic offence or acts whereby damage is caused to a motor vehicle belonging to or driven by him, <Col N="939" /> but including words spoken or written. Has the Minister information in regard to the extent of that immunity and why it is being extended to the director general of this agency?</P>

      <P>The privileges and immunities specified in this section are intended to ensure the proper functioning of the organisation and the safeguarding of its interest.  It is common practice to extend the privileges and immunities enjoyed by other senior diplomatic staff to the secretaries and directors general of international organisations.  In subsection (8) the director-general of Eurocontrol is accorded those privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be extraordinary that we exempt him from everything except a road traffic offence.  I am not suggesting that this director-general of the agency would be involved in drug trafficking or anything else, but we are conferring the most extraordinary immunity on a person, perhaps for very good reasons.  If he drives on the wrong side of the road he can be charged with an offence. It is extraordinary that he would be exempt from prosecution for other offences for which a person should be apprehended, even anybody in the diplomatic service.  It needs to be spelled out fully why such total immunity should be allowed to the director-general.  I want to make sure that he would conform to the same code of ethics that we would expect of people travelling in and out of our airports.  Recently at one of our airports drugs were removed from within the premises and put outside the fence surrounding the airport.  Here we are conferring on somebody an extraordinary privilege that many Members of the House would like to have.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that we are giving such powers to this person, and just mentioning road traffic offences as being an exception.  Why do we not except all the other things that are unacceptable socially to us?  I mention specifically the question of drugs, armaments or subversive documents.  I do not trust anybody any more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said and I now understand why the provision is there.  Senator McDonald explained to me that similar types of immunities are granted to the directors general and officers of similar status in various European organisations connected with the European Community. Of course, I was not a Member of the House when anything like that was adopted and I am not responsible for it. I am responsible for this and it appears to me that the granting of immunity to diplomats is a very special immunity which is based on their being representatives of the sovereign of another country. That is the basis of it.  There is no way one can equate that to the director-general to this worthy organisation.  The principle behind it is incorrect.  I accept what the Minister says, that it is normal. I want to change that.  I do not want it to be normal any more.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to review that aspect of this legislation and of other legislation of a similar type.  The granting of immunity for all such acts is incongruous, to say the least.</P>
      <P>With subsection (8) of section 3, of the 1962 Act, which has been inserted by section 2 of this Act, the contradiction of granting such wide immunity is recognised by reason of the fact that road traffic offences are excluded.  With regard to diplomats, one of the practical effects of giving people diplomatic immunity is that they tend to ignore the road traffic regulations.  Here we are effectively saying that we do not think this man deserves this immunity to the extent of not being held responsible for his road traffic offences. But view that in relation to all the other possible offences for which we are saying he should not be held responsible at all and it shows how ridiculous it is to exclude road traffic offences only.  Surely it would be sufficient to extend immunity, if immunity were necessary at all, in respect of the acts which he committed in his capacity as director general of the agency, rather than in his capacity as a human being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is something which this Minister, other Ministers within the Government, <Col N="941" /> parliamentary draftsmen and the Attorney General's office should consider because I have the gravest doubts as to whether, in fact, his immunity is constitutional and as to whether one can, just willy-nilly, by Act of the Houses of the Oireachtas, decide that somebody should not be held responsible for, or should have immunity in respect of, all his acts, other than road traffic offences.  I do not know if such a thing is possible.  I would like to bring this matter to the Minister's attention, not so much in regard to this particular case but in respect of the various other kinds of legislation which come before us concerning matters of this type.</P>
    <P>Finally, if the organisation which is again referred to in section 2 wants to get a better image in Ireland it should changes its image from Eurocontrol, because that is enough to set any Irishman's hair on end.</P>

Instead of having a freedom of information it seems that we are having a curtailing of information.

The Minister said that the cost of rebuilding Mount Gabriel is going to be £2.5 million, so once this Bill is passed, the cost to us of buying back the equipment and the buildings will be £5 million, rather than £2.5 million.  Irrespective of what Cork County Council or the Government pay on a malicious damages claim to Eurocontrol, if it is going to cost £2.5 million to replace it would appear that it is going to cost us £5 million to take over these buildings rather than the £2.5 million mentioned by the Minister.</P>

      <P>When there is a break up now into national Government control it is stated that all the buildings and equipment that are under Eurocontrol at present will revert back to the national Governments, but the national Governments are going to have to pay for these. The Minister is suggesting in his speech that the cost of buying this is £2.5 million, but that we will not have to pay the £2.5 million, that it will be paid for over a period of years by a reduction in charges. The £2.5 million is all right, but if we have to pay also for the repair of Mount Gabriel, that is another £2.5 million.  It is £5 million rather than £2.5 million.</P>

      <P>First of all, in relation to the claim for Mount Gabriel, I presume an action is being heard in court. Nobody can know what the decision of the court is going to be, so we will have to wait and see.  In relation to the purchase of the stations we are talking about, the officials of the Department have made an agreement with Eurocontrol in relation to the purchase of these and we are getting them at what we consider a very good bargain and the cost will be spread over a number of years to be deducted from the amount of money due to us from Eurocontrol over a number of years.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senators for their contributions. As I stated earlier, the primary effect of this Bill is to give legislative effect to procedures for the recognition and enforcement of judgments against a user &mdash; that is, an air line &mdash; of air navigation facilities who has defaulted in the payment of route charges.  On the entry into force of the amending protocol, all Eurocontrol facilities in Ireland will become the property of the State.  Both the amending protocol and the multilateral agreement on route charges are expected to be ratified by all states concerned during the Irish Presidency of the Permanent Commission in 1984.  When the ratification process is completed, Portugal will become the eighth member of Eurocontrol.</P>
      <P>The amending protocol will enable Eurocontrol to expand and strengthen its role in the development and operation of a co-ordinated European air traffic control system.  While Ireland may be one of the smaller member states of the organisation, we have always been conscious that, because of our geographical location, we can contribute to the development of the organisation and will continue to play a significant role in all matters relating to the organisation's future aims.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan) John F. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a relatively short but important Bill.  Its purpose is to extend the limit on CIE's borrowing powers for capital for temporary purposes and to increase the corresponding guarantee powers of the Minister for Finance.  The present statutory limits on CIE's capital borrowing power is £180 million and it is now proposed to increase that limit to £230 million.  The increase proposed in the case of the <Col N="946" /> board's temporary borrowing powers is from £20 million to £40 million.  These increases are necessary because CIE will shortly reach the statutory limits of their existing powers.</P>
      <P>CIE's capital expenditure is financed from the board's internal resources, mainly depreciation provisions, borrowings and Exchequer capital advances. These borrowing arrangements require the approval of the Minister for Transport and that of the Minister for Finance who has power to guarantee them.  CIE's total capital borrowings at 31 December 1983 will, it is estimated, amount to £175.5 million.</P>
      <P>We have now entered into an unavoidable, necessary and welcome period of rapid change.  For those involved in CIE and for those of us for the time being assigned to guide their fortunes this should not be a time of combat but a time of cohesion.  The inevitability of change is such that the unwise alone will seek to resist, while the wise will seek to fashion it.</P>
      <P>The inevitability of change is indicated by many things but most of all by the galloping deficit which simply has now exceeded what the Exchequer, that is basically the taxpayer, can afford to pay. Last year it broke a new record at £109.2 million &mdash; that is over 33 times what it was in 1969 &mdash; and represented 12 per cent of the current budget deficit.  We have already put a halt to that gallop and for the year now coming to a close the deficit should be around £102 million, which will be the first reduction achieved in 15 years.</P>
      <P>We have also, in a new policy departure for CIE in June, announced, <i>inter alia</i>, that</P>
      <P>(i)  one-third of what they do is considered social and consequently one-third of their expenditure should be their subvention;</P>
      <P>(ii)  their expenditure must be reduced by 12 per cent in real terms over five years &mdash; and therefore their subvention will reduce in real terms over five years by at least 12 per cent;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii)  the subvention will be paid <Col N="947" /> above the line so profits become a possibility from 1984 onwards;</P>
    <P>(iv)  a capital committee has been established to ensure that all future proposals for major capital investment will be properly financially appraised before decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>These changes, although very significant, are only a start and we must now address ourselves to the possibility of advantageous structural changes and be guided in general, if not in detail, by McKinsey.  The problem with McKinsey is that while the prognosis indicated the different problems in CIE and their relative order of magnitude, he is short on cures.  For instance, he says about the railways, which contribute two-thirds of the deficit, that there are four options: (i)  keep them; (ii) reduce them; (iii) expand them or (iv) close them.  He ruled out (ii) and (iii) and said (i) and (iv) will cost the economy more or less the same in over ten or 25 years' span.  However, direct costs to the Exchequer would be considerably less if the railways were closed.</P>
    <P>Two questions, therefore, arise: (a) can we afford to have the railways?  and (b) can we afford not to have the railways? Voluminous bodies of opinion will answer &ldquo;No&rdquo; to both those inherently contradictory questions.  Which of these is right?  That is the £70 million question which no longer can be avoided and must now be faced.</P>
    <P>In addressing themselves to McKinsey, which they will presently do, the Government will be weighing up all economic social and &mdash; let us face it &mdash; political issues involved.  One of these issues is the Howth-Bray electrification about which a great deal has been said and written &mdash; much of it inaccurate &mdash; in the recent past.  This scheme, has no chance of paying for itself, even if passenger numbers reach the most optimistic forecasts.  It would now appear that electrification will add around a further £20 million per year to CIE's problems, at least in the early years.  Having said that, I want to emphasise that there has been no significant cost overrun.  The latest estimated cost is <Col N="948" /> £114.3 million.  This is made up as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  Original estimate (£46.4 million in March 1979) adjusted for inflation and increased VAT &mdash; £85.68 million; 2.  Capitalised interest charges &mdash; £28.62 million; Total &mdash; £114.3 million.</P>
    <P>CIE, when proposing the scheme, did so on the basis that it would be financed entirely by Exchequer grants.  These would not have had to be repaid, nor would they have imposed a liability for continuing interest charges on the board. Initially this was the basis on which the Government of the day approved the scheme.  However, within a matter of weeks they decided that the scheme should be financed on the basis of loan capital.  The decision to convert from grant financing to loan financing effectively added £28.6 million to the capital cost and by rendering the board liable for the on-going annual interest charges put an entirely different complexion on the cost aspects.</P>
    <P>This fundamental change in the financing arrangements pinpoints, I believe, a weakness in the approach not only to the Howth-Bray scheme but to rapid rail transit in general.  It is simply unrealistic to expect that the Exchequer could finance projects of this nature on a grant basis.  That would be possible only in a situation where conditions of continuing and sustained budgetary surplus existed. As we all know only too well, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>When the Howth-Bray electrification scheme was first proposed in 1977, passenger carryings on the line had been showing a continuing upward trend.  They had increased from 12,600 passengers per day in 1970 to some 32,400 per day in 1979, the last year in which commuter services were not being disrupted by construction works.  By the late seventies the rolling stock and equipment in use on the line had reached the end of its useful life and the question of its replacement had become a matter of some urgency.  CIE proposed the electrification of the line, which was in accordance with the recommendations of the Dublin Rapid Rail Transit Study.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain assumptions it was <Col N="949" /> envisaged that electrified services would meet direct operating costs and that depreciation costs would be more than offset by indirect user benefits.  Electrification had the added advantage that it was part of the recommendations in CIE's rapid transit study which envisaged a city wide system linking the new western suburbs <i>via</i> an underground network in the city centre with the Howth-Bray line.  While the decision to electrify did not imply a commitment to the full rapid transit system, it did prevent it from being automatically ruled out as a possibility if a fully satisfactory case could be made for it in the future.</P>
    <P>The then assessment of the energy situation was also a factor since an electrified system would not be dependent on a single source of energy.  I think there is little to be gained at this stage in debating whether the project at its original estimated cost of £46.4 million represented good value for money.  That is an issue that can be decided only on the basis of the perceived value of indirect user benefits and the long-term worth of this substantial addition to infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I can say, however, that I would not today be prepared to seek Government approval for a project of this nature put forward in the same way as the Howth-Bray project.  This must not be taken as criticism of CIE, but rather of the lack of suitable appraisal of such proposals by Governments in the past.  Within my own Department I have now a permanent capital committee to monitor and appraise all major capital expenditure proposals in CIE in the future.</P>
    <P>Daunting as the immediate prospects are for the economics of the service, I am hopeful that when introduced next spring it will bring about a substantial improvement in the existing service in terms of frequency, speed and efficiency.  Day long services are envisaged, serving 25 stations, with trains operating at five minute intervals during peak periods, reducing to 15 minutes off peak.  CIE intend to extend the catchment area of the railway line by the provision of feeder bus services to selected stations.  The board estimate that by 1987 passenger numbers will increase to about 80,000 per day, <Col N="950" /> more than twice the previous best average daily carryings.</P>
    <P>Another major element in CIE's capital programme is the acquisition of 124 carriage units for mainline passenger services.  The new units consist of 94 standard carriages, 15 catering cars and 15 generator vans to be assembled at the Inchicore works in Dublin.  With the new carriages CIE will be able to provide mainline rail facilities of an acceptable standard of comfort and convenience.  It is expected that the first carriages will be available for service early in 1984.  The capital cost of the project at current prices is estimated at about £52 million, including VAT of approximately £8 million.</P>
    <P>The renewal of the board's city and provincial bus fleets is also continuing. Deputies will recall that bus deliveries from the factory at Shannon commenced in 1981 and I am sure that all Members of the House will have seen the new buses on the move throughout the country.  By the end of this year CIE will have taken delivery of 104 single-deck buses and some 366 double-deck buses at a total capital cost of about £68 million.</P>
    <P>Almost since the inception of production at the Shannon plant the Government have been concerned about the form of the relationship between CIE and their Shannon supplier.  This concern springs from the fact that the Shannon firm are basically dependent on CIE for orders for buses.  Questions arise as to whether the manufacturing arrangements represent good value as far as CIE are concerned.  As an indication of their concern, the Government commissioned a firm of consultants to carry out a study of the relationship between CIE and their supplier some months ago.  Meanwhile, the ownership of the Shannon firm changed and, as a consequence, Bombardier no longer have an interest in the operation.  Manufacture of buses is continuing at the plant, however, under interim arrangements.  The Minister has asked CIE to provide him with their proposals in this respect so that he can submit them to Government in conjunction with the consultant's report.  He hopes to have CIE's proposals shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" /> In addition to the projects I have mentioned, the board's signalling and normal capital programmes are continuing.  The main sources of funding for the latter tend to be Exchequer capital advances and depreciation provisions.  The increased borrowing and guarantee arrangements provided for in the Bill are to enable CIE to continue their capital programme as described.  The new limit of £230 million in respect of capital borrowings is an increase of £50 million on the existing limit.</P>
    <P>Now to turn to the temporary borrowing question.  Under section 5 of the Transport Act, 1981, CIE may, with the consent of the Minister for Transport and that of the Minister for Finance, incur temporary borrowings of up to £20 million. This borrowing power is used by CIE to respond to short-term cash shortfalls. With Government approval, this borrowing facility has also been used to finance the difference between total subvention and deficit, when the total subvention made available in any one year has been insufficient to meet the board's deficit on subventible activities.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years CIE's deficits have exceeded the annual subventions which the Exchequer has been able to make available to the board.  1983 will fall into this category, but in exceptional circumstances.  When the Estimates for 1983 were being prepared in 1982, the then Government put into the Estimates a figure for £86 million compared with an outturn of £109.2 million in 1982.  This was clearly an unrealistic figure from the start, which had no basis.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year when deciding their new approach to CIE for the next five years the Government also made realistic provision for the current year.  It was decided that CIE should be asked to live within a deficit of £99 million, plus the cost of the public service pay round which we now know comes to £5 million.  I am glad to report that CIE can live within £102 million in 1983. Although this is a reduction of nearly £7 million on last year, it is £16 million more than provided for in the Estimates. Therefore, we provide in this Bill for the <Col N="952" /> temporary borrowing limit necessary to bridge the gap.  The deficits in excess of subvention since 1981 are symptomatic of what has become a very substantial problem.  Actual State subvention was £85 million in 1981, £96 million in 1982 and £86 million in 1983, a total of £267 million, a sizeable amount of State funding by any standard.</P>
    <P>This year, 1983, marks an important turning point in the affairs of CIE as regards State subvention.  In 1969-70 CIE's deficit amounted to £3.2 million. Had the increase in deficit been confined to the rate of inflation the board's 1982 deficit would have amounted to some £17.3 million.  The deficit for 1982, however, amounted to more than £109 million. If this rate of increase were to continue I do not see the Exchequer being able to provide the huge sums that would eventually be required for public transport. Indeed, the experience of recent years underlines the dangers of this approach.</P>
    <P>When Deputy J. Mitchell became Minister for Transport late last year the subvention for CIE for 1983 had already been fixed, as I have said at £86 million. In the review which took place immediately after the Government came into office it was clear that there was no possibility of increasing the subvention beyond that level even though it was recognised that the board's deficit would exceed the subvention.  In the circumstances, the only real alternative was to let CIE carry the shortfall by temporary borrowing.  The Government, therefore, decided to promote legislation which would enable CIE to cover the shortfall in that way.  As I mentioned earlier, that shortfall is expected to work out at about £16 million.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the position for 1983 and future years the Government saw that a new approach was needed for the fixing of the CIE subvention so that the level of State support could be matched by what the Exchequer could afford.  At the same time it was clear that a massive reduction in State subvention could not be achieved overnight without serious adverse repercussions. It was against this background that the Minister tackled the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> With the approval of the Government, the Minister introduced a package of measures in June last to bring about a substantial improvement in CIE's position. The main features of that package were, firstly, a formula for the settlement of the CIE subvention, which is now determined as 50 per cent of CIE revenue or 33? per cent of expenditure, whichever is the lesser.  In other words, every £2 earned by the board, in principle, attracts a State subvention of £1, subject to the constraint of the one-in-three on the expenditure side.  Secondly, subvention moneys will be paid to CIE from 1 January 1984 as revenue, or &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; in accountancy terms.  Thirdly, CIE are required to achieve a reduction of 12 per cent in expenditure in real terms over five years from 1984, a vital element in getting CIE finances under control. Fourthly, and as briefly mentioned earlier, the establishment of a permanent capital committee with representatives from the Department of Transport, the Department of Finance and CIE will appraise and monitor CIE's capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The subvention formula is a big step forward in the Government's relations with CIE.  It tells CIE quite clearly the type of performance that the Government expect in the years immediately ahead.  In matching the level of subvention to the company's performance we are providing the type of corporate incentive necessary to reverse the deficit trend of recent years.  This, with payment of the subvention &ldquo;above the line&rdquo;, should help to create the conditions in which management and staff can be motivated to perform in a more commercial manner.</P>
    <P>The formula is also a discipline on Government.  Subvention will no longer be decided on an arbitrary basis but must be consistent with the formula.  The formula itself is not perfect and may need to be refined, but it is a pragamatic basis for measuring Government's contribution to the social aspects of CIE services in the medium term.  Under the new system CIE have the opportunity to operate profitably after bringing the subvention to account.  This incentive is, I believe, a key to motivating substantial improvements <Col N="954" /> in the standard and quality of the board's services.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in the year of this new approach CIE's deficit will, for the first time in 15 years, be less than that for the preceding year.  The projected 1983 deficit of some £102 million will be an improvement of £7 million in cash terms on the board's deficit of £109 million for 1982 which, when inflation is taken into account, is an improvement in real terms of approximately 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>A factor that must not be forgotten when considering CIE problems is that Governments in the past have often exacerbated such problems.  Examples of this include withholding of increases in fares and rates and the involvement by Government in purely commercial or operational aspects of the board's affairs. I hope that under the formula arrangements this practice will cease thus allowing CIE to manage their affairs in as commercial a manner as is possible.  It is the intention of the Minister to discourage all unnecessary political intervention in the day-to-day affairs of CIE.  If public representatives have problems about services or operations, the most efficient way of dealing with them will be to go direct to CIE.  The Minister therefore decided to discontinue the practice of receiving deputations about administrative matters and the like in CIE.  CIE, I am sure, will welcome that development and will be able to demonstrate the responsibility with which they exercise their functions.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said recently to the board, and indeed publicly, there are areas in which there can be substantial improvement in performance by CIE. One of these is in the industrial relations area.  The numbers employed in CIE, the range of skills, the spread of locations and the variety of conditions in which the staff operate are factors which influence CIE industrial relations.  However, all staff in CIE should realise the damage that is done not just by major strikes but even by relatively small incidents involving very few people over minor issues. Absenteeism is another factor to be regretted.</P>
    <P>No one should forget that CIE are in <Col N="955" /> the market-place to sell their transport products.  Time and again the consumer has shown that product reliability is high among his priorities.  In CIE's case, every industrial relations incident damages the board's reliability and credibility which inevitably increases costs, loses customers and revenue and in the long run defeats the interests of the workers themselves. With the high cost of private motoring in Ireland, I believe that CIE have a vast potential to win many more customers.  However, this potential can be tapped only if morale improves and the board show in the market-place that their services are, above all else, reliable and efficient.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen in the media the recent announcement regarding the appointment of a new chairman to take over at the helm in CIE on 1 January next.  I would like to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Government and my own thanks to Dr. Liam St. John Devlin for the service to the State which he has given as chairman of CIE during the last ten years.  Earlier this year Dr. Devlin informed the Minister that he would not wish to continue in his post beyond the end of the year. The chairmanship of CIE is an extremely onerous position, which carries an exceptionally heavy burden and our thanks are due to Dr. Devlin for the dedicated manner in which he has discharged this responsibility during the past decade.  I should also like to welcome Mr. Paul Conlon as the new executive Chairman of CIE and on behalf of this House to wish him well.</P>
    <P>As it approaches the anniversary of the appointment of Deputy J. Mitchell as Minister for Transport, I can say that since his appointment he has had contact, mostly personal contact, with almost every representative interest in the field of inland transport embracing carriers and users as well as outside experts, academics and commentators.  During that year, he has taken steps to get some fundamental grasp of the nature and problems of the inland transport industry, and especially of the troubled area many of us have, unfortunately, come to <Col N="956" /> associate with CIE.  These contacts have been of immense value to that end but some of them have also been disappointing. This has been for the very simple reason that some people he has met based their positions on very narrow and subjective views while showing no grasp of the global problems and no potential for an imaginative approach to the problems they identify.  I think there has been a lot of casual thinking on the subject of transport and that the time has come when all who are really concerned will have to review their thinking habits.  The magic solutions to transport problems will still remain elusive but there will never be progress if we all remain entrenched in our views and muddled in our thinking.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>By agreement, we have decided to expedite the passing of this Transport Bill, because on the information we have, the money is urgently needed by CIE.  However, part of the agreement is that after Christmas we will have a full debate in Government time on the problems of CIE.  I am sure that at that stage there will be no time limit. There is nobody in the country who is not interested in the future of CIE, who is not well appraised of the problems that they are facing and equally the problems that face the people who supply the money, namely, the Government and the people who use the services.  We have agreed that the Bill can go through without major debate because of the full debate we will have on the operations of CIE after Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few comments on this Bill.  Senator Lanigan outlined the agreement between both sides in relation to the passage of this Bill, and I will welcome the opportunity to discuss in greater detail the affairs of CIE next January.  We have had a very interesting speech by the Minister of State.  I hope either he or the Minister for Transport will be here next January to deal with the matters covered by this Bill, with the capital committee working at CIE, with the range of contacts he has made in relation to inland transport <Col N="957" /> embracing carriers and users, and with the very welcome changes that have been made since he took office almost one year ago.</P>
      <P>I welcome the new Chairman of CIE, Mr. Paul Conlon, and I would like to pay tribute to Dr. Liam St. John Devlin who will remain Chairman until the end of the year.  As I said earlier when discussing the Eurocontrol Bill, I hope that, as a result of the discussions the Minister had with inland carriers and CIE we will see a plan embracing not just the services that relate to aviation, but also those that deal with CIE's role in providing rail and bus services and who will handle our ferries. The plan will deal with a question that does not seem rightly to fall within the ambit of the Department of the Environment &mdash; the development of our national road system.  This is all part of the essential make-up of our transport services.  If we could in the immediate future see a plan relating to the future development of these areas, and the aspects relating particularly to what McKinsey had to say about CIE, it could be debated in full by both Houses.  We will have that opportunity next month. At this stage I welcome the enabling Bill to assist CIE in their present problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for passing this legislation swiftly through the House to enable the board of CIE to undertake additional capital borrowing. We look forward to the full debate on CIE in the New Year, but there are one or two comments I would like to make on this subject now.  The board and the worker/directors of CIE welcome the fact that for the first time the social aspect of the service has been written into the subvention. Because CIE have responsibility to the Houses of the Oireachtas I have reservations about the Minister not meeting representatives of the Houses to discuss CIE's social responsibility to the community.  Public representatives should be able to meet the Minister to discuss the social aspect of the service.  I would like the Minister of State to convey my views on this subject to the Minister. It is appropriate that management, administration, infrastructure and so on <Col N="958" /> be discussed in these Houses.  In the area of CIE's social commitment the Minister should be responsible to us, especially as there will be a specific subvention along these lines.</P>
      <P>I would like also to join with the Minister of State and previous speakers in complimenting the outgoing chairman of CIE.  As chairman of a liaison committee I crossed swords with him on many occasions when a particular service in the south-east was under threat.  I think he appreciated the position I was in, and I certainly appreciated his position.  I commend him for the admirable service he has given over the last decade.  I welcome and look forward to meeting his successor Mr. Paul Conlon, who I know from his record will make an excellent executive chairman.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to all members of the staff having a national responsibility in the running of CIE properly and efficiently, and commented on unnecessary stoppages over minor incidents and major strikes.  I would like to put on the record that I hope that applies to all members of the staff, particularly management.  The responsibility for the relationship between the trade union movement and those who are employed in the service lies with management.  It is the responsibility of management to ensure that matters which look trivial to commuters and to the people who use the service are not allowed to fester into major problems.  I know they will get the co-operation of the trade union movement if these matters are dealt with within the structures available both to management and the unions.  I would not like it to go out from this House that we were rapping all the staff across the knuckles for minor issues.  I know many of these issues could have been settled by the management and workers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is a spirit of co-operation in CIE because of Government commitments, particularly social commitment. CIE can get down to the business of providing an efficient and economic service that people will use to the fullest. CIE could play a major role bringing people wherever they want to go and they <Col N="959" /> can and should be able to provide this service efficiently.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that there is a tremendous improvement in providing additional accommodation and improving the condition of our carriages and catering cars, because we are subjected continuously to criticism about the condition of existing rolling stock.  The new management of CIE have a commitment to deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible.  I see from the Minister's speech that this is under way, and I welcome that.  For that reason, this Bill enabling them to finance their borrowings is necessary.  We look forward to a fuller debate in the new year.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators who agreed to give this Bill a speedy passage through the House.  I would like to make a few remarks about what has been said in regard to social responsibility. Senator Ferris indicated that he thought the Minister should make himself available to the public with a view to discussing these issues and I will mention that to him.  He will be in the House for the fuller debate later and Senators can put these points to him.  Senator Ferris mentioned disputes that have given CIE such a bad name.  At the most recent All-Ireland Final I saw a sign on Hill 16 which said &ldquo;Barney Rock strikes faster than CIE&rdquo;.  There are many people who would not believe that; this year CIE are a little bit faster.</P>
      <P>We hope these measures will apply across the board.  CIE cost the State £3.2 million in 1969-70 and last year they cost it £109 million.  Regardless of which side one is on, union or management, or if one is just one of the commuters, one realises that if the company keep borrowing at that rate then in a short time the entire finances of the State would be needed for the sole purposes of keeping a transport system going in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be Junior Minister for Transport until tomorrow but my brief was basically in the communications area, telephones and so on, but from time to time I have been involved in a small way in the affairs <Col N="960" /> of the Department of Transport and CIE. I would like to pay a tribute to the present Minister for Transport, Deputy Jim Mitchell, for grasping this nettle and trying to go in a particular direction, and everyone is aware of that direction. Apart from the political content, this is something Senators on all sides of the House should be concerned with.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>One point which is causing traders concern is CIE's recent decision to get involved in transporting people to Newry for shopping.  At a time when so many people are out of work, when every trader needs every penny he can get to maintain jobs, that move is perceived by the majority of people as a step that should not have been taken.  I do not know where the impetus for the decision came from but the decision should be reversed while there is a reasonable amount of money left on this side of the Border which will go into the tills over the next week or ten days, thereby safegaurding the jobs of many thousands of people.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to wish the Minister every success in his new Department; he was always very courteous to us when we met him on any matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What Senator Lanigan said lays emphasis on what I was talking about earlier in relation to the need for a plan on transportation generally. CIE have been losing markets in wide areas within the ambit of transportation. We have the arrival of many foreign concerns like Puralator, TNT and <Col N="961" /> DHL providing freight services.  We have buses travelling east and west every weekend bringing men and women home and then back to this city.  There are markets which CIE have allowed to be taken over by private concerns.  We have this trafficking between North and South because of VAT charges.  Presumably this problem will be sorted out in the other House at an opportune time, and I assume that will happen next January.</P>
      <P>CIE are in the business of offering commercial services, and a necessary social service, but to expect them not to transport people where a market is available is wrong.  That has been the history of CIE over the last 25 years and much to the regret of this House we had a deficit this year of £102 million.  I hope the commercial viability of CIE will be much more in people's minds in the future than it has been in the recent past.</P>

    <Title>Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1983: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan) Michael Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Export Promotion (Amendment) Bill, 1983, while, in one sense, a fairly routine measure, is extremely important as it is concerned with the task of enabling Córas Tráchtála to continue their work of expanding exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everybody in the country, including most economic commentators, recognise and agree that as an open trading economy we have to export to survive <Col N="962" /> and that our export achievements to date and capacity for further export growth is one of the few economic lifelines that we must hang on to and develop at all costs in our efforts to bring the country into a period of new recovery and prosperity.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision for further grants to Córas Tráchtála to enable them to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish exports.  The Bill also provides for ministerial control of the remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions of employment of Córas Tráchtála staff including the chief executive.</P>
    <P>In 1959 when Córas Tráchtála were set up under the Export Promotion Act, the total amount of grants which the board could make was limited to £1 million. This amount was increased by subsequent amending Acts; the last one in 1980 increased the total amount of grants which the board could make to £90 million. This Bill proposes to raise the limit to £160 million, an increase of £70 million.</P>
    <P>An increase of this size may appear very large but, in fact, it will just cover Córas Tráchtála's requirements for the next three years or so.  In absolute terms it is, of course, a large sum of money but, the actual grant-in-aid provided for Córas Tráchtála in any year will continue to be the subject of detailed examination before inclusion in the annual Vote for my Department which comes before the Dáil in the normal fashion.</P>
    <P>I do not have to spell out how vital exports are for the development of this country, the creation of employment and the reduction in our balance of payments deficit.  The export performance over the years continues to improve and provides a real source of satisfaction and pride at a time when we hear so much talk of doom and gloom.  In 1959 when CTT were set up, the total value of exports was in the region of £130 million.  By the end of 1982 this figure had risen to almost £5,700 million and the indications are that by the end of this year our exports will have reached the impressive figure of £6,850 million &mdash; an increase of almost 20 per cent over 1982.  This performance is, in my view, staggering and the crucial <Col N="963" /> role which CTT play in this success story is fully recognised.</P>
    <P>Down the years, one of the constant factors in Córas Tráchtála's performance has been their ability and flexibility to anticipate and adapt to changing demands.  This is particularly important in those new and challenging markets such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Middle Eastern states.  They have to be conscious of the changing needs of exporters, of the requirements of foreign markets and they must be able to analyse and respond to these requirements so as to endure that Irish exports are what potential customers are looking for and that all the other conditions pertaining in those markets are satisfied.</P>
    <P>It goes almost without saying that the activities of Córas Tráchtála require increased expenditure each year.  Their level of expenditure has been rising each year and has almost doubled since 1980. The expenditure this year will amount to £16.24 million and this reflects the Government's strong commitment to the development of our export base and is a compliment to the initiative and drive of exporters generally.  The present statutory limit of £90 million set under the 1980 Export Promotion Act will, however, be reached early in 1984 and in order to enable Córas Tráchtála to continue their valuable work the further increase proposed in this Bill is now necessary.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála spend their funds on providing a comprehensive package of export support aids and services.  These activities range from advice and basic market information, specialist services in the field of market research, incentive grants for individual exporters visiting overseas markets, to the organisation of national stands at international trade fairs.  The House will also know that Córas Tráchtála administer the employment support scheme which is specifically geared to increasing the number and quality of marketing executives who spend a considerable amount of time working and selling in their new overseas markets.</P>
    <P>This scheme is proving to be an <Col N="964" /> extremely successful one and already the marketing executive recruited under it are making significant contributions to the healthy state of our exports.  There is obviously a heavy duty on everybody concerned with exports to ensure that Córas Tráchtála's funds are deployed in a manner which conveys the best support to the exporting community and which maximises the return to the State in terms of new job opportunities, contribution to balance of payments, and so on.</P>
    <P>There is a great expertise and skill involved in deciding what is the best mix of marketing support and aids, or which blend in particular markets promises the best results.  One of the priorities must be to ensure that the range of assistance and advice available from Córas Tráchtála will continue to be up to the minute and to be responsive to the needs of exporters especially in the area of new opportunities and new markets.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that earlier this year legislation was introduced which broadened Córas Tráchtála's area of responsibility to include the export and development of a wide range of service activities and which permitted the provision of export credit insurance facilities in support of such activities.  The indications are that there is enormous potential for the export of service activities particularly to new markets.  Everybody who has been involved with a Córas Tráchtála-arranged trade mission abroad has been impressed with the long-term potential for Irish exports despite the cultural, language and other difficulties which confront our exporters in such markets.</P>
    <P>However, above all they have been impressed at the way individual exporters have been able to present their goods and services and generally hold their own with the assistance and support of Córas Tráchtála through pre-arranged introductions, appointments, acting as go-between and general back-up service and help.  It is this constant attention to detail, matched only by the earlier research in identifying markets for particular products and putting exporters in touch <Col N="965" /> with potential buyers, which ensures that Irish exporters are able to compete successfully abroad.</P>
    <P>We all owe a debt of gratitude to the part being played by exporters and for their efforts in bringing about economic recovery.  The country's export performance over the past few years has been very impressive.  It is clear the Irish exporters are now adopting a much more professional approach to marketing, product development and presentation and to the exploitation of new markets. Córas Trachtála are providing support in all these areas but it is clear that the efforts of Córas Tráchtála and of the exporters must be complimentary.  Without the drive and initiative of individual exporters, Córas Tráchtála's endeavours could not bear the same fruit.  I heartily and sincerely congratulate Irish exporters on their achievements in recent years.  I have no hesitation in saying that the export performance is one of the few bright spots on an otherwise rather gloomy horizon.  I am confident that continuing export growth can hasten the process of economic recovery and give real grounds for optimism and hope in the shape of jobs and a worthwhile future for our people.</P>
    <P>Because of the important mantle of responsibility being placed on the shoulders of our exporters, we must all guard against complacency creeping in.  Impressive as our export growth rate has been, this must be maintained and improved if we are to achieve our basic economic goals.  This growth has never been more critical than now, confronted as we are with unacceptable unemployment levels and other economic difficulties.  We live in an open economy and we must consolidate existing markets and seek out new export markets if we are to make any impression on the unemployment figures. The world recession, the depressed demand for goods and the regrettable tendency among some countries towards protectionism makes exporting a difficult and hazardous occupation nowadays, and emphasises even more the credit due to Córas Tráchtála and to the exporters for their performance down through the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> However, the potential for developing our exports is enormous and the rewards are generous.  We must continue to keep our respective fingers on the pulse of changing tastes and demands; we must continue to educate and inform our exporters in the skills of marketing and presentation; and we must continue to provide Córas Tráchtála with the funds to carry out their essential job which they do so effectively here in Ireland and through their network of 25 overseas offices in 19 countries and in all five Continents.</P>
    <P>I am sure that this House will endorse the view that Córas Tráchtála must have adequate funds at their disposal to continue their vital work.  The Bill also includes a provision regarding remuneration, allowances and terms and conditions of employees of Córas Tráchtála. This is to up-date existing provisions in the Export Promotions Act relating to these matters and in order, at the behest of the Minister for the Public Service, to bring them into line with standard provisions being inserted, as the opportunity arises, in the legislation governing all other non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.  I ask the House to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill and welcome the Minister back to this House. The Minister referred to the tremendous achievements of Córas Tráchtála since they were set up in 1959 when the total value of exports was only £130 million.  In 23 years we have reached the staggering figure of £5,700 million and almost £6.8 million by the end of this year.  Tremendous work has been done by Córas Tráchtála and any help to develop further our export market which is the lifeline of this country will certainly be endorsed by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While giving our full support to the Bill, it gives Members of this House the opportunity to raise any doubts or questions pertaining to the further expansion and further development of our export trade.  I read through some of the comments made in the Dáil when this Bill was going through.  Deputy Kelly referred to the fact that Irish industry has <Col N="967" /> the smallest number of foreign-based permanent marketing executives in Europe.  The Minister referred to this in his speech.  He also referred to expanding markets in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries with their different cultures and traditions and the language barriers that exist and have to be surmounted.  He also mentioned that Córas Tráchtála administer the employment support scheme which is specifically geared to increasing the number and quality of marketing executives who spend a considerable amount of time working and selling in their new overseas markets.  I welcome that statement by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Recently in County Meath everybody was staggered by the announcement that an international company, Westinghouse, were closing their doors at the end of the year.  They are situated in the town of Ceannanus Mór, or Kells.  Here we have an international company with a £10 billion annual capital expenditure budget.  Not because grant support was lacking, but simply because they did not reach their potential market target which would be £21 million to £23 million annually, they are closing down.  This Bill raises a question in my mind.  Did this firm co-operate to the fullest extent with Córas Tráchtála and other State-sponsored bodies?  We have the finest factory in Ireland situated in Kells and it is sad to see them closing their doors.</P>
    <P>Other European countries have made remarkable progress in market expertise and export promotion.  In the case of this firm which exported office equipment, the German manufacturers and export promoters took the market from under the noses of the people in Westinghouse. For this and many other reasons I welcome this Bill and any measures which will improve marketing expertise.  While it concerns production and work efficiency, marketing, selling of produce and presentation are becoming more important and we need to improve our efficiency in every sector in this very competitive world of trade today.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the extra money being provided in this Bill will be used to further <Col N="968" /> improve our agricultural exports. We import something in the region of £500 million worth of food per annum. This is a national disgrace.  If we are not fit to market horticultural produce and other items of food value in such a way that they are attractive to the Irish housewife and to the Irish purchaser, I do not see how we can hope to expand our export market in that sphere.  When I last met the IFA they told me they were preparing a package for submission to the Government with special emphasis on proposals to improve the quality of horticultural produce.  This is most welcome. I hope they will be able to come up with a programme which will be accepted and which will stem the inflow of food to this country and expand our agricultural export industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Minister to try to relieve some of the pressures and over-stringent administrative shackles at present in existence.  With regard to small business enterprises geared mainly towards the export market, some of the regulations tend to discourage rather than encourage many of our smaller firms to expand their enterprises or to improve their export competitiveness.  Many of these smaller firms based in rural Ireland have a tremendous work incentive.  They have no labour relations problems.  They are less prone to strikes.  Strikes very rarely occur in the smaller type rural based industries. They should get an added incentive to develop.</P>
    <P>We have a small firm employing 12 to 14 people with a projected expansion to double its capacity, its output and its workforce.  When we see incorporated into a planning permission a requirement and a stipulation for an amount of £10,000 for the development of a road to this factory &mdash; and if this money is not paid out payment of grants by the IDA will be held back; and no relief coming from the IDA to cover that amount of money &mdash; that is wrong and in my opinion it is a disincentive.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the all-party committee on small business.  In the New Year we will be making submissions. Some startling revelations and submissions <Col N="969" /> will be presented to the Minister.  I hope, if radical changes are necessary and if radical steps have to be taken, they will be taken.  We have so many State-sponsored bodies involved in industrial development, wearing many small hats specifically identifiable to the area to which they are allocated, I wonder are we fully happy that all the bodies are co-ordinating and co-operating in the best interests of trade in general and the export market.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I welcome it.  A sum of £70 million is a good hike all of a sudden.  If the money being allocated proves, as we hope it will, to be positvely geared towards expansion, development and promotion, and pays the rewarding dividend we are all so anxious to obtain, this Bill will be well worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelQuealy" hpid="Mr. Quealy Mr. Quealy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quealy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is worthy of considerable thought and one in which many people are interested.  It increases the statutory limits on the funds of CTT to enable them to perform their export functions. The figures in the Minister's speech indicate the need for this kind of support. The total volume of our exports in 1982 reached £5,700 million and we expect a further increase of about 18 per cent to 20 per cent this year.</P>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála are one of our better run semi-State bodies and they have the confidence of the business people. Export markets are fairly tough today and there is no soft money to be gained from them.  If we are to market our produce, we cannot go on in a haphazard way and think that we can sell what we like where we like.  We have not handled our food exports very well in the past. We can produce the finest products in the world, but we fall down on presentation and marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that we have to import vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and celery.  It is regrettable to see produce from Israel in our supermarkets.  One of the reasons is the high cost of production here.  We cannot compete.  We heard what Kinsale gas, and more recently what Waterford oil, could do for our balance of payments and our economy, but out greatest natural resource is the <Col N="970" /> land and it still has not reached its potential. It was reported recently that 60 per cent of the land was performing at a non-commercial level.  Some of our farmers are able to compete with the best in Europe in terms of output and efficiency, but we have not got enough of them.  As a result, the volume of the raw materials to beef plants and dairy processing plants is only a fraction of what it could be. There is a huge relative loss to our economy in terms of potential employment and much-needed foreign earnings.</P>
    <P>Last year our total volume of gross agricultural output was over £2,100 million. It was a respectable performance I suppose, but a study published in April showed that potential value of our gross agricultural output last year could have been a staggering £5,400 million.  If we reached that stage of development, Córas Tráchtála would have a major role to play in marketing that produce.  Instead of £6,000 million our exports would be worth £9,000 million.</P>
    <P>Another problem in the business of exporting is the question of delivery on time.  The secret of marketing is having the right article in the right place at the right time.  We have a problem with management-worker relations.  They are not always the best.  When we make contracts in foreign countries we must be able to supply goods or services by the prescribed deadline.  If we are unable to do so a company may find itself in great difficulties in getting a renewal of contracts.</P>
    <P>Some of our problems stem from a high inflation rate which is still ranked among the highest in Europe.  It is much higher than that of most of our competitors.  In that situation our profit margins fall.  The only way we can compensate for that in business is to increase productivity or through a reduction in the work force. Any reduction in the work force is not very easily attainable.  There can be strikes and many other problems and it will only add to our already high unemployment rate, which at present is 200,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have a look at our high costs, especially our energy costs, which are the highest in Europe.  Also our telecommunications and postal costs <Col N="971" /> are probably the highest anywhere.  In my view unemployment will continue to rise while those high costs continue.</P>
    <P>CTT have done a good job in promoting our products abroad but they will be unable to promote them if costs are not right.  If we are not competitive, how can they do the job?  I appeal to the Minister to do what he can to reduce our energy costs especially because the main ingredient in most of our industries is energy. It is very important that we get our costs right.</P>
    <P>We have a new Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and I wish him well in these difficult times.  I know that he has the initiative, the enterprise and the foresight to get us out of our difficulties. I know that he and the Minister of State will get us through these difficult years and achieve the proper balance in which we will have further major increases in our exports.  I support the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but in doing so I feel I must make the following remarks because we are talking about a very large allocation of money from the Government in the amount of £160 million.</P>
      <P>The stated functions of Córas Tráchtála are to promote, assist and develop in any manner which the board consider necessary or desirable the exportation of goods and the provision of such services as are specified from time to time by order of the Minister.  With regard to the function that I have just outlined, it would appear from direct experience gained in dealings with CTT that the board are not able to back up this function with real muscle, by way of providing the necessary capital funds which are essential to assist industry in a meaningful way by the allocation of real grants to ease the burden of expense in exhibiting, researching, promotional work and the recruitment of staff of the right calibre by exporting companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another function is to advise the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism on matters affecting or in any way connected <Col N="972" /> with the development of exports. I am not quite sure whether all these titles have changed since yesterday evening; anyway I am sure the relevant Minister and the Minister here this evening, for whom I have the greatest regard, will pass on my comments.  The board are not providing services geared to the marketing of industrial goods as opposed to consumer goods.  The organisation has not kept pace with the growth of industrialisation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Their third function is to provide an advisory, information and consultancy service to exporters covering product packaging and corporate design and product development.  In respect of this function the general impression gained is one of commercial ineptitude and lack of positive commitment and application to industrial marketing, due perhaps to lack of in-depth front line exposure in industrial marketing situations with accountability for results, together with a marked reluctance to be assertive with client companies and lead from the front.  That is usually where leaders are supposed to lead from.  There is more than a suggestion, when recommendations are made, that if anything should go wrong the attitude is &ldquo;Don't blame me; I am only an adviser&rdquo;.  There is lack of continuity by CTT personnel with client companies. Frequent changes in personnel or non-availability do nothing for the credibility of CTT and even less for the confidence of the company.</P>
    <P>I will make a few points that might be taken note of.  Perhaps CTT should have a plan for the year ahead with a company, making a positive commitment to that plan in terms of funds allocated, and designate one person to monitor and ensure the implementation of that plan at regular intervals.  Secondly, CTT could arrange for the secondment of personnel to work with a specific company or sections of industry with set and agreed objectives for a given period.  Thirdly, CTT could rate the performance of companies and reward them through performance-related grant-aid schemes that are sufficiently worthwhile to motivate further the said companies to greater development of marketing expertise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="973" /> I would like the Minister to take note of a reference I intend to make to an actual situation regarding this Government agency.  They are a Government agency and I will preface the case I am going to quote by saying that in my opinion they are probably too civil servantminded. That is deadly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is noted.  It must be said.  The quality of the monitoring staff is poor.  This is something the Minister might take a look at.  I understand that quite a lot of the staff are young and have big ideas and little experience.  We might need an older-type person in that field.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, being such a sensible person, will note this case.  A successful medium-sized Irish firm set up an exhibition in London which cost the firm £15,000.  They designed a new catalogue for the exhibition which cost £5,000 to produce.  They decided to send one person from the firm, with one of the owners, at a low cost to Córas Tráchtála of £150.  What happened?  After four months that firm got the £150 back and they had to wait 12 months to get any or part of the balance money.</P>
      <P>I would go as far this evening as to say that maybe they need a more professional marketing section in Córas Tráchtála.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; because it is a word I am not mad about.  I am talking about a more professional group.  I understand that AnCO in the past few days have embarked on a scheme to send people abroad to train.  If this is true, I fully approve of what AnCO are doing and I would suggest that Córas Tráchtála might take a leaf out of their book and send people to become more professional in management, work practices, presentation and above all in selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely this whole Bill relates to the awful problem of unemployment.  If our Irish industrialists have the proper service from CTT they will produce more jobs because the greater the sales on the export market, the greater the number of <Col N="974" /> jobs at home.  This is a Bill which affects industry.</P>
    <P>I must refer to the cost of our energy. I understand that it is the highest in Europe.  Taking that into consideration and knowing the situation of some of our small and medium-sized Irish-owned firms, I must compliment them on their competitiveness and the top class goods they produce.  There is no sentiment about Irish goods when one goes to Germany or England or any of those countries because an Irish product has to be as good as what it is competing with. Some of those firms have done very well and are continuing to do so, thus giving us the jobs we need.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála should not take all the credit this evening for the jump in exports mentioned in the Minister's speech.  In 1959 export figures were of the order of £130 million, in 1982 exports were £5,700 million and now we are talking in terms of £6,850 million.  Much credit should go to the firms, the staff and management and the co-operation between unions and personnel on the factory floor.  All the credit for that should not be taken by this Government agency.  I would go as far as to say that the Minister might take a close look at this enormous amount of money and give a breakdown of where the money has been allocated.  Some of us would be interested in seeing how that figure is being broken down.</P>
    <P>Just in case the Minister might think I am not supporting the Bill, I wish to state that I am supporting it.</P>

The Bill before us is to provide CTT with money, the fuel by which the organisation works, and so enable it to continue its efforts in the crucial field of export promotion and development activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a small open economy like Ireland's, <Col N="975" /> exports, of course, are of the first importance. Exports are essential to economic recovery and to national development generally.  It is heartening, therefore, to see the exceptional achievement in exports in 1983, an expected figure of £6,850 million.  This figure is 20 per cent higher than in 1982.  This gives a ray of hope in what is otherwise a bleak economic scene.  No other country in the EEC will come near our export performance this year.</P>
    <P>I want to make two points in particular. The first has to do with the development of our electronics industry and its importance for exports.  The second one has to do with staffing levels in CTT which I find particularly worrying.  Clearly we need better export levels if we are to make any real impression on our employment figures.  On the industrial front there is hope, especially in the area of the electronics industry.  It is expected, for instance, that in 1983 the new electronics sector in Ireland will export £1,400 million as compared with £300 million for 1977.  Clearly, electronics exports form a very sizeable proportion of our total manufactured exports.  Furthermore, there are now 300 electronic/electrical companies in Ireland employing 22,000 Irish people.  Notwithstanding the very difficult economic situation only two such IDA sponsored companies have actually closed down.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that by 1992 world annual production of electronics will more than double to £700 billion from £300 billion in 1982.</P>
    <P>Ireland is well positioned to get its share of the huge electronics industry and thereby boost our exports further.  We have a young, flexible and technologically educated work force.  While overseas investment here is very welcome, it does raise the question of the link between foreign industry and native Irish industries supplying goods and services. The clear aim is to maximise the Irish content of inputs to industry and to retain the added value in Ireland.  Research carried out by the IDA shows that the potential exists almost to double the current <Col N="976" /> level of purchases of Irish goods and services to 32 per cent.</P>
    <P>Overseas companies have launched us into the electronic age.  Native Irish firms must be encouraged to participate.  The signs are good.  For example, former employees of Digital of Clonmel, and Measurex of Waterford, have set up their own companies to produce components for the electronics industry.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to staffing levels in CTT which give cause for serious concern. The organisation is remarkable in having a relatively small staff.  At present CTT have 320 employees, while the official staff level is 358.</P>
    <P>This leads me to the blanket embargo on State employment under which only one in three vacancies can be filled.  CTT are at present operating at 10 per cent below their official staff level.  This reduction in staff has led to a reduction in some of their services and to the termination of other services.  Everyone is agreed that CTT play a crucial role in our export drive, yet if CTT lose staff who possess scarce marketing skills they can only replace them under the one-in-three formula.  If there is a case for slimming down staff in some of the State-sponsored bodies, I suggest that CTT is not one of them.</P>
    <P>The role of CTT is far too important to our national recovery and to our future national development to suffer the loss of marketing people under an obviously rigid and inappropriate staffing formula. I understand the <i>rationale</i> behind the one-in-three formula but I am worried about its blanket application, especially for organisations like CTT.  I would ask the Minister and the Government critically to review the embargo on State employment as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Coming as it does on a day after which there has been a re-amalgamation of the Departments of Industry, Commerce and Tourism, it is very appropriate that we should now be speaking about this Bill. We must all welcome the fact that again we will see industry and commerce being joined together as they should always have been.  As a result of this we will see <Col N="977" /> a closer co-operation between the operations of the IDA on the one hand and the export board, CTT, on the other hand.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we have seen today the presentation of the Estimates for the Public Services.  We are here today giving an increase to CTT and in the Estimates the outturn for CTT this year was £16,235,000.  In the Estimates for next year they are being given £17,776,000 which is an increase of only 9 per cent.  With inflation expected to be around the 9 per cent level, it is quite obvious that the services available from CTT next year will have to be run down. If we take it that there will be an increase in salaries, there is obviously no way there can be an appropriate increase in the staffing level.  It is quite obvious that in a world in which costs of everything are going up CTT will not be able in the coming year to do the job they have been doing eminently successfully up to now in a very highly competitive world.</P>
      <P>Let us be straight about it.  People say that the bottom has come to the depression in the world scene and that because of this we can look forward to increasing industrial output and, therefore, increasing industrial exports which will be aided by CTT.  In actual fact, the world market is so highly competitive at the moment that there is a huge need for an expansion of the services of CTT.  There is no doubt that they have been highly successful with the limited resources available to them. When one looks at the range of exported goods that are going out &mdash; and these do not go out by chance, they go out because people go out and make a grasp for the sales &mdash; in 1982 £3,657 million worth of manufactured goods were exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a huge increase in the areas of high technology products and engineering products, and these are new industries which have been set up here mainly by foreign capital and are in general owned by foreign companies.  Much has been made over the past number of years of the cowboys who come into the country, set up a factory, take a grant, and disappear.  That has happened but only to a very limited extent, and when one looks at the twelve-fold increase in <Col N="978" /> exports &mdash; from £303 million in exports of manufactured goods in 1972 to £3,657 in 1982 &mdash; one can see that there has been a tremendous success story there.</P>
    <P>CTT are working in an environment which is not hostile to CTT but it is a tremendously competitive environment, and unless we provide them with the resources abroad I am afraid that because of the nature of things we are going to suffer.</P>
    <P>We have seen their success in recent years in many programmes they have set up, and some of them are worth mentioning because they could be useful to other people when they are considering going into the export market.  It is very hard for a small company to get into the export market on their own because they do not have the resources in terms of finance for travel or in terms of manpower, though they can get a certain amount of help from CTT.  CTT have set up a programme whereby they can put together a group of manufacturers in a certain sector and by doing so they can extend the amount of export promotion that can be done.  The group marketing system has worked extremely well for relatively small companies.  They have equally been very strong in their efforts to set up trade fairs for smaller companies abroad and that programme, again, has been amply successful.</P>
    <P>They have brought in large numbers of buyers from abroad, and there is no doubt that the programme has been a success, but again resources which are available to bring in these buyers are limited.  I reckon that because of the Estimates we have before us for next year the programme will be curtailed.  The Estimates make sad reading.</P>
    <P>The employment support scheme of CTT which gives smaller companies help in export promotion has been a success.  Anyone who looks at the world scene in terms of trade will see that there is a changing emphasis.  Up to 1959 agriculture and agricultural products were our major exports.  Agricultural products now, I would reckon, are away behind our manufactured goods; they are increasing, but not at the same level as our manufactured <Col N="979" /> goods, and I think we will see an increasing gap between the manufactured goods exports and our exports of agricultural products.  That is not to say that our agricultural products will not go up in volume, but if we take them as a percentage of our total exports we will see that there is going to be an everincreasing gap there, and this will create problems as well.  However, looking at what were considered to be the Third World countries who were selling what were considered to be cheaper goods around the world, places like South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, the Republic of China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, it is highly significant that in those countries they are going away from the areas of manufacturing which needed large numbers of people into the highly technological manufacturing area. It was significant recently to read that the chairman of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce said that in the area of computerisation and technology they had done a great job in terms of mechanising and computerising their offices and their sales scene, but that they had not yet got down to computerising and putting high technology into their factories.  People say there is a very cheap labour content out there, and this is quite true, but they are beginning to worry that unless they adapt their factories to high technology they are not going to be able to compete in the future.</P>
    <P>A number of inhibitions are being placed on the export industry and again on CTT by virtue of the extremely high cost that the Government are adding to our manufactured goods here, in terms of VAT on point of entry for goods that are being brought in for finishing or marketing or for refinishing and then reexporting. We have the very high VAT content in all the input that goes into industry and, of course the 11.61 per cent PAYE-PRSI is a huge inhibition on anybody to set up any type of company, whether it be manufacturing or otherwise.</P>
    <P>We have an energy cost which is at least 25 per cent above the next cheapest energy cost in Europe.  We have a transport <Col N="980" /> and telecommunications system which is not adequate.  These are inhibitions that must be eliminated if we are going to get the success that we need in terms of What CTT are trying to do.</P>
    <P>Again, there are areas where we must help CTT.  Any inhibitions that are placed against trading with any particular country must be eliminated.  Take the Republic of China, which is not recognised by us diplomatically at present, but which could be a very major exporting country for us &mdash; a country whose inhabitants are very anxious to broaden their trade outlets because they have found that for too long they have been too dependent on Japan as an export market.  They are now extremely hard-working in Europe, buying and selling, and we could sell a lot more there except for the inhibitions that are put on the Republic of China because of our diplomatic scene. That should not create as many problems as it does at present.  Even though we are not diplomatically represented there, there should be a method whereby major purchasers from the Republic of China who want to come here to buy can get visas and come into this country without having to send their passports to Singapore, to be sent back to Taiwan, which can take anything up to a fortnight or three weeks.  When there is a trade mission in, say Europe, if CTT do a good job and persuade them that they can come in and that there are goods that they can buy here, they find that they cannot get a visa to come in, except by waiting for ten to 12 days.  It can be said that if we allow some kind of a visa system to be evolved helping out Taiwan there will be repercussions from mainland China, but that has not been an inhibition to every other European country.  Various European countries have their own ways of getting over this hurdle.  I just take that particular country as one in which an inhibition which should be eliminated is being placed on our export potential.</P>
    <P>The work being done abroad by our CTT representatives is unparalleled. Export promotion people from many, many countries will tell you that CTT are the most aggressive selling body for any country in the world.  They do not mean <Col N="981" /> aggressive in any derogatory fashion, rather in the sense that they know what they are doing and what they want and are quite prepared to work at it.  That type of enthusiasm and skill have to be complimented here in this House.  Too often we hear criticism of the work being done abroad by people from Ireland. When people go abroad and actually create the magic that has happened in the home manufacturing industry, they should be complimented at the highest level.</P>
    <P>Another area that is only recently coming to the fore and becoming ever more important is our export of services.  This is particularly important to us at a time when we cannot absorb many of our very highly trained young people coming out of universities and training establishments of all descriptions who cannot get jobs here.  They can, if we extend our export of services category, get jobs abroad.</P>
    <P>People have criticised, in this House and elsewhere, nurses and doctors for taking the money from the State, getting themselves very highly trained in very good training and education establishments and then going abroad and not repaying to this country what they have got from it in terms of subsidies that have to be paid for each student going through school.  When one looks at the actual facts, 90 per cent of these people who are abroad are abroad because they could not get jobs here.  I was out in the Middle East recently and saw the job being done under the management of PARC which is a subsidiary of Aer Lingus, and the tremendous work done by nurses and doctors out there who are creating for Ireland an image in the Middle East that we are not just a small, lethargic island race but that we have skills &mdash; and skills that can be used abundantly. Nurses also work in Saudia Arabia. There were management problems with an American company in Saudi-Arabia, but the Saudis said that they wanted the Irish medical teams to stay behind and that they would not be affected by the changes in management. I would hope that there might be a possibility that PARC or some other like <Col N="982" /> group might be able to take over the management of the hospitals involved.</P>
    <P>That is one area of services of which we can be proud and CTT should be given the opportunity to get more involved in it.  There are other areas of service.  The ESB have done a tremendous job for many years, particularly in the Middle East.  Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and various other personnel have gone there on service programmes which have had an invaluable effect on the economies of the host countries.  This has extended our export possibilities and has also shown to people outside Ireland that we are well educated and well trained. The inhibitions being placed on increased exports, because of Government action, will have to be eliminated in some manner, otherwise our tremendous increase in exports will not be achievable in the future.  The CTT 1982 annual report suggested a figure for 1983 and the outturn in 1984 is within a couple of hundred thousand pounds of what they felt they would achieve, which again is an indication of their professionalism.  I appeal to the Minister to re-examine the 1984 Estimates to try to ensure that CTT get as much money in 1984 as they did get in 1983, in real terms.  The 9 per cent increase that they are getting is definitely not sufficient.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to see that our export base is widening, and to an enormous degree, over the past number of years. Again, it is very heartening to think that our fellow Irishmen, even though not under this jurisdiction, are taking a growing amount of products from us.  Last year Great Britain, excluding the North, was our biggest market, then came West Germany, then France and the next biggest market for us was Northern Ireland. It is a very hopeful sign that they are buying from us and we are equally buying from them.  The cross-Border trade that one hears a lot about is not a one-way trade.  Last year our exports to Northern Ireland were in the region of £478 million, which is a lot of money for a very small geographical location.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to compliment Córas Tráchtála.  The legislation going through here this evening is very <Col N="983" /> necessary.  I plead with the Minister to try to get an increased subvention for CTT on the £17,766,000 that they are getting.  That would at least have to go to £20 million if they are to have any chance of succeeding in the jungle that is the market place of the world at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be quite brief.  I could not let the opportunity go without saying a few things.  On this occasion, I am not going to talk about poverty or social injustice, but am going to wear my engineer's hard hat for a change.  I am, to some extent, a practitioner in that academic area and, therefore, have fairly strong views about the whole area of exports and, in particular, in the manufacturing industry.  The first thing that crosses one's mind is that we have come close, at this stage, to establishing a third national aim along with the reunification of the country and the restoration of the language &mdash; and that is the restoration of competitiveness.  It is talked about with almost the same rhetorical intensity that used to be devoted in the past to the language and, indeed, to national reunification.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat confusing for me &mdash; because, whatever qualifications I might claim, I am not an economist &mdash; that in the year 1982 exports increased by 20 per cent at a time when we were told that we were pricing ourselves rapidly out of world markets because of our lack of competitiveness.  What would those who say that we are pricing ourselves out of world markets regard as a reasonable export performance?  If a 20 per cent increase in 1983 over 1982 is unsatisfactory because of our decline in competitiveness, what is a reasonable performance? I say that because this decline in competitiveness, to which has been attributed most of our economic ills, has, in turn, been attributed to the alleged greed of the Irish workforce, and in particular the Irish workforce in what is called the exposed sector of the economy &mdash; that part of the Irish economy which has to trade in the world market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would interest me to hear at some stage the sort of gross export figures in <Col N="984" /> manufacturing industry that those of us who say that our levels of competitiveness are pricing us out of the world market would find satisfactory.  I know that a large part of that 20 per cent gross was in the areas of electronics, chemicals and such like.  Another major area was in agricultural production.  The question begs to be asked &mdash; where does our lost competitiveness show up in the light of those sorts of figures?  I suspect that it shows up at home.</P>
    <P>I do not share the consensus that seems to be developing about the future strategy of developing Irish industry on the basis of an export-led economic growth. I accept that export-led economic growth is the necessary, fundamental driving force for our social economic progress, but do not accept the assumptions on which most of our political parties now believe that development can be based. We are talking, in fact, about a whole structure of incentives to investment in manufacturing industry.  In many cases, I would wear my engineer's rather than my socialist hat in terms of being sympathetic to some of those proposals. There is a certain naivety about the idea that simply by creating a structure of incentives manufacturing industry, and therefore exports, will automatically take off.  It is a bit like putting bait on a hook when going fishing.  If you go to fish where there are no fish, no matter how much bait you put on the hook you will not catch any.  If you create a whole structure of incentives to attract people who have nothing to sell, no new products to put on the world market, no ideas, no marketing expertise, no capacity for innovation, then you will not get export-led manufacturing industry growth.  Something more is required than simply a structure of incentives.</P>
    <P>I would quite enthusiastically support a restructuring of our taxation system in favour of manufacturing industry as against investment, either in Government securities, in land, or anything else and, indeed, might be sympathetic to a certain reduction in employers' PRSI contributions in return for an increase in corporation profits tax so that employers would pay for their extra employment <Col N="985" /> not out of the employment but out of the profits generated by that extra employment.</P>
    <P>That would be reasonable and fairer on people who could therefore be compensated for bad years and retain their employees without the burden of large scale employer PRSI contributions.  That would be in a context of something very different from what currently is being proposed and what has been the strategy in the past.  We lack any real stretegy for innovation, any real commitment to new product research and any real commitment &mdash; in spite of Córas Tráchtála's admitted efforts &mdash; to marketing.  The leaked Telesis Report, which turned up in <i>Irish Business</i> about two a half years ago, identified the fact that most of the major native manufacturing industries took no part in exports.  I do not want to name names, because the Leas-Chathaoirleach would probably rule me out of order if I did&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that I would, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure she would. They are companies that are involved with tobacco and cement, both of which are virtual monopolies in terms in this country.  The two biggest native manufacturing facilities are virtually not participating in the export drive.  That does not say much for Irish enterpreneurs taking up all these incentives that are allegedly going to be offered.  We lack the capacity or the will to believe in our ability to develop new products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most successful new product exported from this country in the last ten years was that combination of whiskey and cream called Bailey's Irish Cream. We have often taken a lot of credit to ourselves.  It needs to be put on the record that Bailey's Irish Cream was developed by English researchers and English scientists in an English research establishment attached to those people who own Gilbey's of Ireland.  It was not an Irish developed product.  We are lucky that it turned out that they chose to use Irish whiskey and Irish cream, because something like 80 per cent of the exports of Irish whiskey <Col N="986" /> are now contained in Bailey's Irish Cream.  Something of which we should remind ourselves again and again is that it was developed outside this country at considerable expense.  Most people are facing up to the fact that foreign investment is not going to produce manufacturing industry growth in the next ten years on the scale to which we have been accustomed for the last 25 years.  Therefore, we are going to be talking largely about home-based industry producing new products and new services, as Senator Lanigan said &mdash; although I have some reservations about the services.</P>
    <P>If we are, then we have to do more than just dangle a whole series of incentives in front of people, because regrettably as surveys published in the <i>Irish Times</i> last May show, foreign investors &mdash; who are probably the best judges because they are the people who have competed and are competing in the international market place &mdash; are not too impressed with native Irish manufacturers in terms of provision of Irish supplies to foreign investors.  They regard them as rating from bad to possibly bad and in that survey 80 per cent of foreign investors in this country rated the delivery, the quality and the cost of Irish manufacturers supplying them with goods and services as bad to very bad.  That does not say much for the quality of native Irish entrepreneurial activity.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be negative, or criticising the whole time, but if we are going to talk about export-led growth based on Irish manufacturing industry rather than on foreign manufacturing industry, then we have to look at the whole area of new product development, of innovation and of market research, and we are putting very little money into those areas.  The budget for Córas Tráchtála in comparison with that for the IDA is pathetically small.  Our investment in research, as evidenced by the National Board of Science and Technology, is so small as to be insignificant. We have no real ability or facility to spend the large amounts of risk and high risk money in new product research and in basic first stage assessment of potential new products.</P>
    <P>In the industry with which I have some <Col N="987" /> connection &mdash; the chemical industry &mdash; you could take it that no more than one in a hundred of the new ideas that would be thrown up in an industry would ever get to the stage of being sold in the market place.  So for every hundred ideas that potential Irish entrepreneurs, or young Irish engineers, or young Irish scientists would come up with, we can take it that 99 per cent will not work.  Obviously, in the whole area of assessing those potential products for marketability, for a niche in the market place, we are going to lose a lot of money in the short-term, in order to develop the one successful idea.  This indeed, was the experience of the parent company in the research which developed Bailey's Irish Cream &mdash; there was a lot of money lost.</P>
    <P>The point that needs to be made again and again is that we have to start spending money on the scale that we are spending on Córás Tráchtála in market research and innovation, not in looking at other people's products.  We have a dreadful lack of faith in ourselves, we seem to believe that we have to get other people's marketing expertise, research expertise and new product development expertise &mdash; that we cannot do it ourselves.</P>
    <P>Again, as the author of the Telesis Report said recently on &ldquo;Public Account&rdquo;, what we need in this country is very similar to what has been achieved in Scandinavia and in Switzerland &mdash; not a wide spread of products covering all areas of world trade but Irish unique expertise in a number of areas &mdash; small areas possibly in terms of world trade, but areas where we command 30, 40 and 50 per cent of the world market.  That is the way the small countries of Scandinavia have achieved high level standards of living and that is the way we have to go forward, not by trying to attract in every dog on the road who has a manufacturing industry covering the whole spectrum, but developing Irish products to a high level of international acceptability. In that way Irish will mean something in the way that Swiss used to mean watches, and telecommunications are often associated very largely with Sweden, for instance.  We have to do that for <Col N="988" /> ourselves, and that means spending money.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the next thing.  I do not believe that the resources or the willingness to take the risk exist in the Irish private sector.  Therefore, apart from any ideological or other bias of my own, it seems that the only sector in the Irish economy which could have the resources, could give the guarantees, and could provide those resources must be the State. What I am appealing for, in fact, is a new strategy for the State in terms of industrial development and industrial investment in the area of exports, and that strategy must be based on research into new products.  I do not know what the new products are, because there is only one way to develop new products and that is to do research, to chase up ideas and to encourage young people.  There is a major role for the Youth Employment Agency in that area, in terms of the number of young people leaving colleges with technological and technical qualifications who are unemployed.  They are the people who can come up with ideas.  We should be providing them with the facilities and the funds.</P>
    <P>That is, largely, what I would like to say on this whole area of export promotion. I do not accept the idea of incentives alone.  I do not accept the reliance on foreign investment.  It is ultimately a matter for ourselves.  We have at this stage a highly educated technologically qualified population.  We must use that resources to develop new products, not copy other people's products, not persuade other people to make their products here, but to develop our own.  There are certain restrictive practices that inhibit that.  One which I mention here concerns the whole area of food production, particularly the dairy industry where one profession by law has to have a virtual monopoly of senior management positions, and that is the dairy science qualification.  It inhibits the participation of the whole engineering profession in the development of our dairy industry, which is not a good idea.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are specialist disciplines that have a role to play, but to exclude all other innovative disciplines from that major industry is obviously a <Col N="989" /> restriction to growth, to innovation and is something that should be examined by the Government so that those who have ideas and skills can contribute to what should be a major area of development. It is a scandal and a shame that we develop so few identifiably Irish high quality products in the whole area of food and food processing</P>
    <P>The strategy that was outlined in the White Papers is fundamentally wrong, because it does not put sufficient emphasis on large resources being invested in the development of new Irish products. That is the strategy that we need in the future; that is the strategy based on confidence in ourselves, not on the dependence on others that we have come to rely on for the last 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Senators for their complimentary remarks and contributions relative to the role of Córas Tráchtála and the Irish exporters for the dramatic break-through in exports to the foreign markets.  Reference has been made to the difficulties of Irish manufacturers and to an extent there are factors, especially in the industry field, which place them at a disadvantage.  The tributes and congratulations are all the greater, having regard to the fact that they do overcome these difficulties and succeed so dramatically.  It is not a question of the major foreign-based industries here, but of a whole series of Irish-based, and especially small Irish-based, industries that have now developed the energy and determination and, above all, the enthusiasm to seek markets for their products outside our own shores.  I congratulate all of them for the success with which their efforts are being rewarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is, as has been said, the one bright spot on our economic horizon and the one hope of an improvement in our serious unemployment situation.  My interest here this afternoon in seeking the expansion of these financial resources to CCT is to give further encouragement and further help to all industries and to all services that have reason to be brought in, in the hope that they will further generate <Col N="990" /> new markets for Irish products and thereby create jobs for Irish people.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch referred to Westinghouse. I would be very glad to make inquiries into that situation and will be only too anxious to discuss with Senator Lynch afterwards how a contribution can be made by CTT and the firm concerned, with a view to improving a serious situation. I will make investigations and arrange to have discussions with the Senator.</P>
    <P>Small indigenous industries are vital to the economy and CCT have a special section dealing specifically with these industries.  The Department of Agriculture deal mainly with agricultural exports.  I can assure Senators that there is the closest liaison between the Department of Agriculture exports section, CTT and my Department generally.  Capital funds are not provided by CTT for industry. This is the role of the IDA.  CTT operate within the annual grant-in-aid, which has increased from £8 million to £16 million in the last three years.  This is a clear indication of a commitment to develop exports in this period of recession.</P>
    <P>CTT submit a profile of their activities to the Department on a monthly basis.  A senior official of the Department meets a senior official of CTT on a regular basis to discuss their activities and plans for the future.  The Minister also meets CTT management regularly to discuss the part CTT have been playing in the overall effort to promote exports and reduce unemployment.  Senator Hillery made a point about staffing of the CTT offices.  I want to advise him that we are conscious of this, and my Department are in correspondence with the Department of Finance regarding the staffing levels in CTT.  I cannot say yet what the outcome of these discussions are, but I would like to assure the Senator that we are conscious of the points raised in relation to the levels of staffing and the importance of work that the staff are doing with regard to our economy.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned the necessity of involvement with China and the huge population and market there.  I am glad to advise the Senator that during the <Col N="991" /> year the Minister led a CTT organised trade mission to China.  The possibilities for a significant improvement in trade with China are very good and are being pursued aggressively by CTT and a number of individual exporters.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan also mentioned the 1984 Estimates.  The Bill before this House is concerned with the technical amendment to the export promotion legislation to enable a further £70 million to be provided out of voted moneys by way of non-repayable grants to Córas Tráchtála for the promotion of exports.  The Bill is not concerned with the actual amount allocated to CTT in a given year.  The 1984 Estimates show what the Government could allocate in the present difficult economic climate. The grant-in-aid for 1984 is more than twice the level it was in 1980.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the loss of competitiveness.  This is very often a problem with indigenous industries many of which have closed down in recent years.  CTT are concentrating most of their energy in this sector in an attempt to identify those manufacturers which can be made viable in the export manufacturing industry which can benefit most from their assistance and advice.</P>
      <P>Senator Honan mentioned the £70 million being sought.  It is assumed that this is merely for a three year period.  It is more desirable to have it done on this basis as was done by the previous Minister in 1980 to 1983, rather than for one year.  That is the reason for the £70 million which it is estimated will be required over the next three years.</P>

    <Title>Alcohol Abuse: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting the concern that has been expressed in many quarters at the extent of alcohol abuse, particularly by young people, calls on the Government to take whatever action is necessary to help to counteract this abuse.</P>
      <P>There is grave public concern about under-age drinking but I do not intend to delay the House by drawing attention to that concern.  This matter has been discussed at local authority, county council and urban council meetings all over the country.  I proposed a motion at the General Council of County Councils on this subject about three years ago and it was passed unanimously.  The view was that it was a matter of grave concern and that it was a problem that would have to be tackled effectively and immediately.  Figures of admissions to hospitals which deal with alcoholism have shown a steady increase over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disturbing factor is the number of young people who are being admitted for treatment for alcoholism. This point has been stressed at public meetings in different areas of the country and addressed by psychiatrists and others who look after or treat alcoholics.  In every case the point that got most attention from these experts was the growing number of young people who are the victims of alcoholism and in need of immediate attention.  It is the generally accepted view that the licensed vintners all over the country treat this matter conscientiously. There are few, if any, cases of licensed vintners supplying intoxicating drink to under-age people.  That is freely admitted at every forum, but the <Col N="993" /> abuse arises in these late night extensions.</P>
    <P>It has been a tradition in this country for a long time that hotel extensions be granted to clubs which run annual dinners. These extensions are availed of by GAA clubs, golf clubs, insurance institutes, angling associations, creamery societies and so on and in all cases a substantial meal is provided.  That is a recognised part of the function and it could be looked on as the most important part of the function.  The meal, the chat, the toasts proposed and the speeches and so on are regarded as part of a big social occasion in many areas.  This practice has been going on for a very long time.  I do not wish to be interpreted as objecting to that in any shape or form, but the abuse arises where extensions are given in hotels and a meal is served.  In some cases no meal is served and in other cases what can only be described as a very light meal &mdash; a sausage or two and chips &mdash; passes as a substantial meal which, by any reasonable standards, does not measure up.  Young people go there and alcoholic drink is served usually until 2 a.m. and very often there is no supervision.  People at the very tender age of 16, and perhaps even younger, are served alcoholic drink.</P>
    <P>In a hospital in my part of the country recently two young girls under 16 years old had to be treated for an excess amount of alcohol.  As long as this practice prevails, society is in danger and these young people who start consuming large amounts of alcohol at that early age are certainly in grave danger of becoming alcoholics.</P>
    <P>It was stated quite recently by Mr. Mulcahy, an expert in this area, that the regular consumption of the alcoholic content in four pints of beer can be the cause of a high percentage of people becoming addicted to alcoholism.  He went on to point out that the recent increase in alcoholism as compared with past generations has ensued because people go out to drink more often now than earlier generations did.  Years ago a man indulged in alcohol only on fair days.</P>
    <P>The regular intake of even a moderate amount of alcohol can lead to alcoholism. When we take into account that people <Col N="994" /> at a very tender age are served alcohol at these functions, and they often attend as many as three in one week, we see the danger that the country is heading for. These extensions are often granted for the flimsiest of reasons.  One very notable occasion in my own county a couple of years ago which drew a lot of unfavourable comments was labelled a hairy chest competition. That sort of flimsy reason for a hotel bar extension until 2 a.m. does not stand up.  In my opinion it is necessary that the law, as I understand it is enforced, that is, that a substantial meal must be part of the function.  It is well known that a substantial meal is not served on many occasions, and I have already said there are cases where no meal is served.  It is also true that people who do not get a meal, and did not go with the intention of getting a meal, are charged an admission of £1 or £2.  Constantly people stay in public houses until closing time and then drive off to one of these events which have bar extensions. These people stay drinking until 2 a.m. Sunday morning, and sometimes even later because they know the bars will not be open until much later.</P>
    <P>Anybody who goes to the trouble of checking not only hospital admissions for treatment for alcoholism but the number of road accidents, will see that many road accidents occur between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. and must realise the harm these functions are doing.  Furthermore, anyone who checks on absenteeism from work on Mondays, and even absenteeism from school, which is another serious matter, will come to the conclusion that it is absolutely necessary that the law be rigidly enforced first with regard to supplying a substantial meal and, secondly, ensuring that under-age people are not served with alcoholic drinks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy G. Birmingham.  As a result of our discussion of this very important motion all parties will realise that they have an obligation to face up to their responsibilities in this issue, and I hope they will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on <Col N="995" /> this motion.  Even though I am a publican involved at retail level in the sale of alcohol, I see no conflict whatsoever between that position and my support of the motion tonight, and my unrelenting opposition to the sale of alcohol to under-age people at retail level.  Despite the publicity, and indeed valid publicity, that we have had in recent times concerning drug abuse by young people, I am still convinced that under-age drinking is perhaps as great, if not a greater, social problem and menace in society.  It is the easy availability and the acceptance of that availability by society that, in my opinion, is the primary cause of the problem we are discussing.</P>
    <P>There are many sectors of society and many people who have a responsibility in this matter.  As legislators we have a major responsibility in this area.  As I said at the beginning, I may have some controversial things to say, but in relation to our role as legislators our performance so far in even addressing the problem has been miserable.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of this motion we will see positive action.  We know what is happening in this scene &mdash; and Senator O'Brien very clearly outlined certain aspects of it &mdash; but we have been content to ignore it.  I recognise that many well-meaning people and organisations have tried to do something positive in this area but their attempts have not got much support from the quarters that support should be coming from.  I will give one example.  A report published in 1977 by the Youth Council of Ireland, called &ldquo;Teenage Drinking &mdash; A Cause for Concern&rdquo;, dealt in depth with the problem and the causes of teenage drinking, but it also made certain recommendations. For example, it stressed the need for more education about alcohol; it dealt with the inadequacy of existing legislation; it dealt with the lack of responsibility on the part of adults; and it dealt with the lack of supervision in certain retail outlets, particularly the sale of drink through off-licences, supermarkets, late night discos and some drinking clubs. They made many worthwhile recommendations on what is an important issue.  At that time that report received much public <Col N="996" /> vocal support but it is fair to say that after six years little or nothing has been achieved.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that I have an involvement at retail level in the liquor business.  I was also involved at that period with an organisation that represents a large part of retail liquor outlets &mdash; the Vintners' Federation of Ireland.  Our national executive committee considered that report.  They felt it deserved their full support as responsible people and, in particular, the recommendations made in that report.  Amongst these recommendations were the following.  There was the call for the setting up of a working party to recommend certain changes, and it was emphasised that amongst the changes that were necessary was the enactment of legislation concerning the purchase and drinking of alcohol by those under 18 years of age, with particular reference to those adults who purchase alcohol in pubs on behalf of teenagers.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is no provision in our existing law to deal with a person who buys drink for an under-age person in a pub or elsewhere.  In most cases the person who purchases the drink is the main culprit but he gets off without penalty, whereas the owner of the retail outlet can be charged and have his licence endorsed and the underage person can be fined.</P>
    <P>I believe it is important in dealing effectively with this issue that the purchaser of the drink for the under-age person should be dealt with.  It is imperative that the change be made in the legislation to include him for what he is &mdash; somebody who is engaging in and promoting what is a most objectionable practice. That report also called for more stringent enforcement of existing legislation covering under-age drinking and more severe penalties on those convicted of supplying it.  It called for a publicity campaign to highlight the dangers of under-age drinking which would be aimed at children and parents and it called for the enactment of legislation covering those areas where drink is available without proper control, such as, clubs, discos, off-licences and supermarkets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Senator O'Brien gave an example of what is happening in the disco scene, and I will come back to that, but I also want to deal with what is happening at another level &mdash; the off-licence, the supermarket and the wine shop.  The reality is that a young person can buy virtually what he wants without control or supervision. The liquor is on open display on shelves or shop floor.  He can go in and pick up what he wants and go out and drink it. The only control is at the check-out counter, but more often than not, that is manned by another under-age person, and so long as the drink is paid for there is no further concern.</P>
    <P>There are two main factors responsible for this situation.  First, there is easy access to drink on the part of young people and easy access to money to buy it.  The advertising ethics of some drink advertisements on television leave a lot to be desired.  Admittedly, they are not as bad as they were some time ago when a very simple message was that if a young person, boy or girl, was not drinking, manhood or womanhood had not been attained.</P>
    <P>I will deal very briefly with the attitude of publicans to this situation.  Those whose knowledge of the licensing trade is superficial have a tendency to lay the blame on the publicans, but they are wrong.  As one of them I am familiar with the attitude of the vast majority of them towards this subject.  Their attitude is responsible, and we would regard any member of our trade who went in for this kind of business as being a disgrace to the trade.  The reality is that most of us are parents, and I would expect that we would show the same sense of responsibility towards another person's child as we would towards our own.  Our organisation has made its position perfectly clear on this subject, and it has put it like this: for any publican who is in doubt about the age of a young person on his premises the principle is simple, do not serve.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with a point raised by Senator O'Brien earlier.  For any of us at that level who are attempting to do something positive in relation to this trade, <Col N="998" /> there are often occasions when we feel we are wasting our time when we see what is happening elsewhere.  I want to turn quite deliberately, as Senator O'Brien did, to the teenage disco scene. As he pointed out, exemptions are applied for and granted as a matter of course by the courts.  He gave a perfect example of the so-called substantial meal.  Even if it is available, it is simply only a sham.</P>
    <P>Supervision is minimal on the premises. Teenagers gain admission to these premises and these licensed discos without question.  They find themselves in an environment &mdash; this is very important and I say it from experience &mdash; from which the restraining influence of older people is totally absent.  That is not absent on the premises I and many of my colleagues are involved in.  The older element are there and they exercise a restraining influence. On the licensed disco scene the clientele are aged from 15 to 20 years.  Drink is freely available.  From my knowledge and from information available to me, inspection by the Garda of these premises rarely if ever takes place.  The result is that seldom if ever are there prosecutions in relation to the sale of drink to young people on these occasions.  It is a weekly, a twice weekly and on many occasions a thrice weekly event in many towns and cities.  Teenagers are exploited.  They are damaged, and the silence and inaction of all of us with responsibility for this scene are damning.</P>
    <P>There are 15,000 liquor licences issued each year for a population of about 2,000,000 people over 21 years of age. On top of that, 42,000 late night exemptions are granted by the courts each year. That was the figure in 1981, and it represented a seven-fold increase on the 6,000 exemptions granted ten years earlier in 1971.  The fault lies to a great extent in laxity at many levels: those who control the sale of drink at retail level, parents, teachers, Garda and Government and, unless all involved work together, the control of this problem is far from us. Teenage drinking is not unique to Ireland.  In fact, consumption of alcohol in volume terms is increasing in all countries for which figures are available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> Ireland, however, is an exception in this case because, in the three years since 1980, in volume terms the consumption of drink has decreased by about 23 per cent here.  The fact that we spend more per head of the population is due to the level of taxation.  Spirits here carry the highest level of taxation in the world and beer the highest level in Europe.</P>
    <P>I referred to the report of the National Youth Council and commitment to be seen.  Another organisation have also attempted to do something positive in this field, that is, an organisation called Caritas, an organisation of voluntary groupings and people.  They are concerned about the problem.  They are trying to deal with it.  They have put their faith in a system of identity cards for young people.  They received only limited co-operation.  While they made some progress in 14 counties, without support from the Government and others their efforts will not succeed.  I want to thank them for their concern and for the effort they have made.</P>
    <P>There is need for a responsible, mature and moderate attitude towards drinking. The sooner that attitude is adopted voluntarily by young people, the better and the healthier for all.  Hand in hand with that must go a firm enforcement of the existing laws and the enactment of laws when existing laws are inadequate.  I refer again in particular to the person who buys a drink for an under-age person. He is not subject to any penalty by the law.</P>
    <P>I should like to be associated with a call on all who have responsibility at retail level to show their positive support in dealing with a growing social problem which can bring misery, hardship and suffering to many young people and to their parents.  No single group and no single factor can provide the solution. The solution can come only when all interests involved, and all with responsibility in this scene, work together collectively to find it.  I hope we can start that process and that what we decide today will be for the benefit of our young people and the Ireland of tomorrow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a motion everyone should support.  It is very difficult to suggest a practical approach to this problem. Previous speakers have shown &mdash; and this is in no way criticising what they have said &mdash; how little can be done particularly by the Government in the sense of passing legislation which will make any major change in relation to this problem.  It has been indicated that the major problem is that the laws which already exist have not been implemented.  The principal fault in that respect is the fact that under-age people are still supplied with drink.</P>
      <P>It is true that the majority of publicans are conscientious about this problem and do not serve drink to young people.  We must admit that it is very difficult sometimes for them to know the age of people who ask for drink.  On the other hand, there are publicans, I am afraid, who are quite careless and negligent in this regard and who do serve drink to people who are fairly obviously under age.  If this aspect of the problem were tackled with far more intensity than it is at the moment, there would be a considerable improvement.  I agree with the proposer of the motion about the way in which extensions are granted on flimsy excuses and, when they are granted, the conditions under which they are granted are not complied with.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to see how the Government could make a major improvement or a major change in this respect.  The approach must be very largely an educational approach.  When I talk about education I do not mean merely for young people, although of course it is particularly relevant for them.  It must be educational in the sense of impressing on people of all ages the danger of abuse of alcohol.  We have had Government warnings, and so on, about the danger of smoking.  There should be something similar in relation to the danger of alcohol abuse to try to get people to put drinking into perspective and to differentiate between drinking which is reasonable and enjoyable, and which certainly cannot be condemned in any way, and drink abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that there was a restriction on the serving of alcohol in <Col N="1001" /> restaurants.  This gave people the idea that drinking is something you do in public houses only, that you have to devote your whole mind to drinking, that you go into a public house to drink, and do nothing else, that when you are having a meal in a restaurant you do not drink.  Many restaurants do not and cannot get licences. This gave a wrong impression to people that when you wanted a drink you went to a place for drinking, and you devoted your entire attention to it.</P>
    <P>I hope that gradually the restrictions will be withdrawn and that it will be possible to have a drink with your meal. Drinking with a meal is the most moderate way, generally speaking, in which people drink.  It gives a better balance as to how one should approach drink.  When this was being discussed in the past, publicans used to object to it very much on the basis that restaurants should stick to supplying meals and they would stick to supplying drink.  Most good public houses now serve food, and that is a very good thing.  In view of the fact that most of them do serve food, they cannot really object to restaurants being allowed to serve alcohol.</P>
    <P>Basically, the approach to this problem must be something which starts from the very beginning.  Young children must have the proper attitude to it.  It must begin in the home.  A good deal more could be done in the schools in regard to their outlook, in regard to various educational helps in this respect and, after that, it should be continued in the community generally.  There should be a new philosophy, a conscious effort by people in the community to adopt a new view on drinking.  There must be a departure from the view that hard drinking is in some way a sign of manhood and virility.  There must be a departure from the view that standing innumerable rounds is an indication of generosity and from the view that the only way that one can really enjoy oneself is by drinking to excess.</P>
    <P>In other words, there must be an effort by the community generally to bring a new perspective to the way in which alcohol is consumed.  This is not going to be easy.  It is going to be a long and a very hard haul.  It is something that must be <Col N="1002" /> done, and in many ways it is more important than anything that can be done by legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, at the outset, that the Government are fully alive to the problem posed by alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>There have been many indications of an increased level of consumption of intoxicating liquor &mdash; for example, in the figures published by the Revenue Commissioners on the quantities of spirits, beer and wine released for home consumption. These quantities doubled between 1969 and 1979.  While it appears that the total sales of spirits and beer declined during the last year or two, overall spending on alcohol in this country is still at one of the highest levels, proportionately, in Europe.</P>
      <P>From the mid-sixties, admissions to psychiatric hospitals for alcoholism and related illnesses showed a continuing increase, so that alcoholism is now the most common cause of admissions.  While there was a small drop in the number of men admitted to psychiatric hospitals for such conditions in 1982, there was an increase in the number of women so admitted.</P>
      <P>One of the other indices of alcohol abuse is the number of alcohol-related road accidents.  These continue to constitute a disturbingly high proportion of the total number of such accidents.</P>
      <P>When we turn from the overall picture to particular areas of alcohol abuse, the aspects which are most frequently mentioned are drinking by the under-aged, late night drinking and excessive consumption arising from easy availability in outlets such as off-licence shops and supermarkets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to get precise statistics which would indicate the extent to which alcohol is being abused at particular times or by particular categories of the population.  That there is excessive drinking by young people is, however, not merely a matter of common observation but is a view borne out by reports from concerned, responsible organisations such as the Irish National Council <Col N="1003" /> on Alcoholism, the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Medico-Social Research Board.  This abuse occurs through the consumption of drink by young people in licensed premises during the ordinary permitted hours and at late night functions in licensed hotels and restaurants under the special exemption order provision, as well as drinking by young people at so-called &ldquo;cider parties&rdquo; of liquor obtained for them from licensed outlets by older teenagers or young adults.</P>
    <P>As to the manner in which these abuses must be tackled, I think I should emphasise that we cannot hope to counteract them merely by restrictive measures such as might be enacted in amendments of the licensing code.  What is in question, essentially, is the development of a proper attitude towards the use of alcohol. I would refer, in this connection, to initiatives such as the alcohol education programme prepared for second-level schools by the Health Education Bureau. The desirability of developing a more responsible attitude to drink, especially among young people, cannot be emphasised enough by concerned organisations and community groups.</P>
    <P>That being said, it is accepted that the liquor licensing code has a very important part to play in counteracting alcohol abuse.  This code has been under continuous review in my Department with a view to establishing the areas where amendment of the law would be appropriate. It is important to bear in mind, however, that any measures taken must be aimed at specific abuses and must not be such as would militate against the requirements of the average reasonable citizen.</P>
    <P>The statutory provisions relating to the presence of young people in licensed premises must logically be among the first to be considered when examining the question of under-age drinking.  These provisions are in the Children Act, 1908, as amended, and make it an offence for a licensee to allow a child to be in the bar of his licensed premises &mdash; a child for this purpose being a person under the age of 15 years.  The aspects which arise for <Col N="1004" /> consideration include the question as to whether 15 years is an appropriate age-limit, the degree of responsibility to be placed on parents and whether the overall prohibition should, perhaps, be varied in relation to the time of the day or the location of the licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Next comes the very important question of the provisions governing the purchase and consumption of intoxicating liquor by young persons.  These provisions are contained in the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1924 and make it an offence for a licensee &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; to sell intoxicating liquor for consumption by a person under 18, though liquor may be sold to a person aged 15 to 18 if it is in a corked and sealed vessel of not less than one pint.  There are considerable difficulties in securing convictions under this provision but there are many aspects to be borne in mind in contemplating an amendment of it.  For one thing, in view of the earlier maturity of young people nowadays, it can be very difficult in many cases for the licensee to be able to say with any confidence that a particular young person is not aged 18 years or over. This raises the question of the introduction of a system of identity cards, and I understand that this has been done on a voluntary basis, with some success, in a number of areas.  While the present provision creates an offence for the licensee, it is for consideration whether a statutory responsibility should also be placed on the under-aged person himself or herself where he or she purchases and consumes intoxicating liquor in a licensed premises, or on any person who procures the liquor for him or her, as well, perhaps, as on the parent or guardian of the young person.</P>
    <P>It is frequently represented that it is not appropriate to have intoxicating liquor as freely available on the shelves of supermarkets as, say, cornflakes or soap powder.  It has been suggested that restrictions should be placed on such outlets or, at least, that the sale of liquor in them should be separate from the sale of other commodities.  In this area it is particularly difficult to establish the line between what is legitimate in meeting a reasonable public demand and what must be restricted in order to prevent abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> Next there is the question of the hours during which intoxicating liquor may be sold.  In this connection, there has not been a great deal of pressure for changes in the ordinary permitted hours.  There has, however, been a large volume of complaints about the abuse of the special exemption order provisions which is available to licensed hotels and restaurants. The numbers of such orders granted by the courts has increased considerably. Provision for the supply of a substantial meal is a prerequisite for the grant of most kinds of special exdemption orders, and there have been many complaints about what passes for a substantial meal on these occasions.  When special exemption orders were last reviewed by the Oireachtas in 1960 and 1962, I think it could not have been envisaged that they would be granted on the present scale.  Those provisions now merit very close scrutiny, so that any necessary steps may be taken to ensure that they are not abused.</P>
    <P>Any new provisions in the licensing code must be such as can be enforced by the gardaí without undue difficulty.  In this connection, I should say that it would probably be timely now to review the penalties for offences under the code, some of which have remained unchanged since they were originally provided in nineteenth century legislation.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am convinced that legislative restrictions under the licensing code will not, of themselves, be sufficient to counteract drink abuse.  The development of a public consciousness of the nature of this danger, and the inculcation of correct attitudes to drink, particularly among young people, is at least equally important.  I would like to assure the House, however, that the Government are fully alive to the dangers inherent in a widespread abuse of intoxicating liquor and that they will take whatever steps are appropriate, including the amendment of the licensing code, to deal with this situation.</P>

    <P>Sin dán a bhí ann fadó, fadó, agus is oth liom a rá go bhfuil a lán daoine tar éis bás a fháil toisc go raibh an iomarca le n-ól acu.  Is oth liom a rá freisin go bhfuil an iomarca de na hógánaigh ar fud na tíre ag ól an iomarca faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>How you stop this, I am not too sure. I know from experience that those of us who are involved in sport have a very responsible position.  Many of us have seen how cups are being filled in different organisations and how teenagers and under-age drinkers are very willing to partake.  It is something which frightens me.  I had occasion some years ago when we won the minor championship to decide, with the help of my committee, that we would not use the cup anywhere afterwards and we kept it in the boot of the car.  The following year in my absence the minors themselves managed to take off with it to the nearest pub, where they had a hooley.</P>
    <P>We have condoned drinking on sporting occasions; it is the only way we seem to be able to celebrate a win in sport in Ireland; everybody gets plastered.  It is a pity.  I am not criticising any particular organisation, because I have spent my lifetime with one of them.  People nearly forget what day of the week it is, even a week afterwards, because they have been celebrating so well.  It affects sportsmen. The good sportsmen are not drinkers, and many a good sportsman has lost his skill, his interest and his contribution to his parish and to his team simply because he could not stop drinking.  It may be thirsty work, but I think we could give an example and, in general, sporting organisations should give an example that it is not part and parcel of their code to drink to excess.</P>
    <P>There are publicans who are excellent and who set standards that are an example to everybody and there are some publicans who unfortunately do not.  On occasions when publicans refuse drink to teenagers because they are under-age, they get the comment &ldquo;okay, we can go somewhere else.&rdquo;  It is a pity that there is somewhere else they can go.  While <Col N="1007" /> understanding it is often very difficult to decide what age a teenager is nowadays, at the same time I think what has been said by Senator Howard is true: if there is a doubt they should not get it.  If one publican is doubtful I do not see why other publicans should not also be doubtful.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that leads to difficulty too.  It is the question of sporting clubs having bars.  Again I speak from experience because I am involved in a club.  It is very difficult in a local scene where everybody is very friendly and some person is looking for drink.  It takes a lot of courage for a member of the local community to say to somebody, &ldquo;Well, you are under-age, you are definitely not getting drink here.&rdquo;  It takes more courage to go over to an adult and say &ldquo;You are buying drink for somebody who is under-age.&rdquo;  Clubs have a responsibility to ensure that their facilities are not abused and that they are not setting young teenagers on the wrong course.</P>
    <P>Clubs may serve a purpose.  They may be a facility for older members and so on, but they can be abused.  It is very easy to see that where you have a lot of young people generally involved in these sporting clubs.  They come in after games and join the adults and it can lead to abuse.</P>
    <P>Dance halls long ago were generally not filled up until reasonably late for some strange reason, but nowadays they are not being filled up because people have to wait until the pubs close first.  It is a pathetic situation in a country like ours that young people cannot go into dance halls until the pubs have closed.  If they have to rely on drink at that age to give them courage to go in to ask a nice girl to dance or the other way round, I think it is too bad for the future of our country.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to legislate to prevent the abuse of alcohol.  It has to come from the example given by adults and by parents, by those in charge of public houses and clubs.  It is something that has to be done by a lot of people together, and I do not expect that any Government of any political creed could possibly legislate effectively to stop the abuse of alcohol, <Col N="1008" /> because it seems to be endemic in this race that alcohol is part and parcel of our lifestyle.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Government would stop any loopholes that exist and make it more difficult to abuse the laws and the rules as they stand, but I still think that it is the example the teenagers are getting that will eventually lead them on the right track.  Go raibh maith agat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a motion which I certainly welcome.  It is one which is well worthwhile and I commend the Minister on a very crisp, clear, purposeful statement in relation to it.  She has identified the problem and she has pointed out quite clearly that it needs a two-fold remedial programme relating firstly to legislation, but not legislation alone, and secondly, to alcohol education.</P>
      <P>One thing that fascinates me in relation to a lot of legislation and, in particular, legislation in relation to drink, licensing laws and drink abuse is this.  At times one gets the impression that legislators and legal draftsmen seem to be deliberately vague in the terminology they choose in order to frame particular pieces of legislation. I point, for example, to the section mentioned by the Minister and the insertion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; which has created endless problems with regard to the securing of convictions.  I believe that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should be deleted, placing the onus very firmly on the shoulders of the publican to find out clearly the identity of the person who is purchasing the goods or alcohol and that it should be incumbent upon him to establish in some way, whether it be by the ID card scheme or otherwise, the precise age of that person.  It is not too much to expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another word which strikes me as being deliberately vague is the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; used in describing a meal. We should have a precise definition of what exactly constitutes a substantial meal.  Is it one course, two courses, three courses or four courses?  It should be couched in precise detail.  I often get the impression that deliberately vague terminology is grist to the mill of the legal profession because they can spend <Col N="1009" /> hours on end in court arguing the legal niceties.  I therefore would urge the Minister in relation to whatever legislation she proposes that it should be clear, precise and definitive.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister that legislation in relation to the purchase of drink at off-licences should be looked at.  I would exhort her to have a serious look at the possibility of raising the age limit here from 15 to 18 years.  I agree with her that statutory provisions are not enough in themselves, but I think that the statutory provisions that exist are reasonably tight if they were enforced.  There is a problem in a small rural community for gardaí to carry them out to the letter of the law.  I would urge, therefore, that the flying squad should be used to carry out raids on public houses which are known to be abusing the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>I refer to the issuing of licences to publicans.  In my opinion they are given out too freely even though a district justice is the final arbiter in relation to this However, there are too many maverick publicans, too many Johnny-come-lately publicans without any training, background or tradition in the trade, who make lots of money and open up licensed premises.  I would venture to suggest that if a statistical analysis were carried out one would find that these people are the main abusers of the licensing regulations.  It is a suggestion I make cautiously, but I have the impression from looking at cases I know of transgression of the regulations that these are the people who invariably seem to be the main transgressors.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it is a two-fold problem.  It is a problem to which we must address ourselves as a matter of urgency.  If it is not tackled now it will totally undermine our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Senator Higgins speak about the need for alcohol education, and it is a very crucial point in this whole debate.  The Minister has told us about what may or may not be done by the State and by the Government in order to curb the abuse of alcohol.  At the end of the day, no matter what legislation <Col N="1010" /> is brought in it is not possible to prevent young people having access to alcohol.</P>
      <P>I speak as someone who was reared in a pub, and in Ireland there is always a way around the legislation.  What is important is to educate people about the dangers of alcohol.  We have seen in the past year or two some very good programmes on television about both alcohol and drug abuse.  Many young people nowadays do not smoke.  When I was a young student it was the thing to smoke: if you did not smoke you were not with it.  Nowadays it is the thing not to smoke, and that is a result of a drive against smoking and making people aware of the dangers of smoking.  That same drive against alcohol would be very useful, and resources could be made available for it.</P>
      <P>Another area I would like to speak on is the area of education for leisure.  One of the problems nowadays in relation to alcohol abuse among young people is that they have nothing else to do.  I have teenage sons and daughters myself and I cannot think of anywhere they go to enjoy themselves where alcohol is not being pushed at them.  It is very difficult in those circumstances for young people to withstand those pressures.  Apart from the fact that we have advertisements on television glorifying the use of alcohol and making it all seem so lovely, everywhere they go they have alcohol readily available, whether it be to the dance or to their local football club.  There could be more leisure facilities made available for young people to play games and use swimming pools.  We may not have a lot in Northern Ireland but we do have a lot of leisure complexes which help to keep young people away from drug abuse and alcohol abuse and other things as well, for example, petty crime and so on.  The resources of the State could be well spent in building leisure complexes and other places for young people to go where they would not have to be dependent on drink to enjoy themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our education system as a whole has not educated youngsters for leisure.  We tend to look on sport and the arts and drama and so on as a luxurious extra.  It would be very helpful if more emphasis were placed on sport in the curriculum; <Col N="1011" /> in other words, on educating people for leisure as well as for life and careers. Perhaps in our young days, certainly in mine, leisure and sport and drama were little extras on the side which you did if you had nothing better to do.  The important thing was to learn your French and Latin and make sure that you got your examinations in order to get a job when you left school.  Of course, there are many people leaving school now who certainly face the very real probability of being unemployed for quite a length of time.  What are they going to do with their time, if they have not been educated for leisure?</P>
    <P>I would propose that in order to help stop alcohol abuse it would be very helpful if we could have more money spent on educating young people to pursue healthy leisure pursuits and on providing leisure complexes for them to pursue those hobbies.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to say too much because I am sure all the points have been covered so far.  I am sure people can understand me as a Pioneer speaking against the abuse of alcohol.  I feel very strongly about the availability of drink to teenagers.  It is one of the greatest problems we have, and how we are going to curb this I am not quite sure. In any supermarket or off-licence premises, the smallest child will be able to purchase alcohol.</P>
      <P>Recently I passed through a county on the far side of the Border and I saw drink freely available along the roadside to anybody who could carry it away.  They were not concerned with the age of the person.  That was the least of their worries as long as they could sell it.</P>
      <P>I remember the days, not too long ago, when the country halls were the places to go.  The real truth is that most of these halls closed because they had not drink available.  Some of the finest halls are closed down because they could not get licences and the people tended to go where they could get drink.  This is very sad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite recently it came to my notice in a certain place that there was a disco on <Col N="1012" /> and the cover charge was £5.  One paid £5 at the door and one got a docket for £2 to be spent at the bar.  That was one of the saddest things I could think about. Some type of ticket was refunded to the value of £2 but one had to spend it at the bar.  I would like to see this sort of thing curbed.</P>
    <P>I listened to Senator Browne when he talked about the good old days when we all went out to play football, and I remember this full well, when we would be looking forward to the night when we could discuss it in the many céilí houses. In latter days when I used to play football they would hardly take time to take their togs off them and they could discuss the game nowhere else but in the pub.  It is very sad for all of us and we must take a long hard look at this.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I saw a local football team winning the championship and I was very pleased to see them winning it. The only sad part about it was that they spent a full week drinking.  In a time when jobs are so scarce none of them seemed to be too concerned about whether their jobs would be there at the end of the week.  It did not seem to worry them.</P>
    <P>I am rearing a family myself and I am particularly worried as far as the youth of my family are concerned.  The trend now amongst young people is that if you are not drinking or not smoking you are a &ldquo;drip&rdquo;.  You are not living if you are not doing these things.  My own children come home and tell me that some of the children aged 14 and 15 are smoking at school and that they are encouraged by their colleagues to do these things.  The worst feature is the question of alcohol abuse.</P>
    <P>How many working days are lost in this country because of drink?  Thousands of days are lost and people lose their jobs.  It has a disastrous effect on some young people's marriages.  Some may have a nice house and car and everything that they should want, but if they have not money for drink they are not contented which is very sad.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have mentioned the need for education in this regard.  We all have a responsibility in trying to get <Col N="1013" /> people to understand that they can live a natural, normal life without drinking to excess.  That is the message that we should be getting across.  All of us realise the favour that we should be doing, and I am sure that the people involved would appreciate later the favour we were doing them in trying to educate them about the dangers of alcoholism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The production of video cassettes has opened up a new field of entertainment, amusement and recreation for people.  In all fairness, it must be said that some of the video cassettes are amusing and harmless and some might even be educational or cultural.  I want to draw attention to a type of video cassette being distributed that gives great cause for concern.  My special reason for putting down the motion at this time is that, as Members of the House will know, a Private Members' Bill has been introduced in the British House of Commons calling for strict curbs on the distribution and sale of certain types of objectionable cassettes.  What worries me and other Members of the House is that when that Bill becomes law in Britain &mdash; as it most certainly will, because it has support from all sides of the House of Commons &mdash; the distributors of these objectionable cassettes might attempt to cut their losses by dumping them here. For that reason, it behoves us to be on the alert to see that such objectionable <Col N="1014" /> articles are not dumped on us, with dire consequences.</P>
      <P>I emphasise the serious view that the British House of Commons took in the matter.  I read today some of the Hansard Report which is available in the Library. Before the discussion took place on 11 November 1983 a private showing of some of these objectionable videos was put on in the House of Commons and Members of the House were invited to attend so that they would get a clear comprehension of what the Bill aimed to remove from society.  What these people saw was so revolting that quite a large number of Members of Parliament got up and left.  Those who left could hardly be described as squeamish Holy Marys.  One of those who stayed on is reported as having said that his reason for staying on to the very end although he felt that the whole thing was objectionable and repulsive, was to put himself in a position to be able to fathom, with some degree of accuracy, the depths of depravity to which human nature can fall.</P>
      <P>These objectionable video nasties depict unrestrained violence, sexual abuse, mutilation, murder and even cannibalism. Such cassettes appeal to the lowest elements of human nature.  They are produced and sold by unscrupulous people who know that there is always a certain market for that type of material. These video nasties may fall into the hands of young people, who are exposed to that terrible trend and there is a very real danger that this exposure to horrible, repulsive things might warp these young people's outlook.  It could, indeed, permanently damage their view of adult life. Imagine the effects on a young mind of being regularly exposed to scenes portraying brutality, rape, murder, torture and mutilation.  I would ask Senators to reflect for a moment on the consequent effect on that young mind and the part that these objectionable films might play in warping that mind for the rest of that person's life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An eminent consultant child psychiatrist recently said that frequent exposure to acts of violence appears to raise people's tolerance and allow them to become blunted to increasingly high levels <Col N="1015" /> of violence.  That opinion of an eminent consultant made an impression on me, and I would ask Members to think over it.</P>
    <P>I took an extract from the Hansard Report on the proceedings of the House of Commons on 11 November 1983, column 535.  A Member said in the debate: &ldquo;An illustration of the impact of videos was given this week by the Lord Chief Justice in Cambridge.  He referred to some crimes that came before the courts and said that their commission could be traced back to the availability of pornographic and horrific literature and recordings.&rdquo; I make an appeal that we be vigilant in this matter and take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that these horrifying, revolting videos are not imported into this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Senator O'Brien has brought this matter to the notice of the Seanad.  I am a bit taken aback that he has asked us to be vigilant for fear that these &ldquo;blue films&rdquo;, as they are known, would come into our midst. Regretfully, I have to inform Senator O'Brien and, indeed, the Seanad generally that they are long since in our midst. I came across them in my constituency more than two years ago.  Some of these unscrupulous people, as he describes them, are operating not only in my constituency but throughout the city generally. It is now quite a lucrative business. I discussed it with the Garda and others who might be in a position to do something about it, but it appears that very little can be done.  In some instances, they are operating not from business premises but from private residences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know in particular of one gentleman who makes quite a business out of renting out the video film and the machine for showing it.  He goes around the housing estates on Tuesdays and Fridays, collecting on a Friday the video that he rents out on a Tuesday and giving out another. I did not realise that this matter was coming up for debate or I would have had more facts and figures relating to it, because I went to the trouble of finding out how much it cost.  It was something <Col N="1016" /> like £7 to rent video recorder and about £2.50 to rent a film for three or four days.  That film does the round of several houses on that housing estate where groups of people as young as ten years of age view them.  It is a very serious matter, and one to which very little attention has been given.</P>
    <P>It is generally felt that we have laws here to prevent this kind of thing happening. I do not know to what extent we have such laws or to what extent they can be enforced.  Certainly, I am convinced that these films are here in our midst and freely being viewed by young people.  Not only pornography is involved, but the advertising of drugs and drink, about which we had a debate earlier this afternoon. The drink problem starts with the video films which are being rented out.  I understand that a &ldquo;blue&rdquo; film is brought into this country by whatever means and then recorded on to tapes.  As many as 20 or 30 tapes can be produced from the one film brought in.  There is no knowing the amount of damage that this is doing. I do not know what action the Minister can take, but I do know that it is high time that some action was taken and that the existing laws are brought into effect to ensure that the people who are doing this kind of thing are brought to justice and that this practice is ended.</P>
    <P>There are many parents in my area and, indeed, throughout the length and breadth of the city who are extremely worried.  Those are the people who know what is going on, but in many other instances where it is happening the parents do not know, because the teenage parties are so organised that it is done on nights when the parents are not there.  I do not want to put it on the records of this House but I can give the Minister instances where these films are now being delivered each Tuesday and Friday to people who have organised themselves into groups to receive them, to show them and then to pass them on to neighbouring houses where the youngsters gather in groups of six, eight, ten and sometimes more.  The age that I have come across of children viewing them is as low as ten.  I would like the Minister to be aware that very many parents are concerned <Col N="1017" /> about it, and would like to see some action being taken to ensure that this practice does not continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the problems posed by the availability of objectionable videos and at the public concern caused by their availability.  As the Minister for Justice stated recently, and again in reply to a written parliamentary question on Wednesday, 30 November 1983, he is having the adequacy of the law for the control of such video films examined as a matter of urgency, so that decisions can be taken on new legislation or administration measures which may be taken to deal with the problem.  Objectionable videos are causing widespread concern in other countries also.  The video recording films have been introduced into the British House of Commons recently.  On 23 November 1983, a report was published in England dealing with children's viewing patterns of videos in England and Wales.  The report is part of a research project sponsored by parliamentarians in England.  The overall theme of the research is &ldquo;Video, Violence and Children&rdquo;.  Two further reports on the topic are to be issued in January and March next.  The January report will deal with children's viewing habits and parental attitudes and the March report will deal with the effects of video violence upon children.</P>
      <P>Members of the European Parliament are also concerned about the problems posed by objectionable videos, as is illustrated by the following extract from the June 1983 edition of <i>Community Report:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alarmed at the wave of pornographic and violent video cassettes flooding the market, a group of Christian Democrat MEPs is calling for the establishment of a European Inspection Office to screen out material potentially harmful for young people. Video recorder sales are booming, they say.  In the German Federal Republic it is estimated that by 1986 every second or third household will have one.  The trade says that nearly 45 per cent of all video cassette sales are <Col N="1018" /> horror, war and action films, with pornographic films taking 12 per cent of the market.  The horrified MEPs say that in some films pregnant women are hacked open alive with pickaxes, or live victims are nailed to doors to make it easier to decapitate them.  The MEPs say they don't wish to decry individual media or new technology, but want the excesses curbed.  They have asked the Commission to start an immediate inquiry into the lack of restraint in video material and to look into the legal options under the Treaties of Rome of combating the problems by community action.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the video film problem being examined by the Department of Justice is the relevance of the censorship legislation to videos.  The relevant Acts were drafted prior to video films being available.  Accordingly, the question of whether video films come within the scope of the Acts has to be decided. In this context, I should mention that recently there have been some convictions for the display of uncensored video films in public places.</P>
    <P>My Department are in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners about the problem of importation of objectionable video films.  The commissioners have power, under the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, to prevent the importation of &ldquo;indecent or obscene prints, paintings, photographs, books, cards, lithographic or other engravings, or any other indecent or obscene articles&rdquo;.  Customs officials have been seizing an increasing number of video films at point of entry in recent years in accordance with their powers under this 1876 Act.  The Garda are also being consulted concerning the video film problem.  Recently, gardaí in each division have been asked to supply any relevant information which they may have.  I expect that this information, when correlated, will give a better view as to the details of the video film problem, its prevalence and the geographical areas where it is acute.  As Senator O'Brien said, there is a very considerable degree of opinion being expressed that violent crime &mdash; and particularly rapes and other <Col N="1019" /> crimes against women &mdash; may be linked with the availability and the influence of video films that degrade women in the name of entertainment.</P>
    <P>There is one other area on which I wish to comment.  That is the responsibility of parents in relation to video films being watched, purchased or hired by their children. Parents may not fully realise how objectionable some of the material on video film is.  The extract from <i>Community Report</i> that I mentioned earlier gives some idea of the content of these films. It is difficult to get across in the written word, however, the visual impact of these films and the realism that can be achieved in a film of this nature.  Some of the scenes depicted are said to have had a sickening effect on some adults who viewed them. The effect on children who are likely to be more impressionable because of their youth is likely to be even much more severe.  There is a possibility that children will be seriously upset by watching these films.  There is also the more serious possibility that they may become more tolerant of violence and sadism.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of parents would not allow their children to watch the material in question had they any idea of the absolute depravity and obscenity shown in some of the videos now available. I feel that it is worth appealing to parents to make sure that they know what type of video films are being watched by <Col N="1020" /> their children.  They should find out what type of films are being bought or hired by them, presuming these would be older children.  However, even if they do that and do succeed in censoring their own children's viewing, those of us with children experience the extreme difficulty of knowing what standards prevail in other people's homes &mdash; the homes that one's own children may visit in.  Unscrupulous people are making money out of a totally objectionable video trade, and one way to discourage their activities would be to reduce the amount of money being spent on the hire and purchase of these films.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to assure the House that I am having the adequacy of the law on the control of objectionable videos examined as a matter of urgency, so that decisions can be made on new legislation or administrative measures which may be taken to deal with the problem.  I can assure the Members that I have a personal interest and commitment to this.  There is no doubt that videos are an undesirable development and, accordingly, I am confident that everyone &mdash; politicians, public officials, the Garda and parents &mdash; who has any influence in the area will play his or her part in ensuring that the menace is ended.</P>
