    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to raise from £100 million to £180 million the limitation on the total amount of borrowings by Bord na Móna for the performance of their functions under the Turf Development Acts.  The opportunity is also being taken to formalise the control of capital expenditure by Bord na Móna and to provide by statute that private bog developers will have access to information resulting from researches and experiments carried out by Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna are currently in the process of implementing their third development programme.  This is a major development programme which was formulated in response to the 1973 fuel crisis when the high cost of imported energy caused a rise in domestic prices and in the balance of payments deficit.  The programme, which commenced in 1974, was aimed at expanding peat production for electricity generation and for industrial and domestic use.  This programme was subsequently extended and now covers 78,000 acres, most of which is under development.  The main development area is located west of the Shannon but operations involved in the programme extend over Counties Tipperary, Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Galway, Roscommon, Longford and Mayo.</P>
      <P>The programme when fully implemented is expected to produce annually 2.2 million tonnes of milled peat, 80,000 tonnes of sod peat and 1.6 million cubic metres of moss peat in addition to existing production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the additional milled peat production was intended by Bord na Móna to be used in two new briquette factories. One of the factories, at Littleton, County Tipperary, has already been constructed and came into production in September 1981.  It is designed to produce 130,000 tonnes of briquettes annually.  The second factory is proposed by Bord na Móna to be constructed at Ballyforan, County Roscommon, and some site work has already been carried out there.  I should <Col N="1099" /> add, however, that because of the high level of borrowings and the need for effective use of capital to ensure a better return to the community, the Minister has initiated a review of all capital investment projects within his area of responsibility, including the Ballyforan briquette factory, to determine whether the projects can be justified on acceptable norms.  The review of the Ballyforan project which was indeed projected in the revised Public Capital Programme for 1983 published by the Government, is now at an advanced stage and he hopes to be in a position to put the outcome of the review to the Government within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The balance of the production of milled peat under the third development programme will be used to increase the output and to extend the life of the existing electricity generating station at Bellacorick. A 45 megawatt extension to the ESB milled peat station at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, was recently commissioned and a similar extension at Lanesboro, County Longford, will be commissioned next year.  Additional sod peat under the programme will be used to offset to some extent the reduction in output from existing sod peat bogs as they become cut out.  The programme also provides for a major increase in horticultural peat production.  Export sales of horticultural peat of the order of £12 million made a useful contribution to the revenue of Bord na Móna and to our balance of payments last year.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are a major industry employing 6,234 people on average throughout the year.  They are particularly valuable in providing employment in many areas which do not have strong potential for attracting other types of industry.  Apart from providing employment directly, the programme also generates spin-off employment in engineering construction and allied industries. The consequent effect of this on the economy in the catchment areas of the board's enterprises has been substantial.</P>
    <P>The large scale bog development operations of Bord na Móna require considerable expenditure during the development <Col N="1100" /> period during which there is no financial return.  The necessarily slow process of land acquisition, drainage and other development work means that new bogs do not contribute anything towards the servicing of advances and loans during the development stages.  Investment must, therefore, take account that up to seven years will elapse from the initiation of a Bord na Móna scheme before a bog will be capable of producing peat and yielding revenue.  Capital servicing at high interest rates impacts heavily on the board's revenue throughout this period.</P>
    <P>Low prices in the past resulted in the board not being able to make any significant contribution from their own resources and the servicing of their borrowing places a heavy burden on the board's financial position.  In order to alleviate this problem a four phased price increase was approved last year.  When fully implemented it will bring prices for the board's products up to market related level and should ease considerably the strain on the board's cash-flow.</P>
    <P>In the early years of the third programme the Exchequer funded by way of repayable advances the bulk of Bord na Móna's capital requirements.  Since 1978, however, the board have had to meet expenditure on their development programme and related capital charges mainly by borrowing.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this Bill arises because the board have almost reached the limit of their statutory borrowing powers.  Under the Turf Development Acts the board may not borrow more than £100 million.  The total borrowing to date is approximately £98 million, but commitments to further expenditure will shortly arise and it is necessary, therefore, to increase the statutory limitation to allow the board to undertake further borrowing.  I am satisfied that borrowings by the board in excess of the current statutory limitation are unavoidable and that the proposed new limit will enable the board to continue their work for the next three years when the statutory limit on the board's borrowings will need to be reviewed again.</P>
    <P>Since the mid-seventies the board have spent £78 million on their expansion and <Col N="1101" /> have proposals to spend a further £82 million, at present values, to complete the programme.  This is a major investment in native energy.  It will reduce our dependence on imported energy significantly, and will have a very beneficial effect, particularly in the areas in which the bog development works are located.</P>
    <P>At the same time a prudent attitude is called for, not least by the Government, who have ultimate responsibility in the matter, where very large capital expenditure is involved.  Under existing administrative arrangements Bord na Móna's major capital expenditure is subject to ministerial approval.  While this has worked reasonably well in the past, I am sure it will be agreed that in the current difficult economic climate more stringent control of such expenditure is necessary. The provision in section 2 of the Bill will allow for formal statutory control of the board's expenditure.  It is based on similar provisions in more modern legislation, such as the Gas Act, 1976, in relation to An Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>Not all bogs, however, are suitable for large-scale mechanised development by Bord na Móna.  There are many small tracts of land which can be economically exploited by private developers.  While the board will continue to be the dominant force in bog development and peat fuel production, there is a welcome revival of interest in private turf production. This revival has been stimulated by two events &mdash; the Turf Development Act, 1981, and the advent of small turf cutting machines.  The Turf Development Act, 1981, provides for capital grants for private turf production &mdash; up to 60 per cent of the cost for co-operatives and groups and 45 per cent for individuals and private companies.</P>
    <P>The administration of this scheme has been entrusted to Bord na Móna because of their unique expertise.  To date grants totalling £1.9 million have helped some 4,000 people in carrying out drainage to their bogs and on the construction of roads and the purchase of machines.  A number of small enterprising companies are now marketing popular turf cutting and harvesting machinery and taking the drudgery out of the traditional hand-won <Col N="1102" /> methods.  This development, the grants scheme and the good weather last summer resulted in a very substantial increase in turf production in 1982.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have over the years built up a fund of information resulting from their experiments and research into bog development.  Much of this information could be of considerable value to private developers.  While the Turf Development Act, 1946, provides for the dissemination of such information, as the board think fit, the provision in section 3 of this Bill will ensure that the information will be more freely available to private developers.  I would like at this point to put on record my deep appreciation of the help and advice that Bord na Móna have given voluntarily to private bog developers in the past.  Section 3 simply formalises this practice by ensuring that the private developers will have access to the findings of the board's researches and experiments as a right. However, I believe that the board should be allowed to exercise some measure of discretion in cases where the giving of information could prove a threat to their commercial interests.  The Bill so provides.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make an important contribution to our energy objectives, as I explained earlier.  It will be a vote of confidence in Bord na Móna who have always enjoyed the strong support of the community for the progress they have made down through the years.  The board have earned a high reputation for technical expertise and development and it holds an important place in the fabric of rural life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I believe Bord na Móna have a major role to play in the further development of our bogs. The Minister of State is correct when he says in his opening remarks that the Minister wishes to keep tight control of the affairs of Bord na Móna.  Indeed, there might well be tighter control of some aspects of their operations.  I say that because for a number of years Bord na Móna did not give a fair return for the moneys previously invested by the State. The need for further development in line <Col N="1103" /> with private enterprise is something that should be foremost in their priorities in the future.  We are all aware that, other than their own capital, the resources will not be available to them to develop the enormous areas of turbary in the country. In his opening remarks the Minister mentioned the amount of money recently given by way of grants for small bog development.  I believe that was the greatest thing that ever happened with regard to the development of smaller bogs in rural areas.  It meant that people who traditionally relied on imported fuels, oil or coal, were rendered reasonably self-sufficient as far as household fuels are concerned.  It has made extra finance available to such people, because turf is a cheaper form of energy.  The 1981 Act which brought about that situation came perhaps 20 years too late.  Had it come in the early sixties probably it would have meant that when the early seventies energy crisis arose we would have been in a much better position to tackle the problems it presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as private development is concerned, in the future I would hope that Bord na Móna would continue to ensure that the moneys made available to private individuals and co-operatives are well spent.  We do not want a situation to develop in which that money might be spent on projects which would prove to be non-viable in the long-term.  There is one problem which arises in regard to this type of development.  Possibly it may not be a problem for Bord na Móna.  I refer to the problem obtaining at present with regard to the subdivision of turbary by the Land Commission.  There may well be a role to be played here by Bord na Móna, in conjunction with the Land Commission, to deal with the backlog of division of turbary remaining unexploited. In many cases this turbary belongs to absentee landlords and various estates, the owners having long since passed to their reward.  There was an example recently in my county when a number of people endeavoured to develop an area of bog and were forced to cease development there because an individual held a turbary right on approximately <Col N="1104" /> one and a half acres of 200 acres, which was undefined.  This meant he could claim his right to that small portion of turbary anywhere on that acreage. This is something that will need to be tackled in the very near future by Bord na Móna in conjunction with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill mean an investment of £80 million by the State, which, it is envisaged by the Minister, will be spent in the next three years. There was one point in the Minister's opening remarks that annoyed me intensely, that was that the decision with regard to the Ballyforan peat briquette factory is being deferred.  I will admit that the Minister says it is hoped there will be a final decision taken with regard to this project in approximately three to four weeks which will then be put to the Government.  But if this money is made available to Bord na Móna by the Government they can instruct Bord na Móna to proceed with this project which in my opinion is viable, especially in view of the fact that today large amounts of German briquettes are being imported. This is a drain on the economy.  If we produced these briquettes from our own resources we would be providing badlyneeded employment in the area.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna, like all semi-State bodies, have a social as well as an economic role.  If they were to become totally economic-orientated, they would not fulfil their purpose as a semi-State organisation. Then they should be handed to a private enterprise organisation and in that event they would have to survive on their own, although I accept they could do this.  However, they must fulfil their social obligation as well as an economic obligation.  In making his decision on the future of this project I hope the Minister will remember that quite an amount of money has been spent in the provision of services in respect of the factory in question. Not alone was it a commitment of the previous Fianna Fáil Government but there was also a commitment by members of the Minister's party and his Government to proceed with the Ballyforan project.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna should be requested to <Col N="1105" /> make available to all Members of the Oireachtas, as should all semi-State bodies, a detailed breakdown of their capital expenditure for each year.  By this I mean making available details of all capital expended in excess of £100,000.  We have a right to know how such moneys are spent.  The annual report of Bord na Móna or of any other semi-State organisation which is made available to the public and to Members of the Oireachtas merely shows items listed as capital expenditure, and round sums are given. Information should be made available to the public regarding the way the money has been spent.</P>
    <P>One or two matters slightly annoy me in the operations of Bord na Móna.  There is a kind of closed shop operated with regard to quotas for peat briquettes.  I know of fuel merchants who have to pay money to third parties to take up their quotas from peat briquette factories.  This is an unhealthy situation because people who are not directly involved in the fuel business are getting commission on fuel that is later sold to the public.  I hope the Minister will ask Bord na Móna to seek tenders for quotas in tonnage of briquettes that will be required for the following year.  I know of one case where a person who entered the fuel business in the past two years has been refused a supply of turf briquettes.  He has been told he must get them through a quota-holder with Bord na Móna.  I hope the Minister will do something to rectify this unhealthy situation.  Turf is one of our great natural resources and if it is handled properly it could safeguard us in the future against the problems we faced in the period 1973 to 1975 at the time of the energy crisis.  I hope that in future Bord na Móna will examine the possibility of giving assistance by way of grants to private individuals, in addition to the 45 per cent presently given to them to develop areas of bog.</P>
    <P>The amount of moss peat being produced could be increased greatly because there is a widespread market for this product.  The board should make a greater effort in this area.  The income this year was £12 million from this product. If it were fully exploited, £30 million <Col N="1106" /> to £40 million could be gained from the sale of moss peat.  There is a large market on the continent for this product which is of great benefit to the horticultural industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech mentioned the extensions being provided at Shannonbridge and Lanesboro.  These are welcome developments which will benefit the country in the future, especially as we could have the same problems with regard to energy supplies that we experienced in the past.  The Minister has stated that it is proposed to spend a further £82 million to complete the present programme of development and he has said that he hopes the capital position will be reviewed in three years time.  I hope this will be done and that the expansion work will be carried out within three years.  We lost at least 20 years in terms of development.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the points I have raised.  In view of the fact that we are giving this company an extra £80 million over three years, they have an obligation to explain to the public each year what they do with the finances that are made available to them by the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I support the Bill and I admire his dedication in furthering the interests of Bord na Móna.  Since the board were set up in the late 1930s, and certainly since the 1946 Act, they have played a significant role in the economic life of many of the midland counties.  The Minister told us that Bord na Móna had over 6,000 employees.  That contribution to our economy, especially in the midland counties, is one that we must jealously guard.  I should like to compliment the board and their employees on their progress to date.  The chief executive is coming to the end of his term and I wish him happiness and success in his retirement. Under his guidance the board have made a very significant contribution over the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am a little disappointed with some aspects of the board's development. Some of the recent capital intensive expansions they have undertaken <Col N="1107" /> have had more teething troubles than should have been expected for a semi-State organisation with such well developed technological expertise.  The amount of experimentation and obvious waste in that area should be closely looked at.  There may be a looseness in some areas of the board's responsibility which in the present state of national finances should not be disregarded.  Some activities should be subject to closer scrutiny. I wish the new chief executive well. I hope that the £80 million being made available by the Government under the terms of this Bill will provide clear planning for the future.  Bord na Móna are a semi-State organisation and the Turf Development Acts clearly set the guide lines for them.  They are a fuel development organisation.  Within the terms of the Turf Development Acts the board should diversify as much as possible.  It is not acceptable that a semi-State organisation such as Bord na Móna should be content to sit back and use up the bogs of this country within the next 20 years.  The present board should ensure through their policy that they will be able to conserve resources and continue to provide employment and make a useful contribution to the national economy indefinitely. That is possible.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the board have been so blatantly foot dragging as far as the biomass energy experiments are concerned. It is a national disgrace that Bord na Móna, the ESB and An Foras Talúntais have so half-heartedly spent only a portion of the money made available for the biomass experiment in the midlands.  If I were an employee of Bord na Móna in the midlands in Clonsast, Portarlington, Boora, Offaly or Kildare, I should be concerned for future employment because Bord na Móna are making absolutely no attempt to perpetuate their activities in the future.  The board have an obligation to carry on their activities economically and successfully and the members and the servants of the board have an obligation to ensure that the activities of the board can be carried on indefinitely.  I hope that the Minister will <Col N="1108" /> interest himself in that area as well. Reading through the Turf Development Bill I see no reason why the board cannot diversify into other areas of energy production. Perhaps it might be no harm if the Minister would consider asking the board to take over control of coal development in the Leinster coalfield and in the Leitrim and Tipperary areas.</P>
    <P>When one sees a new coal face or coal mine being opened and coal being lorried in from Tipperary and from other coal mines to be sold at a new pit, which obviously is waiting either for coal and steel grants or for IDA grants, one wonders what is going on and what sort of supervision there is.  Bord na Móna were specifically set up as a semi-State organisation to provide fuel and energy for this country and they should take on a wider role and utilise the terms of the Acts to the very fullest extent.</P>
    <P>I read with considerable interest an article in the June issue of <i>Farm and Food Research.</i>  This is a publication of An Foras Talúntais.  There is an article on page 86 of this magazine which gives a very optimistic report of two beef production systems on peat land.  The experiments and the progress that is being carried out in this area over the past ten years must surely put pressure on Bord na Móna to decide exactly what they are going to do with the 3,000 or 4,000 acres of cut-over bogs that they now own, bearing in mind that the vast majority of that acreage was compulsorily acquired by the bord at figures ranging from half a crown an acre upwards.  I hope to speak about their CPO facility later on.</P>
    <P>I should like to dwell very briefly on the beef production systems.  I know that Bord na Móna have a sizeable agriculture sector in the midlands.  Unfortunately, they do not seem to have specific figures for the results that they have achieved in that area.  In the Turf Development Acts there is no statutory provision to allow them to go into farming.  Before the spending of this £80 million Bord na Móna must make a policy decision on exactly what they are going to do with their large holding of cut-over bogs.  If they are to go in for State farming of 1,000 acre farms across the midlands it is going to be <Col N="1109" /> extremely difficult for farmers to compete with that kind of loss-making activity.</P>
    <P>When we consider that the best developed State farms in the Soviet Union have not yet, after over 60 years, been able to get around to a profit making situation I cannot foresee a situation in this country when Bord na Móna will be able to break through and make a profit from working huge farms in the midlands. The option would be for the board either to hand back the cut-over land to the people from whom it was acquired or lease it to new farmers.  On the face of it I would be against that because if that were to happen in the midlands we would lose 4,000 to 5,000 jobs, which we can ill afford to lose.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that, with the first of the new moneys which are being made available, the board will examine their full range of options so that the policy will be to retain an optimum depth of peat on the cut-over bogs so that it will render land use in the decades ahead more flexible and more useful.</P>
    <P>I hope the new chief executive, whether it is Mr. McEvilly or someone else, before taking office, will embark on a fact-finding tour either to Georgia in the United States, Georgia in the Soviet Union or to any of the Nordic countries such as Denmark, Sweden or Finland, where significant results have been achieved in the biomass experiment. In this country yields of 24 tonnes per hectare have been recorded.  This is far above the experience that Bord na Móna experiments have yielded.  I would like to know why.  If the Minister is going to endow the board with this extra capital there should be a more futuristic approach taken to it.  I hope that some of the board members, such as the new chief executive and their technical officers, will go to some of those countries to see exactly what is being done.  People from all over the world are coming to look at the achievements and the progress which Bord na Móna have made.  My sole concern is that the board should remain in a position of offering long-term employment to people in Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Westmeath and Longford, where there is <Col N="1110" /> not a strong industrial base.  The activities of Bord na Móna have made a useful contribution to the economy in those counties since the thirties.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned briefly the reason for section 3.  On reading section 19 of the 1946 Act, I thought the Act made it clear that the board were free to give information that had come up during their research.  As I read through it, I missed the finer point why there was necessity for this particular section at this time.  If it is because the board &mdash; this is my experience &mdash; have been reluctant to divulge any semi-State secrets on their profits from their farming activities &mdash; it does not appear anywhere in their annual statement of accounts &mdash; if it is to conserve that kind of a closed shop, then it is a mistake.  I believe the accounts of a semi-State organisation should be absolutely open and free.  I hope the Joint Committee on Semi-State Organisations will look in some depth at the activities of Bord na Móna, not by way of a witch-hunt but to ensure that whatever policy the semi-State companies have, it will, in the long term, be in the national interest, the interest of job creation.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the situation in many parts of the midland counties where people are going back more and more to cutting their own turf, taking up their turbary rights and using the banks that families have had traditionally.  Senator Ellis mentioned a case where an individual held up progress.  I would not like to be part of that.  People must clearly indicate where their rights are and come to some agreement but there are people who have very definite turbary rights in marked areas.  In these areas it is not acceptable that the board should come along and compulsorily take them over from the ordinary householder.  This is a great year for turf and people with turbary rights must have those rights respected.  It is not sufficient for Bord na Móna compulsorily to acquire the rights of small individuals who want to continue using those rights.</P>
    <P>Another point, which has already been mentioned by the previous speaker, is the quota system.  It is not sufficient for the <Col N="1111" /> board to say that they only supply people who have been traditional customers over the years.  Quite clearly, their present policy is an infringement of the competition policy of the EEC.  The fact that they will not supply even large fuel importers is forcing these people to import peat briquettes from European countries.  That is not in the national interest.  It is ridiculous to find Republic of Ireland fuel merchants having to import supplies of baled briquettes from Northern Ireland.  That is not acceptable. I ask the Minister to ensure that there is free and open competition in that semi-State organisation.  The cartels, the rings and the most favoured customers should be done away with because the present system militates again the provision of the cheapest type of domestic fuel for the ordinary housewife.  I hope the Minister will take this matter up with the board as it gives considerable concern.  If not, I feel it is something that should be brought to the notice of the Commission.  There is unfair competition there.  There is no great difficulty in getting supplies from second or third parties but Bord na Móna refuse to supply everyone who goes to them.  That, for a semi-State organisation, cannot be in the interests of normal good trading.</P>
    <P>I wish the board well.  I hope their plans for the expenditure of this money will be well and truly laid.  I welcome the development in Shannonbridge.  The relationship between Bord na Móna and their employees throughout County Offaly and in the other midland counties has been exceptionally good.  The board are lucky that their staff have shown great dedication through the years and that has been a significant factor in the success story of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>My one fear with regard to this semi-State organisation is that the board will just sit out the lifetime of the present bogs, having no regard whatever for the maintenance of employment at the present level.  I hope the Minister will use his powers to force Bord na Móna, the ESB and An Foras Talúntais to press ahead with the biomass experiments.  If they are successful in five or six other countries, <Col N="1112" /> in Europe, in North America and in the USSR, there is no reason why they cannot be successful here, especially when a yield of up to 24 tonnes per hectare has already been recorded here.  Perhaps a strong contributory factor is the fact that the ESB have not fully co-operated in providing the furnaces.</P>
    <P>An unfortunate development over the past few years has been that the National Board for Science and Technology have lost some of their control.  They were transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach, where they seemed to have plenty of power and were in the middle of the decision-making process, to another Department and they have lost their supervisory role and their effectiveness. This has shown up drastically in those experiments where there is no supervision and it is difficult to see the trees and plants because of weeds.  There is an uncaring attitude.  There is not much point in having a board of science and technology if they have not the facilities to carry out their task.  I refer the Minister to their American counterpart who can report directly to the US Senate and to the President of the US.  Unless we restore bite and power to the decisions of the National Board for Science and Technology, we cannot hope to break down the barrier which hinders progress.  I welcome the Bill and wish the board continued success.</P>

      <P>When the motion came before this House for the setting up of the committees I objected to the small number of places given to Fianna Fáil on some of the committees.  I withdraw the objections I made at that time.  I am satisfied with the numbers that we have on the committees.  The system employed in this House and in the other House for the selection of people to serve on committees is excellent.  It is a pity that a similar method cannot be implemented throughout the country in local authorities and so ensure that every political party would have their fair share of members <Col N="1114" /> on committees throughout the country. I am not talking politics because all political parties behave in the same way in this.  One party may have one seat more than the other, say 14 as against 13, on a county council and they may take all the seats on a committee.  I hope the Minister for the Environment will do something about this.</P>

      <P>I believe the marriage breakdown committee to be far more important than some people realise.  It is the fault of the political parties that more men are not nominated to this committee. The nominees come through the Whips and the parties have various ways of selecting the members.  Marriage breakdown is not always attributable to one sex or the other.  It can be the fault of either side.  The husband is very often <Col N="1115" /> the greater sufferer in a marriage breakdown and the male voice should be heard to a far greater extent than it appears it will be heard on this committee.  There is to be one male voice among four females. I have no objection to any of the female members.  By all means let the female Members of the Seanad have a voice and serve on this committee.  The male voice should be heard more than it is likely to be heard, with all due respect to Senator Hussey.  I am sure he will do a good job on this committee.  I congratulate him on joining with the ladies from this House. He, too, would welcome some support on the committee.  I want to protest at the political parties not seeing fit to nominate more male Senators to the committee.</P>

    <Title>Turf Development Bill 1983: Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Turf Development Bill. This Bill proposes to raise the borrowing limits of Bord na Móna from £100 million to £180 million.  Bord na Móna are one of our more successful semi-State bodies. Since their establishment in 1946, they have made a substantial contribution to the economic and the social well being of the country through the development of bogs and peat resources.  They have also given considerable assistance to our balance of payments, particularly in more recent years, by providing a substitute for imported fuel and through the export of peat moss and other peat products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have been responsible for the creation of secure employment for a large number of workers in areas where alternative employment opportunities are either very scarce or in many cases nonexistent. It is very important that this situation should continue.  The Minister mentioned that the work force of Bord na Móna at the moment is in excess of <Col N="1116" /> 6,000 people.  I understand that their wage bill is in the region of £50 million per annum.  There is no doubt that they have made a very important contribution to the social and economic well-being of the areas where their works are located.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the Turf Development Act, 1981, the board have been playing a major role in encouraging more extensive private development of our smaller bogs for the production of fuel. They provide grants to individuals and groups.  As the Minister said in his speech, not all bogs are suitable for large-scale mechanised development by Bord na Móna.  Many of our smaller bogs are now being exploited by private developers and are producing considerable quantities of fuel.  Those private developers have been aided very considerably by the grant scheme which was introduced under the Turf Development Act, 1981.  I hope that more groups, co-ops and individuals will avail of these grants for drainage and construction of roads and purchase of machinery.  It is very important that we should continue to increase the amount of home-produced fuel.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay my tribute to everybody associated with the work and success of Bord na Móna over the years. Since their establishment in 1946 they have played a major role in the social and economic life of the country.  I hope that they will be as successful in the years ahead as they have been in the past.  I hope that the passing of this Bill and the additional money which will be provided to the board under this Bill will enable them to continue to operate successfully.</P>
    <P>In my own area of the country there are Bord na Móna works located at Mount Dillon and Derryfadda.  In the Mount Dillon group of bogs, which are located in Counties Longford and Roscommon adjacent to the Shannon, both sod peat and milled peat are produced. The milled peat produced in these bogs supplies the ESB generating station in Lanesboro.  I was pleased to hear the Minister annouce in his speech that the extension to the generating station at Lanesboro will be commissioned next year.  The sod peat which is produced in <Col N="1117" /> the Mount Dillon group of bogs is sold for domestic use.  In recent years, demand has exceeded supply in the Mount Dillon works.  I understand that the sod peat generating station has been closed in Lanesboro and possibly there will be more sod peat available for domestic use from those bogs.  The situation has been over the past few years that sod peat from the Mount Dillon bog has been sold on a quota system.</P>
    <P>Over the years the board have provided very badly needed employment in that area.  That fact is both recognised and appreciated locally by the general public.  The Derryfadda group of bogs is situated in south Roscommon and east Galway, adjacent to the River Suck. There are approximately 10,000 acres of virgin bog in this area.  Up to recently most of this bogland was in the ownership of hundreds of small farmers in the south Roscommon and east Galway areas. They sold their bogs to Bord na Móna, in most cases for nominal prices, on the understanding that this bog was required for the development of a briquette factory at Ballyforan.  It was stated that between the bog and the factory there would be 400 to 500 workers employed for the next 40 years.  I am satisfied that a clear commitment was given to the development of the Derryfadda group of bogs and the development of the factory. It is easy to understand why the small farmers in that area were so willing to sell their bogland for nominal prices because they saw the prospect of employment opportunities for their sons and daughters and nephews and nieces for many years to come in Ballyforan.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna proceeded to develop this bogland and also to develop the site for the factory.  The projected capital cost of the factory was in the region of £25 million.  To date a sum of between £5 million and £5½ million has been spent on site development.  In addition to what Bord na Móna have spent there, Roscommon County Council, of which I am a member, in anticipation of the employment opportunities which would be provided by the project, decided to proceed with water, sewerage and housing schemes in the Ballyforan area.  Everything <Col N="1118" /> seemed to be going fine until a short time ago.  Approximately two weeks ago, the Minister for Finance was in the Roscommon constituency on what was described as a morale-boosting visit.  That was when the bubble burst.</P>
    <P>At a press conference in Roscommon town, the Minister confirmed that the Ballyforan project was being reviewed as part of a national review of capital expenditure.  This announcement has caused shock and disbelief in the area.  It was common knowledge that a contractor had been selected to build the factory. Last week, along with many other public representatives from Galway and Roscommon, I attended a public meeting in Ballyforan which was organised by the Ballyforan development organisation. We were left in no doubt as to the views of the people about this Government decision.  The people cannot understand why the project should be deferred.  They see the decision as having the most serious social and economic implications for the development of the south Roscommon/east Galway area.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that in recent years the board have not been able to meet the demand for briquettes and were obliged to operate a rationing system, the decision is all the more difficult to understand. Senator Ellis referred to the fact that we have been importing briquettes for the past few years.  I cannot understand why this project should be the subject of a review at this stage.  I urge the Minister to ensure it is proceeded with immediately.  Any delay will put the jobs of the work force at risk since there is no point in producing milled peat if there is no briquette factory.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Industry and Energy was on a promotional tour in the Far East.  On his return home he announced, according to newspaper reports, that industrialists from Hong Kong, Japan and Korea would be visiting Ireland with a view to setting up factories here which would provide up to 1,000 jobs.  I congratulate the Minister on the success of his tour and hope the jobs will materialise.  Other Ministers have travelled to various parts of the world and I assume they too have been making every <Col N="1119" /> effort to persuade foreign industrialists to locate here.  I know the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism was in China recently.  I do not know if he was successful in persuading any Chinese industrialists to locate here.  However, it makes little sense to me to be travelling all around the world looking for industry to locate here and at the same time being reluctant to proceed with the development of industry based on our own natural resources.  In Derryfadda we have a valuable native resource.  Bord na Móna have the expertise to establish a very successful industry based on that resource.  I appeal to the Minister to give them the green light to proceed with this project immediately.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill which will enable private bog developers to have access to information about research and development by Bord na Móna into bog development.  I have no doubt that this information will be of considerable value to private developers. I am delighted it will be made more freely available to them.  I accept that the board should be allowed to exercise some measure of discretion in cases where the giving of information could prove to be a threat to their commercial interest.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister I would welcome this Bill very much if at the end of the debate he will give an assurance that the Ballyforan project will be proceeded with without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for bringing this legislation before us.  I also thank the Opposition for agreeing to take all Stages now.  This is an enabling Bill to allow Bord na Móna to increase their borrowing capacity by £80 million, which is necessary if they are to carry on with their major development programme, likely to cost in the region of £82 million.  This is on top of the major development programme which the board have carried out in the last ten years.  This is indicative of the tremendous impetus there appears to be in this semi-State body to capitalise in areas where capital projects are economically viable and materially possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> In some areas the terrain lends itself to major industrial development using the Bord na Móna technique and in other areas it does not.  I am glad that my county, Tipperary, has a major development in Littleton.  I was present when the factory came into production.  It is a show piece for any industrialist to see.  It shows what it is possible to do with a natural product like turf.</P>
    <P>The factory is a major employer in a part of rural Ireland where there would not normally be a factory.  It is a shining example of what is possible.  From research which was carried out, I know it was proved economically viable for such a factory to locate there.</P>
    <P>This factory is located on the border of two administrations.  I am glad that both North and South Tipperary County Councils co-operated in providing the infrastructure, such as roads and so on, which was required.  Both county councils were an example of what could be done when there is the will to do so.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the project envisaged for Ballyforan seems to be the subject of a review.  I hope the review will be carried out quickly.  I know the part of Roscommon concerned and they could do with this kind of development.  The sooner the doubt is cleared up the better. We must ensure that capital projects are economically viable.  We have had too many projects for which we borrowed vast sums which did not stand the test of time.  We are now saddled with the repayment of borrowings for projects which were not viable.  We pay 90p out of every pound collected in PAYE on interest on borrowings for projects which were not viable.  A lot of borrowing took place here for projects that were never really viable but they were initiated for other reasons.  I am not suggesting for a moment that this is one of them, because it probably is not.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that Ballyforan, like Littleton, will get their major industrial development by way of the natural product that is available as readily in County Roscommon as elsewhere.  It is a major by-product of the countryside and because horticulture has benefited so much from that kind of by-product the <Col N="1121" /> company must ensure continued research by Bord na Móna into all its products, whether for energy in the form of sod turf or peat briquette, or waste matter which can now also be utilised for horticultural purposes or, indeed, for any other biomass fuel.</P>
    <P>I would plead with the board to show a degree of courage in breaking into new areas of research because other countries have proved that that product has immeasurable advantages for the economy.  We have seen in other countries alternative energy provided from the most extraordinary kind of products. Certainly turf is one that lends itself to many very important uses.</P>
    <P>I am very keen on the section in the Bill that allows private individuals and co-operatives access to all the expertise available from Bord na Móna.  There is no doubt that in parts of the country, particularly my own county on the side of the Galtee mountains, there is an immeasurable amount of turf available for saving.  I am glad that grants are available for co-operatives and individual groups where there has been a history over a long number of years of saving turf on the mountainside.  It certainly is an area that I can never envisage Bord na Móna getting involved in because the terrain is pretty tough.  Apart from the job satisfaction of being out in the fresh air of that beautiful countryside saving your own turf, you might not be able to put a value on the end product, but the tremendous satisfaction of being able to do it would drive many people out to do it.</P>
    <P>There are grants available not only for the capital required for the machinery, but also for the provision of roads to get to the point where turf can be saved and can be used effectively.  I look forward to a tremendous development of that type of self-interest, that people are not depending on large semi-State bodies in an area which we realise they will never develop.  The board should not have any worries about releasing information to such small developers who would never become commercial competitors of the board.  Perhaps if more boards had more commercial competitors they might be <Col N="1122" /> more efficient.  Certainly in this area I can see no problem from the small development of mountainside bogs.  From discussions with various groups in my own area it emerges that they will be proceeding along the lines outlined by other speakers. A reference was made to the board's lethargic approach to the use of land from which they obviously have taken all that they want.  This could lend itself to further development, particularly in the area of horticulture.</P>
    <P>I am very worried about the workers employed with Bord na Móna to whose continued fruitful employment I look forward. I hope the board will look seriously at this and that this Oireachtas, in its message to the board, will point out how important it is to make total use of the land available to them.  When a colleague of mine discussed this publicly at one stage, he was accused by all sorts of people, politicians and otherwise, of talking about nationalising land.  The man was talking intelligently about the development of land that is already in public ownership.  Thousands of acres owned by Bord na Móna were acquired under the Turf Development Act, compulsorily, if you like, but certainly they were acquired and compensated for.  That land is in ownership by the Government and has been vested in the Turf Board.  I am suggesting that that land should be made available to workers in the factories who have a vested interest because they have maintained Bord na Móna by the sweat of their brows for so many years.  If land is available now that is of no commercial value to the board, certainly the Bord na Móna workers &mdash; many of them small farmers &mdash; should have access to this land which could be profitably used for horticulture.</P>
    <P>It has been outlined by Senator McDonald that the land, with a certain amount of re-seeding, could be used also for cattle production on a limited scale. There is a whole area of development there that the board should be looking at and not totally concentrating their efforts on major expansion, which is important if it is viable.  We should not lose sight of the ordinary development of the land that has now become available.  I am asking <Col N="1123" /> the board to look at the possibility of taking the rights of the workers, and they have some rights, into consideration in the future use of this land.</P>
    <P>With those few comments, I welcome the Bill.  It enables the board to increase their necessary capital borrowings.  I sincerely hope that our friends in County Roscommon will be as fortunate as we have been in County Tipperary in the development of turf production and peat briquettes, particularly as there seems to be an unlimited market in this country for turf.  It is a major achievement for a semi-State body to be able literally to sell all their products.  There is an unlimited supply available if it is processed and used properly.  In the long term the economy will benefit to a large degree and our balance of payments will be improved because we would be no longer as dependent on oil as we were in the past. I am glad that the Minister devoted so much of his time to this fact of energy.  I hope that all Bord na Móna's efforts will be successful and that they will seriously take into account the views expressed in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill, which provides additional capital to Bord na Móna for their development programme. Bord na Móna have always enjoyed the support of the community for the progress they have made in the development of our bogs.  They have given quite valuable employment, not just in recent years &mdash; I understand that the number employed now is in the region of 6,234&mdash;but also in the past, particularly during the emergency years of the forties when many young men and women earned their livelihoods saving turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today, more than ever before, we need the help and expertise of State boards such as Bord na Móna to absorb some of the young labour force now available to us.  Bord na Móna can provide valuable employment in areas which do not have strong potential for attracting other types of industry.  Apart from providing employment directly, when they embark on their programme it also generates <Col N="1124" /> a spin-off in engineering, construction and allied industries.  The consequent effect of this kind of development on the economy of the catchment areas of the board's enterprises has been substantial. That is why I was personally very happy when the board, with the full support of the Government, decided to develop the Derryfadda range of bog, and build a briquette factory in Ballyforan. This range of bog, which covers an area of over 10,000 acres, stretches from Ballyforan, Ahascragh, Ballygar into Glenamaddy and almost right across into Castlerea in County Roscommon, an area which was devastated by emigration and unemployment in the past.  From every household in that area, at one time or another, a son or daughter emigrated to England or America during those dark years to try to eke out a living in the slums of London, Birmingham, New York, or wherever.</P>
    <P>In that part of the country we are determined to fight to the last to ensure that the development promised in that area by successive Governments is carried out.  Commitments were given by Fianna Fáil Governments and Coalition Governments. The dismay and disappointment of the people in that area which has been affected by emigration and unemployment in the past can be imagined when they heard the announcement made by the Minister for Finance in Roscommon. The Minister was on a tour of the western counties.  Usually when a Minister visits a county he tries to bring good news. Unfortunately that does not seem to be the case with the present Government. Every time a Minister visits an area we know we can expect bad news when he leaves.  That was the pattern in Roscommon, unfortunately for the people of Ballyforan and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed at what the Minister said. As reported in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> of July 1 under the heading &ldquo;£25½ million briquette factory review&rdquo;, the Minister, who was speaking to local pressmen prior to addressing a meeting of the Fine Gael executive, is reported to have said it was a pity they did not have such a review in relation to Knock Airport before public money was committed to it.  We all know <Col N="1125" /> the Minister's attitude towards the Connacht Regional Airport.  If he adopts the same attitude towards the Ballyforan briquette factory, that factory is doomed.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, has an interest in bog development. I should like him to give a firm commitment to the people of that area that this project will be proceeded with. The review has already been carried out. When this project was first mooted I am sure Bord na Móna and the Department of Industry and Commerce, as it then was, did their sums properly.  They were satisfied that any money invested in this project would be money well spent, not only from an economic point of view but from a social point of view.  The social aspect is very important.</P>
    <P>We have the same problem in relation to the Tuam sugar factory at the other end of the constituency.  The Sugar Company had a development at Ballyforan, the Gowla farm.  A number of workers were employed in safe jobs.  Their jobs were taken over by Bord na Móna.  They were absorbed into the Bord na Móna plan for the area.  Those people are now wondering what will happen to them.  We have seen clouds which were cast over the sugar factory.  I visited that factory on numerous occasions and I saw the developments there, covering an area of the county back into Ballyforan and Ahascragh.  They helped farmers and workers to get jobs.</P>
    <P>This is an industrial mini-estate.  Our Ministers are travelling the world trying to encourage foreign industrialists to set up industries here, but they have the opportunity to develop our native resources, to develop the bogs which have been lying idle for so many years, to create employment and provide valuable spin-off industries.  It would be unfortunate if anything were to happen to that project.  I am saddened that any doubt should be cast on it.  One has to live in that area to realise the importance of a development of that nature to the people of Ballyforan and the eastern part of County Galway.</P>
    <P>There is no prospect of getting any other type of industry in the area.  Vast areas of bog have been taken over by <Col N="1126" /> Bord na Móna.  The farmers signed away their rights.  The sold their bogs to Bord na Móna for development.  Why any Minister should attempt to block that development I cannot comprehend.  I hope the Minister will have a satisfactory explanation for us tonight.  The people from that part of east Galway and south Roscommon are very worried, very annoyed and very frustrated that any attempt should be made to stymie the development of that project in Ballyforan.  I am pleading on their behalf in the strongest possible terms with my colleagues to ensure that this development will go ahead.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are the one hope. Unfortunately we have a large tract of bog which will never be developed.  In the past it was left lying there, undrained and undeveloped.  Farmers cut a few loads of turf and sold them to people who had no bogs of their own.  They made a few pounds in that way but those days are gone.  Now we have machines which are capable of developing the bogs.  It is very important that this area is developed and that the people are given a chance to utilise this resource which has been lying idle for so long.</P>
    <P>I am happy that money is being provided to co-operatives and groups of farmers for the private development of their own bogs.  Over the past number of years modern machinery supplied by the Sugar Company and in later years by private individuals has been used for cutting turf, wasting a good deal of the bogs in the process.  It is sad to see that happening. Unless the bogs are drained properly large tracts will be wasted in a few years' time and they will be no good to anybody.  Every encouragement should be given to private individuals and groups to drain the bogs.  At the moment they are taking the top off the bogs and leaving the best part behind.  After using those machines for a few years the bog becomes useless and cannot be used for further development.</P>
    <P>I should like to encourage the Department and Bord na Móna to highlight the grants which are available under the scheme.  Many farmers still do not realise that grants are available.  Bord na Móna and the Department have a duty to make <Col N="1127" /> known to those people the types of grants which are available, how they can apply for them, and how they can avail of the money that is there for the development of the bogs and the roads leading to them.</P>
    <P>A few years ago I visited some of the midland bogs.  I was amazed at the amount of work being done on cutaway bogs.  We were brought to a particular bog and shown the fine crops of silage cut from cutaway bogs which had been developed and seeded by Bord na Móna.  They had done an excellent job and were producing vegetables of all kinds.  That could be improved upon particularly when one considers the extent of vegetable imports annually.  It is sickening to think that we have an abundance of land where such vegetables can be grown and that our cutaway bogs which are suitable for vegetable growing are not utilised.  It is wrong that we must import millions of pounds worth of vegetables annually to satisfy our needs.</P>
    <P>I understand that last year Bord na Móna produced £12 million worth of vegetables but that could be increased substantially. The board should get involved in that aspect of bog development more vigorously because it would mean a great help to the economy.  It is questionable whether cutaway bogs should be handed back to individuals.  That should be examined carefully.  While it is possible that a number of farmers may be interested in developing such cutaway bogs for the production of vegetables or grass there is always the chance that a farmer in between may not be interested in developing his portion of the cutaway.  That person may not do anything to clear the drains and that would frustrate the efforts of those anxious to develop their plots. There should be no question of nationalising such land and I would be against any such move, but I accept that a problem will arise if we do not have the full co-operation of all farmers involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the acquisition of land by Bord na Móna, I am aware that it is a slow and cumbersome procedure.  Many constituents have had to approach me on numerous occasions to make representations to Bord na Móna about that aspect <Col N="1128" /> of their development programme.  It appears that the board are slow to pay for land purchased.  Some owners have found it very difficult to get their money from the board.  Up to recently the price paid by the board for bog was very low. Bord na Móna have the expertise and they should ensure that a farmer who is giving up his few acres of bog is adequately compensated.  It is not good enough to prolong the negotiations for years.  In some cases the board have commenced the development of the bogs before they have paid the farmers for them.  The procedure should be speeded up and the board should pay the full market price to farmers.  In my constituency some farmers had to sell land they had already reclaimed, the board stating that they needed it because it bordered on bog they were developing.  Those farmers did not get adequate compensation for that land bearing in mind the amount of work that was involved in reclaiming it.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna should be generous with farmers who have developed and drained land to enlarge their holdings.  I support any development Bord na Móna undertake in any area because it is the one State board which can make a contribution to our economic development.  In the past the board have built up a reputation and now more than ever before we need their help in our efforts to create employment for the many young people who are tramping our roads in search of any type of job.  State boards like Bord na Móna should advance projects and diversify.  The board should not only be involved in turf production but should move into other areas.  I am confident that if they do that they will absorb more of the available labour force thereby making a further contribution to our economic development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate highlights a number of principles and points which are important not only to Bord na Móna but in regard to the State, ownership within the State and the control of the State.  The bogs of Ireland have come to the people in trust from the past.  We must consider today, particularly because of the high technology we can now apply <Col N="1129" /> to bogs, if we will turn out to be good trustees.  A number of Senators alluded to that fact.  Senator McDonald pointed out there was a grave danger of utilising as much as possible today and overlooking the fact that we might be glad tomorrow if we had been more conservative in the amount we took out of our bogs.  We must ask ourselves if we are serious about whether we will run the risk of squandering precious resources on the one hand and the degree, the sense of urgency or determination we are going to apply as a people to the need for conservation.  I do not think people have to read very much about the present state of global ecology to become aware of the great crisis that now exists in the world in regard to fuel requirements, energy needs and the use of energy.  It is anticipated that by the year 2000 many of the fossil fuels will have run out and mankind will be looking for alternative types of fuel or alternative ways of living.  A horror that one has is that therefore we will be forced to become nuclear in our philosophy to energy production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point that could not be emphasised sufficiently is: how seriously are we prepared to take the future as well as the present when we look at the potential we have in our bogs?  The second point I should like to raise is: how do we determine who decides how the bogs will be used, to what purpose their production will be put, how the cutaway bog will be used after the turf has been removed from it and will it be left in the hands of a centrally organised semi-State body or will we have an increasing local political input into the decision-making process? They are important matters and they may go some way to answering a few of the questions that have been posed by fellow Senators.  I am sure that in many aspects of living in today's highly centralised world there is a need to look again at what can be achieved in a political sense at local community level, and how we need to restructure our society to liberate the potential of the people and to use the resources realistically, to respond not only to present needs, but also to the need for conservation and anti-pollution. I have talked about the need for a health <Col N="1130" /> guild in the local community, and I would suggest that there is a crying need for energy guilds to be set up in local communities, or in the thinking of people concerned about the use of land and resources, so that there would be a much greater input by people to the debate. The commonsense of the citizen in the community where the land or the resource exists is something that cannot be replaced with textbook knowledge.  At the same time, the citizen cannot be aware of all the technological developments now available.  I would plead for a much greater balance in the debate than we had before.  We should not say that the technological expert must know all the answers, but we should say he can provide certain expertise.  The people instinctively know in relation to the tradition of the countryside in which they live, their own needs, their own communities, how those resources can best be utilised.</P>
    <P>I refer now to turbary rights which were raised by Senator Ellis.  This raises some very important points of principle as to how the citizen in the community relates to the central institutions of the State.  Do those central institutions dictate? There has been a suggestion throughout this debate that they may have to dictate to the local people what they should do for the greater good.  Will people living in the community have a greater opportunity in the future to determine what their basic needs are and try to get the central institutions to respond in a more constructive and positive way than they have in the past?  I believe there is a great need for Bord na Móna and other semi-State bodies to try, as is happening, to put more emphasis on scale and community and less on size and centre.  That is not to say that we throw overboard overnight all that has been created out of centralist thinking, but that we try to achieve a better balance.</P>
    <P>I am the owner of a half acre of bog in Donegal &mdash; where I was yesterday and not in Downpatrick, my old home town &mdash; around which there is seven acres. What will the local people ever benefit from those seven acres which is owned by the absentee landlord?  If I chose to sell <Col N="1131" /> my property tomorrow, who would benefit, apart form the absentee landlord? How is that land being used?  For whose purpose is it being used?  I am not suggesting that one could convert it into a ranch overnight, but I do not believe that the social and political climate of Ireland will have reached any great state of health until at least those questions can be freely asked in that community in which I am now an absentee landlord.  I believe, and I hope, I can give answers to those questions. I believe there are a lot of taboo questions about the use of resources in Ireland which we do not face up to.  If we do not face up to them soon they will face us in a much more devastating manner later.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would bear out what has been said by others that, when we look at the challenge of private ownership, there is a tendency to say &ldquo;nationalise all&rdquo;.  As I have said before in this House, that puts a gulf between the people, the land and resources, because it is only a means of taking it over by the centralised bureaucracy.  There is a crying need to face up to what will become an increasing demand by people who have been disenfranchised by no employment into having a stake in the country in which they live.  Therefore I would earnestly like to support the proposal made by Senator Ferris &mdash; and which has been dealt with by other Senators &mdash; that land becoming available as a result of cutting away the bogs should be shared out to people who have an interest in it.  It should not be beyond our imagination to consider that experiments in individual ownership should be undertaken in some centres, in others collective ownership and finally, perhaps, Bord na Móna ownership. Senator Hussey had certain reservations about handing over the bogland to individuals.  I would go further and say it is essential that we start to think how we can hand back to individuals small amounts of land to be held at least in trust for their lives as land becomes available. Here lies a golden opportunity for an experiment in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to spend <Col N="1132" /> too much time on this Bill because as most people know we do not have many bogs in Kilkenny.  However, we live on the periphery of the biggest bog in Ireland.  We need an integrated energy policy.  For too long there has been an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement in relation to the major sources of energy we can produce.  At present we have Bord na Móna and An Bord Gáis.  There exists a situation at present where millions of pounds are being spent off our shores on explorations for oil and gas, while a major source of energy is being run down &mdash; the Leinster coalfields, the Tipperary coalfields and the Arigna coalfields.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made in recent years in the use of low grade coals but we in Ireland do not seem to have dealt with that problem.  I have seen the running down of our coalfields.  I have seen them taken over by cowboys, people who get in for the quick buck, who take out what is easy and then run away.  For too many people the bog is like the hurley.  If one lives in the city the only relationship one has with the bog is to run down to buy a bale of briquettes.  One never thinks about where that bale of briquettes comes from and the major part that the manufacture of these briquettes contributes to the Irish economy.  A similar situation exists in relation to the hurley.  An attempt was made here yesterday to eliminate VAT on hurleys.  The hurley comes from a native source &mdash; ash.  The energy expended by our people in using that ash should be recognised, as it is recognised in many other countries.  VAT should be removed from the ash used in the making of hurleys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech Ballyforan, County Roscomon, was mentioned.  One might wonder how I, being from Kilkenny, could relate to the setting up of the Ballyforan factory.  The Minister stated that because of the high level of borrowings and the need for an effective use of capital to ensure a better return to the community, he initiated a review of all capital investment projects within his area of responsibility.  This review of capital expenditure apparently ranges over every public sector, just as it does over <Col N="1133" /> every enterprise in the private sector. Apparently this review does not take into account the major effect of the possible abolition of the Ballyforan project not alone in Roscommon but stretching as far down as Kilkenny in places where companies have tendered for the manufacture of the plant which could be used in Ballyforan.  The Irish content of the conveyor alone within the Ballyforan project is in the region of £700,000 to £800,000.  Therefore it will be seen that this project has major implications for our economy.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the capital investment by the IDA, and relates it to numbers and acres, Kilkenny becomes very important.  The Minister in his introductory remarks said that £78 million had been spent since the mid-seventies on the expansion of Bord na Móna and that there are proposals to spend a further £82 million.  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>To date grants totalling £1.9 million have helped some 4,000 people in carrying out drainage to their bogs, on the construction of roads and the purchase of machines.</P>
    <P>One might relate those remarks to the situation in Kilkenny where there is a site of 11½ acres covered by a factory building into which the American company, Fieldcrest, put a very small amount of money and the cost to our Exchequer was £35 million.  That was a situation in which the IDA poured an average of £2,500,000 per acre into a site which eventually did not produce one solitary job.  We might well relate that experience to what we are about today, giving an increase in capital to Bord na Móna whose programme now covers 78,000 acres.  One might well pose the question where we should be going in relation to our energy policy and in relation to our investment policy in industry. I do not think we are serious about the situation.  Indeed, an integrated energy policy here is a laugh.  There are major energy sources not being used.  No attempt is being made within the Department of Energy to have an integrated energy policy, to bring our gas, oil, low grade coal and a certain amount of high grade coal, and turf within the ambit of <Col N="1134" /> one Ministry and board rather than have various people fighting for insufficient capital resources.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb spoke about the proper usage of our energy sources.  Generally speaking we are talking about fossil fuels, in coal, turf, timber, oil and gas and it must be remembered that these energy sources will expire.  Another interesting fact, when related to what has been said by Senator Robb, emerges from what the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Low prices in the past resulted in the board not being able to make any significant contribution from its own resources and the servicing of its borrowing places a heavy burden on the board's financial position.</P>
    <P>I remember when everybody criticised the Arabs for raising the price of their oil products in 1974 to that sustainable economically. Suddenly the whole world became anti-Arab.  They have a fossil fuel which is being run down.  What did they do?  They did not bring it up to what would constitute an economic return. They endeavoured to bring it up within the range of being economical and the whole world went against them.  In this Bill there is a parallel.  Why should Bord na Móna not charge an economic price for the products they sell?  If they do not charge an economic price nobody will clap them on the back in ten years time when they have a scarce energy source and endeavour to raise its price to what they should have been receiving for many years past.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Developments in the European Communities &mdash; Twenty-first Report&rdquo; was received by us today, having discussed yesterday the Nineteenth and Twentieth Reports dated January and July 1982 respectively.  I might quote from chapter 16 under the heading &ldquo;Energy Policy&rdquo; at paragraph 16.1 where it is stated:</P>
    <P>On 13 July 1982 the Council (Energy) discussed Commission reports on various elements of the Community's strategy as follows</P>
    <P>&mdash;the energy situation in the Community</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" />&mdash;investment in the rational use of energy</P>
    <P>&mdash;demonstration programmes in the energy sector</P>
    <P>&mdash;nuclear aspects of energy strategy</P>
    <P>&mdash;the role of coal.</P>
    <P>There is a parallel between what is said there and what we are talking about today.  Paragraph 16.2 states:</P>
    <P>In reviewing the energy situation the Council noted indications of further falls in energy and oil demand during 1982.  It shared the Commission's concern about the uncertainties of future trends in oil prices and in the rate of economic growth and agreed to pursue policies that would ensure that the pace of structural change in energy supply and demand was continued.  Having considered a Commission proposal regarding financial support for two demonstration project schemes, the Council requested a report on the proposals for the November Council.</P>
    <P>I wonder how much of the Commission's money has come into Ireland in relation to the development of our bogs.  I know certain commercial interests have succeeded in getting start-up grants from the EEC Commission.  But I wonder have we explored this aspect of the use of our bogs in their present condition and, in particular, their usage when cut away.  I do not think we are sufficiently concerned in this area.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 16.2 continues:</P>
    <P>The Council adopted a Recommendation to member States concerning the encouragement of investment in the rational use of energy.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking about the use of energy but not about its rational use.  We are talking about an <i>ad hoc</i> agreement to increase the capital of Bord na Móna which will not do anything to rationalise what is happening in terms of energy here.  Rather will it increase the borrowing capacity of the board but is in no way integrated into what I consider should be a national energy policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> Paragraph 16.2 ends with this sentence:</P>
    <P>On the role of coal in the community's energy policy it was decided that a more in-depth policy debate on all solid fuels would take place at the next Council (Energy).</P>
    <P>We must remember that this is 1983 and that there has been an energy crisis in the world since the early seventies.  Now the EEC Energy Committee are considering a more in-depth debate.  At paragraph 16.3 they say:</P>
    <P>On 9 November the Council (Energy) discussed the Community energy strategy on demonstration projects, financial incentives for the rational use of energy and the role of coal and other solid fuels.  Certain guidelines, towards the preparation of a Council decision, were agreed on most problems in relation to the demonstration projects schemes.</P>
    <P>I wonder have any of these demonstration projects schemes been taken into account by Bord na Móna in making future plans.  I wonder what has been the input of those guidelines into the present energy policy of the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 16.4 states:</P>
    <P>The Council discussed the Commission's proposal on the granting of financial incentives for certain categories of investment in the rational use of energy, one of a series of suggestions designed to promote productive investment in the Community.  On the role of solid fuels it was decided that the Energy Ministers would discuss this issue at a special meeting in December 1982.</P>
    <P>Those remarks are very relevant to the Bill we are discussing.</P>
    <P>In regard to the maintenance of minimum oil stocks the report had this to say at paragraph 16.5:</P>
    <P>In regard to the maintenance of minimum oil stocks, member States are to undertake to maintain, during 1983, the level of stocks for petroleum <Col N="1137" /> products at 90 days average daily consumption recorded over the three preceding years, ...</P>
    <P>I should like to know the level of stocks at present being carried by Bord na Móna.  As has been said by other speakers, it seems it is virtually impossible to get a bale of briquettes during the winter. I know that premiums are being paid by shopkeepers to get them.  Why is there a monopoly in the sale of briquettes?  Why are they not distributed in the normal commercial way?  Why should I not be able to get briquettes from a Bord na Móna depot and sell them on a commercial basis?</P>
    <P>The 21st Report of Developments in the European Communities states that factual documents on energy pricing and natural gas supplies were discussed by the Council.  The report also states that an informal meeting of Energy Ministers was held on 16 December 1982 in Copenhagen to consider the role of solid fuels within the framework of a Community energy strategy aimed at diversifying energy supplies and rationalising energy use.  I do not know if the Minister attended that meeting but in view of the fact that solid fuels play such an important part in the economy he should have attended the meeting.  What did he learn from that meeting that would be of use in a balanced and integrated approach to our energy problems?  The report stated that the Ministers considered there should be evident progress towards a balanced and comprehensive Community strategy for solid fuels.  It stated that the Commission were requested to present proposals early in 1983 concerning various aspects of energy such as increased use of solid fuel, improved handling and transport of coal, the coking coal aid scheme, improved production, trade with third countries, and also matters of environment, research development and demonstration.</P>
    <P>I have not yet seen here any integrated or improved handling system for coal. Whereas we have in Bord na Móna a good vehicle for the production, sale and use of turf, our policy on coal is totally inadequate.  As I said before, it is wide <Col N="1138" /> open to the operations of &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; who come here from abroad, who have bought mines and who have put them on the market in Canada and America with no benefit to our economy.  Unless we have an integrated policy for solid fuels we will not get from Bord na Móna the performance we need in what will become an energy starved world in the next ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is a relatively simple measure to enable Bord na Móna to increase their borrowing requirement by £80 million over three years.  Naturally I welcome this and I congratulate the Minister and his officials on bringing this Bill forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The global effect will be that Bord na Móna can continue to expand their operations. Section 3 requires the board to give to private individuals or to people working in co-operatives who are going into bog development work information <Col N="1139" /> and expertise which Bord na Móna have acquired in their 40 years of operation. They have a mine of information that could be shared by others.  We want a greater level of development in bogs, especially in smaller tracts which the board find it uneconomic to develop. There is also a provision in the Bill which states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring the Board to give information to a person the giving of which would&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in the opinion of the Board, prejudice its commercial interests, or</P>
    <P>(b)  contravene policy which for the time being stands determined pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.</P>
    <P>I express a slight fear that we are asking the board on the one hand to give information but perhaps we are also giving them power to be the sole arbiter of the information they give.  I hope they will take a broad view when information is requested from them.</P>
    <P>The Turf Development Act, 1981, has been mentioned.  I should like to take up some of the points raised by Senator Robb.  He referred to the environmental aspect of bog development.  This is very important but it is forgotten that the Act does not impose any requirement on bog developers to protect the environment. There is no provision in it to ensure that they do not do anything that is damaging from the ecological point of view.  That is a great pity.  We know of the destruction, of the raping of the terrain by private unplanned development.  In many places all we have are great canals and useless swamps.  Now we have legislation that will encourage people to go into bog development and we grant-aid such development, but we should also have legislation to require them to look after the land they take into their care.  If that land is not worked well much damage will be caused.</P>
    <P>It is to the great credit of Bord na Móna that during the years they have <Col N="1140" /> adopted a caring attitude in the way they treated bogs.  When they have been cut away they will hand them back in a state that will enable them to be used for another form of production.  I am an environmentalist.  I live in a part of the country that is surrounded by thousands of acres of bogland which is deep and productive.  It is also beautiful to look at and it forms a vital part of the hinterland. We do not want to destroy that.</P>
    <P>There has been mention today about the project at Ballyforan.  That is the development of a peat briquette factory and this I welcome.  I support wholeheartedly the establishment of this factory.  If that project were to be deferred &mdash; I do not think that will be the case &mdash; I would be quite dismayed.  Bord na Móna have accepted that the project is viable and that eventually it will pay its way.  It takes time for any Bord na Móna project to pay its way: it is like raising a child, it has to be fed and nurtured for seven years before the investment starts to pay.</P>
    <P>Generally the contributions from speakers on the opposite side of the House on the Ballyforan project have been constructive.  However, I deplore the mischievous content of the propaganda that has been circulated particularly in County Roscommon and County Galway.  It is this hoary old chestnut of the abandonment of the west.  Our friends down there have homed in on the Ballyforan project with no hard information. They are saying that it has been axed.  The Minister for Finance is often quoted regarding his press conference in Roscommon, but more often he is misquoted and misrepresented in what he said.  I was there when the Minister was speaking and he was very careful to point out that the Ballyforan project, in common with all other capital spending projects that the Government are undertaking this year, is being reviewed.  That is right and good.  It makes them stand the test of their economic worth.  The Minister said, quite rightly, that if this kind of review had been carried out previously we would not have had outrageous public spending on Knock Airport, the Talbot deal and the great wall of Cootehall in <Col N="1141" /> my constituency.  I welcome the fact that the Government should&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Senator has no idea what the implication was behind the Talbot deal.  I am sure the workers in Fords of Cork and in Semperit in Ballyfermot would have a lot to say to the Senator regarding the implications of what he considers to be the Talbot deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right and proper and the duty of any Government to review from time to time their capital spending programme.  As some speakers said &mdash; some from the Opposition side of the House &mdash; there are too many projects in this country where public money has been spent and which proved to be white elephants.  The time for building and fattening white elephants, which we have been doing, is past because money is too scarce.  We are spending 30 per cent of all the tax revenue paying back debts, debts to pay off projects such as those I have mentioned.  However, Ballyforan does not come into that category.  This is a successful semi-State body developing a native resource.  There can only be one result when the Government's review is finished in three or four weeks' time &mdash; that it will go ahead.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that, purely for propaganda reasons, this project has been homed in on for the purpose of saying that it is abandoning the west.  Speakers on the opposite side of the House would do well to remember that reviews are not unknown to them either.  When we were leaving office shortly before February 1982 the then Minister for Energy sanctioned a power station at Arigna, also in County Roscommon.  During the summer of 1982 Fianna Fáil reviewed this, but they reviewed it out of existence.  Our friends from the opposite side of the House, from County Galway and County Roscommon, should remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to keep these things in perspective. We should like to know why Ballyforan is being singled out for a special propaganda attack.  It is a great pity <Col N="1142" /> that so much of it is based on untruth and misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>While generally I admire Bord na Móna in that they are a very successful semi-State body, very caring about the environment and doing a good job, there are a number of things about them that appear to be bureaucratic.  I have had experience myself of small tracts of bog &mdash; this is going back to the 1981 Bog Development Act &mdash; which Bord na Móna would regard as being non-viable for their purposes, being in the hands of the Irish Land Commission.  If the Irish Land Commission wish to apportion them to several tenants or to one or two private developers, they always ask Bord na Móna if they wish to exercise their option.  While Bord na Móna may say it would not be commercially viable for their operation, nevertheless they are very slow to come to the decision eventually to abandon their option and to allow it to be handed over by the Land Commission or any other agency to a private developer or other tenants.  Bord na Móna should look at that aspect of their policy to see if they could speed up the length of time it takes to make certain decisions.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald spoke about the biomass experiment and the slowness in having any major development in this area.  I support him in that.  Many of our cutaway bogs, which would not be suitable for agriculture development or of beet production afterwards because of the level and the natural wetness of the land which remains, would lend themselves to biomass production.  Bord na Móna should get involved more seriously in this area of research and development. Over the next three years, with a possible £80 million to spend, some substantial amount of money should be expended in that area.  We have to think beyond the time when the bogs as we know them today are cut over and cutaway.  We are talking about agricultural, horticultural or biomass production which is a replacement energy from these tracts of land.  I ask Bord na Móna to be mindful of that in the closing stages of this third programme.</P>
    <P>We all like to speak of home.  I said <Col N="1143" /> earlier on that I live in a part of the world where there are tracts of bog in which Bord na Móna are getting involved in so far as they are acquiring bogs in the Castlerea and west and north Roscommon areas.  Senator Hussey, in commenting on the Derryfadda group of bogs, placed them as going towards Castlerea.  They do go a little towards Castlerea in the sense that they are on the Galway side of the River Suck, but on the Roscommon and eastern side of the River Suck there are vast tracts of bog which could be developed.  Naturally, being a resident of that part of the world, I ask that Bord na Móna would become involved in development there as quickly as possible&mdash; firstly, in purchase and afterwards in development.  The climate is more amenable there for them to operate in that major drainage works, the main drainage of these bogs, is now under way by the Board of Works.  From that point of view it would be a very good time for Bord na Móna to get involved in west and north Roscommon.  Under the Boyle drainage and catchment scheme, most of the water which will be flowing in the channels and the rivers comes off the great tracts of bogland in that area.  Bord na Móna should take that into account in policy development and look at it as a prime area where they should next become involved in a new project.</P>
    <P>I was also struck by the fact that, under the programme which is going on at the moment, there will be 2.2 million tonnes of milled peat and 80,000 tonnes of sod peat.  This is a welcome development because, as speakers have said here today, there is a tremendous shortage of sod peat or peat briquettes to be got from Bord na Móna.  I hope that this would bring on to the market a far greater supply of sod turf and briquettes, since most ordinary people recognise Bord na Móna as a turf producing board.</P>
    <P>This is my maiden speech on a substantive issue in this House.  I have an interest in it, as I speak for western development.  I am delighted to see that many of the developments are in counties west of the Shannon.  I welcome the fact that <Col N="1144" /> we will have an extra power station in Lanesboro based on milled peat from the bogs mostly in County Roscommon.  The old power station in Lanesboro was supplied mostly by bogs in County Longford which is Leinster.  Naturally I welcome that development.  I also welcome the Shannonbridge development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning we are dealing with one of our most successful semi-State bodies.  Because it has been successful, one would be inclined to think that the Minister with responsibility for it would be somewhat complacent.  I urge him to be as vigilant in keeping a brief on <Col N="1145" /> Bord na Móna as on any other semi-State body.  There is room here for vast beneficial improvement.  The Minister stated this morning that the average employment for the year is 6,234, which is a sizeable number.  There is, of course, a very large spin-off employment benefit. I am sure the employment is far greater than that at this time of the year when the harvesting of turf is taking place.  In this way it can be of great benefit to many people who have other means of income but which are insufficient to provide for their families.  This can be used as a supplement to small farmers in many parts of the country as short-term employment. Bord na Móna are doing an excellent job.  I would not for one moment decry the activities of Bord na Móna or underestimate the job they have been doing over the years.  I hope they will continue to do this.  However, it is important that the Minister ensure we get the best possible benefit for the money that it is proposed to borrow under this Bill here today.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna are getting dangerously near their limit of borrowing.  This makes one wonder if they are running into trouble.  I hope they are not.  The limit was set some years ago and money values are not today what they were when the limit on the borrowing for Bord na Móna was set.  Our bogs, properly used and exploited to the full, could save this country many millions of pounds in fuel imports.  This is important.  There are many bogs which were neglected until the early forties when we found we could not import the necessary fuel for our factories and for domestic purposes.  It was only then that many people turned to working the bogs and extracting from them the very valuable asset which we had there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that there are sufficient regulations governing turf harvesting and the condition in which bogs are left afterwards.  I am not speaking about the Bord na Móna bogs.  I am familiar with some of their bogs and they do an excellent job.  But there are many bogs operated by private firms and individuals which are left in a deplorable condition afterwards.  Their only interest seems to <Col N="1146" /> be to extract the turf, whether for commercial or for domestic use, and thereafter the bog is left in a shocking condition. All of us can see this as we travel through the country.</P>
    <P>The Turf Development Act, 1981, for the first time gave grants to individuals. I was disappointed at the level of grants to individuals and to private companies because 60 per cent of the cost of road construction, drainage and purchase of machinery is given to co-ops, but only 45 per cent is given to individuals or private companies.  Why is the individual penalised in this way?  Even the IDA in recent times have come to the realisation that to help the small man is of the greatest benefit to the country.  When they get people to take up a new business or project they give it the greatest of publicity. That is in order to encourage more people to do the same.  The Department or the Minister, in giving only 45 per cent grants to private individuals and private companies as against 60 per cent to co-ops or larger groups of people operating bogs, are not encouraging the individual to make the best possible use of the bogs.</P>
    <P>Many bogs would be used to a far greater extent if this grant were available under more liberal conditions.  I ask the Minister to see if he could increase the 45 per cent grant to individuals and private companies to 60 per cent to bring it into line with the co-ops and larger groups.  I imagine the reverse should be the case: that the individual should be encouraged and should get a greater grant than the co-ops.</P>
    <P>I am referring to areas where Bord na Móna are not operating.  Many people cut turf from private bogs or through turbary rights and no grant whatsoever is available to them because they are outside a grant area.  In other words, it is an area in which Bord na Móna do not have jurisdiction.  I do not know why.  I am referring, principally, to Wicklow and south Dublin.  Believe it or not there are bogs in south Dublin and nobody operating these bogs is entitled to a grant.</P>
    <P>I was involved in recent years in trying to improve access to these bogs and I failed because no money was available. <Col N="1147" /> I tried through the local improvements scheme, which is operated by the local authorities, to improve roadways to farms and outlying farm areas and even into farmlands where there were no dwellings.  I was unable to persuade the officials of either Wicklow County Council or Dublin County Council that the local improvements scheme could be used to assist the turf-cutters.  Very many people are cutting turf now who did not cut turf previously.  Very many people who had turbary rights did not bother to cut turf, but with the increased cost of other fuels they are now turning to turf harvesting.  The Minister should give some attention to bogs outside areas where the grant is available.  He should look at ways of giving other grants.  In many instances only road improvement would be necessary or advice about draining the bog might be in order, because where individuals are cutting turf there is no continuity and holes are dug in bogs creating maybe four, six or eight feet of water in one area of the bog and perhaps the turbary rights do not permit the owner of that bog to go into the neighbouring bog.  He has no means of drainage.  Perhaps ACOT could take on the responsibility for giving such advice, although there is a great cutback in staff there.  Many people would go into the bogs to harvest turf for their own use and they should rate as high a priority with the Minister as those who are harvesting turf for commercial purposes.  I do not know if the Minister has the figures for the acreage involved in the bogs I am speaking about.  I hazard a guess that it is almost as great as the bogs that are controlled.  In other words, as much bogland is in private ownership or with turbary rights as is in public ownership and local authorities and the State have no input either by assistance or advice into it.  I ask the Minister to deal with that in his reply or else to give it some attention and at the next available opportunity through a Bill in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to come in at this stage because I feel, like Senator McMahon and Senator Ryan, that the Minister has been here a long time.  I will be as brief as I possibly can.</P>
      <P>There is a great shortage of briquettes for sale in the west.  Anything that can be done to improve that situation would be very welcome.  I regret the halting of the development at Ballyforan.  That project should go ahead because there is a great need for it.  There is a lack of turbary rights for individuals and many people are concerned about the way the land has been acquired by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry without any consultation whatsoever with the board. There should be consultation between the board and the Department in connection with acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to use the words &ldquo;turf bank&rdquo;, &ldquo;land bank&rdquo;, &ldquo;blood bank&rdquo;.  We do not have a turf bank pool available for the future.  One Senator said today that we should provide for the future and ensure that people who traditionally cut their own peat should have certain turbary rights close to where they live.  Small provincial towns should have a supply of turf available over a long term.  I can see turbary rights dwindling fast because the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are acquiring land much too quickly in these areas.  I ask the Minister to arrange that negotiations take place between Bord na Móna and the Department of Fisheries <Col N="1149" /> and Forestry in connection with that acquisition.  There is no consultation, and neither is there any control over people from outside coming to this country and buying vast tracts of blanket bog all over the country.  I do not know for what purpose they are purchasing hundreds of acres in my county and in many of the western counties.  They possess now and are in the process of acquiring more blanket bog that may be a valuable asset to this nation in terms of energy.  I ask the Minister to find out for what purpose this type of land is being acquired.  It is being left dormant with a view to some type of development in the future.  We as legislators should know why foreigners buy hundreds of acres of land.</P>
    <P>The individual has the right now to get information and expert advice from Bord na Móna.  I do not think that applied in the past.  Private enterprises who tried to elicit the information they required for private bog development found it difficult to get the necessary expert advice in the past.  That right of the individual is built into the Bill.  That is reasonable, provided that it does not harm in any way the commercial activities of the board.</P>
    <P>I will conclude for now, as the Minister has been here for a long time and I feel we should have adjourned for lunch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the large number of Senators who contributed to the Bill.  It is quite obvious that there is a great depth of knowledge about the peat industry in this country.  I would like to refer to a number of points which have a wide interest and which were mentioned in the debate.  First, I am very happy to note that the Bill has been welcomed on all sides of the House, and I was pleased to note the praise given to Bord na Móna and the work they do on behalf of the people.  I was pleased to note too, the tribute paid to Mr. L. Rhatigan, their chief executive who, I understand, may be retiring shortly.  He has given excellent, dedicated service to the State in his work for Bord na Móna.  Any Senators acquainted with him know him as a very committed and outspoken person, deeply <Col N="1150" /> dedicated to the development of our boglands.</P>
      <P>One of the major issues which came up in the course of the debate was that of Ballyforan briquette factory.  I referred in my introductory speech to the fact that the Minister is carrying out a review of all the major capital commitments before the Department under his aegis.  This is necessary and it is now generally accepted by the public that there is a serious problem with regard to public finance.  It is only correct and responsible that the Government should take the responsible decision and review major capital projects.</P>
      <P>Senators Ellis, Mullooly, Ferris, Hussey, Lanigan and Connor all referred to this project.  For the information of the House, I should like briefly to go back on the history of the project.  When it was approved by the Fíanna Fáil Government in May 1979, unfortunately no finance was then provided for it.  This resulted in Bord na Móna's trying to raise the necessary capital by borrowing.  The board ran into difficulties on this because, under the unrealistic pricing policy allowed by the same Government, the revenue from the sales of the board's products was insufficient to cover the servicing of the projected cost of the capital required. When the last Coalition Government came into office, they carried out an examination of the board's bog development programme in the light of their projected capital needs.  This was initiated in October 1981 with a view to assessing the board's ability to finance the project.  This examination was continued in 1982 by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government and resulted in a Government decision to grant a four-phased price increase which, when fully implemented, will bring the prices for the board's products up to a market-related level.  Their relativity will be that of coal. Two of those four phases have already been implemented, which has made an improvement in the board's cash flow condition.  That would have gone only part of the way towards the reconstruction of the board's financial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second review is at present being carried out, but this is a more thorough <Col N="1151" /> review of the capital outlay on the bog development and briquette factory project. It is important that the House should note that this project was originally estimated to cost £28 million.  That estimate has now gone up to £48 million within a four-year period.  That, in itself, is sufficient to lead any Government or any Minister to request a review of the project to see why the cost has escalated, whether there is a pay-back benefit, over what period the project would justify itself and what the return will be to the taxpayer.  These are reasonable and proper questions for Government to ask and they should have the support of all public representatives in their decisions. The purpose of the review, which is being carried out in conjunction with Bord na Móna, is to study the practical return on the investment and to reassess all options and all costs, to ensure a more effective capital investment.  This review is almost completed and its conclusions will be put before Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions for the Ballyforan project in the public capital programme, on 25 March 1982 when the budget was presented to Dáil Éireann by the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, the public provision in the capital programme for Ballyforan was £8.4 million.  This was the Estimates figure provided by the Coalition Government in autumn 1981 and taken over by the Fianna Fáil Government when they came into office on 9 March 1982.  On 9 February, 1983, when the budget was presented by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, the published figure for Ballyforan in the Public Capital Programme was £5.2 million.  This was the Estimate figure then provided by the Fianna Fáil Government in October, 1982.  This figure has since been revised upwards to £8.4 million, where it now stands.</P>
    <P>I would not like to talk about Ballyforan in any concept other than that of a serious project.  I do not wish to compare it with a suggested white elephant such as Knock Airport.  That is not a correct analysis.  Ballyforan is a major project in the context of Bord na Móna's capital <Col N="1152" /> programme and, indeed, in the context of the nation's needs.  We must recognise that there is a serious problem with regard to the investing of £48 million of taxpayers' money in the present economic climate.  I wish again to stress that this Government must examine all major capital expenditure with a view to ensuring that the money being spent on behalf of the taxpayer is being spent wisely, being invested on their behalf wisely and will show a pay-back to the State and to the taxpayer over a reasonable number of years.  There is nothing wrong with establishing acceptable norms which should apply to all public expenditure. There is no doubt that there has been some public expenditure in the past which has not been successful, or indeed justified, with hindsight.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the question raised by Senator McDonald of the co-operation by Bord na Móna with private developers.  The suggestion has been made that the board have been less than anxious to co-operate with some private developers.  I would take a dim view of any move by Bord na Móna calculated not to help private developers.  It would be most regretful.  There should be no antagonism between private developers and Bord na Móna, because there is ample scope for both.  In section 3 of the Bill, the information gained from research by Bord na Móna is being made available to private developers as a legal right.  This point was raised not only by Senator McDonald but by Senators Ferris, Connor and O'Toole.  It is also accepted that there are certain areas which must be of a confidential nature in Bord na Móna's commercial activities and, of course, the board will have a right to retain that confidential information. However, the information which will be required by private developers should be available to them readily.  There should be no reluctance on the part of Bord na Móna to supply that information.  I would be most unhappy if the board was being criticised for not being open with bog developers and giving them the information they require.  I praise Bord na Móna for their research into bog development <Col N="1153" /> and I am satisfied they have an open relationship with private developers.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the board's experienced staff are available to local development committees, co-operatives and private producers to advise them on the carrying out of development works and the application of mechanical production methods.  It was deemed desirable to include in this Bill a section which would ensure that private developers would have access to information as a right.  This is a correct move and sets out the Government's attitude regarding the availability of information.</P>
    <P>The question of possible conflict of interest over land acquisition was also raised.  Occassionally a conflict of interest does arise.  This is due to the nature of the large scale operations of Bord na Móna.  It makes it necessary to plan the development of large areas as a whole unit.  The board acquires the land from individuals by agreement if at all possible. If agreement cannot be reached, the board must serve a notice of compulsory purchase.  Bord na Móna usually arrange an exchange of land with the owners involved in the case of compulsory purchase. Where turbary rights of tenants are interfered with, the board offer alternative turbary rights or allow the tenants to cut turf until the land is needed.  Every effort is made to minimise disruption or loss to individuals.  There is also a right of appeal under the Turf Development Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>As regards access roads to private bogs, assistance is available under the private bog development scheme for the provision of new access roads or the repair of existing roads to bogs.  No specific amount is designated but 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the cost of such works is covered.  The grant is payable to applicants but there may be cases in which the owners can arrange with the county council to carry out the works.  Bord na Móna will pay the grant subsequently in those cases.  Once the grant is made the subsequent upkeep of the roads is a responsibility of the grantee.  The board encourage individuals to form co-operatives for the purpose of sharing the cost of access roads.  The extent to which grant <Col N="1154" /> assistance may be available under the local improvements scheme or from Roinn na Gaeltachta for bog access roads in Gaeltacht areas is taken into account under the private bog development scheme.  A sum of £104,669 was paid out in respect of bog roads this year to date. The intended purpose of the ancillary road grants is to assist in the making or repairing of roads comprising part of an approved bog development scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the manufacture here of small turf-cutting machines. Recent developments in that area are welcome.  Total grants made for machinery amounted to £1,450,255.  During the international peat congress to be held here next year the board will set aside 100 acres which will be used by Irish manufacturers to demonstrate machines which are attracting great interest both inside and outside the country.</P>
    <P>The position of cutaway bogs was referred to by many Senators.  This is an important area and I should like to inform the House that an interdepartmental and semi-State committee, which includes Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais, are about to present broad conclusions on this.  About 70,000 acres will become available in the next ten years.  The general usage which is likely relates to grassland, forestry and amenity. I do not wish to comment further on this until the committee present their report.  In cases where cutaway bogs were used for horticultural purposes the results were not great.  The results of vegetable growing have proved disappointing.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald referred to the fact that Bord na Móna might move into other areas such as coal.  The coal industry is in the hands of private industry.  I doubt the validity of extending the remit of the board to that area.  The present statutory functions of the board are sound.  They have a lot of responsibility and they carry out their task well I am satisfied.  I do not think there would be any major benefit if they were given a remit to develop the coal industry here.</P>
    <P>The question of rationing turf briquettes was also raised by Senators.  This arose because of the energy crisis in the middle seventies.  Demand outstripped <Col N="1155" /> supply and the board had to take a reasonable decision about the manner in which they would sell their briquettes. They appreciated the value of customers who stood by them over the years.  For that reason they allocated briquettes to customers during that time.  I accept that it was discriminatory.  Obviously the answer is to produce sufficient briquettes. In view of the concern expressed by Senators I will take up this matter with the board.  I do not think it contravenes EEC regulations as suggested by Senator McDonald.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey raised the question of payment for land acquisition being slow. My understanding of the matter is that where there is a delay in payment for land acquired by the board, the fault usually lies with the legal people and problems related to title.  We are all aware of the complex nature of titles in Ireland.  In this case my understanding is that the only reason for slow payment is the finalisation of titles by Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald raised the question of of biomass.  An Foras Talúntais carried out very successful trials in this area and established economic return criteria on investment.  Large scale similar experiments carried out by Bord na Móna have not yet duplicated the success of the trials by An Foras Talúntais.  However, on some portions of the Oweninny bog in Mayo the results have been very encouraging. The planting programme has been revised to take into account the factors responsible for less successful growth.</P>
    <P>The problems which have arisen are first that the forestry trials have been on coniferous species.  In the early years these do not provide enough evidence to form a judgment and more time is needed.  Secondly, the ESB wish to postpone combustion trials because the material produced by the harvester developed by Bord na Móna is not suitable for automatic feed.  If I were to reach a conclusion I would have to say biomass is like any other energy source: success depends on using the right technology to suit the resource material and finding the right appliance to use the product in.  This work is ongoing, with the main bulk of it <Col N="1156" /> being carried out and funded by Bord na Móna.  A sum of £3 million is being provided by the EEC towards a total cost of £9 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis referred to the need for tight control on capital expenditure.  I was pleased to note his very responsible position in this regard.  It is proper to point out that the details and direction of capital expenditure by Bord na Móna are available in each annual report.  The annual reports of Bord na Móna are of an open nature.  The explanation for capital expenditure and the direction of capital expenditure in these reports are satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of the Energy Council.  Things do not happen overnight in Brussels.  It can be a slow and tedious process to get movement on major programmes.  The Commission and the Council of Ministers are very budget-conscious.  Major projects which would be of interest to Ireland are being viewed in the context of the Community budget.  I want to assure Senator Lanigan that the Energy Council of Ministers are concerned to ensure that we have a sound, ongoing, progressive, energy policy.  There are well established criteria for the energy policy which should bring us into the nineties.</P>
    <P>One of the main thrusts in that policy is a move away from oil.  Around that concept there are a number of policy movements, such as the move towards a balanced fuel policy, a demonstration grants policy, and alternative energy sources.  These are all being considered at a high level.  The EEC have a major commitment in this regard.  We benefit from the various EEC schemes.  I am satisfied that we are well represented in Brussels at official level, at Commissioner level, and at council level.  We will ensure that the thrust of the EEC policy on energy is maintained and that we can benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb raised the question of turbary, the position of ownership, and cutaway bogs.  Senator Connor raised the question of conservation.  The question of title in Ireland is very complex and has its roots deep in history.  I am aware of the problems.  My Department and Bord <Col N="1157" /> na Móna are also aware of them.  I do not hold out any easy solution.  There is no State wish to take over this land of Ireland.  On the contrary, we would much prefer to see Bord na Móna carrying out their remit, and private enterprise being successful.  The 1981 Act has given great encouragement to the development of private bogs.  Bord na Móna work very closely with An Taisce and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, who have responsibility for conservation.  Where a bog has ecological importance, applications for grants from private developers are referred to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry who have the option of listing them for conservation or acquisition. That is the present legal position.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon referred to private bog development.  He also mentioned the bad condition in which some bogs have been left by private developers.  This was true in the past.  Now we have the 1981 Act there will be a change for the better. Under that Act developers will have to submit a development plan.  This will enable us to ensure that development work will be carried out in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>He also raised the question of the different levels of grant aid under that Act, that is, that co-ops get 60 per cent and individuals get 45 per cent.  My understanding is that this was designed to help to resolve a particular problem which a number of Senators mentioned, the problem of commonage, or cases where there is doubtful title to bogland.  It was felt that by offering a higher rate of grant to co-ops, which include informal or qualified groups of persons, they would be encouraged to pool their resources, including their combined rights to the land, and thus to enable a larger area to be developed in a co-operative spirit. That is a reasonable attitude to take especially taking into account the large acreage which would be so affected.</P>
    <P>Senator McMahon is wrongly informed with regard to the direction of grant assistance.  I should like to assure the House that all private bog development will be grant-aided in any part of the country.  No areas are excluded.  All that is required for aid to be granted in a <Col N="1158" /> development scheme.  I deeply appreciate the interest Senators took in the Bill. I have endeavoured to answer all the points raised but if I omitted any I will discuss them with the Senators concerned. I look forward to the continued capital expenditure programme of Bord na Móna, an organisation that has served us well down through the years.  I am pleased to note the support the board have in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. P. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is intended primarily to stop a recent development whereby the owners of Spanish fishing vessels have been getting round existing legislation by registering their vessels in the United Kingdom.  To date attempts to register such vessels here have been discouraged by the need to obtain a fishing licence from my Department but since the enforcement of the conditions of such a licence outside our waters could be extremely difficult there is an urgent need to adopt more stringent measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent development involving the registration of Spanish fishing vessels in the United Kingdom emerged as a direct result of the extension in 1977 of the fishing limits of EEC member states to 200 miles from baselines.  Prior to that several hundred Spanish vessels fished regularly in the waters around Ireland, Britain and France, but under an EEC/Spanish agreement only about 100 Spanish vessels are permitted to fish in the fishery limits of member states and in the case of Ireland they can fish only <Col N="1159" /> outside a box the limits of which are 50 miles at least from the coast.</P>
    <P>The means adopted by the owners of certain Spanish vessels to register their boats in the United Kingdom have been met by recent British legislation whereby British vessels may fish only subject to restrictions concerning the nationality of crews.  In effect, this means that British registered vessels cannot fish within British limits unless the crew consists of, at least, 75 per cent EEC nationals.  As a result of this the vessels in question may avail themselves of British rights to fish in our waters.  In fact, proposals to that effect have already been made.</P>
    <P>Furthermore fishing by such vessels could seriously diminish stocks of fish which our own fishermen may require to exploit either now or in the future. Claims that landings here by such vessels would enhance the national or local economy are not supported by the British experience where the effect of landings by such vessels on the local economy was insignificant.</P>
    <P>The main aim of the Bill, therefore, is to provide against the registration here of vessels owned by nationals of third countries and also to provide against the registration of such vessels in other EEC member states with a view to gaining access to resources of fish in our waters.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the foreign vessels will not be able to re-register here, provision is made in the Bill for the licensing of Irish fishing vessels prior to their registration here.  Powers are also being provided in the Bill to enable the Minister for Transport to revoke the registration of a fishing vessel in respect of which a licence has been withheld or cancelled. The Bill also contains a provision whereby the Government may exclude fishing vessels from reciprocal registration arrangements with certain other countries including the UK.</P>
    <P>All of these measures which I have mentioned will enable the Government to reserve the benefits of EEC quotas allocated to Ireland under the Common Fisheries Policy to genuine Irish fishermen and will prevent the re-registration <Col N="1160" /> here of other countries' vessels to enable them to fish our quotas.</P>
    <P>I am taking this opportunity to include in this proposed legislation a provision for the bringing into effect of one of the more important features of the Common Fisheries Policy, that is the provision concerning access by certain EEC member states to the six to 12 mile band around the coast.  Existing legal provisions concerning this matter are open to doubt and the provision here should eliminate any question of doubt in the matter.</P>
    <P>There is an internationally agreed ban on fishing for salmon outside 12 miles from baselines but there is some doubt as to the efficacy of our present legislation to enforce it.  I am proposing therefore to amend the relevant legislation.  The proposed amendment will also enable me to apply controls, if necessary, to boats connected with the fishing industry, such as transporters and vessels which carry out processing on board.  The need for such controls has become evident in recent years especially in relation to the mackerel trade.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. Kiely Mr. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been promised for some time.  Apart from the recent controversy regarding the landing of catches from third countries and the need to legislate in this area, there has been concern in the fishing industry at some development with the Community itself. This may mean that events will have further overtaken this legislation and our prospects for further fisheries development may be seriously undermined.  This Bill in effect may be too little, too late and may well be overtaken by events in the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent efforts by the Community to bargain away fish from our waters to the Norwegians is a total capitulation on the Common Fisheries Policy.  While we have stated from the outset that we will support the Government's legislation to consolidate the Irish fishing industry, in my view there are objectionable features in this Bill on which we will need clarification if we are to give it our total support. The Minister claims that the Bill is mainly <Col N="1161" /> aimed at the Spanish fishing boats.  This may be so, but the effort is a very weak one and there is no definite line in the Bill which in any way can prevent the Spanish or any other boats from landing here.</P>
    <P>This legislation enables the Minister to make regulations but we have not seen any of these regulations and there is no indication what they are likely to be.  This is a blank cheque which may bounce badly on the Irish fishermen in the long run.  Many sections of this Bill refer to Irish boats.  Section 2 says that all Irish boats must have licences.  How will the Minister classify the boats which will be excluded?  Is this another effort by the Government to collect revenue?  If so, the Minister must remember that Irish fishermen are badly hit already with rising costs, bad fishing, low prices, poor catches, threats from foreign boats and crippling loan repayments.  They are facing enough difficulties at this stage without a further imposition of licence duties.</P>
    <P>In relation to section 2, which proposes to require that Irish fishing vessels may fish only in Irish waters according to the terms of a licence issued by the Minister, this is a very serious matter because by implication &mdash; and I hope the Minister will clarify this &mdash; we are suggesting that Irish boats may fish only inside the 12 mile limit.  Will pleasure boats have to be licensed?  This is a source of revenue for the Government because anyone who can afford a boat for pleasure car be considered a rich man but under this legislation fishermen who need their boats for their livelihood will also have to have licences.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this opportunity pass without mentioning salmon.  Salmon stocks are threatened.  Netting, pollution and diseases have affected stocks.  This year and last year due to the efforts made by the previous Minister, Deputy Daly, when he brought the Naval Service fully to the protection of salmon, there has been a slight improvement in stocks.  It would be a tragedy and a disaster if that slight improvement led to a free-for-all. It would wipe out the work which has been done to halt the decline in salmon stocks.  The only way to conserve salmon <Col N="1162" /> stocks is to allow fishermen to fish during the day and to prohibit fishing at night and at the weekends.  They should have a five-day week and control their gear.  It is interesting to note that the Minister said the most effective types of net which could be used were the multi-slant and super-nylon.  I hope in relation to conservation, especially of salmon, that the Minister will invite representatives from the fishing organisations to discuss this serious problem.  I am sure most problems will be overcome during the discussions to be held from August onwards. Fishermen have as much right to be interested in conservation as the officials and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be aware that the salmon and lobster fishing seasons are not two different seasons &mdash; they largely overlap.  I should like to refer generally to other aspects of the industry.  The general conservation programme must be employed to the fullest, particularly in regard to mackerel and herring.  Quotas must be uniformly enforced and monitored by the EEC.  All boats from here and other countries should have observers aboard to monitor all catches to ensure that quotas of mackerel and herring are not exceeded.  Ireland is not taking the amount of mackerel that would seriously affect our stocks.  The fishermen could possibly take more than the 82,000 tonnes without affecting stocks.  I was disappointed to read that the talks in Brussels broke down yesterday but I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that the Irish are not causing any damage to stocks and if the quota has to be reduced that would have a very definite effect on the livelihood of our fishermen.  We must protect and conserve out stocks but we must be realistic also.  A salmon war at sea is the last thing we want and all those involved must realise that damage will be done if this happens.  There is a risk that lives may be lost.  This is a frightening prospect and no amount of salmon will pay for the human tragedy, suffering and distress that will result if anything like this happens.</P>
    <P>The protection service have a very difficult job to do and they get no pleasure <Col N="1163" /> from it, but there have been serious incidents where the protection service have been criticised for over-reacting to situations. A recent incident off the Donegal coast is an example.  The fishermen have to make a living and the protection services over-reacted.  It was disappointing that on the occasion the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Fisheries, Deputy P. Gallagher, raised this matter in the Dáil he was suspended.  I want to put it on the record that I thought it was most unfair that the democratically elected representative who tried to protect the rights of his constituents should be treated in such a manner.  Fishermen should know that their livelihood depends on the protection of stocks.  They must observe the law.  There is no way they can flout the law any more than any other person. There are other areas in fishing where they can have opportunities to fish without risking their lives, gear and boats in illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister specifying conditions and the nationalty of crew members.  There is a loophole in this section &mdash; it is vague and weak and the percentage of crew members should be stated more clearly.  It also suggests that the company may register here and operate from this country.  I am anxious to ascertain whether this permits any of the third countries to register a company here and allow them to fish from here.  If so, that section should be amended.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to the conservation of fish stocks.  The importance of conservation cannot be overstressed.  I said earlier that we had been ill advised in relation to herrings, having been given the distinct impression earlier that there were no difficulties as far as herrings were concerned. But we found a few years ago that their stocks had been depleted.  I think the Minister mentioned in the course of his remarks:</P>
    <P>The recent development involving the registration of Spanish fishing vessels in the United Kingdom emerged as a direct result of the extension in <Col N="1164" /> 1977 of the fishing limits of EEC member states to 200 miles from baselines.</P>
    <P>I understand it is proposed to amend the legislation so that protection vessels can operate 200 miles from baselines.  I should like to see them operate from the baseline and not from the 12-mile limit, that they would operate from the baseline to the 200-mile limit ensuring that our stocks are conserved.</P>
    <P>Section 7 has to do with fines and forfeiture of boats and equipment.  I notice that the fine will not exceed £10,000.  That fine should be more severe.  Also the circuit courts have no jurisdiction over vessels valued in excess of £2,500 when dealing with offences committed by the owners of such vessels.  In this connection the relevant sections of the Principal Act should be amended to ensure that our courts would have jurisdiction in order to deal with offences by the owners of such boats valued in excess of £2,500 when they fish illegally.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the breakdown of the fisheries talks in Brussels yesterday evening. That is not good for the morale of our fishermen and fisheries industry generally. Judging by comments in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> the breakdown of those talks will mean that increased vigilance will be needed by our fisheries protection vessels to police our waters.  This industry is akin to agriculture and we know how the delay in reaching agreement in the talks on agriculture damaged that industry, further exacerbated by the bad weather and so on.  There were millions of pounds lost to our industry because of those delays in reaching agreement and the same will apply to the fishing industry. While I am sure the Minister does his best on behalf of our fishermen, nonetheless it is demoralising for them and the industry as a whole that there has not been agreement reached among member states.</P>
    <P>The ban on fishing outside the 200-mile limit should safeguard stocks in the 12- to 200-mile zone.  I should like this to operate from the baseline to the 200-mile limit and that the provisions of this Bill would cover that situation.  However, no amount of legislation, of heavy penalties, <Col N="1165" /> enforcement procedures or conservation measures will work unless there be goodwill and co-operation between our fishermen, the protection services and the Government.  I appeal for order to be restored in this connection and the Minister has a responsibility to ensure that is done.</P>
    <P>Overall we are prepared to give the Bill a chance.  I hope the regulations promised will be implemented.  On that basis we shall not oppose the Bill but give it qualified support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Loughrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. However, it must be remembered that the purpose of legislation is basically to protect ourselves from ourselves.  Fisheries legislation, of its nature, it to protect ourselves, first of all, from third countries, secondly, from our EEC partners and, thirdly, from ourselves.  The provisions of this Bill do all of those things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must conserve our stocks if the fishing industry as such is to continue.  In my last contribution on fisheries in this House, on the Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, I mentioned the possibility of introducing a tag and quota system.  The Minister said then he would examine the possibility of so doing.  I see real possibilities for such a system, both in doing away with illegal fishing of a poaching nature and illegal fishing of the nature with which the Minister and the Department have had to deal in recent weeks. The quota system would do away with one and the tagging system with the other.  There would be a quota for a particular fisherman or boat and the quota that that fisherman or boat would fish would then be tagged &mdash; indexed tagged or by whatever other method Departmental <Col N="1166" /> officials might devise &mdash; and only recognisably tagged fish would be used. Once a fisherman or boat reached that quota he must cease operation or, if allowed under the terms of the legislation, use up the unfilled quota of another fisherman or boat.  It would mean that a certain quota of fish would be caught by all our fishermen, subdivided amongst them and, when that had been done, there would be an end to fishing.</P>
    <P>The issue of the monofilament net is a difficult one.  I know the problems the Minister has had in recent weeks.  Senator Kiely referred to the difficulties being experienced in Donegal.  I know those difficulties only too well.  Senator Kiely referred to Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher being sent out of the House because of his concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I apologise, I withdraw those remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All our public representatives in Donegal and around our coasts generally were concerned.  Deputies representing coastal constituencies unfortunately were trying to find a balance between supporting their local fishermen and yet not advocating breaking the law.  The use of monofilament netting constitutes a <Col N="1167" /> breach of the law.  Therefore it should not be used.  However, it is acknowledged that it has widespread usage.  In a recent television debate on the activities of our corvettes off the Donegal coast, representatives of the fishermen and processors admitted openly using monofilament net while endeavouring to advocate that no action would be taken by the corvettes. I appreciated the difficulty facing the Minister at that time and I admired the courage with which he faced it.  I know the Minister for Defence found it difficult to order the corvettes into our fishing waters to curb fishing by our fishermen. However, if the law is broken that matter must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In a previous contribution in the Seanad I advocated that the Minister should do one of two things and I repeat that statement now.  Either he should legalise monofilament netting or ban the importation of those grades of monofilament netting used for salmon fishing. The reply given on a previous occasion was that monofilament netting is used in agriculture, and in other types of fishing.  To me, the solution is to ban the mesh sizes that are used specifically for salmon fishing or else to legalise the use of monofilament netting completely.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of monofilament netting is that it lasts longer.  The killing power of that netting is probably somewhat more than that of super-nylon. The advantage is that it lasts three times as long and thus it reduces costs.  The other advantage of monofilament netting or super-nylon netting is that it allows day fishing: thus we can have safer fishing and less loss of life.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry will last only if stocks are conserved throughout the world.  If we are to curtail catches in Ireland without job losses we must ask ourselves where we can create further jobs.  In the fishing industry the obvious answer is processing on shore.  This is where the industry can advance.  At the moment we export £50 million of fish products but, at the same time, we import fish to the value of £25 million.</P>
    <P>Until recently Rathmullan had been going through a bad period.  At the beginning <Col N="1168" /> of the century there was herring fishing in that area but that diminished. In recent years there has been mackerel fishing and last year harbour dues of £18,000 were paid to Donegal County Council.  I ask the Minister when he is visiting Donegal in his capacity as Minister for the Gaeltacht&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. P. O'Toole Mr. P. O'Toole">

      <P>I now invite the Minister to visit Donegal in his capacity as Minister for the Gaeltacht and I hope he will visit the little Gaeltacht area beside me where I went to school.  I also invite him to see Rathmullan pier.  If he notifies me in advance of his intention to do this I will organise a group of people representing business, fisheries, fish processors and buyers to meet him.  They will point out the real possibilities that exist to develop the harbour.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation.  I know what the Minister is doing in trying to protect Irish fisheries.  If the fishing stocks are depleted throughout Europe, the whole industry could end.  Legislation alone will not protect our fishing stocks.  The fishermen have a vested interest in this, although recently they did not show quite as much interest as they might have done. If stocks run out their jobs are gone.  At the end of the day, the Minister with the Irish fishermen, with his European partners and the EEC with the third countries must discuss the whole policy of fishing and the conservation of stocks.  Only then can real advancement be made in the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on the speed with which he acted.  I think the Seanad should know something about my background.  I am not claiming authority to speak but I am claiming some knowledge of the subject.  I was brought up in The Rosses, on an island to the northeast of Aran.  I grew up in the midst of currachs, punts and yawls.  At the top of a 500-foot cliff, as a boy I watched Spanish and French smacks as they were called in those days.  They had no engines, they <Col N="1169" /> sailed.  As a boy this was most intriguing to me and I thought often about boats and sails.  I heard the fishermen talk about the foreign people who came in to fish but in those days there was no problem about herring, salmon, crayfish, lobster or any other species of fish.</P>
      <P>Senator Loughrey has made most of the points I was going to raise.  I concur with him especially on the question of a survey of the fishing potential towards eventually doing much more in the area of processing.  I mentioned this on the last occasion I spoke.  The Senator mentioned Rathmullan, as I did.  This morning Senator Robb said he had a few acres in The Rosses.  In that area we would call him an &ldquo;import&rdquo;.  I can tell the Senator I am a Rosses man; I belong there and I speak with some knowledge of what is required for the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>On one occasion I remember making a radio broadcast from McGee University College.  At that time I was pressing, through the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for the control of natural resources in Ireland, not only fishing but minerology and many other items.  The items included cross-Border co-operation, electrification and the nationalisation of the railways.  I remember at that time saying that if our fishermen did not build bigger boats to enable them to catch more fish and to process it, the fish would die of old age.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill from the point of view of conservation.  I add my voice to that of Senator Loughrey.  We must act quickly and we must also watch our own people in their own interests.  If it is necessary to spell that out publicly it should be done.  Illegal fishing and poaching are not in their best interests.  In other words, our communications system must be geared towards educating the people who wish and those who depend on the industry for their livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is to be commended on his action.  The Bill is necessary.  It is not protectionism in the selfish way: it is justified and intelligent protectionism.  It would be wrong for anyone to think we are doing it for selfish reasons.  We have to conserve stocks in an intelligent way. If a person spends his capital he is left <Col N="1170" /> with nothing.  If he abuses his land, if he does not use fertiliser on it and if everything is taken from it, much damage will be caused.  It is not an intelligent or an orderly way to work.  In this instance we are endeavouring to bring to the fishing industry some order and intelligence for the future.  I commend the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. P. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the Senators who participated in the debate.  I will try as best I can to comment on the points raised and answer the questions that were asked.  I will be seeking the remaining Stages of the Bill today and perhaps we could deal with the more nitty-gritty aspects on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely made a complaint that no specific measures were enshrined in the Bill zoning in on specific problems. This is not altogether true but in so far as it is true, and there are areas about which this could be said, the Senator will understand that this is basically enabling legislation. There are reasons for this and I am glad to note Senator McGonagles' praise for the speed with which I succeeded in getting the Bill to the House. Up to now the view has been that I have been very late in coming to the House.  I presume Senator McGonagle &mdash; having given us a brief outline of his background which was informative and somewhat sentimental &mdash; realises the difficulty of drawing up a Bill of this type.  It did cause serious drafting problems and would have been before the House long before now if we had not encountered these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a Bill which must get the blessing of our EEC partners.  We are dealing with a situation which is totally different from that which my UK counterpart, Mr. Walker, had to deal with.  He legislated for English fishing boats and obviously nobody else could interfere, intervene or get involved in that.  I, in the same way, could legislate within 24 hours if I were concerned with Irish boats or boats flying the Irish flag, but my problem is somewhat more complicated in that I had to deal with boats flying the British flag in waters where the <Col N="1171" /> UK have fishing rights and which, together with the complication of our EEC membership, leads to an amalgam of factors requiring complicated legislation which had to be carefully drafted.  I am glad that somebody has seen the difficulty and I compliment Senator McGonagle on that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific matters raised by Senator Kiely, this is enabling legislation which will be followed very quickly by regulations dealing with what the Senator referred to as something that ought to be dealt with in the Bill.  The advice, both from my Department and from the Attorney General's Office, was that it would be much more beneficial and safer to draft the Bill in this way.  For example, if you got down to the nitty-gritty of suggesting a 75 per cent EEC crew membership as a requirement for a licence, you found that in trying to operate that ratio it was not sufficient.  If this came to light quickly then you would be in the position where you would have to introduce amending legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas and through the third element of our constitutional procedure, the Presidency, to get the amendment passed.  If a regulation is found unworkable or inadequate you can redraft an amending regulation within a matter of 24 hours and have it effective immediately.  That is the kind of flexibility which regulations give which legislation or having specific matters in the Bill do not give.</P>
    <P>Senator Kiely suggested that licences were an effort to raise revenue.  I assure the Senator and the House that there is no suggestion that the introduction of licences is a back door method of raising revenue; the licences will be free.  The reason for introducing a licensing system is that while we all know that there is no great need in normal circumstances, for demanding that Irish boats be licensed, the problem is more complicated.  We now have &mdash; which is the basis for this legislation &mdash; a threat of boats flying the British flag in waters where the UK have fishing rights.  That is one side of the coin. You can put through a Bill, followed by regulations, to prohibit that kind of activity. <Col N="1172" /> As things stand, these people would have a perfect right to re-register here and fly the Irish flag.  The end result of that would be somewhat more serious for us in that at present the Spanish boats flying the English flag at least have their catches deducted from the UK quotas in our waters.  But if they registered here and flew the Irish flag they would then be fishing our quotas.  As things stand there is nothing to stop them doing that.  In order to have an omnibus cover to ensure that this can be blocked, we are now obliged to introduce the safety net of a licensing system.  All it means is that it will give the Minister of the day the opportunity to scrutinise the application and grant or refuse to grant a licence, as the case may be.  I hope that my successor will act in the way I would wish myself to act, that is at all times to protect the interests of Irish fishermen within the framework of a Common Fisheries Policy, which is an EEC measure.  We must show some commitment there too.  I am speaking here about third countries.  You could not apply a licensing system to one category of Irish registered vessels without applying it to another.  The end result of what I am saying is that all boats from now on &mdash; Irish boats included &mdash; must get licences.</P>
    <P>The question was raised by Senator Kiely and others about the kind of restrictions which might be enshrined in that kind of licence.  The Senator mentioned restricting Irish boats to fishing within the 12 mile limit.  I could spend a long time assuring the House that there is no intention on my part or.  I am sure, on the part of any future Minister, to impose such a restriction, as anyone who would do so would not be worthy of being Minister for Fisheries.  God knows, we spent long enough fighting for what we have at the moment.  We have a 200-mile limit with certain restrictions applying down to the 12-mile limit.  We have a 12- to six-mile band, with more restrictions applying, and we have a six-mile exclusive limit, which means that only Irish registered boats can fish there.  We are trying to encourage our industry to move out beyond the 12-mile limit and beyond the 50-mile limit into deeper <Col N="1173" /> waters where it has been established other member states and third countries find a very lucrative fishery.  The sooner we, first of all, broaden our fishing base from the few species of fish we now concentrate on, together with literally extending our horizons and going further afield, the better, more lucrative and more expansive our industry will become in the future.</P>
    <P>There will be no charge for the licence. It cannot be seen as a revenue-raising device.  While the Minister of the day has powers to apply restrictions, I have no intention of applying any such restrictions either in geographical terms, in regional terms in the case of area or in the case of species of fish.  Salmon was mentioned by Senator Kiely, Senator Loughrey and by Senator McGonagle. This has been a very live issue, as Members are aware, particularly in the past few weeks.  Senator McGonagle and Senator Loughrey made the point that we must save ourselves from ourselves. That is in the context of overall conservation and it does not apply only to salmon.  In the case of salmon, for traditional reasons, this is brought to attention very starkly at certain times of the year. We come up against this salmon problem annually.  As Senator McGonagle mentioned, that is justified protectionism without being narrow-minded about it or doing it from a self-indulgent point of view.  It is the sensible, logical thing to do.  If you eat all your seed potatoes today, you will not have any crop next year.  That is what is happening at the moment.  We are dipping increasingly into the seed potato category so far as fish are concerned.</P>
    <P>As Senators probably know, I spent the last two days in Brussels in what turned out to be an abortive attempt to come to some arrangement for quotas and other matters for the current year within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.  One of the matters discussed, on which we hope agreement will be forthcoming in a fortnight's time when we go back to Brussels, is a &ldquo;mackerel box&rdquo;, which is in the English Channel and extends to the south-east of this country.  The reason for that suggestion <Col N="1174" /> is based on scientific data made available by ICES, the agency which establishes scientific facts about the availability of stock, whether it is on the increase or diminishing, the age of fish, the distribution patterns and so on.  These are the people on whom we are dependent for scientific data on which we can base policy. This box has been suggested by the Commission as a result of scientific data available.  The suggestion was made simply for the reason that 90 per cent of catches there in recent years are of juvenile mackerel.  There is a market for this kind of fish, but it is bordering on criminal for any country or any group of fishermen to indulge in the catching of juvenile fish of any kind.  That affects us directly, because we are talking about western stock mackerel, and we are all west of Scotland in the Atlantic.  The North Sea is a different kettle of fish, if Senators will excuse the pun.  It has a direct effect on our future stocks.  We hope, as a member state, to phase this agreement in relation to the total prohibition on fishing in that so-called &ldquo;mackerel box&rdquo;.  There are pressures to narrow it off somewhat from the French but, as they say in other places, sin scéal eile.  That is the kind of self-discipline being engaged in within the framework of the EEC and we hope we will get that through.</P>
    <P>We have a very serious problem in relation to the conservation of salmon. While Senator Kiely said that we must conserve our salmon stock, he also said that the Naval Service had to do their job, which is not a very nice job at times. It is not easy for them because of the opposition, the traditions and the emotive aspect involved.  I detected some curious ambivalence in relation to what happened a few weeks ago.  I will not name colleagues in the other House, but there is that curious ambivalence in relation to, on the one hand, the need for conservation and, on the other hand, the kind of shut-eye approach to people who are in breach of the law.  Somebody said the law is an ass.  The law may not be workable to the extent that we would like it to be.  There may be anomalies there in relation to the kind of nets and so on, but this House is a party to laying down certain <Col N="1175" /> regulations in relation to the kind of nets to be used.  The Seanad is directly involved, as is the Dáil.  It was the Houses of the Oireachtas who laid down the regulations. If citizens insist on breaking laws agreed to by the majority through the democratic methods of these Houses, if there are people prepared to defy these regulations, then the State has a duty to take action and to ensure that the laws are upheld.  That is what the Naval Service did on that occasion and will continue to do in relation to that specific problem until such time as the regulations are changed.  I would not in any circumstances be prepared to condone breaches of regulations to which I am party as a Member of either House of the Oireachtas. I hope that no Member of this House would have an attitude different from that.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service have been maligned.  They have been accused of overreaction and I have heard fairly strong statements made about their activities. The Dáil was suspended over a stance on this.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the Naval Service for the way they operate a very difficult remit under very difficult circumstances.  I would like to thank them publicly, not for the first time, and the officials of my own Department in the protection service who also have a very difficult job to do.  Two figures bear out what I have said previously, that we must save ourselves from ourselves. Eight short years ago the total salmon catch in this country amounted to about 2,200-odd tonnes.  Last year that was 900 tonnes.  These two figures are a damning indictment of all of us that we allow the destruction of the only major wild salmon fishery left in the west of Europe to take place before our eyes. We have a duty to ensure the survival of that fishery, not only for the time being; we owe it to our children and to our children's children that that resource is not depleted to a stage where it just dies away.  It has been put to me that we are not the only culprits, and of course we are not.  Because of the migratory nature of this species, people like the Faroese, Greenlanders and Canadians are also involved.  My predecessor and I have <Col N="1176" /> been very forceful in our EEC activity in trying to get the Faroese and the Green-landers in particular to take account of the condition of the salmon stock and to get them to introduce somewhat restrictive regulations on their activity and not only for their own sake; much of the benefit will rub off on us because we are talking about the same stock.  Let us be fair about it: they have taken note and taken action.  The Faroese today are operating under the strict control of ICES officials who are out there overseeing the salmon fishery in the Faroes.  In relation to Canada, only yesterday I raised this matter at the Council of Ministers in Brussels where negotiations for an international salmon convention have been finalised and agreed, and we now await the ratification of the provisions of that agreement.  Canada will play a very important role in this international convention. I understand from the reply I got that there is high expectation that the provisions will be ratified by all countries, including Canada, before very long.  The Commission of the EEC see no great difficulty at the moment in having ratification put forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Loughrey mentioned the monofilament net.  It has its advantages in its capacity to catch fish, in daylight without being detected by the salmon.  It has its disadvantages too.  It can be damaging to the stock.  There is no point in killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.  It is going to scoop up everything in sight and it has a damaging effect even on other fish that swim through its meshes.  I have been told by fishermen other than salmon fishermen that on many occasions where mono-filament net is being used extensively &mdash; I will not name any area &mdash; umpteen cases of fish other than salmon are caught in their nets with the fins torn off and so on.  The only explanation for that is that they have passed through the mono-filament net, not being able to see it in the water in daylight.</P>
    <P>The regulation is there in relation to mono-filament.  Anybody using it is breaking the law and will be treated as a law-breaker.  There is no point in being ambivalent about it.  We in this House are responsible for seeing that our regulations <Col N="1177" /> are observed.  I would like to tell Senator Loughrey that about a month ago I put a public notice in the newspapers declaring my intention to ban the sale of monofilament net.  There are certain procedures through which one must go.  As far as I can recall, there is a period in which one must await submissions.  I think 27 July is the final date for the receipt of submissions on this issue.  After that the submissions will be scrutinised to see what case has been made for the abolition or retention of monofilament net.  We are doing that for the simple reason that there are anomalies in the present situation.  People have said to me, rightly, both privately and publicly, &ldquo;You are prepared to allow this for sale and the Minister for Finance is prepared to collect VAT on its sale, but the minute you put a few corks and rope on it you are deemed to be acting illegally.  The owner can be brought to court&rdquo;.  That is not unique, but that is not to say that it is not anomalous.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of being able to ban the sale of monofilament net, because it is being used for other types of fishing quite legally and it is very effective. We must jump certain fences when we come to them, having established the public reaction to the proposal to ban the sale of monofilament net.</P>
    <P>Processing has been mentioned as an area of interest and great benefit to the industry.  I am going outside the limits of the Bill, but these matters were raised in the debate.  I would crave your indulgence, Sir, so that I can reply to them.  We have a natural resource of great potential in out fisheries.  We are taking steps elsewhere through this Bill and at EEC level to try to protect that resource as far as we can within EEC regulations.  This industry lacks the commitment necessary to bring it up to the standard obtaining elsewhere in the EEC.  We now find ourselves, having been a party to the CFP, in the position when our industry is not in the same league as fishing industries in other EEC countries.  One area where this is most evident is in the processing of fish.  That is not to say we do not have the nucleus of a good processing industry.</P>
    <P>There are 17 processing units attached <Col N="1178" /> to Killybegs Harbour.  It is a joy to go around there and see what is happening.  In many cases we are talking about primary processing.  It is a head and tail business.  It means whole fish are transported abroad when we could have greater added value by having secondary processing.  One of the problems we have had is that we did not give sufficient thought to selling fish as a commercial venture.  We had a simple view of fish &mdash; it was caught in the sea and eaten.  It was not looked upon as a worthwhile commercial product with job creation potential.</P>
    <P>We must start at the consumer end and establish what the consumer wants.  We must provide that fish as and when the consumer wants it.  In the last fortnight we set up a committee in the Department to deal with marketing.  The first meeting was held last Monday week.  Such a committee was badly needed.  All interested parties are involved in the committee and I hope we will be in a position to improve marketing in the near future.  Members will realise that this is tied in closely with processing.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the level of fines and the fact that they are too low. There was provision for a fine of £100,000 on conviction plus confiscation of catch and gear for a first offence.  That was increased to £200,000 at the behest of the Opposition in the Dáil.  People have asked why it is not £½ million.  We must be seen to be reasonable.  There is no point in providing for fines if they will not be applied.  We are talking about maximum fines, which are rarely applied by the courts.  It would make bad law and bring the legislation into disrepute if we had an outlandish level of maximum fine and only had 5 per cent of it imposed.  It is better to keep it at a reasonable level and hope it will deter people from breaking the law.</P>
    <P>In relation to third countries, this Bill prohibits the fishing, landing and transshipment of fish.  I have been advised that in order to batten down on the activities of potential intruders these three areas must be covered.  We could provide for a prohibition of fishing but if an intruder <Col N="1179" /> evaded the protection vessels they could land and trans-ship.  That is why the prohibition includes fishing, landing and trans-shipment.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered all the points raised but if there are any further details Senators wish to have clarified I will do so on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>If the Senator found himself in my place, he would probably do the same as I am doing.  It would be up to the Minister of the day to introduce a fee, but I have no intention of doing so <Col N="1180" /> and the section is not meant for that purpose.  The Senator asked earlier if this would apply to all boats.  Obviously, there are certain categories of boat to which it would be inappropriate to apply a licence.  The idea of insisting on the owner of a currach having a licence is somewhat ludicrous.  There are also boats which are used exclusively for angling and for facilitating holiday people, but we are talking here about boats engaged commercially.  We will have to see what categories of boats can be exempted from the requirements.  My intention is to have an annual licence, which the owner of a boat would fill in.  There is nothing underhand about it.  It is a question of prohibiting more unwelcome guests into our Irish fleet.  Fishermen will be rather worried and complain, as anyone would, about filling in forms.  It is not the greatest pastime.  I hope to keep these forms as simple as possible, so that they will not be caused any great anxiety or agony.</P>

      <P>Could I mention proposed amendment No. 6?  I said I would look at this amendment and want it to be seen that I have kept my word.  The amendment proposed in page 5 is to delete all words from and including &ldquo;boat, or of&rdquo; and including &ldquo;specified&rdquo;.  The basic proposal concerns the inclusion in the Bill that 75 per cent of the crew would have to be EEC nationals.  I could not accept the format when on my feet in the Dáil.  Draftsmen take an even more in-depth view of the formulation of words than a non-legal person like myself.  Even if it were acceptable for inclusion in the Bill, I could not accept the wording without having it scrutinised by the officials in my Department and in the Attorney General's office.  I have sought their advice on this and have been told that the amendment cannot be accepted.  To specify a percentage would not permit the <Col N="1181" /> Minister the flexibility to cope with a situation which might arise afterwards.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the EEC might, at some future date, take the matter in hand and possibly provide, by regulations, for a crewing requirement.  To bring our legislation into line with such requirement would entail the lengthy procedure of an amending Act.  A requirement by the EEC of 77 per cent &mdash; and indeed I would not be very surprised if they did not insist on a nice round figure of 76.4 per cent &mdash; would require amending legislation by us.  The House can take it that, while my own view is that 75 per cent is suitable at the moment, we can reduce it by regulation and if that is found inadequate in any way, it can be regulated for again without the necessity for amending legislation.</P>
      <P>The other suggestion which I promised to consider was the requirement that the skipper of a sea-fishing boat to which the conditions apply shall be an Irish citizen. Firstly, the amendment as put to me in the Dáil was turned down at the time on the basis of its presentation.  I was subsequently told that it was legally incorrect and would be unworkable.  The section provides that the regulations apply to fishing vessels of all nationalities.  In the case of foreign vessels, it would be totally unreasonable to require that they be skippered by an Irish citizen or even an EEC national.  To require that all vessels for fishing in our waters be skippered by Irish citizens would be discriminatory and would be unacceptable at EEC level. That situation is already well covered by the provision in subsection (2) in relation to crewing requirements.  Therefore, the amendment could not be accepted, even if put in more legally acceptable terms. The practical and legal requirements are met in the Bill already.</P>

      <P>I owe an explanation to the House in relation to this section. Within the EEC regulations under the <Col N="1182" /> EEC Common Fisheries Policy, salmon are not regarded as sea fish.  Problems could, therefore, arise in relation to restrictions on salmon fishing.  The Members will notice that the section says &ldquo;other than seafishing&rdquo;.  In other words this brings salmon into the overall regulations. That is the purpose of this section.</P>

      <P>There is a problem which is not of my making.  It concerns the levels at which the District Courts operate. There are regional fisheries boards who operate through the District Courts.  That kind of approach has one advantage in that you can get fairly quick results.  Once you go up to the higher courts there are long delays, unreasonable delays in the view of many people.  There could be a delay of a couple of years in having a case brought before the bench.  That is unsatisfactory. I have to give the Senator the short answer that I am not responsible for the way the courts are run.  It is not satisfactory from our point of view in the Department of Fisheries and from the point of view of our protection people, because of the restrictions and the delays when you have to go on to the higher courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for increases in the statutory limits governing Exchequer grant aid towards tourism capital developments so that the Government can, through Bord Fáilte, continue to encourage developments in this area.  The statutory limit on grant expenditure on non-accommodation tourism capital development will be reached in the latter part of this year.  It is necessary as a matter of urgency to increase this limit to permit Bord Fáilte to make full use of their capital allocations for 1983.  In addition, the statutory limit on Exchequer grant assistance for the development of tourism accommodation will be reached in 1984 and it would seem appropriate at this stage to increase that limit.  The opportunity is also being taken in the Bill:</P>
      <P>(i)  to increase the level of fines for infringements of the Tourist Traffic Acts,</P>
      <P>(ii)  to provide for proceedings in the Circuit Court to prevent the unauthorised use of protected titles,</P>
      <P>(iii)  to remove statutory maxima on the level of certain fees provided for under the Acts,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iv)  to provide statutory backing for <Col N="1184" /> Bord Fáilte's involvement in overseas consultancy work.</P>
    <P>(v)  to provide for the establishment of a register of holiday apartments,</P>
    <P>(vi)  to provide for the display of certain information in registered premises,</P>
    <P>(vii)  to provide for the appointment of persons, who are not ordinarily resident in Ireland, as members of the board of Bord Fáilte Éireann,</P>
    <P>(viii)  to provide statutory authority for Bord Fáilte to pay death gratuities and spouses' and children's pensions, and</P>
    <P>(ix)  to provide that remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions of employment of Bord Fáilte staff be determined by the board with the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I would like to remind Senators that the present limits provided in the Tourist Traffic Acts for capital development were last raised by the 1979 Act, which increased the limit on grant expenditure on non-accommodation development to £10 million.  These limits are now nearly exhausted and there is a need to increase them to permit Bord Fáilte to continue to provide grant assistance towards this type of tourist development.</P>
    <P>In the period 1979 to 1982 the Government provided through Bord Fáilte nearly £9 million in grant assistance for the development of holiday accommodation. This grant expenditure stimulated total investment of nearly £33 million in expanding and upgrading our accommodation stock.  Initially emphasis in the accommodation grant area was on the hotel sector but capacity in that sector is now considered adequate and the number of hotel bedrooms with bathrooms has been increased from 60 per cent to 79 per cent of total stock in the period 1979 to 1982.  More recently grant assistance has been channelled towards other areas of holiday accommodation such as self-catering cottages and caravan and <Col N="1185" /> camping parks which have become increasingly popular.  In addition, grant assistance was also provided for the upgrading of town and country homes as well as farmhouses.  Some moneys were provided to An Óige to improve and expand the network of youth hostels.</P>
    <P>Senators may recall that the National Economic and Social Council in the report on tourism policy published in December 1980 was critical of the idea of permanent blanket type grant schemes. It suggested that future policy should concentrate on stimulating the upgrading of accommodation outside the hotel sector. To a significant degree these recommendations were already reflected in changes in grant policy introduced prior to the publication of the NESC report and have been reflected in all schemes introduced since 1979.</P>
    <P>Following the NESC report, my Department undertook an extensive review of tourism policy.  This exercise included an in-depth assessment of accommodation grant schemes.  There has been a tendency in the past to look upon grant schemes as the panacea for all the ills afflicting the tourism industry. The introduction of new schemes has too often been seen by the different sectors of tourism as the ready-made solution to their individual problems.  The findings in my Department's review indicate that the implementation of schemes as originally conceived seems not to have had sufficient regard to changing circumstances between their launching and the final undertaking of some of its projects aided. The review has underlined the need for a more critical approach to possible future assistance in this area as a means of ensuring that the State obtains a worth-while return from any investment made.</P>
    <P>With future development in mind I have asked Bord Fáilte as a matter of urgency to prepare a detailed assessment of current and likely future holiday accommodation capacities to establish whether supply over the next four to five years will match demand.  When this assessment is available it should be possible to identify to what extent, if any, there is a need to expand or upgrade any <Col N="1186" /> particular segment of our accommodation stock and to consider if grant schemes are the most suitable means of stimulating any developments thought desirable.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year the aggregate amount of grants issued by Bord Fáilte for accommodation development under the Tourist Traffic Acts will have amounted to £24,228,000, leaving only £772,000 remaining before the statutory limit of £25 million is reached.  I propose that the statutory limit be raised from £25 million to £30 million.  This should be adequate to cover existing accommodation schemes as well as allowing some leeway for the introduction of new schemes if this is found necessary.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, I do not intend to make any decisions on future grant schemes until I have had an opportunity to look at the assessment of future accommodation needs currently being prepared by Bord Fáilte.  This is not to say that in the intervening period I will be unresponsive to the needs of the accommodation sector.  Present policy tends to favour non-grant assistance in the form of concessionary finance provided through the Industrial Credit Company. The up-take of loans by the accommodation sector under these schemes has been most encouraging and I would intend to keep this type of financing under close review to ensure, in so far as possible, that sufficient funding continues to be available to the sector.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to non-accommodation grant expenditure, which is used to encourage the development of tourismrelated facilities and amenities.  The existing statutory limit on grants of this nature is £10 million and expenditure up to the end of 1982 amounted to £9.3 million. The provision in the 1983 Public Capital Programme for this type of grant expenditure was £929,000.  The statutory limit must, therefore, be increased at an early date if this year's programme in tourism non-accommodation capital development is to be completed.</P>
    <P>Since 1979 the Government, through Bord Fáilte, have provided £5.7 million in grant assistance for the development of tourism amenities and facilities in the <Col N="1187" /> non-accommodation area.  This expenditure has been allocated to stimulate the development of a wide variety of projects, ranging from cabin cruiser projects on the Shannon, which received £1 million in grant assistance, to the upgrading and replacement of tourism information offices throughout the regions on which a further £1 million was expended.  A similar amount was spent on developing recreational facilities in holiday resort areas.  Other areas of major grant expenditure included angling development, water sports, equestrian centres, historical and cultural sites, parks and great houses and gardens.</P>
    <P>This particular grant scheme, over which Bord Fáilte exercise considerable discretion in the matter of allocating grant assistance to specific projects, was examined in the course of my Department's review of tourism.  The review disclosed that the scheme has to a significant extent been responsible for stimulating very desirable amenity development throughout the country which in many instances might not otherwise have taken place.  However, the review was critical of the direction in which certain grants had been channelled.  It suggested, for example, that while specific projects assisted may have enhanced general amenities in particular areas their direct impact on the generation of additional tourism traffic had been negligible.  In addition, it questioned and was critical of the involvement of Bord Fáilte with Government Departments. local authorities and other bodies in the provision and improvement of amenities for the general public where these particular Departments and bodies had the primary responsibility for such works.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to disagree with these conclusions.  I can readily accept that Bord Fáilte have a role on an ongoing basis to ensure that account is taken of tourists' needs when schemes of this type are being planned.  However, as the public at large and not tourists specifically are by far the main beneficiaries of such development, I fail to see why Bord Fáilte should be expected to carry a considerable proportion of the costs <Col N="1188" /> involved.  Funding available to Bord Fáilte is limited, particularly in these present recessionary times, and should in so far as practicable be used to further the board's primary role, which is of course the promotion and generation of tourism traffic.</P>
    <P>It would be my intention in the future generally to confine assistance provided under this scheme to aiding and stimulating projects where there is likely to be an identifiable return in the form of additional tourism revenue generated.  To this end my Department will be having discussions with Bord Fáilte with a view to agreeing guidelines for the future operation of these grants.  It will, of course, be desirable that Bord Fáilte still maintain discretion in the day-to-day allocation of these grants, but I would envisage this being balanced by an annual requirement that agreement be reached in advance between my Department and the Board on the broad direction of expenditure for the following year.</P>
    <P>I would expect that the new procedures which I have outlined will result in this scheme becoming more cost effective As I have mentioned already, the statutory limit covering this area of expenditure will be reached shortly and I am accordingly proposing that the limit be increased from £10 million to £14 million.</P>
    <P>Turning now to other aspects of the Bill, I would like to deal with the question of fines imposed under the Tourist Traffic Acts.  As Senators will be aware, the Acts contain penalties in the form of fines for specific infringements of the legislation. Maximum fines for the majority of such infringements were set out in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939.  The impact of inflation in the intervening period has meant that these provisions are no longer realistic. The Bill proposes, therefore, to increase all fines ten fold which will bring them to a more appropriate level.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Acts also provide for the protection of certain titles and prescribe penalties for unlawful or misleading use of these titles.  The title &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;, for example, can only be used legally by a premises registered with Bord Fáilte in their register of hotels.  The <Col N="1189" /> unlawful use of this title can have serious implications for other competing premises which are legally registered.  While the Acts make provision for fines in respect of offences of this nature, the actual processing of such fines can be unavoidably slow and can to a considerable degree be circumvented by the offending party.  In order to improve the existing situation the Bill proposes to make it possible for Bord Fáilte to obtain an order in the Circuit Court to prevent the use of registered titles by premises not properly registered with Bord Fáilte. This additional provision would be without prejudice to the existing provisions which allow for the imposition of fines in cases of illegal use of registered titles.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in the Bill to make it possible to update specific fees charged by Bord Fáilte for particular services.  At present the Tourist Traffic Acts permit fees to be charged for a wide range of services.  In all cases the fees are prescribed by the board of Bord Fáilte subject to the consent of the Minister. However, in four particular cases the legislation precludes the board from setting fees above certain maximum levels. These maxima, which were set in 1939, vary from 2½p for a certified copy of an entry in a register maintained in accord with the Tourist Traffic Acts to £2 for application for registration.  These charges are no longer even remotely adequate to cover the cost of the services being provided.  For example, the registration application fee of £2 at most covers about 2 per cent of the cost of processing an average application.  In accordance with general Government policy on the question of charges, it is intended that these fees be raised to more realistic levels.  The Bill, therefore, proposes to remove the statutory maxima so that in future these particular fees can be prescribed by the board of Bord Fáilte with the consent of the Minister without being constrained by statutory maxima as is the case with all other fees charged under the Acts at present.</P>
    <P>Intermittently over the last few years Bord Fáilte have undertaken a limited number of consultancy assignments in developing countries.  The work involved <Col N="1190" /> has generally been in the nature of preparing tourism development plans or undertaking some form of studies as part of aid programmes.  Countries assisted have included Zambia, Tanzania and the Seychelles and in many instances the studies were funded as part of a European Community aid programme.</P>
    <P>As Senators can appreciate, this type of overseas consultancy work brings certain benefits and can make a positive contribution to Bord Fáilte, both in terms of staff development and revenue receipts.  I should stress, of course, that there are no plans to expand Bord Fáilte's activities in this area and, as has been the practice in the past, Bord Fáilte will only undertake overseas consultancies when their staffing resources permit and when there is absolutely no possibility of such activity restricting the board's capacity to fulfil its overriding roles in the promotion and development of Irish tourism.</P>
    <P>In recent years some doubts have been expressed about whether Bord Fáilte are properly empowered to engage in consultancy work.  On the recommendation of the Attorney General the opportunity is now being taken to remove any doubts in the matter by inserting an appropriate provision in the Tourist Traffic Acts.  A similar provision was made in respect of consultancy services to be provided by the ESB in the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1979.</P>
    <P>A noticeable trend in recent years has been the growth in popularity of self-catering accommodation.  In this area Continental holiday resorts have seen a dramatic growth of tourism self-catering apartments.  Bord Fáilte have advised that the holiday apartment concept, which is still relatively new to Ireland, could be an important factor in revitalising traditional holiday resorts in this country.  To encourage this type of development and to ensure that high standards are set and maintained, I am providing in the Bill for the establishment of a register of holiday apartments to be maintained by Bord Fáilte.  It would be the intention that only holiday apartments meeting Bord Fáilte standards would be allowed to use the registered titles applicable to <Col N="1191" /> this type of accommodation as listed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have on numerous occasions in the past emphasised the need for, and desirability of, providing the consumer with adequate information.  Specific provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts make it possible for Bord Fáilte to exercise a certain influence in this area.  Under the Acts, the board may require the proprietors of registered premises to display lists of charges for rooms, meals and other services provided and may also require proprietors to display external signs as supplied by Bord Fáilte.  I now wish to extend the existing provisions to provide for a wider range of consumer information.</P>
    <P>I should say that in the matter of providing consumer information the holiday accommodation sector has a better track record than many and I would like to compliment the sector on its performance in this area.  Nevertheless, there are some establishments that could undoubtedly do more in this regard and whose reluctance to do so can reflect unfavourably on the sector as a whole.  In the Bill I am making provision to ensure that there would be a standardised arrangement in all registered premises for providing certain specific information to the consumer. What I envisage is a standard type notice displayed in all bedrooms and in a prominent position in reception areas.  Bord Fáilte would have the power to determine the type and scope of information to be provided in these notices.  Included would be information on such matters as the grade of premises, meal times, the safety of property and the rights of guests generally.</P>
    <P>I would draw the House's attention to the Hotels Proprietors Act, 1963.  This Act sets out the duties, liabilities and rights of hotel proprietors.  For example, the proprietor of a hotel is duty bound to receive at the hotel as guests all persons who, whether or not under special contract, present themselves and require sleeping accommodation, food or drink and to provide them therewith, unless he has reasonable grounds of refusal.  I suspect that the general public are not fully <Col N="1192" /> aware of their rights in this area and I think that the provision now being made in the Bill could effect a useful improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, provides that, if and whenever a member of the board of Bord Fáilte ceases to be ordinarily resident in Ireland, he shall be disqualified from holding and shall cease to hold office as a member of the board. Effectively, this section precludes the possible appointment of a non-resident to the board.  In my view, this prohibition is over-restrictive and does not take account of the international nature of tourism.  In certain circumstances there could be strong arguments in favour of appointing a non-resident if, for example, a particular individual who had acquired a wide knowledge and experience of tourism internationally became available.  Such an appointment would clearly be beneficial to the board, particularly in the matter of deciding upon and implementing promotional and marketing strategies abroad.</P>
    <P>In the course of preparing this present Bill it was found that the existing wording of sections of the Tourist Traffic Acts dealing with superannuation might not adequately allow for the payment of death gratuities and spouses' and children's pensions in respect of employees of Bord Fáilte.  To remove any doubts in the matter a suitable amendment to the relevant sections of the Acts has been provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a provision regarding remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions of employees of Bord Fáilte.  This is to update existing provisions in the Tourist Traffic Acts relating to these matters in order to bring them into line with standard provisions being inserted as the opportunity arises in the legislation governing other State-sponsored bodies.  The proposed amendment, therefore, provides for the remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions of Bord Fáilte staff to be determined by the board of Bord Fáilte with the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my speech I would <Col N="1193" /> like to make a brief reference to the tourism prospects for 1983.  At the start of the year Bord Fáilte had set themselves a target of 5 per cent growth for 1983.  To support Bord Fáilte in this aim the Government have provided the board with a current expenditure allocation of £21.25 million &mdash; an increase of £3.131 million over 1982.  In addition the VAT reduction for holiday accommodation announced in the Finance Bill should improve our competitiveness.</P>
    <P>While it is still too early to provide any reliable estimate of tourism performance for the year there are a number of positive signs.  Reaction to Bord Fáilte's promotional drive this year in the main markets abroad has been good and the level of advance bookings is encouraging.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have undertaken a three year promotional programme in Britain aimed at raising awareness and improving the image of Ireland and I understand it is quite successful.  Earlier this year Bord Fáilte won two awards from the British Institute of Marketing for this advertising campaign.  Provisional estimates on traffic from Britain in the period January to May indicate an increase of nearly 3½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Germany is our largest market in continental Europe and Bord Fáilte are confident that there will be growth in this area.  Our other major market in continental Europe is France.  The imposition of strict currency restrictions by the French Government may hamper traffic from France in 1983 but the latest indications are that it will not be as severe as originally feared.  Bord Fáilte were very quick to adjust their marketing campaign to take account of the currency restrictions and this should be of benefit in maintaining numbers from France.</P>
    <P>Last year the number of North American tourists visiting Ireland reached a record level and I am confident that we can maintain this record level in 1983.  I would point out that an increasing proportion of our visitors are non-ethnic in that they do not come from an Irish background. This is an encouraging sign showing that we attract tourists on our own merits without having to rely on ethnic ties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> Overall there is strong reason to be optimistic about the tourism prospects for 1983.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in asking the House to support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which will give more financial scope to Bord Fáilte.  Any Bill that will help the tourist industry is more than welcome.  I am grateful for the opportunity to express my views and concern on the present state of the tourist industry.  The Minister said he was hopeful and optimistic; I am more hopeful than optimistic.  I come from an inland area and over the years we had a tremendous number of people coming from the Continent for the fishing in Lough Sheelin.</P>
      <P>The area of Westmeath and Cavan has been neglected by the tourist board.  The natural resources, the amenities and the atmosphere of that area have brought many tourists from France, Germany and Britain.  When I realised this Bill was being introduced, I visited the Lough Sheelin area on Monday afternoon where I saw the fishing boats lying idle.  There had been a small number of fishermen from France earlier.  I spoke with hoteliers in the area when they asked me to bring to the attention of the House that something be done at national level to salvage our tourist industry.  I hope Members on both sides of the House will share my views and that, on the conclusion of this debate, many of the worthwhile suggestions put forward by Senators will act as an incentive to the Government to take the necessary steps to salvage the industry which, according to people in many areas, is on the verge of total collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister of State represents a good tourist area, with tremendous amenities.  Probably it will be one of the last areas to be hit by a bad tourist season. But we must remember that tourism is about tourists and we must ask ourselves: where are the tourists in this good weather?  What has happened, what is the reason, or who is to blame for their absence?  Certainly we cannot blame the tourists themselves.  I am in the licensed trade, I play a little music; we play at <Col N="1195" /> functions right across the country and we see the tourists who come here.  Usually these functions are held in smaller towns where tourists come to have a drink in the local pub.  At present they are not there; it is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>If we check the registers I am sure we would find more Irish people than ever going abroad on holiday this year.  That is true but sad and we should do something about it.  People are going abroad not alone for the sunshine but because it suits their pockets, leaving behind our naturally beautiful coastal areas.  Some of these people have never visited, say, Donegal, Kerry, Clare, Wexford or my own area, the east coast of County Meath where there are approximately six miles of coastline.  People find it much cheaper to go abroad on holiday.  I have never spent a holiday abroad myself.  I decided I would discover all of Ireland before doing so.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that more money is being provided by Bord Fáilte for tourist accommodation and amenities.  It is crucial that we keep the scheme ticking over. But we might well ask: what is the use in providing extra money for, let us say, bed accommodation if those beds remain idle?  The average tourist coming here simply wants comfortable accommodation at a reasonable cost, good food of which we have plenty, and a few drinks. For the remainder, they want to enjoy the amenities which are a natural part of our beautiful country.  The problem is that hotel beds are too dear, food is too dear and everybody knows that drink is too dear.  Some people contend that drink could not be dear enough.  Whether we like it or not, drink forms part of our livelihood, of our everyday living.  Certainly there was nothing wrong with the drink business when it was handled by the family publican.  Also functions and dances have become cost-prohibitive.  I would recommend that the House call on the Minister for Finance to take an honest look at the situation and face the reality that we are sending tourists from the southern into the northern parts of our country to purchase goods, to buy their petrol and drink.  We are diverting a <Col N="1196" /> lucrative flow of traffic from the Twenty-Six Counties northwards.  We are the best advertisement yet for the northern economy by way of revenue yield.  We do not begrudge the northern economy that revenue boost, but charity begins at home and we should look after our own first.  If the Minister were to give an incentive to the drink industry, pull it back on to its feet, in so doing he would be protecting the livelihood of the family publican and of hoteliers who it should be remembered are the backbone of the country to a certain degree, along with small business people.</P>
    <P>I might bring to the Minister's attention the fact that air flights from England to Ireland cost over £100 while one can book a flight from London to America for £98 or £99.  There is a gross anomaly here.  Of course the reason is that a monopoly obtains and, where such creates a degree of imbalance it should be ended and free enterprise restored. We are keeping tourists away from our country.  We must consider what tourism means to us, the immense contribution it makes to our balance of payments; it is ready cash flowing into the country.  What a tremendous year we could have had this year.  There were predictions of a 2 or 3 per cent increase on last year.  My heavens, we would need some increase on last year because it was a disaster.  We have the good weather and, had we been more cost-conscious, we would have had the tourists also; they would have flocked here.</P>
    <P>The success of the tourist industry means so much to the ancillary service industries also.  I would hazard a guess that hotel accommodation is at a peak, that for the number of tourists visible we are probably over-accommodated.  I am glad to see the Minister place emphasis on the provision of finance and assistance to rural guesthouse accommodation which is to be welcomed and encouraged. Allied to the tourist industry is the food industry, laundry, bedding, not to mention the building industry. <i>Ad hoc</i> measures are not sufficient when we realise the full extent of what we are losing and what we could gain by becoming once again a cost-conscious and efficient <Col N="1197" /> tourist attraction country.  Cost-wise we were very attractive at one stage but we did not have the accommodation, amenities or indeed the requisite standard of cleanliness.  Also we had not developed our amenities or our fisheries.  For example, we had not advertised the attractions of our lakes in the midlands for fishing, those in the north-Meath, Cavan and Westmeath areas.</P>
    <P>Yet, we had a considerable number of tourists.  Now we have provided the amenities but we increased prices to such an extent that tourists no longer come here.  Last week I spoke to an hotelier who told me of some friends who came here on their annual holiday from England.  They intended to spend two weeks here but had to return after six days.  The hotelier offered to keep them and to allow them to send on the money later but they decided to return home. They simply could not afford to stay here for two weeks.  The hotel in question is a first-class hotel but, simply to stay in business, it has not raised its rates since 1981. I might add that the area in question is not the most expensive.  We must face reality and become competitive.  The Government will have to make some radical changes.  We have a beautiful country and we have the services to meet any demand but we are preventing people from coming here because of the cost. We must take down these self-erected barriers.</P>
    <P>A matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister and the board is that in some areas price controls are not rigidly enforced during certain periods.  This applies in particular to some holiday resorts where there are major race meetings.  In such cases, the sky is the limit so far as charges are concerned. I have experienced this myself.</P>
    <P>When I was travelling during my Seanad campaign I noticed that in general sign-posting needs to be improved. In many areas it is good but in other places it is very poor.  I have criticised the Minister for Finance on behalf of hoteliers but, equally, the hoteliers and the people who benefit from the tourist industry should get a message.  If I were <Col N="1198" /> a foreigner coming to Ireland what would I expect to find?  I should like to come to an Ireland that would be truly Irish.  I should like to hear Irish music, experience Irish dancing, see the national games and hear the national language spoken.  When I was a Member of the Dáil I said that the amount of Bord Fáilte assistance given to hoteliers was a national disgrace because many of them have done little to promote the cultural aspects of Irish life.  Irish music does not come through the public address system in their hotels.  I am not saying that all hoteliers are guilty of neglect in this area but a large percentage of them do little to promote our culture.  People ask me why Irish music is not heard in hotels in Mayo, Clare and Kerry.  With the exception of a fleadh, when a festival is held it features pop music.  People do not come to Ireland to find that.  The question is, who is to blame?</P>
    <P>I have noticed that cups, saucers, plates and cutlery in hotels are generally foreign made.  The same applies to bed linen and vegetables.  All of these commodities are imported.  Bord Fáilte have done tremendous work during the years to encourage tourism but they can only do so much.  The people involved in the industry and the public have a lot to contribute.  I am afraid there has been failure on all sides.  We should be able to sell our games and music to the rest of the world.  I should like to see more grant assistance given to organisers of national festivals and to the promotion of heritage tours and so on.  It will not be necessary to pump £10,000 per job into this area. Some grant assistance would be most welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome many sections in the Bill.  It proposes the establishment of a new register to encourage and control the development of holiday apartments and camping sites.  I am in agreement with what is proposed in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first occasion I have contributed on a Bill taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, I should like to welcome him back to the Seanad.  He was a distinguished Member <Col N="1199" /> of this House and I am glad to see him here today in the Minister's chair.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am glad that it was initiated in the Seanad and I am sure that sentiment is shared by An Leas-Chathaoirleach. Because the Bill was initiated in this House we will have the opportunity to discuss it in detail and ensure that when it goes to the other House it will fulfil the obligations and expectations we intended.</P>
      <P>Equally, I welcome the proposal to provide a sum of £9 million for the promotion of tourism accommodation and for the provision of amenities for tourists. The provision of that money is an indication of the concern of the Minister that the industry be stimulated at this stage and that the people engaged in it be encouraged with regard to the future of the industry.  It will help them to accept, despite our difficulties, that there are still reasonably satisfactory prospects for the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the prospects for tourism generally and particularly for this year.  That provides us with an opportunity to look at the industry in general. Nobody will dispute that since the late sixties, and particularly since 1969 this industry has gone through a most difficult and trying period.  Those of us who recall the progress, expansion and prosperity that were taking place in the tourist industry right through the sixties could never have imagined that such a serious turnabout could have taken place.  There is no doubt during those years that that industry offered tremendous prospects to this country.  Unfortunately things began to change in 1969.  For the last 14 years the tourist industry has been going downhill. Admittedly, there are indications this year&mdash;and there were indications in 1981 and 1982 &mdash; that we might have turned the corner.  However, it is as well to acknowledge that there are factors which contributed to the decline in tourism here and over which we or the Government had very little control.  But there were also factors that we had control over and we did not exercise that control in a way that would have been of advantage to the industry.  Basically the start of the decline <Col N="1200" /> arose from the problems in Northern Ireland and we had very little influence over that.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch mentioned that we had lakes here which were teeming with fish and so on.  It is as well to recall and to register the fact that in the early seventies when we had people coming to fish in these lakes, these same people were intimidated and their transport often burned.  The most damaging publicity of all was the so-called patriots with their buckets of whitewash in the middle of the night, daubing their slogans on walls throughout this country.  These people have wreaked havoc on the industry by creating the type of publicity that emerged from their activities.</P>
    <P>The prospects were there for improvement in 1981, again in 1982 and we also had it this year.  Unfortunately, the situation regarding the H Block hunger strikes in 1981 hit us at the very time when the trade should have been taking off.  Last year the Falklands situation did not help the position either.  Now we have our eyes on 1983 and, so far, we have none of these factors which were present in the past two years to militate against the prospects of an improvement.  I am encouraged by the Minister saying that Bord Fáilte are aiming for a 5 per cent increase in tourism this year.  He seemed to indicate it was on target and I sincerely hope so.</P>
    <P>Perhaps when the Minister is replying he might avail of the opportunity to reconcile the points he made here with a statement from the Irish Hotels Federation which received publicity in the papers this morning and which paints a particularly gloomy picture of the tourism prospects for this year.  That statement is either true or false.  If it is true then it is a tragedy for all of us.  If it is not true then it is not the kind of publicity we should be projecting now.  Basically there were four main points in the publicity concerning the Irish Hotels Federation. They said that in a normal tourist year about 3,000 part-time jobs could be expected in the industry but that this year we will have only 1,000.  Bed-night accommodation will be down by about 10 per cent and the factor responsible for <Col N="1201" /> this is the decline of the touring motorist. They also say that the drop in the commercial trade is a factor.  They are projecting that the consumption of food and drink within the hotel industry will drop by 20 per cent this year and that is an enormous drop.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the damage that has been caused by various elements to the tourist trade over the years.  We have almost reached the point in the tourist industry &mdash; I admit to an involvement &mdash;where we have to start at the beginning and build it up to what it was.  We must make Ireland attractive to the tourist. The Minister and Senator Lynch indicated the value to our country and to our economy of a thriving and vital tourist industry.  The more tourists we get the more we help our balance of payments. There is extra cash in circulation, extra spending power and extra jobs, full or part-time.  In general you get a spin-off effect.  It is necessary that the Government, those involved in the industry and everyone else, recognise that this is an extremely valuable industry.  There are advantages for everyone if we have a successful tourist industry.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the resourcefulness of the industry that it has weathered the storm so well up to now.  I sympathise with those who put a high investment into hotels, particularly during the sixties and with the people who devoted a lifetime of commitment to building up the tourist industry and then had to face the difficulties of the past number of years.  For them, there is a significant message in what the Minister is doing today.  By putting in that extra £9 million he is giving a measure of encouragement to those whose resources at this stage may well be almost exhausted and whose confidence and capital could be running thin.  The Government believe that there is still a successful future for our tourist industry provided we can get certain things to fall into place.</P>
    <P>Senators mentioned the advantages we have as a tourist country.  However, they are limited and we should recognise this fact.  We have four advantages, the first one being the wonderful scenery, beautiful coastline, beautiful inland lakes, <Col N="1202" /> drives and mountains.  We are a friendly people and despite all the difficulties, there is still co-operation and help available in abundance from the people.</P>
    <P>We must put a question mark over the other advantages we had.  One was that we were a quiet, peaceful, law-abiding people.  I question this now, particularly if we speak in terms of the entire island. The tragic events in Northern Ireland shattered much of that and the attitude of people in Southern Ireland has changed.  Tourists should be able to feel that this country is a part of the world where they can park their cars or caravans or where they can walk in the certain knowledge that their property is going to be there when they return.  That is an advantage we had back in the period I spoke about and I hope we still have it.</P>
    <P>The fourth and the crucial advantage is that a holiday in Ireland was, up to recently, good value.  I find myself on common ground with Senator Lynch and I am sure even the Minister will not disagree with me.  We have lost that advantage. This country is no longer good value for money.  The fact that a holiday in Ireland was good value when the tourist industry was thriving compensated for the uncertainty of our weather, which is something we can never guarantee.  To whatever degree the Minister and the Government are responsible for the weather now, they are to be congratulated. Because we cannot guarantee good weather, we must ensure that the value of a holiday here is sufficient to compensate for that.</P>
    <P>As long as we have the dearest petrol in Europe and as long as we are selling drink that carries the highest level of taxation in Europe, we will not give good value to a holiday-maker.  We must face the reality of this situation.  Food, accommodation, petrol for transportation and drink for the social and relaxing atmosphere that exists here are the main components of the cost of a holiday.  As far as petrol, drink and even cigarettes are concerned we have priced ourselves to the degree that we are no longer good value.  We need to recognise this at every level and to work at restoring the balance and the advantages we had.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> A genuine effort has been made over the past few years to peg the cost of accommodation in the hotel industry and guesthouse accommodation generally at a level within which, because of the volume of trade, the establishments in question can justifiably operate.  We have four basic advantages and we should keep those that we have and restore those we have lost.  If we can do that then we will be back on the road to restoring our tourist industry.  I accept that the Bill is a recognition of that need.  The extra £9 million in the Bill for accommodation and amenities is an indication of our commitment. I hope that commitment will continue.  If it is continued we will work towards retrieving the successful situation we had.</P>
    <P>We should applaud the efforts of Bord Fáilte abroad in promoting and advertising the advantages of a holiday in Ireland. It is satisfying to know that the Minister can record that they have won awards from the British Institute of Art.  No matter what awards we win or how effective the publicity is, unless we can establish that Ireland is a country which is good value for a holiday a lot of it will be wasted.  I accept the Bill before us as a gesture of confidence and commitment from the Minister and from the Government.</P>
    <P>I accept the need for registration.  I understand from the Minister's speech and from reading the Bill that we will have a number of registers for hotels, guesthouses, cottages and caravan parks, some of which exist already.  I recognise the need&mdash;and support it fully&mdash;to display the cost of staying in any of these establishments and the cost of the services being provided.  It is important that we have the confidence of the tourists coming here.  We want to prevent the rip-off which helped to destroy what was a very important industry.  I believe the measures being taken, including the substantial fines, strengthening the powers of Bord Fáilte where registration is concerned, giving them easier access to the court, will have beneficial results.</P>
    <P>I need clarification on one point.  We can discuss it on Committee Stage and I <Col N="1204" /> am just drawing attention to it now.  Section 7 (4) states:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful for the proprietor or occupier of any premises to describe or hold out or permit any person to describe or hold out such premises as a holiday apartment, tourist apartment, apartotel or holiday flat, or as being of any other description prescribed for the purposes of this section unless the premises are registered in the register of holiday apartments and such proprietor or occupier is registered in that register as the registered proprietor of such premises.</P>
    <P>One interpretation which can be put on that is that unless you register with Bord Fáilte you cannot offer accommodation to tourists.  That interpretation is possible on reading the Bill.  I am seeking clarification whether that is the situation.  We can argue on Committee Stage.  whether it is too restrictive a regulation.</P>
    <P>I do not have to refer to Killarney, Cahirciveen, Lahinch, Laytown, Bettys-town or anywhere else to point out that there are people who offer valuable, clean accommodation who are not registered and who may not wish to be registered. Are they excluded from the terms of the Bill?  I accept the need for Bord Fáilte and their staff to engage in overseas consultancy work in developing countries.  If we can do a good day's work for the countries concerned, then there is no reason why we should not do so.  I am glad to see provision for it enshrined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I support the provision which will ensure that adequate gratuities, benefits and pensions are available to the spouses and children of the staff of the board.  I accept the point made by the Minister that the restriction which required a member of the board to be resident in this country was something which could deny us the services of people who could do an outstanding job in promoting the tourist industry here.  I welcome the removal of that regulation.  I congratulate the Minister for introducing this excellent Bill.  I believe it will achieve the task that the Minister and the Government have in mind for it.  I believe that it can help to <Col N="1205" /> stimulate all those who have an interest in the tourist industry and will enable everybody to realise that a contribution is needed at every level to restore to this country an industry that was extremely valuable to it and which can be in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time the Minister introduced a Bill in this House to which I have had the honour of speaking.  Like Senator Howard, I congratulate him and welcome him to the House.  This is a short Bill but I believe it is important.  I also welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>The national objective as expressed in Bord Fáilte is to maximise the economic and social benefits to Ireland gained by the promotion and development of tourism both to and within the country.  Taking account of a number of factors and elements including the balance of payments, the quality of life and the development of the community, the enhancement and preservation of the nation's cultural heritage, the conservation of the physical resources of the country and tourism's contribution to the progress of regional development and job creation. Whilst the national objective is concerned with both the economic and social benefits of tourism, the balance between those two depends on the general state of the economy.  Naturally, during a recession the economic objectives assume a greater importance.  Tourism as we all know is a major industry and any positive measure, such as the Bill before us, to contribute in this area must be warmly welcomed.  Any opportunity lost, whether on the operational side from within or through restrictive and unfair measures imposed externally, must be a source of grave concern because at individual and collective level the loss will be felt not just immediately but on a continuing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people claim that there are signs of an increased awareness among the public of the importance of conserving the environment.  Bord Fáilte and the environment council have warned that there should be no faltering in preventive action and that sustained vigilance is vital if increasing problems are to be overcome <Col N="1206" /> and if environmental resources are to be adequately protected and improved in the future.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte must be credited with the success of many important community projects.  These include tidy town competitions, lock-keeper competitions, and national gardens.  When we realise that almost 800 towns and villages participate in the tidy towns competition the scale of the organisation will be realised. The contribution which this competition has made to the physical environment on a national scale over the years is not fully appreciated.  All those involved deserve the highest praise and a special word of praise is due to Mr. Patrick Shaffrey who is the final judge of the competition and who has done more than anybody else to improve the awareness of the importance of the environmental aspect and the aesthetic content of the environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to hotels and guesthouses, those of us who have canvassed for the Seanad have a fair idea of how good they are.  In particular I pay tribute to the guesthouses.  We have stayed in them overnight and we have the highest praise for them.  At present very little help is available by way of grants for new hotels, guesthouses, or extensions.  This should be looked at sympathetically and grant aid should be made available for them. Our caravan parks are very important and contribute enormously to the tourist industry.  Perhaps they could be distributed more widely.</P>
    <P>Roads are very important.  Unfortunately in this area Bord Fáilte have no jurisdiction.  Everybody will agree that our roads are in pretty bad shape.  In our towns the roads are potholed and have bad surfaces and footpaths are defective. This is outside the scope of this Bill, nevertheless it is a very important in regard to the tourist industry.  We should have good roads and I hope that the surface and alignment of our roads will be improved without serious damage to the environment.  In some places whole areas have been bulldozed and in completing the works fences which are not compatible with the environment have been erected.  In all such places, the form of fencing installed should be in sympathy <Col N="1207" /> with the environment.  Where hedges or stone walls are a feature of the locality they should be retained.  The whole should be designed to blend in with the environment rather than stand out like a sore thumb.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Howard I will refer to today's <i>Irish Independent</i> which reports an enormous slump in the tourist trade this year.  The latest indication is that nearly 2,000 of the jobs usually seasonally available will not be filled.  Food and beverage sales are 20 per cent below what they were last year.  I hope that the Mitterand Government's currency restriction will be removed in the near future.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Lynch, I will refer to the area around my locality, the town of Kells.  People in the tourist business there feel that Bord Fáilte are responsible for organising tours which, understandably, include the beautiful Boyne Valley but on many occasions the town of Kells is not included.  That old and historic town has an enormous amount to offer.  On the cultural side we have ancient monuments such as St. Columcille's Oratory which dates back to the early 9th century, the Celtic crosses, the Market Cross and the Cross of Kells which is known throughout the world.  The Book of Kells unfortunately we do not have, and many feel we should have it.  We have the round tower and many other features of a cultural content in the town.  We have sports of every kind and one of the best golf courses in the country.  We have soccer and Gaelic football, squash courts, badminton, handball alleys which have produced many Irish champions, pitch and putt courses, fishing &mdash; in fact nearly everything.  Perhaps VAT should be reduced to a figure of 18 per cent <i>in toto</i> on hotels.  The 23 per cent VAT rate still in operation as regards food and 18 per cent VAT on rooms affect only the very big hotels.  It has very little effect in small hotels.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very long and detailed speech.  It was heartening to listen to him.  With regard to a member of the board ceasing to be ordinarily resident in Ireland, this should not disqualify him.  The Minister mentioned that other <Col N="1208" /> areas of major grant expenditure included angling development, water sports, equestrian centres, historic and cultural sites, parks, great houses and gardens.  I wish to make a plea for the humble thatched cottage.  Everybody interested in conservation and retaining our architectural heritage is concerned about our great houses and rightly so. The thatched cottage is a feature very much associated with Bord Fáilte's promotions. It is an emblem which is associated with Ireland as much as the shamrock. From an aesthetic point of view there is nothing more beautiful than a little thatched cottage, whitewashed, tarred plinth, the roses around the door and perhaps pots of geraniums on the window sills.  Perhaps it is a romantic notion but it is a beautiful one.</P>
    <P>While we promote tourism with the help of this emblem we have done nothing to help to maintain the thatched cottage. It belongs to history now.  It was a special form of architecture which derived from a restricted choice of materials and finance but it was much enhanced by local craft.  Everything should be done to preserve this part of our heritage.  Since the foundation of the State no Government Department or county council built a thatched cottage.  There are many people concerned about our culture and about having a good way of life for our people. They would say the thatched cottage should be bulldozed away because it condemns people who live in them to a rather primitive way of life.  I do not think so.  I carried out a survey on thatched cottages and found that very special people live in them.</P>
    <P>There should be some kind of grant given to help to maintain the thatched cottage. It is very expensive to re-thatch a house particularly if the whole roof has to be done.  A number of authentic thatched houses in each county should be selected.  They should be buildings which have remained unaltered.  Grants should be provided to maintain them and help the people to preserve them.</P>
    <P>The thatched house should be preserved for posterity.  It is a house which can deteriorate rapidly.  If the thatch begins to take the water the weight of the <Col N="1209" /> roof is too much for the house and it collapses.  It is very easy to get rid of a thatched house.  When grants for new houses were introduced in the Gaeltacht no attempt was made to preserve thatched houses.  They were let deteriorate.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to deal with this subject under the Bill.  If grants were made available for the preservation of such houses they could be included in the register which Bord Fáilte provide to help tourists.  To a passer-by every thatched cottage might look the same but there are subtle differences depending on which area one is in.  I make a special plea for the thatched house and ask the Minister to find some way of preserving some of them which have not been altered.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChristyKirwan" hpid="Mr. Kirwan Mr. Kirwan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend a warm welcome to the Minister of State, not so much on his return to the House but because of our long association and common heritage. We were both spawned from the trade union movement.  I hope that will enable him to understand the nuances of my delivery and appreciate more than others whatever rationale I may have in the observations I make from time to time.</P>
      <P>He has a very difficult job in so far as tourism is a vital sector of our cultural and economic infrastructure.  I welcome the Bill as a genuine effort to help maintain development in that important sector to a degree which is profitable to the people who work in it and to the nation at large.</P>
      <P>Nobody knows better than the Minister that the hotel industry is under siege at present.  I will not refer to what appeared in one of the national newspapers this morning other than to say that those hotels which operate on a 52-week basis and who employ staff on a full-time basis are being decimated daily.  Staff are being told with almost inexorable regularity that they are no longer required in the industry.  Labour forces have been reduced in a way which I can only describe as dramatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many of our scenic areas, the small class B hotel has virtually disappeared, <Col N="1210" /> due in no small way to the phenomenal growth of bed and breakfast units.  This, too, has had an enormous effect on the employment content and potential of our tourist industry, which, as I said, is one of the most important and vital sectors of our economy.  Whilst some fleeting comments have been made about other elements essential to maintain the equilibrium of our tourist industry, it is important to stress that one cannot develop a tourist industry without regard to the other elements of the infrastructure which are essential in the maintenance of that industry.  For example, one needs a properly integrated rail and road transport system, in order to claim effectively that one can provide a comprehensive tourist environment.  We have not been able to do this because, like the hotels, our rail system is under siege and an essential link between one area and another could very well become extinct if the full or even part of the provisions of the McKinsey Report are given effect to.  Most of us know that that report, with the serious effects of its implementation on the tourist industry, is the end product of a contract entered into by a previous Minister for Transport to produce a report which suited the arguments which he then held to be sacrosanct. The same firm of consultants some ten years previously had produced an entirely different report to suit CIE. This challenges the validity of this type of report.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we have an efficient transport network to enable the tourist industry to develop consistent with its importance within the national infrastructure. While on the subject of McKinsey, it is not too far to strike into the area of hotel management as entered into by CIE.  They have for very many years maintained probably our only real national up-market hotel chain.  Perhaps the Minister might give some indication of the overall prospects for the maintenance of the CIE hotel chain in the future.</P>
    <P>Whenever people challenge the existence of State monopolies, my adrenalin rate increases rapidly.  Reference was made by Senator Lynch to the monopoly <Col N="1211" /> held by Aer Lingus and to what I detected as his view of the detrimental effect that this was having on the tourist industry. The implications seemed to be that perhaps if it were privatised, or if we had a number of private air operators or if someone else came into the civil aviation business, that might be a way of depressing the charges, in some way helping the tourist industry.  That is one end of the spectrum.  If one travels right across to the other end, there is the Laker debacle, where this was carried to an extreme, leaving its own monstrous monument to the inefficiency of the private enterprise system and in the process, leaving thousands stranded, deprived of substantial amounts of money which they had zealously saved for a holiday in that period. In the last analysis, the Minister has a difficult and onerous task and I wish him well in his brief.  In his pursuit of stability within the tourist industry, I would ask him to have regard to the transport factor in that industry and to have maximum regard to its employment potential and the preservation of employment levels, which are now currently under stress.</P>

      <P>I am glad that in spite of what was said this morning, the Republic welcomes the tourists from the North even if it does not welcome our turf.  I have had many good holidays in Donegal in very simple surroundings.  I would like to back some comments made by Senator Fitzsimons, who should be well aware of the potential of the small home, cottage or whatever one calls it, in Ireland, through being the author of the book &ldquo;Bungalow Bliss&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the points which should be emphasised if one looks at the various projects throughout Ireland is that one of the most successful is on Cruit Island off Donegal with thatched cottages, which gives some lessons to be learned.  First of all, the two people who have been responsible for the project have been very much involved in it right from the start.  Secondly, they keep in <Col N="1212" /> very close contact with those who use those thatched cottages.  Thirdly, they feel that the advantages which they have over other cottage schemes is that they have employed real craftsmen to use first-class thatch applied in an attractive manner.  Fourthly, they are in an unusual situation.  Fifthly, the area is kept spotlessly clean and there is great attention to detail.  The tourist comes and feels welcome. He or she sees a clean place which has a novel Irish feel about it and is in a unique situation.  Those are things which we should consider.</P>
      <P>I have also seen caravan sites, particularly in the Republic, where the basic toilet requirements are primitive, to say the least, and where people using the site do not seem to understand the elementary principles of camping sanitary arrangements and where litter is not disposed of in spite of the recently introduced Litter Bill.  With regard to the comments made about caravan sites throughout Ireland, an increasingly important aspect of the tourist industry, there would be a place for a very simple notice indicating to those using the sites the techniques of sanitary and rubbish disposal.  Furthermore, the caravan sites need help from the local councils.  I have witnessed the situation where there are two bins for some 25 caravans which were until this year emptied once a week so that the litter collected around the base of the bins and the dogs and other animals used it and pulled it apart.  The only way of disposing of that litter was when a person came to set fire to it once or twice a week, usually managing to smoke out most of the residents if the wind was blowing in the wrong direction. That site happened to be situated in one of the most beautiful bays in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we seek tourists who want to stay here, we must pay attention to the tourists' requirements on holiday.  We must not be frightened to insist on high standards in our camping and caravan sites. We must help people who perhaps are having this type of holiday for the first time to cope with the elementary facets of camp-style living.  It is not that they do not want to cope, it is for lack of knowledge. To see rubbish just emptied into <Col N="1213" /> the sea is not good enough, but it happens around Ireland and there is not very much said or done about it.  Persuasion is important rather than coercion.  This can take place through example and through notification.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to make is that one of the encouraging things which have occurred in the violence throughout the past 14 years is the degree of co-operation there has been between the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte. There was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this week in which a study was made on the philosophy of tourism by Mr. Shane Belford, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  Long may that continue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the problems raised by Senator Howard, I wonder whether there is not some need to look at a voucher system which would enable tourists from the Continent of Europe to have a photograph identical to the one on their passports on that voucher which would enable them to have food, refreshment and petrol supplied to them at rates more commensurate with the full development of the tourist industry.  I welcome the idea of outside representation on the tourist board.  As we are a small country, we know each other well, and I would hope that people could be objectively critical without others being offended.  This would give rise to constructive thinking.</P>
    <P>I would go a long way with what Senator Howard said.  Ireland is in a unique position.  It is an island.  There is much beauty left, if we pay attention to conservation which was mentioned on both issues raised here today.  We are a friendly people.  Unfortunately, as he said, in the eyes of the world we have become a violent people.  I do not think the tourist industry will boom again until we can resolve our political problem in a constructive fashion.</P>

      <P>Senator Kirwan, the Minister and I are members of the same union.  We came out of the trade union movement.  I am glad to see him here today.  I do not wish to go into detail on the Bill.  What had to be said has been said.  I want to ask the Minister if he will request Donegal County Council to take a survey of their beaches, especially Lough Swilly, to see whether they are dirty or clean.  One of the attractions for tourists in Ireland must be a clean beach. We may need some type of educational programme to discourage people from leaving litter on the beaches.  Even the provision of litter bins is not sufficient. We need notices.  We need an educational programme.  We need articles in the press.  The beaches have to be kept clean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lynch was apprehensive about people going North for holidays.  It is remarkable to me that the ourselves alone principle is now being applied to 26 counties of Ireland.  I always thought it applied to the 32 Counties.  I am delighted <Col N="1215" /> that people from the South go to the North.  I would be equally delighted if people from the North could be encouraged to go South.  Recently in America I was at the Bord Fáilte headquarters and I was delighted to see that Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board were involved in joint promotional exercises. This must be a good thing from the point of view of tourism, from the point of view of commonsense in cross-Border economic co-operation.  If other organisations North and South would emulate this, we might have a more peaceful island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan) Michael Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank Senators who contributed in such a sensible and realistic manner.  I recognise the very serious responsibility I have to the tourist industry in my capacity as Minister.  The tourist industry is our third greatest industry after industrial exports and agriculture.  As such, it merits the type of very sincere and genuine consideration it got here this evening.  Nothing was brushed under the carpet.  The problems confronting that industry were stated.  Indeed, I am deeply conscious of those problems.  Whether those problems are great or small, I in my capacity as Minister, and Bord Fáilte in their capacity as the statutory body catering for the promotion of tourism, cannot find the solutions on our own.  This will be achieved only through the total, collective involvement of every person involved in the tourist industry.  That covers a very wide stratum of the total population.  This is the type of involvement and contribution for which I am looking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lynch made a number of very useful points.  He made one point which is very relevant.  We do not portray the richness of our national heritage in promoting our tourism assets.  Since my appointment as Minister, I have said at every possible opportunity, and in consultation with Bord Fáilte, that to an extent we have neglected to display the wonderful riches we have in our music, <Col N="1216" /> our songs, our dances, our games and our traditional crafts.  In my discussions with very many tourists from many countries I find that while they may have complaints, what will live in their memory and what they will return to enjoy are our songs, our dances and our ancient crafts.  These are symbols of our identity, of our nationality, that we should not push to one side.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, on St. Patrick's Day they are to be enjoyed in various towns and cities.  I have been advocating to tourist interests and very co-operative bodies such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, Irish dancing groups and local organisations that they be on display for our tourists in June, July and August when we have so many thousands of them.</P>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill to facilitate increased borrowing.  The present grants are confined mainly to hotels to ensure that the level of our existing stock is kept to the highest level in the matter of private bathrooms and so on.  The other new feature &mdash; it is a valuable one &mdash; is the development of self-catering establishments. That will have a tremendous impact in the future.  It is a new venture on the Continent because people want to have freedom to cater for themselves and we must match that to the maximum.  It has another valuable component in that those centres would be in rural areas and as a result would bring a lot of wealth to local economies.  Grants relate to accommodation and the development of caravaning and camping sites and the latter are a major feature in the tourist industry. That is all for the better because it means the industry is spreading to isolated areas.  That will encourage local interests to establish self-catering houses, a valuable contribution for the future expansion of the industry.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of sign-posting, a matter which was referred to by Senator Lynch.  I should like to tell the Senator that I have already raised the matter with Bord Fáilte and the Department of the Environment.  It is important that we have an adequate sign-posting system at the main entries to the country, such as Dublin, Rosslare, Shannon and Cork. There is a great need for a more intellition <Col N="1217" /> gent approach to the needs of tourists in this area.  I hope my representations will be successful.  Senator Lynch also referred to the depressed state of the industry.  Like most other people I am conscious that the industry must contend with a variety of problems and has had to deal with them over a number of years. However, I am heartened by the fact that since 1978 there has been a revitalisation in the growth of the industry.  Last year earnings from foreign tourists exceeded £500 million while the home market amounted to £260 million.  That represented real growth of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make any comment on the IHF remarks this morning but there was an increase in business in May, and June ran parallel with the same period in 1982.  What the hotels do is their business but I should like to state that it is too early in the year to make any final assessment of what the full impact on the industry will be.  In respect of hotels, particularly their restaurants and bars, there has been a substantial drop off in trade but my Department, or Bord Fáilte, do not have any indication if the numbers of foreign tourists are fewer than last year.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch also asked about giving financial aid to festivals and so on.  That is a problem of tremendous financial magnitude because every village and small town runs a festival in the summer. That is to be commended but Bord Fáilte do not have any means to support all such events on a financial basis.  The real purpose of Bord Fáilte, an organisation with limited resources in relation to the magnitude of the industry they are responsible for &mdash; £21 million &mdash; is to sell Ireland at home and abroad.  Our primary objective must be to get more foreign tourists here and to encourage more natives to spend their holidays in Ireland.  With the approval of the Department, Bord Fáilte have embarked on a special three-year programme in Britain and £1 million extra has been allocated for that purpose. We all realise that the British tourist has been the backbone of our tourist industry down the years.  Having regard to the problems we have, now is the time to make a determined effort to ensure we secure the return of those tourists.  I can <Col N="1218" /> assure the House that the programme is proving successful.</P>
    <P>Senator Lynch was concerned about fishing.  I should like to tell the Senator that in Manchester recently, a city that has a colossal catchment area for the sale of holidays, I found tremendous interest in fishing holiday package deals in Ireland.  On Thursday, 28 July I will be launching a giant North-South publicity campaign in Monaghan town.  I have arranged to meet a number of local fishing interests on that day to see how we can all work together to sell fishing holidays there.  Fishing holidays here have proved to be very relaxing and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I was asked about grants for new hotel development.  At present I am awaiting a full assessment of the potential of the tourist industry in the next four or five years and a decision on such grants will not be made until we see how that development fits in with the proposals of the industry and how we relate competitively to the rest of Europe.  In trying to sell Ireland today we must be conscious of the fact that the budget of all tourists is a vital factor.  Senator Kirwan expressed the view that we need major hotels here and I accept that but when one is involved in world wide competition in an industry which by the end of the century will be Europe's major industry we must ensure that we have the structure, accommodation, hospitality and prices to meet the requirements of all visitors.  If we do not do that people will choose elsewhere for their holidays.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are doing a major sales campaign in regard to town and country homes and guesthouses.  This is because there are people who will demand that kind of price, accommodation and hospitality. As I said to the IHF, this is a helping rather than a hindering policy for hotels because it will attract people to this country who would not visit it if that type of accommodation was not available. While they are here they will be contributing to the economy and utilising hotels, restaurants and bars.  We have to provide a good standard of accommodation. This will not only attract more tourists but it will ensure that those who have <Col N="1219" /> made substantial investments in this area will get a good return.  At the same time we will also be helping the hotels solve their present problems.</P>
    <P>The decision by the French Government seriously to restrict finance was a great shock.  We expressed our concern to the EEC about these restrictions and we are assured that they will be removed for the 1984 tourist season.  Having regard to the size of the French tourist market, that is good news.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard mentioned section 7. I can assure him he need have no worries because a person advertising a registered property must live up to the standard required.  There is no problem there.  Senator Kirwin asked about the OIE hotels. A decision about these hotels does not rest with my Department but with the Department of Transport.  Before a final decision is reached, I hope that in my capacity as Minister I will be asked to make a submission.  I believe we should retain hotels which have such high standards and which cater for conferences, congresses and so on.</P>
    <P>A Senator mentioned the serious problem of caravan and camping sites.  I have been pressing the Minister for the Environment to encourage local authorities to make full use of the powers under which this situation could be put right.  This is an absolute scandal.  We must put our best wares in our windows to attract tourists. Unless we do that we will all be losers because the international tourist market is very competitive.</P>
    <P>We accept that intensive tourist development requires a very efficient transport system, both road and rail. Prices are an ever recurring problem. Bord Fáilte, the hotels and restaurants are to be congratulated for the development of the special menu &mdash; three or four course lunches at a fixed price.  This will be welcomed by tourists.</P>
    <P>We are very disappointed at the tax on alcoholic drinks because drink is a major factor in relaxation for tourists.  We will do our best to ease the tax and VAT situations and keep them under constant review.  As an exporting industry, this industry should get the same recognition <Col N="1220" /> other exporting industries get, but unfortunately this has not happened so far.</P>
    <P>In times of recession prices are a vital consideration and no hotelier or restaurateur should be found guilty of charging prices above the maximum.  Unfortunately there are some sectors in the drink trade &mdash; hotels &mdash; who are exempt but I am not happy that the prices they charge are justified and something may have to be done about this.  When one sees 35p, 41p or 43p added to the maximum price of a pint of beer, one wonders if that type of exercise will attract tourists.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have a wonderful tourist industry which can make a great contribution to the wealth of the community, but it will only succeed if we all have a total commitment to maintain our open spaces, unpolluted beaches and the other immense facilities we have to offer.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators who contributed to this debate and look forward to the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann asks the Government to state, in view of the soaring and totally unacceptable levels of youth unemployment, the steps they propose to take to halt this spiral and to provide meaningful employment for our young population.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that Government Senators will refrain from using the well-worn, spendthrift Fianna Fáil policies to which they have consistently referred as accounting for all the ills at present besetting us.  I do not doubt that there were mistakes made with regard to fiscal policy over those years and that they were accentuated by an unexpected second world oil crisis.  However, if one is to examine the 1973 to 1977 Coalition Government and the policies of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Richie Ryan, one finds that under their economic policy at that time planning was thrown out the window and deficit financing introduced.</P>
      <P>One could seek another scapegoat. However I am anxious that this be a mature debate in which the horrific problem of unemployment is taken out of that kind of political arena and faced up to in a reasonable and fair manner.  I should like to see this three-hour debate requested by us used fully in debating these ills, with a view to finding a solution and without wasting time.  I would prefer not to hear the Minister expound the theory that slightly reduced interest rates &mdash; which were raised artificially by over 2 per cent last March &mdash; lowering inflation and increased exports hold out radical promise for rapid growth of employment when all the indications are to the contrary.  These improvements, such as they are, may be welcome but the crisis of job opportunity for our growing population goes much deeper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore in this motion we want to <Col N="1222" /> establish what are the real intentions of the Government in that regard.  We hope the Minister will outline in detail the schemes he has in mind to redress this tragic situation.  We do not expect a miracle &mdash; this is a deep-seated problem &mdash; but we insist on getting from the Government a more enlightened and hopeful sign than the barren, inept and totally anti-investment and anti-incentive thinking that has clearly dominated their consideration of this matter to date.  It is not too late to change.  We will gladly welcome a change if we see any evidence of one.  To do this is to endeavour to cater for the most crucial central and captivating problem confronting this country and its politicians today.  As a public representative I would not consider it worth-while to be in public life if I felt that, in this crucial area, we were unable to cope in some reasonable way.</P>
    <P>Surveys undertaken in different parts of the world have shown clearly that young people who are continuously unemployed for a period of three years on leaving school are already on the road to being unemployable.  This is a shocking condemnation and a deprivation of ordinary human dignity.  Then, if employment situations were to improve, the market takes up the qualified people at that time and relegates to the dust heap of no opportunity those groups who failed to get jobs in the intervening years. It is precisely because of this likely phenomenon that this motion has been put down.  I and my colleagues regard it as the number one priority for the country. Ignored it will be the most lethal weapon for the destruction of democracy as we know it.</P>
    <P>There are many competing agencies in the fields of youth employment.  Can we afford a bureacratic row between AnCo and the Youth Employment Agency about control of this or that training or employment programme?  Are they bereft of ideas as each month passes and the dole queues grow longer?  It is estimated that there are now almost 100,000 young people, including those leaving school this year, seeking employment.  A few short years ago a former Taoiseach said that any Government presiding over <Col N="1223" /> unemployment figures exceeding 100,000 would not be entitled to be re-elected. We are now in the depths of a situation in which that figure has virtually doubled and is, by any standard, of crisis proportions. The misery and suffering of its consequences cannot be quantified.  It is fundamentally unjust that these trained and educated young people are being confronted by the spectacle of unemployment through no fault of theirs.  The ensuing and inevitable resentment which constitutes the spin-off contains the seeds of social discontent and, if left unbridled, will erode the structure of society as we know it.</P>
    <P>The Government must demonstrate that they recognise this catastrophic situation and show clearly that they are prepared to pull out all the stops in combating this mounting problem.  The Government have the resources and democratic authority to initiate the policy changes that would begin to redress this problem.  But they must give a lead, of which there are as yet no visible signs. Our unemployment problem is one of the most serious of many countries.  A huge proportion of our population is under 25 years of age.  More far-reaching measures are needed to deal with it.  It goes without saying that that amounts to a massive task.  Perhaps because of developments in the country over the past 20 years we have now a more selfish community in which people in advantaged positions seek to make that advantage even stronger, a community in which those who have seek to have an ever diminishing cake divided so that they receive more and more.  There are situations in which groups are prepared to halt essential services to try to extract from whatever source what they consider to be their legitimate demands.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to look at this problem from a number of points of view. Firstly, we should gear our educational system for the rapid technological change and the new demands occurring in that field.  Secondly, we should develop and expand our natural resources.  Thirdly, we should revamp the building industry. Fourthly, combine Government-trade <Col N="1224" /> union-employer power in order to reach a consensus as to the method by which we can change the present situation in which more and more is given to fewer and fewer.</P>
    <P>There must be a new industrial investment policy in which the emphasis is placed on people and not on machines and equipment and ensure also that risk-taking activities are encouraged by our tax code rather than discouraged as they are at present to the detriment of job opportunity.  Fifthly, our goal should be to provide real employment rather than temporary employment schemes. Sixthly, we must consider a shorter working week, earlier retirement and, because of those considerations, a preparation for greater leisure in terms of the provision of facilities, tourism and matters of that sort.  Lastly there are voluntary activities.</P>
    <P>Our schools must be geared to the real world.  The emphasis on technology rather than on the academic is still not sufficient and is too slow.  Our schools and colleges need to be encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial spirit.  We need to show vidoes and use every opportunity to get across to young students how successful projects are generated, particularly to emphasise where such were possible in small businesses emanating from small beginnings and small resources. The emphasis must be away from the present and traditional consideration of wanting to be something rather than wanting to do something.  There are few vacancies in the medical, para-medical and other professions, such as teaching. But there is a vast range of imported products we could manufacture ourselves given the reorientation of traditionally educated beings.  I should like to emphasise how it is possible to do something in that area.  Close to me at home is a workshop for the mentally handicapped. There are 40 young people working in a variety of schemes in this sheltered workshop. Only two years after they started, they are able to supply products to local industries in Roscrea which formerly were imported.  These products are made by people who are very disadvantaged but with the help of the local community and the health board we see how such <Col N="1225" /> groups can be helped.  Those of us with good health can do much more in a more extensive way.</P>
    <P>We have an educational structure in the technological area that is on a par with the best in the world.  However, we do not seem to be able to capitalise on it and have the kind of inventiveness that the country so badly needs.  An information data revolution is taking place.  We need access to new inventions and developments. We have to reward risk-taking. Not all that is attempted will succeed but it is better to attempt and fail than to do nothing.</P>
    <P>Neither our tax code nor our industrial policy reflects the attitude of a Government interested in grasping every worth-while possibility for job opportunities. About £400 million is available for private investment but only a small fraction of this finds its way into employment projects.  Securities, gilts, insurance and finance companies are safer bets.  It is up to the Government to create a climate for investment.  They should ensure that tax incentives and other helps are diverted to meeting crucial, national needs.  Is it not a crying shame that tax concessions are given to people who invest in areas where there is no question of job-creation while employment creating areas are not treated in the same way? There is a huge market in computers and electronics.  With the co-operation of NIHE in Limerick, highly skilled personnel are exploiting the job market in this growing industry.  However, we import software programmes which are written in Europe and which could be done here if we had sufficiently trained manpower to do the programmes.</P>
    <P>Despite considerable growth in some sectors, agriculture has considerable scope for advancement.  I referred previously to the scandal of food imports.  If greater research and development on new projects were carried out, if there was greater downstream processing and if there was added value to existing products, there would be ample scope for increased foreign earnings, more jobs and a reduced deficit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the pilot scheme with regard to food technology which is being <Col N="1226" /> awarded to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I hope that this unit, with the expertise that is in the industry, can be motivated to a far greater degree.  In the depths of the last recession it was the agricultural arm that gave the first lift to the economy.  Our land can and must do more.  Its produce is worth more.  We must sell it more aggressively on the European and world markets.  We must extract the maximum gain for our country.  In this difficult climate from the point of view of investment when competition for foreign investment is so keen, it behoves us to look at what we have at home and to ensure that we gain the maximum benefit from it.</P>
    <P>Our forests are maturing at a phenomenal rate.  Now we could reap the advantage of the foresight of those who pioneered this development many years ago but what is the reality?  We are harvesting each year about one-third of this maturing crop and we are leaving the remainder to choke our forests.  As a nation we spend about £350 million on timber imports excluding furniture but it is estimated that 86 per cent of imports could be manufactured or processed at home.  The British import about 75 per cent of their timber requirements and the EEC import about 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>In an area where we have a surplus product, in a market where we already have trade agreements and where massive imports are required we have failed to grasp the possibilities.  Faced with this gilt-edged opportunity in terms of jobs and foreign earnings in respect of a native resource which is ever-renewing, we stagnate. I will never understand the attitude of the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture and Forestry with regard to this matter.  It is not possible to divorce an economic policy from a jobs policy.  Because of our young, growing population, these two areas have to be intertwined.  In our dire economic situation it is not possible to ignore the potential of our resources, particularly when we pay huge sums for imports.</P>
    <P>In the matter of Government contracts we have huge purchases each year.  I know that a substantial amount of Government requirements are imported. <Col N="1227" /> There is much talk about the provision of jobs and the development of our natural resources but, at the same time, we continue to import vast quantities of commodities.</P>
    <P>In the area of fisheries, European countries have ensured that for every job at sea they have five or six in the processing sector.  The opposite is the position here: for every job at sea, we have only one job in the processing sector.  The absence of a coherent common fisheries policy has frustrated some of our efforts. We must convert our renewing resources over which we have control to ensure that the maximum number of jobs are provided.</P>
    <P>The Government have considerable funds at their disposal for youth employment projects.  I ask the Minister of State not to allow this fund which was created by the 1 per cent levy to replace gradually the European Social Fund in respect of training.  I ask him also to ensure that the Government do not continue to use the fund to replace existing Exchequer supports, thereby leaving only minimal resources available for necessary and worthwhile youth employment projects. There is some evidence that the Government are using the fund to ease the burden on the Exchequer.  I regard this as virtually criminal.  Levies are a notoriously unfair means of taxation.  They do not take into account one's ability to pay. If there can be any justification for hard measures, it can only be that the moneys accruing to the State will be devoted exclusively to dealing with the youth unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in looking at the variety of schemes to be undertaken, both in training and in employment, not to come up with metropolitan temporary employment schemes only.  There is merit in training and temporary employment in those situations where schemes of that nature are employed.  Many of them have done a lot of good.  Young people have been prepared and as a result have been able to go into gainful and remunerative employment.  In my home town of Roscrea the local school teacher and a small committee, blending their <Col N="1228" /> ideas and with the co-operation of the youth employment scheme, provided very worthwhile temporary job opportunities in the reconstruction of Damer House and the development of a heritage centre.  This development, together with giving employment, has aroused a wonderful interest in local history and culture and will afford, to a new generation, the opportunity to know and to understand, to a far greater degree than any school could give, local history in the widest possible context.</P>
    <P>What I was getting at, when referring to the temporary nature of much of that work, was to ask the Minister to be more adventurous in his approach and to consider establishing youth industrial co-operatives. We have lying dormant in many parts of the country, factory bays, halls and other facilities which could be used for a variety of co-operatives, for the preparation, development and processing of small products.  We have vast resources in terms of untapped brain power with no real encouragement for adventure or risk taking.  I do not mind whether it is the preparation of a regional cheese or preserving lamb to reach the delicatessen, or whatever other local outlets there might be, so long as we consider worthwhile schemes where the initiative of individuals would be tapped.  If we give some encouragement to investment of that kind, young people themselves will come up with other solutions.</P>
    <P>None of us expects solutions overnight or dramatic changes but we want to see it tackled in a way in which young people will know that there is a real interest in the problem and that whatever the difficulties, the community as a whole, led by the Government which have the democratic power and authority, are approaching this in a constructive and fair way.</P>
    <P>One has only to remember what was possible in relation to Bailey's Cream. An industry was about to close and people, pooling their resources and coming together, came up with an idea.  I was proud as Minister of State to see at the Green Fair in Berlin the extent to which this product of only a few years old had penetrated the world market.  I do not recall the thousands of cases that were <Col N="1229" /> sold in that week alone but it is indicative of what is possible when we have belief in ourselves and where we use the organs of the State and the facilities which are there to encourage people to find solutions for themselves.  We have an historical and undue reliance on somebody else to do things for us and we must try to change that.  Young people especially will respond when interest is shown.</P>
    <P>We must promote the idea of reducing working time, early retirement and voluntary schemes which open up the possibility of spreading the available pool of jobs to the greatest number of people possible.</P>
    <P>In order that these schemes should prosper, there will inevitably have to be a marked change of attitude on the part of trade unions, employers and the Government.  Trade unions place greater emphasis on more money for fewer people.  The Taoiseach stated that the recent wage agreement will cost between 5,000 and 10,000 jobs.  Where is the leadership there?  The problem is identified but there is no will to find the solution. The soaring tax bill and the glaring inequities in that system make the trade union problems more difficult but Government action would help.  However, the obligation to look seriously at their policies and to work out a cohesive union policy rests with the trade union movement.  They must recognise their responsibility and be assisted in every way in promoting a less greedy and less selfish, ever-demanding attitude from those of us who are lucky to have employment and sometimes gaining ground at the expense of those whose future employment rests in the balance.</P>
    <P>Employers, too, have a vital role. Wealth and property ownership bring in their train a heavy responsibility to use these resources in every way that will facilitate maximum employment.  The Government must look at the way they penalise both employee and employer with PRSI and other levies.  Some consideration must be given to this area and a little will help.  The Government have huge sums of money available to them through social welfare contributions and there must be scope for encouraging <Col N="1230" /> change here.  The black economy has grown.  We have estimates of what it is in some European countries but we do not know exactly its extent here although if one looks at the devastating spectacle of drug pushing and the dire consequences for so many of our young people, we can understand the aspect of this side of our economy.  There seems to be a grudging admiration for people who evade the courts or their tax liability.  The tendency to consider a person so engaged as some kind of a hero must end.  I refer specifically to the drug scene because there is mounting frustration among our young people with so little opportunity for work.  This leaves them easy prey to drug pushers.</P>
    <P>The educational system, despite the changes over the last ten years, has not succeeded in redressing the disadvantages of many of the working class and poor people.  They suffer more from this additional problem because of no job opportunities.  By the end of this year one out of every two who traditionally worked in the building industry over the last couple of years will be unemployed. All the indications are that this most vital organ of our economy is still on the decline.  Cement sales are down, investment is down and the queue of building workers, trained and untrained, grows longer.  Our housing needs are immense and one has only to meet young couples at the weekend to know the misery that many families have to endure.</P>
    <P>As well as public funds being necessary, we have to re-jig the incentives in investment policies to ensure that far more private investment is encouraged into this growth area.  Can we, in all conscience, tell young people that they must wait until the world economy recovers before they have any hope of a job?  Is this facing reality?  Studies have shown that, even with a significant increase in economic growth, the present rate of unemployment could perhaps only be halved.</P>
    <P>In America some researchers have come up with the fatalistic view that one-third of the children now growing up will never work, a further third will <Col N="1231" /> work full time until they reach 50 years of age and the remaining third will work for about two days per week.  These prognostications may prove false but new technology is increasingly reducing the need for man effort.  This scientific revolution is with us and it is there to stay.  Is technology, without social advance, only bringing misery?  Over 50 per cent of the jobs coming on stream in this scheme were not known 15 years ago.  Today we do not know what the vast majority of job opportunities in the technological area will be by the end of this century. How do we manage this change?  Will our educational system, which is only beginning to look like moving in the direction of providing a more flexible, adaptable and less conservative approach, cope with these problems?  A still more radical approach is needed.  Only by reaching to this potential will we have the kind of skilled personnel to match the ever-changing employment opportunities.  We need to continue evaluation of the skills of our unemployed so that instead of dumping people on the unemployment dust heap we will be in a position to divert resources to meet their needs.  Their skills and techniques must be harnessed.  When will we face up to the demoralising, undignified social welfare code which paralyses people?  Hundreds of millions are spent each year on dole and unemployment benefits.  With a little topping up it could be diverted into very necessary and worthwhile community schemes.  Ask any young person who stands in an unemployment queue what his wishes are?  The system will always be necessary to cater for the needy, but let us open the door to incentives and work schemes.</P>
    <P>When money was much scarcer than it is today progressive Governments saw the need to contain unemployment.  They were prepared to undertake even marginal economic schemes for the sake of employment.  The Coalition Government talk about productive employment.  I would also if I were in a Utopian situation but we are not.  In the meantime the best part of £700 million will be spent soaking <Col N="1232" /> the last dregs of initiative away from a huge percentage of our population.</P>
    <P>We have to seek the ideas of everybody. Things have to be worked out. Surveys have to be carried out and preparations made for tackling the transitional period between unemployment and employment.  Do we as a community have to be paid for everything we do? There are vast opportunities for voluntary endeavour and community co-operative work in the provision of amenities and so on.  Do we value work without pay, the kind of tradition which formed part of our culture, neighbourliness, helping lonely elderly people?  Am I naive even to introduce it into the debate?  Does work without payment enhance society or are we getting so bound up in ourselves that there is no room for the community obligation?</P>
    <P>I suggest that we have to make a greater effort to put all the fragmented pieces of the bureaucratic machine together, find what is needed and act immediately.  There are too many organisations fighting for the top dog positions and some will have to give way to follow a more co-ordinated and less wasteful approach to finding a solution.  My theme is that there is plenty of work but not sufficient jobs.  There are so many people out of work and so much work to be done and the question is: how do we match the two?  Is life about earning a living or spending a living?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second this motion on behalf of my party.  It is not with any great pleasure I do so.  As far back as 1978 we realised that half of our population were under 25 years of age. Many politicians readily seized the opportunity to slot that figure and those age groups of young people into many speeches which all parties made at that time without stopping to realise what it really meant.  What it meant has been too plainly proved to all of us in public life since it was with this in mind that my party signed our names to the motion. Our attendance here this evening confirms the unhappy truth of what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people believe that politicians <Col N="1233" /> have very little understanding of their problems.  Many of them feel that we have abandoned them.  This is not true. Many steps have been taken by successive Governments to ease the problem of youth employment.  Millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been spent in various schemes.  I have reservations, which I am sure are shared by many of my colleagues, about these schemes.  It is time we looked at some of them to see how they operate in practice.  If we are spending millions of pounds of taxpayers money, and since all aspects of that money are being looked into so closely, we might take a look at these agencies also.</P>
    <P>National Manpower operate a work experience programme.  A young person is taken into a business and his or her wages are paid in return for work experience.  Perhaps this young person will eventually get a full-time job.  But, in the end, is this all only in theory?  I have experience of dealing with some of the young people who have taken these six months work experience courses.  The end result has sometimes been good. However, in practice there are some employers who abuse the system.  Many young people involved in the system are being used as cheap labour.  The money is provided by the Department of Labour for the scheme.  The young people are let go after six months and replaced by other young people.</P>
    <P>Do these young people really benefit from the scheme?  I questioned the Minister for Labour who was also Minister in the previous Coalition Government &mdash; when he brought in the Youth Employment Agency Bill.  In this atmosphere of doom and gloom some of the young people are a breath of fresh air.  They do not see the bad position the country is in. They seem to think there may be a way out and that in some years ahead there may be a job.  There are still dedicated young people with some of the old ideals. I was in contact with some of them recently in regard to the preparatory work and official opening of a new youth centre in Ennis.  It was under the AnCo community youth training programme.  It was a complete success because the right <Col N="1234" /> man was in charge of it from beginning to end.  It was the renovation of an old national school.  It was officially opened about two weeks ago by the Taoiseach. I might put on record that the Taoiseach did not give the money for it &mdash; it was given by Fianna Fáil &mdash; but he performed the official opening.</P>
    <P>Father Seán Sexton was in charge of that project.  He was close to the whole project from beginning to end.  I would be worried about a project in another area if there was not the same commitment by a man like Father Sexton.  In another constituency where an identical project was undertaken it did not work as well as the one in Clare because I understand there was not sufficient check.  We have the right type of supervisors in AnCO.  That might be something the Minister might talk about to his colleagues in the other Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour spoke last week about the Cabinet task force on employment which is to bring a co-ordinated and integrated approach to the problem.  Later in his speech he said AnCO will train 34,000 people in the current year.  Presumably many of these will be for the building trade.  There are no jobs in the building trade today.  I hope the Minister is not pinning too much hope in that particular field.  I would like to refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week on Aer Lingus.  It stated that job sharing is working successfully in Aer Lingus.  Job sharing could increase the number of jobs in other areas.</P>
    <P>There are a number of jobs that unemployed people do not hear of under the present manpower system.  I would suggest that the Minister consider a system of walk-in centres where all the current vacancies would be on display.  He will say that there are no vacancies, but maybe a teacher who cannot get an appointment might be very glad to get work in another field.  The same would apply to a carpenter or any other category of worker.  This would eliminate a great deal of bureaucracy and filling of forms, and there would be notification only if a vacancy occurred in the area of qualification stated on the form.  Under the present system a teacher is notified only of a <Col N="1235" /> teacher vacancy.  A small shop might be the ideal location for such a centre. Young people are discouraged by complicated procedure and faceless institutions and in this country &mdash; it is small enough &mdash; we should have a simple procedure on a personal basis without layers of bureaucracy.  We are talking about youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the young people think of our readiness to call in high-powered consultants &mdash; most of them foreign &mdash; to analyse our problems on youth unemployment. We are well able to do it here ourselves.  We do not need any foreign consultants.  It seems that a prophet is not without honour, save in his own country. I am worried about the number of young people who may never get jobs.  All politicians must see a very serious problem here which is the responsibility of the Government and even I will give them a hand, if I can do so, to solve it.</P>
    <P>I understand that funding of sport activities was reduced this year by £100,000.  If that is correct it is the worst year possible to reduce the funding of sports activities.  Young people may go out and get into trouble if they have no jobs and no activities to occupy their time.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to return that £100,000 to the Minister of State at the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There is a new realism among young people.  They can take the truth and they have a right to a clear, simple explanation of economic, social and human problems. They are not interested in this Government blaming manifestos or <i>The Way Forward.</i>  They are not interested in us criticising the Government for not creating jobs.</P>
    <P>Young people want to see us politicians working together.  They are surprised at our quickness to see difficulties and our slowness to grasp opportunities.  They are daring and they think we should adopt the same attitude.  The youth of today might well respond to a genuine effort on our part to help them.  It has been said that tough minds and tender hearts get results.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that on something as important <Col N="1236" /> as this our contributions are confined to 15 minutes.  In dealing with the nation's problems, we should give priority to youth unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I congratulate him on his efforts to date in the short time that he is in that Ministry and the work that he has achieved in that time.  I am glad of the opportunity to point out that this Government have a commitment to youth.  In 1981 while temporarily out of office our work in that regard was put in abeyance but we are glad that at the end of the next four years we will see a remedy to this problem that preoccupies all our minds, not only as politicians but also in many instances as parents, of the future for our young and growing population.</P>
      <P>Youth unemployment is the most important and pressing problem.  This Government recognise that we must face up to this challenge.  Commentators on the question have said that this growing population will accept unemployment on a temporary basis but they cannot continue to live in hope without some sort of reaction, and I hope that in the next four years the fears that may be latent within the young population can be abated and that worth-while and constructive opportunities for employment can be provided. It was this Government who first proposed a new, radical approach to the question of youth unemployment when they legislated for the creation of the Youth Employment Agency in 1981 which was inaugurated in March 1982.  It was an attempt to deal with a problem which had been identified previously. Senator Honan said that many foreign consultants had been employed in the past but I should like to tell her that as far back as 1980 a report on youth unemployment was published by the Manpower Consultative Committee.  Its findings were very rewarding.  Nobody can quibble because Manpower is an Irish agency.  Its work in finding employment for young people has been recognised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator said that all research into unemployment was done by foreign consultants.  What I said was that as far back as 1980 Manpower published the first worth-while report on youth unemployment.  One of the important findings of that report was that most of the disadvantaged people did not come in contact with any official employment agency.  We have no idea of the number of people involved, their skills or capabilities. They were included in the unemployment registers but we had no idea of their needs.  The Youth Employment Agency regarded such people as priority cases for places in future training such as AnCO work experience programmes.</P>
      <P>Our population is growing faster than any other European country and our working population is increasing at twice the rate of any other European country. We are faced with a problem because we have no industrial base in which to absorb this population.  The old safety valves of the civil service and emigration are gone. We must acknowledge the fact that 48 per cent of the population are under the age of 25.  The number of school leavers has increased from 50,000 in 1971 to 70,000 this year.  The Government must provide jobs at an increasing rate.</P>
      <P>Some people suggest that we should look to emigration again.  I and the Government totally reject that as a remedy for our present situation.  The future of the country lies in our youth.  If young people emigrate not only do we lose them but we also lose their skills.  The money we spent on educating and training them goes to benefit some other country.  We must employ our young people in our own country.</P>
      <P>Like other countries suffering from recession, our unemployment has increased sharply.  Young people are the most vulnerable.  The rate of young unemployed far exceeds that of adult unemployed.  There are more people looking for work than there are jobs and this is most demoralising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are facing the challenge but they cannot tackle the problem <Col N="1238" /> in isolation.  The resources available to the Government must be channelled into paying back foreign borrowings which were incurred over the years.  Many of our present misfortunes must be placed at the feet of the Opposition.  It is reckoned that most of the money received from the PAYE sector is used to repay the interest on foreign borrowings. It is a pity that this money must leave the country when we could use it to create jobs for our young unemployed.</P>
    <P>Much abuse was made of the money which was borrowed in that it was not used for productive purposes or to create employment.  With the establishment of the Employment Task Force and the National Planning Board the Government are initiating employment generating prospects.  The 1 per cent levy which is used to finance the Youth Employment Agency yielded £38 million in 1982 and £77 million in the current year.  This will go some way towards creating employment for young people.</P>
    <P>Many youth employment schemes will be initiated in the coming year.  It is hoped to increase the number employed from 32,000 in 1982 to 45,000 in the coming year.  In many cases the employment is not continuous but it gives those young people an opportunity to gain work experience.</P>
    <P>Many people mentioned agriculture, fishing and forestry as areas which could provide job opportunities.  Here, too, we are faced with great difficulties such as surpluses of food.  As a result of the recession we find ourselves in markets oversupplied with many of the commodities which are our basic selling commodities. It is up to the National Planning Board and the task force to seek out new opportunities in those sectors.  New products, new scientific measures of producing them and value added to the processes will have to be found if we are to use these basic raw materials as an opportunity to create greater employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Very recently at the meeting in Stuttgart the Taoiseach and many <Col N="1239" /> of our Ministers who represented us there won for Ireland a very important worth-while scheme whereby not only has our problem been recognised but we are now listed among one of six super-priority regions within the EEC for which additional funds will be made available for the creation of employment.  Two very important things have come from that. One is that 40 per cent of the Social Fund has been allocated to the creation of employment.  Secondly, Ireland is included as one of those super designated areas within the EEC and must benefit largely by that.  The important aspect is that 75 per cent of the Social Fund will be allocated to the sector with which we are dealing, the unemployed under the age of 25 years.  It is important, therefore, that we can expect in the near future a further involvement in training schemes, in youth employment and temporary employment schemes.  Solving the problem of the unemployed cannot be done by the Government alone.  It needs the co-operation of all people involved in youth administration, youth education and the voluntary youth organisations. They have a very valuable part to play at local level.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Education's intention to reorganise the curriculum whereby people will in future be educated for work rather than having the present educational structure under which, when young people do the leaving certificate, they have no basis on which to seek valuable future employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the call for action on this matter.  It is undoubtedly the most pressing problem that faces the country at present.  If it is not solved it will certainly lead to far-reaching consequences, economically and socially.  In saying that, it would be quite impossible to exaggerate the consequences which will follow if this question of unemployment in general and of young people in particular is not tackled and solved.  In urging the Government to act in this respect I am not suggesting that there is any easy solution and certainly not that I can offer to them a comprehensive <Col N="1240" /> solution to the problem. However, it must be realised that I have not been given the task of solving this problem whereas the Government have. That extends to the Members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in this House who combine to form the present Government.</P>
      <P>I would urge them, in speaking on this measure, not to be talking to somebody away out there but to be thinking in terms of the fact that they form the Government of the present time and should be saying what should be done, not merely advocating it to somebody for whom they would appear to have no responsibility. No Government which fails to solve this problem could hope to remain in office for very long.  No Government which fails to solve the problem would deserve to remain in office for very long.  It is the acid test by which any Government can be judged while this problem still exists.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the views of most economists at present &mdash; and most of the statistics which they produce appear to bear this out &mdash; give little hope for an improvement of the situation in the immediate future.  The report carried in today's papers from the OECD, while predicting a lifting of the recession over the next year and that there would be improved production, improved sales, improved international trade, still predicts rising unemployment over the next year or two.  One of the rather depressing things about the commentary from the Confederation of Irish Industry, which also came out in the last day or two, is that it shows that the capacity utilisation in our average factory at present is only something like 60 per cent.  That means that even with an improvement in the economic situation the average factory can more than improve, increase its output by more than 50 per cent without having to take on any extra staff.  That shows the problem which exists at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most indications suggest that unless some very far-reaching solution is found unemployment will persist for the next few years.  In fact, the OECD report says that in Europe unemployment will move up from 16 million to 20 million.  That <Col N="1241" /> will give an unemployment rate of something like 12 per cent for the whole of Europe.  In the case of Ireland they are even more pessimistic.  They say that over the next year our unemployment rate will rise from 13½ per cent to 15¾ per cent and that we will have 220,000 unemployed in 1984 as compared with the present figure of something around 189,000.  That is their prediction.  Whereas it is something which has to be considered and which is very pessimistic, we do not have to take it for granted that it is going to be exactly right.  It is up to the Governments of this and every country to show the economists that they are not entirely powerless, that they can do something in this matter, that the position is not totally hopeless.  Certainly, that is something which our Government must endeavour to do.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why the unemployment situation appears to be so bad is that many of the firms which have survived the recession of the last year or so have done so by the introduction of capital intensive methods, by cutting down on employees, by introducing labour-saving methods.  The result of that is that when the recession lifts and when these firms which have introduced these methods go back into full production again, they will be doing so with much lower staff numbers than they had before the recession.  That, of course, is a reason why instead of full or increased employment following increased production and increased international trade, in fact there will not be that relation between the two.</P>
    <P>The State of industrial relations in this country has undoubtedly contributed to our unemployment problem.  There is no doubt a continuous succession of strikes, and unofficial strikes in particular, and the continuous hassle in industrial relations have caused a good deal of difficulty to firms and resulted in an inordinate amount of time being taken up by management in trying to deal with these problems, time which should have been devoted to ensuring that management was more efficient, and that more effective methods were adopted in the ordinary running of the factory.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has contributed <Col N="1242" /> to the lack of a resurgence in employment is the legislation introduced a few years ago restricting the dismissal of employees. This has proved to be counter productive because many industrialists are now slow to take on staff for a new venture knowing that if the venture is not successful it will be difficult if not impossible to dismiss the staff who are no longer required.  This seemed to be a good idea but in practice it has done more harm than good in relation to the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Assuming the lifting of the recession and that the predictions of the OECD and the other economists are correct, and that we will have improved international trade, and an improvement in industrial relations to enable us to compare more favourably with other countries, we are still likely to have a completely unacceptable level of unemployment, particularly amongst young people.</P>
    <P>There are only two bright spots in relation to this problem which can be seen at the moment.  One is in the area of providing services for countries in the Middle East, Third World countries.  Instead of concentrating on the export of goods as we did in the past, we should be giving a great deal more attention to the possibility of providing services, of availing of the need in these countries for administration. This idea has been adopted very successfully by such firms as the ESB, Aer Lingus, building firms and several other types of firms to fill a need for those services.  By doing so they provide very good employment for people here.  If goods are required in relation to the work they are doing in these countries they can ensure that at least Irish firms are given an opportunity to tender and have a chance to provide the goods, thereby increasing our exports as well as providing services.</P>
    <P>The other area which gives some hope in the future is not as acceptable a solution as the first one I have mentioned. It is a fact that in Germany in particular, and in one or two other countries in Europe, by the end of the decade they will have a problem not of unemployment but of an inadequate work force.  They will have to look to other countries for <Col N="1243" /> help in this question of a work force and they will either be providing work in Germany, or whatever countries are concerned, or alternatively, which would be much more acceptable, they will have to set up some of their factories in countries where a work force is available.  This is an opportunity which Ireland can avail of, and an opportunity which can be of some help in solving the unemployment problem in a few years' time.  These are two areas in which there is some hope, over and above the ordinary possibilities of which we must never lose sight, providing more jobs in the traditional way.</P>
    <P>Apart from that the Government must make a radical reappraisal of the problem of unemployment.  They must introduce and devise new methods of providing occupational activity of one kind or another which would possibly be something half way between the normal kind of job we have at the moment and the situation where we have so many people on the dole.  We should always remember that the problem is not that there is no work to be done.  There is plenty of work to be done.  The problem is that we cannot afford to pay people to do the work which is crying out to be done.  There is an immense amount of work to be done on infrastructures, on building, education, social welfare and health.  The problem is that we cannot pay for this work to be done in the ordinary way.  Everybody who is concerned about this problem must have a new look at the whole question of providing occupations for people in a way which will give them some recompense.</P>
    <P>The Government should explore the possibility of getting some of the work done which requires to be done to some extent on a voluntary basis but subsidised by the State.  This would provide a temporary occupation for people who cannot get work in the ordinary way.  It would give them some satisfaction, some self-respect and an income in excess of the dole but possibly not as much as they would get in full employment which they would hope to get eventually.  The Government must explore all possibilities outside the traditional methods of <Col N="1244" /> providing employment.  They must cut through the present conventions, the precedents, the inhibitions, the whole idea that there is only one way to provide work and that is by building more factories or in agriculture.  If there is to be any hope of solving the almost impossible problem which unemployment poses, the Government must look at the matter in a new way.  It is a basic requirement for the economy and the social structures that the problem of unemployment be solved.  Something radical must be done. I do not think we can survive as a State unless something radical is done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I compliment him on the auspicious start he has made as Minister.  The issue addressed in this motion is of the utmost importance for our future and for the development of our country.  As we are so often told our people are our nation's most valuable resource.  Young people in particular will make up the Ireland of tomorrow.</P>
      <P>The scourge of unemployment is not a local issue.  It is not a national issue.  It is a trans-national problem which affects the whole developed world.  Nor is it a problem which affects young people alone.  All ages and all groupings can have their lives turned upside down by being thrown out of work or being unable to find employment.  There are those who would argue that, of all age groups, young people are best able to cope with the catastrophe of unemployment, being more resilient and adaptable than their older work mates.  However, I would argue that to hold out no hope of employment for our young people is to tell them that they are of no value, that they do not have a contribution to make to the wellbeing and prosperity of their country. They must be allowed to make their contribution and they must be seen to be held in high esteem and high value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the dire situation in perspective, I should like to refer to the disastrous unemployment situation in Wexford.  In March this year 2,258 people were registered as unemployed in Wexford town, a 140 per cent increase since 1979 and representing 21.2 per cent of the work <Col N="1245" /> force.  Similarly in Enniscorthy 1,565 people are unemployed, a 136.7 per cent increase in four years and a scandalously high 16 per cent unemployment rate.  In New Ross there are 1,224 unemployed, a staggering 188.7 per cent increase since 1979, while in Gorey there are 1,014 people unemployed, a 171.1 per cent increase in four years representing 16.1 per cent of the work force.  A significant number of those are people who are aged under 25.  I am anxious to avail of this opportunity to highlight the situation in Wexford to the Minister.  While I recognise that the country in general has problems I put it to the Minister that the situation in Wexford is of crisis proportions. To underline the point further I should like to tell the Minister that only 5.1 per cent of our working population in Wexford are engaged in manufacturing industry and that compares with 10.9 per cent for Carlow, 10.4 per cent for Water-ford and 7.3 per cent for Kilkenny, our three neighbouring counties.  Those figures, together with the fact that no major manufacturing industry has been sited in Wexford in recent years, underline the neglect of that county by successive Governments, but I am confident that the Coalition Government will rectify that neglect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the bringing to fruition of the Youth Employment Agency as a mechanism by which the problem can at last be tackled.  I understand that in recent times the Minister sanctioned additional staff for the agency to identify areas where the considerable sums of money available to the agency from the Exchequer can be pumped into creating sustainable and worth-while jobs.  The agency can be of immense value in focusing in on the areas where a fruitful investment can be made and, equally important, in signalling clearly to our young people that the Government and the nation value them highly.</P>
    <P>Those fortunate enough to be in employment in my view quite happily contribute the 1 per cent levy if it can be seen that the moneys thus collected are well managed and productively invested. I look forward also to the establishment of the National Development Corporation <Col N="1246" /> as a dynamic State agency for investment in job creation.  It is clear that private enterprise alone cannot solve our unemployment problem.  Millions of pounds of public money have been used to attract and encourage foreign enterprise to the State.  Too often we found that when the market got tough their commitment to the country and our people was very subordinate to the commitment to profit.  We have all too many examples in every constituency and county of those who when the going got tough saw fit to cut and run.  It is therefore imperative that programmes for attracting foreign investment are matched by direct State involvement in job creation.</P>
    <P>It has become fashionable of late in certain quarters to attack State and semi-State industry.  Too often we, as politicians, have lumbered semi-State companies with a myriad of social responsibilities, interfered constantly with their day-to-day working and then expressed surprise when at the end of the day they did not make a profit.  Elected members have a responsibility to be balanced and fair in their comments and when looking at semi-State companies to use the same criteria they use to judge and evaluate the work of private companies.</P>
    <P>The forecasts from every source and every nation are characterised by one factor, recurring gloom.  No country has found a solution to the nightmare of unemployment and increasingly we are told that the best we can hope for in the immediate and long-term future is a slowing down of the rate of increase rather than an end to the problem.  The situation demands that we look in a new and radical way at the concept of unemployment. We must not debase the unemployed by making this a party political issue, a political football in which each party beat their chest in majesty by saying how much they, their Departments and their Ministers have done and decry the Opposition for not doing all they should have done.  I appeal to the Opposition and Members on the Government side to regard the issue as being of such importance that it transcends the normal political divide and to acknowledge the fact that we all must share the responsibility, <Col N="1247" /> it rests on all our shoulders, and only in collective action can we hope to remedy it.</P>
    <P>We will have to break a few traditionalist and outdated moulds.  No longer can we view a job as being the factor which defines our work, our social position or as being the skeleton on which we hang our lives.  Unemployment must not be regarded as a social disease and the unemployed victims to be avoided and pitied.  We must look afresh at the possibility of work-sharing, a fact alluded to by Opposition speakers, and areas such as early retirement and the creation by the State of non-commercial jobs whereby those who undertake socially useful and important work in the environment, working with children, the disadvantaged, unattached youth, can have their work recognised and be paid a social wage.  We must look afresh at leisure activities and the concept of open-ended education, cradle to grave education, allowing easy access at different stages of one's life.  We must look at the facilities the State provide for people to occupy their leisure time, to get away from the idea that a nine to five job is the only way one's day can be usefully occupied.</P>
    <P>The age of the micro-processor has dawned and with it comes, depending on one's viewpoint, either a plague or a golden opportunity. In coming years the jobs of many people will be replaced by machines.  The work undertaken by a considerable proportion of the work force at present can be more efficiently done in the future by robots or mechanised machinery.  Depending on how we come to terms with that fact, the result will either be a further concentration of wealth in the hands of the few or, alternatively, the freeing of people to develop their own talents, indeed their own humanity.  From the labour point of view, we must approach the opportunities of mechanisation not as a plague to be avoided or as a disaster zone, but as an opportunity for freeing people to be more human.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister outline what plans the Government have <Col N="1248" /> for employment, and particularly youth employment, and to impress upon him the importance of his Ministry at this crucial stage of our nation's development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to remind Members that one of the primary duties of society is to create employment opportunities for the greatest number of our citizens.  Work is one of man's most important means of self-fulfilment.  The opportunity and freedom of work are conditions of his dignity as a person.  To a man work is that independence and ability to provide for his own, without which he can scarcely retain his self-respect. In our kind of society productive work and the independence which goes with it are important conditions for retaining the respect of the community. Those people who remain without work for long periods inevitably become &ldquo;marginalised&rdquo; in society.  That situation is a recipe for vandalism and other evils in society.  It undermines one's self-esteem and tends to breed resentment against society.</P>
      <P>For a man not to be able to find work means that society is saying they have no need of him.  This country is saying that to many thousands of older people who have served the community very well and whose employment has ceased with little hope of retraining them.  We are saying to thousands of young boys and girls to whom we have given a good education that we do not want them either.  We are letting them down.  This situation is a very serious reflection on society and should weigh very heavily on our conscience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the biggest single problem parents see for their children is a job at the end of their school days.  They are not unduly worried about education, social welfare or other areas; their biggest single worry is whether their children will have worthwhile jobs.  It must be admitted that the last budget did very little, if anything, for the job creation situation. Government taxation now and in the past has been a deterrent to job creation. Clearly PRSI, unfair dismissals, the Employment Equality Act, are all areas which are helping to keep young people <Col N="1249" /> out of jobs.  When I was at leaving certificate stage in the late fifties there were many areas where I could look for a job &mdash; CIE, Aer Lingus, semi-State bodies, insurance companies and the building industry.  The tourist industry was booming.  Now unfortunately that is not the case because of the high hotel and petrol prices.</P>
    <P>The first aim of the national policy of any Government should be the provision of jobs for the greatest possible number of people.  Senator Burke said the Government recognised that fact; he could have fooled me.  I do not wish to make a political point but during the last eight or ten months I have heard a great deal about crusades, divorce, contraception and issues that are important in their own way, but this is the most vital issue facing the people.  Clearly job creation for our youth is the crisis area which should be tackled as a first priority by this Government.  Let me repeat, I am not saying those other areas are not important in their own way, but this is the most important issue of the day.</P>
    <P>This problem should be accepted as a national challenge and everybody should make a commitment to it.  It will not be easy to solve this problem.  No easy promises should be bandied about.  Unless sacrifices and restraints are seen by all and are voluntarily accepted by all, especially the better off, there is no way the jobs needed will be created.</P>
    <P>A real injustice will be done to our people by politicians or other leaders of opinion who suggest that our economic problems can be solved without more work, restraint, saving and sacrifices.  A real injustice will be done to all by group leaders who claim that the necessary sacrifices should be made by others, but not by their followers.  Political promises, economic forecasts, group demands or refusals raise important questions of justice. We have to tell the people it is their living standards and their families which are at stake.</P>
    <P>We must compliment the IDA for the great work they are doing, but unfortunately as they are creating jobs in industry others are being lost by cutbacks and closures.  This is a regrettable situation. <Col N="1250" /> In a recent article in one of our newspapers I read that job losses are likely to remain high in industry and that policy makers will have to look elsewhere to find employment for job seekers.  That type of problem will continue, regrettably, and the figure mentioned by Senator E. Ryan unfortunately will increase. We have become uncompetitive.  This is another reason jobs are being lost.  We have new technology, which is playing a massive role but is doing nothing for job creation.</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned by previous speakers, the valve of emigration is no longer with us.  One could argue that the situation has worsened.  I was told recently that as many as 100,000 people have come from the North of Ireland since 1969.  They are welcome but they have added to the problem.  I have given reasons why jobs are scarce and will continue to be scarce.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about work experience programmes.  Much as they are to be praised, I believe our people realise that training is vital if there is a job at the end of the day but there is no point in training somebody if there is not a job for him.  I have seen this happen to boys and girls who were trained under various schemes.  The Youth Employment Agency has been mentioned very often in the course of this debate.  I believe that not just 1 per cent or 2 per cent but 5 per cent would be contributed by our people by way of youth employment levy if, at the end of the day &mdash; rather than have some type of training situation obtain &mdash; there were permanent, worthwhile jobs. That is not what is happening at present. The emphasis must be on the creation of jobs as distinct from the provision of training programmes at present being undertaken by many agencies.</P>
    <P>Our expanding population presents a huge challenge to all of us.  The creation of jobs for our people will be one of the great tests of national spirit and of patriotic endeavour in this generation.  In face of this challenge a new definition of patriotism must be created, a new understanding of what it means to love and serve Ireland must be formed.  The community as a whole needs to be much <Col N="1251" /> better informed about the facts.  I accept that the strain on the nation's basic services of education and health will be extremely severe in the years immediately ahead.  But I believe that the risks of social unrest which would follow a failure to face this challenge would be very grave indeed.  All those competent to judge have warned that, if recent unemployment rates are allowed to grow &mdash; and I believe they will grow or continue at their present rate to something less than 200,000 &mdash; then the dangers of grave social and socio-political tensions in this country will be very great.</P>
    <P>The matter is too serious for political point-scoring.  All of us in this Chamber must bring to this debate genuine courage, objectivity, constructive criticism, if necessary.  The truth sometimes may be unpopular but concealment or evasion of the truth might be fatal.  Many of us have mentioned reasons for there being improvements implemented on the job scene.  I am not an expert in this field but I accept that job-sharing must have an input of some kind.  It has been suggested that overtime might be replaced by some kind of flexible, casual staffing arrangement. A shorter working week has been suggested.  I believe that better tax concessions would improve the position. But, above all, we must become competitive.</P>
    <P>In this and the other House we have all-party committees on important matters such as marital breakdown, divorce, building land and so on.  I am not saying we should not have them but why not have an all-party committee on the most important issue of all, that of job creation? Why not have an expert team of specialists from all sections of the civil service &mdash; we are paying civil servants very high money; I am not saying they do not deserve it &mdash; who would sit down with the politicians and iron out this problem once and for all in order to provide our young people with new jobs and a better way of life?  Men with an already adequate salary or pension, women with comfortable livelihoods, with no economic need to work in present circumstances, have some obligation not to seek <Col N="1252" /> to hold onto their jobs at the expense of others, especially at the expense of our younger people who cannot find work. The single most important problem confronting this country at present is the shortage of jobs.  Let there be no doubt about that.  To have good opportunities for all those seeking work would be the biggest single social reform that could be achieved.  It would remove a good deal of poverty, relieve a great deal of personal frustration, reduce social tensions and create a climate of optimism which in itself would contribute to a healthier society.</P>

      <P>This is the single, greatest problem confronting this country, that of youth unemployment, and it is a challenge to all of us.  There is in Ireland a growth of young people much more than in the rest of Europe.  We hear people talk nowadays of what kind of country we will have here in the future and about the future Ireland.  Of course when they talk in that vein they are referring mainly to the national question.  The kind of country the next generation will inherit will depend as much on what we do to tackle the problem of youth unemployment as it will on what we do to tackle the national question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> It is clear from the contributions in this House today that there is an awareness of the problem that must be tackled right across the board, across the political parties. I have listened to all of the speeches and there is no doubt about that.  I am pleased to note that there is in this part of the country the Youth Employment Agency which was set up to tackle the problem of youth unemployment.  What is now required is an equivalent commitment across the board, first of all a commitment by Government who are in a position to do something about it and an equal commitment on the part of the Opposition to constructive criticism and constructive, helpful suggestions and ideas in the tackling of this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Might I say a word or two about the young people of today?  I feel they come in for a lot of unfair criticism.  From my experience of working with young people I find they are far more idealistic, more caring and more concerned about the under-privileged than were my generation when I was young.  They are quick to recognise hypocrisy in all areas of politics. I should like to pay tribute to young people who I think are much maligned by society today.  If politicians fail to take seriously the grave problems that face young people in seeking employment, disillusionment will develop very rapidly. They will experience frustration and the problems that flow from that.</P>
    <P>The urgency of the problem cannot be over-emphasised.  I urge all concerned, the trade unions, employers, Government and Opposition, to get together and make a constructive effort to tackle the problem.  In particular trade unions, with the employers, must play their role.  Like the Northern Ireland problem, there is not an easy solution.  The days are gone when we could export our problems. Because of the seriousness of the problem it will require all parties to transcend the normal political divisions.  We must give the young people a stake in the country. If people do not have this they will not be very enthusiastic about the type of society we have.</P>
    <P>I realise this is a problem that affects the rest of Europe, it is not just an Irish <Col N="1255" /> problem although it may be a little worse here.  While we consult with colleagues in Europe about the youth unemployment problem, perhaps we do not have enough consultation with the people who deal with that problem in the North of Ireland. I suggest that some way be found of pooling ideas in this part of the island and in the North in an effort to tackle the problem. Unfortunately we have not a Youth Employment Agency.  Unfortunately, also, we operate under an iron lady whose concern for youth is not clear. Neither is her concern clear with regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we could learn from the mistakes that have been made.  A number of mistakes have been made in the North with regard to youth employment.  Senator Honan referred to training schemes. There is a danger of short-term advantage being sought by setting up training schemes but with no work at the end. Taking people off the unemployment queue for six months, training them for jobs that do not exist and then throwing them back on the scrap-heap of unemployment doubles their sense of frustration.</P>
    <P>There is need for a planned approach. There is also need for a new attitude towards work and the value of work. Here there is a major role for education. For too long the problem in this country has been trying to fit square pegs into round holes.  In my generation it was thought a university degree was the beginning and end of everything.  What we require is equality of opportunity for all and thus allow everyone to fit into the mould that is best suited to him or her. All work should be given equal value. We should not have a snobbish outlook that regards some work as more important to society than other work.</P>
    <P>There are a number of pitfalls to be avoided in seeking a way out of our dilemma of youth unemployment.  I am sorry Senator Fallon has left the House. He talked about women who are comfortably off.  A few people recently have said married women should give up their jobs.  Most married women who are working do so because they have to supplement <Col N="1256" /> the family income.  I suggest that the men who have two or more jobs should give up their extra work and keep just one job.  We must not think of the sacrifices the other person has to make but of the sacrifices we must make.  For instance, we could have schemes to encourage early retirement.  That would allow jobs to be created for young people.  Women could be encouraged to go out of the work force for a few years to cope with their families.  Many women would like to do that but they know they would lose benefits and pension rights. That area should be considered.  Women could be given incentives to stay out of the work force for a few years if they wished to do so but it should not cost them anything in pension rights.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the Northern experience and to talk about the real effect of unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular.  In Northern Ireland we have a young generation who have no hope of work and whose parents have never worked.  When people talk about unemployment and youth unemployment here, it looks like a rose garden to us from Northern Ireland.  Many young people there have no hope of employment: they are in areas such as west Belfast, Derry and in the eastern part of Northern Ireland.  They are doubly frustrated and doubly alienated because they have no work, no hope of work and their families have never worked.  The result has been a total alienation, a total lack of identity with the institutions of government. This sense exists already for other reasons but it is aggravated by the unemployment situation.  That alienation allows for exploitation of two kinds. First, it allows for young people who are desperate to find employment to be exploited by employers who pay them less than a living wage.  They are so glad to get any work they will work for buttons. That does not solve the problem but leads to further frustration later on.</P>
    <P>The worst exploitation of all is the exploitation by the para-militaries of young people who have lost hope in society, who do not identify with it and who are completely alienated.  In their frustration they are led to believe that the <Col N="1257" /> answer to all their problems lies with the para-militaries who have been quick to exploit that situation.  I am talking about people whose concern for youth unemployment can be gauged by the fact that in the past ten years the damage caused by these same para-militaries to industrial and commercial property has cost £428 million in Northern Ireland.  One can imagine the job losses that resulted from that.  They have also been responsible for the murder of industrialists and that, in turn, has discouraged investment. They are the people to whom the young, in their frustration, are turning for help. I suggest that is an indictment of all the politicians concerned with providing employment for young people.</P>
    <P>I envy Members of the Seanad and the Members of the other House.  They have the power to change things, to make the sacrifices and to give the commitment.  In Northern Ireland we have not that power.  I know it will not be an easy job. I am not an economist but I appeal to all concerned, the Government, Opposition, the trade unions and the employers, to come together on this the most crucial issue facing our people, namely, the problem of youth unemployment.  They should make a constructive attempt to deal with it before the alienation we have seen with its tragic results in Northern Ireland sets in here which will leave the people here with a more difficult problem to tackle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the wishes of the Chair I shall be very brief. With regard to married women giving up their jobs, I wish to say at the outset, in case I forget it later that I would, under no circumstances, subscribe to that idea. If married women feel they have a contribution to make, professionally or otherwise, they should be given that opportunity and I see no reason to discriminate against them simply because they are married.  Those of us with young children and, indeed, with children not so young, are very concerned about this problem.  One of the most serious and urgent problems facing us is that there are in the region of 200,000 unemployed. A few years ago the prospect of having <Col N="1258" /> 100,000 unemployed was considered out of the question.  As I have said before in this House I believe that employment as we have known it will never return.  We will have to consider shorter working hours and possibly earlier retirements.</P>
      <P>In the existing system there are many anomalies.  One of them is in regard to someone who is signing for social welfare benefits.  The position was that if an individual was employed for a short period there would be a break in the claim.  Bureaucracy was involved which would involve clerical procedure and delays in payment with the result that either the unemployed individual did not work for the short period or he worked and did not notify the social welfare office.  He was, therefore, encouraged to be dishonest.  The mistake was in the system and no fault could be found with the individuals concerned.</P>
      <P>I met a young county councillor during my canvassing.  He had a wife who is a nurse who had applied unsuccessfully for different jobs over a number of years. She decided while drawing social welfare insurance to do a course in typing to qualify as a secretary in order to get a job.  However, she was not allowed to do the course while drawing unemployment benefit.  That was a crazy situation.  By staying at home and doing nothing she was entitled to draw social welfare benefit but by trying to do something constructive that would result in getting work later on she was debarred from getting social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad situation when our youth are being educated with no prospects of getting employment.  Applications for some positions run into thousands.  A vacancy for a position of clerical officer with a local authority was advertised recently. There was a young man in the position in a temporary capacity and when the post was advertised to be filled permanently this young man applied.  There were over 300 applications, three of which were from well-qualified graduates and the result was that this man who had been doing the work so well was not even called for an interview.  The ultimate will be when applicants are required to have <Col N="1259" /> doctorates to get jobs sweeping the roads.</P>
    <P>This situation spells nothing but despair.  A radical approach is needed. Nearly 100 per cent of the people capable of working wish to do so.  They do not want hand-outs.  We will have to abandon the present system like a sinking raft and channel the finances through productive schemes such as housing, roads, forestry, turf, drainage, industrial projects, assisting farmers, etc.  This could be done without competing with private enterprise.  It would be possible to give proper remuneration and satisfactory conditions.  Let us take forestry, for example.  If, 20 years ago, people who were on the dole were given the opportunity to work on a scheme for re-afforestation of an area of land they could have been paid well, would have had decent conditions and we would now have a viable industry giving employment.  That would have been a good investment at no cost to the State. If we were to give special grants to people to build their own houses we would get a meaningful contribution.  These houses might not necessarily be in competition with others built commercially because the same conditions could apply to them as for vacancies, for example, in the civil service where people who would have got grants for training as teachers would not be considered.  Those with educational qualifications could be given grants for various projects and they would have something to look forward to.  The whole focus should be on hope.  It is not enough to tinker with the existing structures.  It is very important to train for leisure.</P>
    <P>In the National Youth Council of Ireland publication which we have all received it is pointed out that effective policies are of the greatest urgency with an average growth rate for the adult population of 1.3 per cent and with over 70,000 young people unemployed.  The basis of the solution lies in the pursuit of economic and social policies geared toward job creation.  I want to repeat that over the years, the objective was to reduce labour or, in fact, in many cases to eliminate it if possible.  There were firms who carried out surveys for that <Col N="1260" /> purpose.  This was a short-sighted and parochial approach as far as fiscal policy was concerned.  When I started work as an area clerk for Meath County Council, we had quarries and pits all over the county.  These gave employment and the unit charges were based on the costs.  For example, the costs were worked out at so much per cubic yard.  A private company were set up at that time and were in a position to charge less per cubic yard than the local authority.  For example, where about a cubic yard of chippings would cost the county council £1 to produce, this firm could supply one cubic yard at half that cost.  The result was that all these schemes were terminated and jobs were gone forever, replaced by sophisticated machines.  In a limited sense of grants for the various works this was progress. More work could be done for a specific grant or the same work could be done at a lesser cost.  But in the global sense of lost jobs and the social welfare payments that inevitably followed, the situation was quite definitely on the minus side.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that we do not take advantage of modern technology and science. If we were prepared to go back to the spade and shovel, the horse and plough, the mug of buttermilk and the pretty maid milking her cow there would be no problem.  However, there is no turning back.  We need a new definition of work and a radical plan.  Money should work to generate work.  I agree with the Senators who have said that this is not a party political problem.  This is a problem we all want to share.</P>

      <P>At this stage I want to repeat my point of order.  We have three or four Senators who are anxious to speak on this motion and I can detect in the House a consensus to facilitate these speakers.  Many people who have been in the House have offered now. I propose that under Standing Order 41 (a) which says that, unless the Seanad so otherwise orders, three hours be the time given to a motion, the Seanad should amend its Order of Business now to extend the time of sitting from 8.30 to 9.30.  I so move.</P>

It was the Cathaoirleach's advice that we defer our consideration of this item until we were nearer the time of termination.  We are coming perilously close to the time when the Minister would be expected to speak and the movers of the motion would be expected to reply. I can see a limited number of Senators who would want to offer to speak.  It was for that reason and out of deference to the Chair that I held off moving it until now.

We prepared our speakers on the basis of the time limit imposed by the Standing Order.  In the other House when that happens the Opposition or Government speakers have to share the time they have.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take up immediately a point made by the preceding speaker.  It is important that it is not omitted from this debate.  It is an advantage to speak before the Minister speaks. It is very important that he should respond to the submission that is being made to him and to all Members of this House by the National Youth Council of Ireland which was very specific in the detail of the items to which it asked us to respond.  It made proposals for a national social guarantee for young people which would include a guarantee of some form of experience, be it in terms of work, training or financed education for young people, within a defined period of time. It spoke, secondly, of something that has been taken up by almost every speaker: the need to redefine the concept of work. It spoke also for strong political support <Col N="1263" /> for the Youth Employment Agency. Linked to that was the whole question that no bureaucratic division should impede the Youth Employment Agency in any way.  Fourthly, it spoke of the need for a stronger emphasis on job creation. I endorse that recommendation.  My personal view is that I would be inclined to make a commitment to such a proposal.</P>
      <P>I hope that what I have to say now will not be misconstrued in any way.  I noticed that Senator Howlin mentioned that he had confidence that this problem would effectively be addressed within the immediate few years.  I am not being in the least partisan or disloyal when I express reservations about whether it will in effect be addressed.  I want to give the reasons for that.  I believe that unemployment does not enjoy the status of the other problems that have been defined as the problems besetting the economy. They are essentially two in most of the western economies.  One has been the problem of servicing the public borrowing requirement when you have reached the ceiling of taxation, when you have a tax revolt on your hands, when people say they will not pay any more taxes.  The only other prong, on the traditional economic management argument, is that you look at the question of cuts.  If you go for cuts you increase unemployment and thus you have descriptive statements being made about the economy that you can have a reduction in inflation, that you can have even better interest rates but that you have a continuing rise in the overall unemployment statistics.  That kind of descriptive remark, which is usual in defining the economy in many administrations, in which you separate the unemployment problem from the basic structural problems of the economy, is disastrous.  It is going the road of Britain and of other economies.  I very carefully mention that point.  There is no way in which you can follow traditional economic strategies and make any indent on the unemployment statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My point is that we have not accurately given a status to the problem of unemployment. Equally, on the European level, there is every evidence that we <Col N="1264" /> continually under-estimate the problem of unemployment.  I do not want to go into that very much but in the methodology of assessing the unemployed in Europe &mdash; the 20,000 odd they are out in many statistics &mdash; it is found that they are probably out mostly in relation to measuring the extent of youth unemployment. One would not want to be rhetorical and pious about this whole question of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment.  Let us be perfectly clear that the most important statement that has been made by different Senators in this House this afternoon has been in relation to the redefinition of work.  I hope Senators realise what it means.  It means that you break the connection between the idea that if you do not hold a job that is related to production for the market you are not entitled to income or if you are entitled to income you are entitled to an income that will be defined under social policy as some kind of welfare benefit to which a particular status in the community is attached.  If you are saying break that link, I wholeheartedly agree with you, because the problem is one of getting income out across the community in such a way that you will not lock yourself into poor law schemes of dealing with an economy that is in a period of contraction.  This is very important. There are things that we can do that are important now.  The question of the redefinition of work is a crucial point.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear why I said I was pessimistic. I have been reading the different economic forecasts on the economy for many years.  There are very few people within orthodox economics who hold the view that is being expressed in the Seanad this afternoon.  It is very interesting the different advices that have been given. For example, Ciaran Kennedy and Foley's document, <i>Industrial Development</i>, Brendan Dowling and Durkan's edited <i>Irish Economic Policy: Review of Major Issues</i> and the Dublin Economic Social Research Institute in 1978 came up with three measures in which they addressed the problem of unemployment, measures to increase industrial output, measures to increase the spin-off effects of industrial output on <Col N="1265" /> activity elsewhere in the economy and measures to reduce the growth of labour productivity and they assessed these.  I make the point that this is orthodox thinking, the idea being that you can somehow or other create an atmosphere in which people will respond to incentives to industrial production and this will in turn enable you to reduce your unemployment figure.  All the evidence is against that thinking.  Only last night I quoted the European figure.  Unemployment in the European Community is now over 13 million.  To get back to the old definition of full employment, under 4 per cent or so, we would need to create a million jobs a year between now and 1995.  The Community has produced 280,000 jobs in its best year, thus the projected unemployment figure for 1995 at present trends in the Community, given existing population forecast, is 50 million.  This is the size of the problem. Thus it is absolute twaddle for conventional economists to keep on talking about the cyclical nature of unemployment and to suggest that you can somehow or another use 1960 solutions to a problem of the magnitude of the 1980s.  It simply makes no sense.  Thus new measures need to be taken.  For example, if you are not going to get the quantitative growth in the economy in western Europe and in Ireland in particular, you could get qualitative growth.  Therefore, there is much merit in specific proposals that have been made by many bodies, including the NYCI, in relation to job creation of a qualitative kind.</P>
    <P>I will say five things about this.  First of all, it is possible to encourage investment programmes in the field of environmental protection and energy policy.  Second, it is crucial in relation to overall fiscal management that you move away from financial investment to genuine productive investment.  This point has been made already.  Third, it is necessary by structural policies to boost exports on the basis of technological progress.  Fourth, one I wholeheartedly endorse and which has many implications: it is important if you are to stimulate demand to have an incomes policy that will benefit the lower income groups particularly.  Finally, <Col N="1266" /> there is no doubt that we must look at the whole question of differentiated working hours, shorter working lives etc.  In this regard we are doing nothing novel or new.  For example, in the Federal Republic of Germany all the women can retire at 63 on a slightly reduced pension.  In Sweden men and women can retire at 60 on a reduced pension.  Since 1976 in France there is a full retirement pension at the age of 60 years.  In Belgium the normal retirement age is 64 for men and 60 for women.  It is a question of adjustments in relation to the length of the life span.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important to examine these measures in three ways.  There are short-term measures such as I have been describing, medium-term measures in relation to economic management, and long-term measures.  The long-term measures involve the shifting of economic thinking into an acknowledgement of the size of the structural problem of unemployment.  I do not intend to delay on the rather silly suggestion that our unemployment problem is exacerbated by the equal participation of men and women.  It would be very wrong if we took a problem like our unemployment level and used it as an opportunity to make a case against real gains in equality which were long overdue.  What it would achieve would be infinitesimal compared to the impact of the elimination of women from the work force.</P>
    <P>Youth unemployment cannot be separated from the general economic position, but people are a little coy about what is happening in relation to the economy.  Overall, the western economies are suffering from high interest rates in the United States.  Let us see the parlous nature of that.  Those high interest rates were brought about by the high level of Government borrowing when there was a commitment to reduce taxes. That high borrowing is for military expenditure.  Thus at the same time as we have an unemployment crisis in Europe provoked by high American interest rates, the borrowing is being spent on militarism.  We have the co-existence of militarism and unemployment.</P>
    <P>I endorse every word that is being said <Col N="1267" /> by Senators from all sides who have been making the case for a rethink in relation to the whole question of unemployment. The advisers to Governments, this Government, the last Government and all the previous four or five Governments, are operating from premises in orthodox economics that are related to market performance.  There is no point in saying that you must create an atmosphere of incentives in the private sector. I have not the time to review the history of the Irish private sector, one of the most assisted in Europe.  Moneys for depreciation, promotion and export tax relief are forked out to them.  No other private sector has had such a list of incentives, and their employment creation record is one of the worst in Europe.</P>
    <P>We are here discussing youth unemployment when we have not submitted our industrial policy to examination.  The Telesis report has been leaked and commented upon.  We are told there that our reliance on one form of industrialisation strategy is weak and negative.  We should have discussed it long before now, but the notion that you can fork out money to the private sector and create an atmosphere to help to reduce youth unemployment is rubbish.</P>
    <P>On the other side it is important to be optimistic.  It is impossible to believe that side by side with the neglected question of unemployment and youth unemployment in particular you would have cutbacks in education.  Surely it is time above all else to put money into education. People from the other side of the House have spoken about robotisation.  There are 16,000 robots at work in the Japanese economy.  A robot can weld a car in 25 seconds.  We need to get beyond the three phases of industrialisation &mdash; the present state of micro-technology, followed by bio-technology, followed by robotisation &mdash; to anticipate the fourth stage.  To do that you need to educate your population instead of neglecting unemployment and particularly youth unemployment and at the same time cutting education.  We should look at a whole new mix of survival time, education time and leisure time.  That requires the new thinking that <Col N="1268" /> people have been speaking about in this debate this afternoon.  That is the way that we should go.</P>
    <P>The fact that I speak about these long-term things does not mean that I see them as in any way an absolution from thinking in the medium-term and in the short-term.  In the short-term it is important that the agencies that exist get the political support to be rescued from clientist politics, that they be widely disseminated in relation to what measures are being promised and that there be little jealousy in competition between the different youth strategies that exist.  To my mind they suffer from lack of integration. There is some evidence of a jealous protection of areas and definitions within acts, functions, scopes and powers.  It is time that an end was put to that.  What is important is that they would make the maximum impact in the short-term in relation to schemes that would be of benefit to young people.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is important, if work is to be redefined in the long-term that it be redefined in the short-term also.  If work is redefined, what will be put in its place? When I read all the stuff about community value and so on I find it hard to believe that somebody who plays the saxophone on the streeet and whose hands go blue is not involved in a valuable and important activity.  If individuals choose an activity that is of value to and extends themselves and provides value and pleasure to the community, be it in any field, education, the arts or any activities like that, they should be encouraged and assisted.</P>
    <P>I have listened to many young Deputies in the Dáil and young Senators in this House.  I hope they will not be upset if I say that the majority of them are much more conservative in their thinking than I am.  They realise that their careers will probably do very much better if they avoid the rather eccentric opinions that have been attached to me for some time. I wish them some radicalism because you cannot let words come out of your mouth about redefining work and at the same time go on living and co-existing within a system that has produced so much unemployment.  It means structural <Col N="1269" /> change is the implication of what people are saying.  I hope they are prepared to live with it.  I hope they are able to convince their elders of the necessity of moving from an economy that produces the scandal of so much unemployment to one in which it would be regarded as an obligation to provide and assist activity and to sustain income to enable people to live in dignity and in a way that develops them and is of benefit to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the speakers who have spoken so far and their approach to this motion which we are delighted has come before the Chamber for debate.  It is important that we treat it seriously.  Speaking from my experience of dealing with youth and as a father, unless we arrest the problem in the not too distant future our youth will no longer accept the legislation being dished out to them.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Higgins when he said the policies of the sixties could not be adapted to the eighties.  The advancement of technology creates unemployment. Let no one think that it creates employment.  We have a reputation for gearing our youth to take up jobs here or abroad.  In the old days people went across the water to seek employment. They cannot do that today.  We must take responsibility for the creation of jobs for our increasing population.</P>
      <P>We have 57,000 young people unemployed. They leave the educational assembly line and accept jobs for which they were not trained.  They are desperate to get jobs in order to get money and mark time until the day comes when the jobs they were trained for come on the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must give full support to the Youth Employment Agency and widen its terms of reference if necessary.  It has been said that the 1 per cent levy to fund the agency does not serve the purpose it was intended for.  We have had several schemes of a temporary nature which were non-productive.  They included environmental schemes and so on.  They give temporary relief but they are not the answer.  We must provide jobs.  I appeal <Col N="1270" /> to those civil servants who prepare these schemes to think out how the unemployment problem can be tackled.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have undertaken schemes to create employment.  I have often said that there are a number of people who are unemployed at work. I see them around me every day.  If the unemployed people at work were working further jobs would be created.  We have high absenteeism and other ills in our employment structure.</P>

      <P>Not really.  It could apply to Tipperary just as well.  I welcome the debate.  I am sure the Minister is proud of the sincere way in which it is being conducted.  I can see our youth adopting revolutionary tactics.  They can be contained for a certain length of time but not indefinitely.  We must create the necessary employment for them here. We must tackle the problem in a logical and practical way.  It is sad that the main function of interview boards interviewing young girls who wish to pursue a nursing career is to see how they can knock the candidates.  At the end of the day they arrive at a figure to suit the requirements of the hospital.  Most young people are aware that the right type of person does not always get the job.  Young people are prepared to take any job rather than sit at home.  Those Senators who have families will know this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must give full political and financial support to the various agencies.  We must provide policies which will create jobs.  I realise we are going through stringent financial times.  It has been suggested that the retirement age should be reduced to 60, as is the case in other countries, but this only creates another problem because people will be receiving pensions sooner than heretofore and thereby will be longer on pension.  For that reason, it is not profitable to do that.  The day has come when mothers nursing in hospitals are keeping their trained daughters out of jobs and this will have to be tackled. That is the reason for this motion being tabled.  Irrespective of what Government are in power, policies will have to be <Col N="1271" /> geared to solving this problem.  I do not want to be political but we must programme for a five- or ten-year period. Programming from year to year to meet the challenge of this serious problem is not sufficient.  We will have to programme well into the nineties to indicate to the young people that we, as legislators, are doing what in our view is the best in trying to tackle this problem which will not go away.  There is no other outlet and we must retain our youth in our own country.  The only outlet would be a world war, which is a desperate thought. People of the Eastern bloc and some other countries might welcome that, but we would not welcome the elimination of our youth.  It is our duty to ensure that our legislation is geared towards creating as many jobs as possible and that is what we should be doing.  I thank the Senators for the worthwhile way in which they have received this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this motion from the Opposition and all the individual contributions, I would like to state that our Government's commitment and total concern about this problem are quite evident.  So far, in our period of office we have demonstrated this concern in many ways.  There is no doubt that the single most pressing problem in our society at the moment is the unemployment question.  Many of our other problems result from this.  Being a teacher, I am very much aware of the problems which our youth face at present.  The frustration and anxiety that accompany the prospects of joining the dole queues have a very disheartening effect on many of them.  It can only lead to further alienation and total disenchantment with our system and with society in general.</P>
      <P>Delinquency, high rates of drop-out and attraction to subversive activities as mentioned earlier are just a few results and symptoms of this problem.  The unemployment issue is an historical one in civilisation and is not something new. Various communities and societies in the past have resorted to solving the problem by using methods which were relevant to that particular period.  Whereas we look to the past for experience, it is for the present and future that we must seek remedies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, being a teacher, I am very close to this situation and every day come in contact with issues and problems facing <Col N="1273" /> our youth.  I find that their lack of motivation and initiative and in some cases their total indifference towards their future are quite frightening.  It is a long time since I began to listen to political commentators and people making speeches on political platforms and their main theme always is that they are going to solve the problem of unemployment. Let us be honest and face reality. Although we can articulate very well on the subject, as some have done here tonight, we must ask ourselves, are we making an honest effort to solve the problem? We must as a nation face up to this problem from Government and Opposition down to community level.  We all share a similar responsibility.</P>
    <P>There are various aspects of Government policy which can affect unemployment, but there is no doubt that initiative from communities can have a similar effect on the unemployment issue.  In some cases it can be more effective, as has been the experience in some of the projects which have been initiated by the Government in the recent past.  Both Government and community must make an honest effort to explore every avenue possible through which we can employ our youth.  There must be a relationship between the Government and the community. If they do not work together on this issue, I can see the problem being exaggerated and posing a bigger threat to our society in the future.</P>
    <P>Figures quoted in a recent newspaper article by an economist, Mr. McCabe, show that 57,000 people under 25 years of age are unemployed.  Again, let me add that some of those included in that figure may work in part-time jobs and in employment which is not recorded.  The most disturbing aspect of the figure is that it has increased by 13 per cent since 1982. That demonstrates that, despite the efforts being made by the Government agencies, there has not been success in overcoming the unemployment problem. At the same time, I welcome the initial efforts made by the Government in supporting and funding the various agencies involved in youth employment and training in their budgetary allocations for 1982.  As the Minister pointed out in Galway <Col N="1274" /> recently, they were in excess of what the agencies sought.  This bears testimony to the Government's commitment to solving the problem of unemployment. We must recognise and accept that there is an urgent need to curb and cut expenditure, but an increase in these allocations must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>At a later stage no doubt the Minister will quote some figures.  The Department of Labour increased the allocation to the employment incentive scheme by £3.8 million for 1982-83.  They increased the allocations to the work experience programme, the grant scheme for youth employment, and the community youth training programme.  I welcome those increases.  The new Youth Employment Agency have definite possibilities.  They will play a major role in solving our unemployment problem in the future. They have made a sizeable impact on the problem.  This will become more evident in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan said there was a cutback in the amount of money spent on recreational and sporting activities.  Some of the money which was cut back was channelled into the Olympic training programme for 1984.  While it is not desirable that any area should be deprived of funds the Olympic training programme is worthwhile and should be supported.  I agree with Senator Honan that since we have an unemployment problem we must provide recreational and leisure facilities. Every effort should be made by the Government to ensure that proper facilities are available.</P>
    <P>In a broader sense the Government have definite policies with which I totally agree.  In order to achieve the highest possible return in economically sustainable jobs for the capital input involved, we must strive to provide jobs with a future.  Previous speakers emphasised the fact that the concept of work should be redefined.  If we are to provide worthwhile jobs they must have a future.  Too often in the past public finances have been wasted on the creation of jobs to satisfy an immediate need.  We can all quote examples of factories which were set up for political purposes, or to meet the immediate needs of an area.  They <Col N="1275" /> collapsed after a while due to a lack of planning.  They had no future in reality.</P>
    <P>We must have very clear-cut objectives. As the Taoiseach said, there is a need for a planned approach to the development of the economy to solve the unemployment problem.  Any approach which is not planned and structured is doomed to failure.  In the past we had too many programmes which were designed to meet an immediate need and had no future prospects.  When they did not succeed the problem was aggravated.</P>
    <P>The Government are endeavouring to identify areas with an expansive employment potential.  Although some of them have been cited already, I should like to cite some which I consider worthy of being explored.  There is a considerable potential in development in the food processing industry.  As Senator Smith said, it is a shame and a disgrace on all of us, and farmers in particular, that we import so many foodstuffs.  We have the best climate and the greatest potential in the world for the production of agricultural and horticultural products, and we are not utilising this potential to the full. Two major problems at the moment, apart from unemployment, are the high cost of fuel and the high cost of food.  If we produced more food, we could make it available to the people in the cities at far less cost.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable potential in the glasshouse industry, in the development of our forestry and peat industries, and in the development of potentially rich agricultural land which is lying dormant at the moment.  When we talk of agricultural production, we are inclined to look at the productive areas and the productive farms.  We have all seen very well-developed farms in the midst of waste land and bogland.  The good farms have been developed due to the initiative of individual farmers.  We must look at the land which is lying waste at the moment and try to make it productive.  In this way we would encourage the provision of more employment in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>As a part of our educational system I think we have lost sight of the requirements <Col N="1276" /> of the individuals who on leaving the system face modern society.  Unemployment is very much a national problem. All politicians share the responsibility for solving it.  We must endeavour to offer solutions and to co-operate with each other in order to maintain our system of Government.  Otherwise the youth will look for alternative methods.  To protect democracy we have to provide measures, and be seen to provide them, which will solve our unemployment problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnRobb" hpid="Mr. Robb Mr. Robb">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Senator Deenihan on the way in which he tried to bring together the two dimensions, the Government on the one hand, and the community on the other.  In recent years we thought that by planning from the centre of the State we could bring about the sort of social change necessary to give people more employment, better health, a better sense of their own esteem, and so on.  At the end of his speech he correctly mentioned that young people would turn to alternative methods of employment.  It would be wrong of me having come from County Antrim, not to say that, in the 14 years of violence we have had, I can think of little that has been more revolting to me than the murder of six people today in a very heightened atmosphere of tension, undoubtedly to provoke the Westminster Government to bring about the reintroduction of hanging in Northern Ireland. The motivation of death to produce judicial death as a pretext for more death is something that all Irishmen who hope for a better Ireland for their children&mdash;that is what we are talking about this afternoon&mdash;should join me in condemning.  I despair when I look at what will be required of society to meet the challenges that have been outlined here this afternoon. We are facing a dramatically changed social scene.  We are entering a new era.  How many of us at local community level are prepared to take up the challenge?  It is easy to give responsibility to the central institutions of the State and those who hold power in them and, in a way, to abdicate one's own personal responsibility, but unless we do something to liberate the talent where it exists, <Col N="1277" /> and to use the resources where they are known, and to use them fairly, we will go nowhere.</P>
      <P>I said once before it was necessary to redefine &ldquo;all men are born equal&rdquo; because in today's highly centralised society that has come to mean, &ldquo;all men should have an equal opportunity to be the same&rdquo;.  In fact, to meet the challenge of this era we must surely look at society and say, &ldquo;all men should have the same opportunity to be different&rdquo;.  How do we find, develop and liberate the uniqueness that is the inheritance of each one of Ireland's citizens?  We will not do that if we emphasise or over-emphasise central planning.  We need central planning to ensure that there is fair play, but unless we move the debate to where it rightly belongs at community level we will miss the whole point of what is necessary to face the sort of challenges which were mentioned this morning and the ones which daily become more and more apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, unfortunately, missed most of Senator Michael D. Higgins's contribution, but knowing him I am certain he must have dealt with the implications of the super technology.  If we are going to espouse super technology and think in terms of employment as we were accustomed to it, we will have an ecological disaster on our hands, let alone also encouraging the forces which Senator O'Toole referred to.  Therefore, we have to accept, as Senators have indicated, that there is no question of wanting more man-woman hours in employment; it is a question of accepting that society might be much better with fewer man-woman hours in employment.  The question then is: how do we cope with the machines, on the one hand, and what do we do with the more woman- and man-hours which become available to us in community, on the other?  There is no greater time to have a new look at radical community socialism than now.  That, to my mind, is what real republicanism is about.  Surely the challenge today is to say, fewer and fewer people will control these large machines or the machines of super technology. Therefore, it becomes more important than ever to ask how are the <Col N="1278" /> profits distributed, how are the products shared and how is the philosophy of the machinery controlled?  Is it to be controlled from the centre dictating the need of the citizen or is the citizen in his community going to determine what his need is and to ensure through an alliance of similar enterprise, of similar scale in different communities how the centre of the State will respond to it?  That is one side of it.  The other side is, what do we do when we suddenly see that there is more time?  Are we to have a life-affirming or a death-pursuing society?  If we are to have a life-affirming society it becomes important as Senators have mentioned, to make a distinction between employment and work straight away and to recognise that all work is valid.  The women's movement, if they have done nothing else, have surely brought home to men that all work is valid.</P>
    <P>Secondly, is there an outlet for that talent I referred to earlier?  Do we have in our educational system the means, let alone the will, to liberate the talents of our young citizens, to develop them for the new world of tomorrow?  When we talk of creative activity and the joy of participation, let us also think about another form of participation and let us face the issues of class and capital because there is no greater challenge to community politics than class and capital.  Many men who identify with community cease to identify it once the interests of class and capital clash with the interests of community.  If we are going to do that we must not just talk about idle participation. It is easy to say.  To fire a question in one's own community takes more courage than to fire a bullet in someone else's. That is of no avail, as we have found in Northern Ireland, unless one has the power to make questioning and the reasoning that goes after the questioning effective.  I beg Senators, and particularly the Minister, to look with imagination and courage at what is needed in Ireland today, to liberate the talent of the people and look at the resources that are available at community level as well as at central level.</P>
    <P>Keynes, who is responsible for the sort of economics Senator Higgins referred <Col N="1279" /> to, talked once about foul is fair and fair is foul for a little longer.  That little longer has lasted a very long time.  It is time we looked freshly at society and asked ourselves if it is the rationalisation of resources with which we have been obsessed, which has led to more and more centralisation but it is not the liberation of resourcefulness which must go with it.  Does that not need a new liberation at community level?</P>
    <P>If we are going to have it we must have a new tax system and I mentioned here before the need for this.  Why not let us give to the communities the money to decide on their own priorities and yet leave in the centre sufficient which can be shifted on a sliding scale from privileged communities to deprived communities.  I throw out figures as an illustration but there is no particular merit in the figures that I use.  If, for example, Ireland was divided in four regions and there were one million people living in each region and we had one tax: 10 per cent went centrally, 20 per cent went to the region and 40 per cent went to the community, we would still have 30 per cent left over to shift on a sliding scale which central Government and central institutions would use to ensure that there was fair or increasingly fair distribution.  That is no good unless we also encourage political participation at local level so that we put our faith and trust in the people to solve their own problems, each with the other, and together enforcing the centre of the State to respond to the need defined by them and no longer to be allowed to continue to dictate on the grounds of expert opinion exclusively what their needs should be.</P>

      <P>I would like at the outset to thank Senators who contributed to this very worthwhile debate and to express my regret that, even with the decision taken by the Seanad, the debate was limited.  It was obvious from a number of the contributions that a great deal of thought, compassion and concern had gone into those contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious from the mail we have <Col N="1280" /> been receiving over the last few days that this debate was attracting a certain degree of interest outside the House.  A number of Senators referred to the briefing material they had received from the National Youth Council of Ireland.  I hope Senators found it useful.  They will agree that the expertise and imagination which was brought to bear is a clear justification of the policy of successive Governments in affording consultative status to the National Youth Council.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators found it helpful to refer to the unemployment situation as it affects our neighbours in Europe.  It would be helpful at the outset to take a brief overview of the scale of youth unemployment in the Communities. While the situation does, of course, differ between one member state and another, the increasing youth unemployment problem is one which is common to the European Communities as a whole.</P>
    <P>For the past five years, the unemployment rate among young people in the European Communities has been more than double that of adults.  At present, out of a total of over 12 million unemployed, more than 4.5 million are young people under 25 years of age.  Young people represent over 40 per cent of the total registered unemployed, despite comprising only about 20 per cent of the total labour force.  The recession has brought about an increase, not only in the rate, but also in the duration of their unemployment: there are over two million young people without a job for over six months.  In addition, almost one and a half million have been without a job for over a year.  The average rate for adult unemployment is about 11 per cent, whereas for young people it is over 20 per cent.  It has been estimated that, in present circumstances, 2.5 million jobs would need to be created in order to bring the average youth unemployment rate down to that of adults.  Where do we fit into that picture?</P>
    <P>Ireland's population is growing at about four times, and its labour force at about twice, the EEC average.  Almost every Senator who contributed said that with 48 per cent under the age of 25 in 1981, Ireland has the youngest population <Col N="1281" /> in Europe.  The numbers reaching school leaving age &mdash; which rose from 50,000 per annum in 1971 to 68,000 in 1979 &mdash; are likely to remain in the region of 67,000 to 70,000 each year throughout the eighties.  There has been increased participation in education by young adults, and this reduced the numbers seeking work at the lower age levels.  The net position however is that the 15 to 24 year old labour force is projected to grow by 3,000 per annum during the eighties.</P>
    <P>Registered youth unemployment has been rising considerably faster than adult unemployment.  In the past year, however, the disparity between the two rates of increase has lessened considerably: in each of the two years to the end of June 1982, the numbers under 25 on the live register increased at about twice the rate for those over 25.  But, in the year to the end of June 1983, youth unemployment grew at just one-and-a-half times the adult rate.  This reduction in the disparity between the two rates of growth undoubtedly reflects the impact of the large increase in the number of places in youth training and employment schemes resulting from the introduction of the youth employment levy, a point to which I shall be returning later in more detail.</P>
    <P>Those figures I have just given serve to underline the magnitude of the problem which, in common with our EC partners, we face in the years ahead.  For our country, the problem is inter-linked with, and exacerbated by, a series of other problems, all arising from the disastrous loss of control over the economic management of our country in previous years.  It is significant that almost all Senators went beyond the narrow brief of youth unemployment and spoke about the problems of job creation and unemployment generally, and some Senators spoke on wider issues.</P>
    <P>This Government have shunned perpetration of the pied piper policies which were being pursued in the past, and which led our people to a very dangerous brink. Instead, with vigour and determination, we have set about correcting the fiscal position which we inherited.  Our efforts to regain an effective measure of control over Ireland's economic future are, even <Col N="1282" /> at this early stage in our term of office, beginning to bear fruit.  A start has been made in restoring order to the public finances; in reducing the crushing burden of our external debt; in halting the decline in competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategies have a clear social objective &mdash; the creation of the conditions in which employment will be available for our people.  Employment is dependent on a lasting return to economic growth with a consequential increase in aggregate labour demand. Economic progress and our desired standard of living can only be well founded on the country producing sufficient competitive marketable products to pay for our imports and other expenditures. That is the reality of our economic situation and we must accept it.</P>
    <P>Young people are among the most vulnerable groups in the labour market, and so unemployment generally has a disproportionate impact on them.  This motion refers to the &ldquo;totally unacceptable levels of youth unemployment&rdquo;.  Our previous record in Government shows that we went beyond talking about &ldquo;unacceptable levels&rdquo;: we recognised that specific measures in favour of young people were urgently required, and we took the necessary action.  We brought forward the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981. Under this Act, the Youth Employment Agency was established, and the youth employment levy was introduced, in March and April of last year respectively.</P>
    <P>What was the situation prior to establishment of the Youth Employment Agency?  Prior to the establishment of the Youth Employment Agency in 1982, there were five main training and employment programmes in existence which where specifically youth-oriented.  These programmes were set up between 1976 and 1978 and they operated a low level of activity, relatively speaking, during that period.  They are: the work experience programme; the community youth training programme; the community training workshops; the temporary grant scheme for youth employment and the environmental improvements scheme.</P>
    <P>These programmes were effective, <Col N="1283" /> within their limited terms of reference, relative to the needs of the time and to the resources then available.  It must be said, however, that they were set up in a somewhat <i>ad hoc</i> fashion.  Consequently, they developed like a patchwork and in an unco-ordinated way which, in turn, hindered full expolitation of their potential. Furthermore, many of the programmes did not appear to do enough to help the disadvantaged young people who were most in need of them.</P>
    <P>Clearly then, there was a need to bring about co-ordination of the activities of the various bodies involved in administering the programmes, in order to maximise the effectiveness both of their operations and use of resources.  The formulation of a comprehensive, overall framework was called for, within which all the bodies in question could work harmoniously to achieve agreed objectives in so far as the youth labour market was concerned.</P>
    <P>The mandate given to the Youth Employment Agency was based on a recognition of the need to effect a unified and concerted a approach to youth training, work experience and employment measures.  The agency was designated as the overall body, under the Minister for Labour, responsible for activities in favour of the young unemployed and for the co-ordination of those activities.  The agency is unique in having an integrated range of responsibilities across all of the services required to give effect to manpower policies for young people between the ages of 15 and 25.  The agency has the key role, not only in relation to co-ordinating existing facilities but, also, their expansion due to the additional financial resources available since the introduction of the youth employment levy.  The proceeds of that levy, being a separate identifiable source of public funding, have the important advantage of facilitating planning on a longer term basis by the agency.</P>
    <P>Let us look then at the activities of the agency and at the first nine months of its existence.  In 1982, during the first nine months of its existence, the Youth Employment Agency directed its attention primarily at the operations of existing <Col N="1284" /> youth programmes, so as to ensure that as many new participants as possible were absorbed according as the programmes expanded throughout the year as the funding from the levy came on stream.  Better information systems were developed too, with the aim of achieving greater precision in the design and targeting of programmes.  The agency also approved financial support for over 50 projects which could not be accommodated within existing programmes.  Those projects were, in the main, established at community level for disadvantaged groups and areas.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1982, the agency published a document entitled &ldquo;A Policy Framework for the Eighties,&rdquo; which outlined some of the main features of the context within which the agency will be working over this decade, and the main policy directions which it will follow in the light of those considerations.  The document pointed to the fact that there is virtually no area critical to the overall objectives of the agency where bodies with whom it can co-operate do not already exist and to the fact that, in some cases at least, the programmes through which the objectives of the agency can be achieved are already in place.  It was in that context that the agency believed it important for it to provide a coherent set of objectives and principles on which it, and indeed other bodies, could plan and implement their activities.</P>
    <P>The first agency initiative during 1983 which I should like to highlight is the establishment, in the near future, of six demonstration projects at community level, which will integrate the activities of education, training, recruitment, job creation and local authorities.  That is a development of particular interest to Senator Robb whose contribution touched on that area.  The projects are based on the setting up of Community Training and Employment Consortia &mdash; Senators will be glad to know they will not be expected to remember that mouthful, that those agencies already have an abbreviated name to label themselves with, COMTECs.  COMTECs will be representative of all local manpower and community interests.  The agency organised <Col N="1285" /> a seminar only last month to enable its proposals in this regard to be fully discussed by interested State, education, local authority, employer, trade union, youth and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>At that COMTECs seminar, the agency pinpointed the integration and co-ordination of existing youth programmes as being a major element in increasing the value young people get from the large public expenditure now being devoted to these programmes through introduction of the youth employment levy.  The agency sees this involving, in essence, the development of a &ldquo;single shop window&rdquo;, where young people can have access, at one point, to information on all of the range of options open to them, so that they can make informed choices between those options. Again it is fair to say that it is very close to ideas outlined by the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Honan, in her contribution.</P>
    <P>The need for a single focus of this kind, which the agency has identified, relates not only to the young unemployed and school-leavers, but also to the increasing number of community organisations on whom the public programmes depend for co-operation.  The rapid expansion of public training and employment programmes has given them a significant role in the transition period between education and working life.  The vast majority of those participating in programmes are teenagers some of the older participants are recent leavers from third level colleges.  The National Manpower Service survey of school-leavers in 1982 showed that one-fifth of all school-leavers in 1981 who did not go on to third level education participated in either AnCO training or the work experience programme during their first year out of school.</P>
    <P>In its proposals for COMTECs, the agency is, therefore, looking towards the establishment or reinforcement of a number of links &mdash; firstly between those bodies responsible for the operation of youth training and employment programmes; secondly, between those bodies, young people and community groups; and, thirdly, between the bodies and the <Col N="1286" /> educational system, to which their work now relates very closely.  That link between the educational system and the world of work occupied the minds of many Senators.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment among young people has grown during the present recession.  In April 1980, there were fewer than 7,000 persons aged under 25 registered as unemployed for more than six months.  By October 1982, this figure had risen to over 16,000.  Available information suggests and it would be the view of most people in this House, that, after six months out of work, people find it increasingly difficult to re-enter employment.  People with the lowest level of skills and education predominate this group to a greater degree than among the unemployed overall.</P>
    <P>In accordance with its mandate to provide for increased penetration for youth training and employment schemes among disadvantaged youth, the Youth Employment Agency has recognised the need to give priority access, for the longer term young unemployed, to the range of such schemes provided for young people generally. Over 1983, the objective of the agency will be to move towards a situation where recruitment will take place exclusively from among this group for the programmes providing employment on community and environmental facilities. The intention, too, is that up to 50 per cent of existing training places for young people will be devoted, progressively, to those out of work for longer periods.</P>
    <P>In developing programmes aimed at aiding job creation, the agency has had to take account of the variety of public incentives and aids already in existence. These include not only the grants and tax incentives provided for industrial development, but also a number of training programmes of the &ldquo;start up your own business&rdquo; type.</P>
    <P>The agency's specific brief in the job creation field relates to community and youth enterprise.  In this connection, the agency had two reviews carried out on its behalf &mdash; one, of the process of local employment creation; the other, of the financial situation facing communities and young individuals, including access <Col N="1287" /> to grant and/or loan finance.  Arising from these reviews, the agency has now developed proposals for two programmes &mdash; the community and youth enterprise programme, and the loan guarantee schemes.</P>
    <P>The community and youth enterprise programme, which is due to be launched next Tuesday, is an imaginative and potentially significant contribution to the creation of economically sustainable employment.  It is not being presented by the agency as a short-term panacea for youth unemployment.  Rather it is seen as a means of unlocking a hitherto unexploited potential for job creation.  In this, as in other areas, the agency has, as a matter of policy, decided to engage only in activities which complement, rather than compete with, the activities of other bodies.</P>
    <P>Under the community and youth enterprise programme, the agency will fund the employment by local groups with an approved project of a community enterprise worker for a set period to help to assess the viability of the project.  The programme arises from the identification of a need for outside technical resources to help local groups take projects from the ideas to the implementation stage. The need may vary, from assessing the market for a product which it is known can be produced locally, to examining the possibility of local production for a known market.</P>
    <P>Individuals and small local projects often face difficulties in access to loan finance for small amounts of working capital. The agency's proposals for the two loan guarantee schemes would involve it in part-guaranteeing bank loans to such projects.  Negotiations are now under way with the major clearing banks, with a view to implementation of the schemes. When agreement has been reached, the agency intend to launch a major marketing campaign to inform the public, development officers and local community officers of the existence of the schemes.</P>
    <P>Pending development of the loan guarantee schemes, the agency is continuing to examine job-creation proposals from <Col N="1288" /> individuals and groups on a case-by-case basis.  As a result, grant assistance has been approved for a number of co-operative projects, as well as for a subsidy scheme to encourage the employment of technical and marketing graduates in small firms.  Senator Honan and others mentioned the co-operative sector. These aids have led, to date, to the creation of over 200 full-time employment places, most of which are now filled.  In all cases, the projects are aimed at generating jobs which will be sustainable without further public assistance.</P>
    <P>The agency is also supporting three pilot projects providing back-up resources for young people starting their own enterprises.  The first of these comprises programmes in Cork and Finglas, which provide, over a 12-month period, training in basic business skills, &ldquo;incubator space&rdquo; in which to initiate the enterprise, and continuing advice.  There is also Youth Enterprises Shannon, which provides similar services for three groups in Limerick, Nenagh and Shannon as part of an EC-supported project.  The third project is the Waterford Resource Centre for Co-operatives which, while still in its formative stages, is designed to develop small co-operative groups of young people providing goods and services for the local market.  From these experiences, the agency intend to provide a basic model for resource centres with defined agency supports, which would be available for general application in 1984.</P>
    <P>The agency's support for the expansion of State-aided youth training, work experience and employment programmes will continue in 1983.  I shall be returning to this aspect when I come to give Senators a picture of the significant impact of levy funding on the expansion of these programmes.  The agency has also been focusing on improved access to training for disadvantaged teenagers, through extension of the network of community training workshops.  These teenagers are young travelling people, and young people, mainly in inner city or, large suburban areas, who have left the educational system relatively early. Almost one in ten young people leave school without qualifications, and the <Col N="1289" /> unemployment rate among this group is now over 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The innovative characteristic of the youth employment levy lies, as I have mentioned, in its being a separate source of funding, devoted solely to youth training and employment schemes.  Senator Smith suggested there was a fear that the levy was being used by the Government to replace existing funds.  That is not so and an examination of where the money has been expended since the creation of the agency puts that beyond any doubt. Introduction of the levy, under the 1981 Act, was designed to bring about a substantial increase in expenditure on such schemes&mdash;which has happened&mdash;so as to ensure that they could be expanded to meet the need arising from the rapidly rising levels of youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>An overview of the expenditure and participation levels in relation to the schemes, from 1981&mdash;the year prior to introduction of the levy&mdash;to 1983 will indicate the extent to which our objective is being met.</P>
    <P>In 1981, £19 million was spent on youth training and employment schemes.  In 1982, during the first nine months in which the levy became payable, expenditure rose to some £35 million.  This year, the first full collection year for the levy, expenditure is expected to reach in the region of £77 million.  Senators will appreciate that, due to the constraints on the public finances, increases in funding of that magnitude would not be likely to have taken place in the absence of the introduction of the levy.</P>
    <P>In 1981, 22,478 young people participated in the major youth training and employment schemes then in operation. Participation rose by 50 per cent to some 32,500 in 1982.  In 1983, the number of participants is expected to be over 45,000: in other words, double the number participating in 1981.  The average number of participants at any time &mdash; which is a better measure of activity levels &mdash; has increased more rapidly, from 7,500 in 1981 to over 20,000 in 1983.  This is because programmes such as the work experience programme which last for longer periods of up to six months, have expanded relatively rapidly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> The Youth Employment Agency, as we have seen, look in general to existing bodies as opposed to assuming an executive role itself.  For that reason, in addition to the agency, the principal beneficiary bodies where the levy is concerned have, to date, been: the Department of Labour, in respect of the work experience programme, the grant scheme for youth employment and, this year, the youth element of the employment incentive scheme; the Department of the Environment, in respect of the environmental improvements scheme operated by the local authorities: the Department of Education, this year, in respect of the pre-employment and secretarial courses; AnCO, in respect of apprenticeship training, community workshops, the community youth training programme and adult courses for unemployed people of which 70 per cent of the participants are now under 25; and CERT.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to mention that last February the Youth Employment Agency set up a review group to examine the operation of a number of publicly-funded schemes, including the work experience programme &mdash; Senator Honan mentioned this &mdash; under which young people are placed with employers. The National Manpower Service, the FUE and ICTU are represented on the review group.  A primary concern of the group is to identify the impact of work experience placements on the operation of the Labour market, that is the possible displacement of permanent workers by young persons participating in the schemes; and to make proposals for minimisation of any adverse side effects which may exist.  If any Member of the Seanad is aware of a case where this or any other scheme is being abused and young people exploited, I appeal to them to come forward so that action can be taken to weed out such abuses.  I have indicated already that Senator Smith was incorrect in suggesting that the levy was replacing funding from the Social Fund or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>However, aid from the European Social Fund is of course of considerable assistance though it is not in any way confined to programmes for young people.  The fund has contributed in large <Col N="1291" /> measure to the rate of development of our vocational training facilities generally over the past decade.  Grant approvals from the fund for Ireland have increased each year from over £4 million in the year we joined to an expected £130 million in 1983.  I am sure Senators will understand the crucial importance for Ireland of the successful outcome of the recently completed review of the rules governing the fund.  I am pleased to be associated in a minor way with the role played by the Minister for Labour on behalf of the Government in securing the solution which emerged at the meeting last month of the European Communities Social Affairs Minister in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects of the final package which deserve to be singled out.  First, with effect from 1984, a legally guaranteed 40 per cent of the fund will, for the first time, be reserved for regions, including Ireland, of absolute priority within the European Community.  Secondly &mdash; and this perhaps has more direct reference to the motion &mdash; 75 per cent of the budget for the fund will, subject to concertation with the European Parliament, be allocated to programmes in favour of young people.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go on at any great length because I know that Senator Smith has to reply, but I think it would be appropriate at this stage to link in my treatment of the Government's response to the need to alleviate youth unemployment with the initiative emanating from the European Community known as the Social Guarantee, to which Senator Higgins made reference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be finished before then.  The Social Guarantee was agreed recently by the European Community Joint Council of Social Affairs and Education Ministers.  It is a central feature of the Community's vocational training policy as outlined in the resolution agreed by the member states.  The resolution commits member states within <Col N="1292" /> the next five years (1) to do their utmost to ensure that, following compulsory education, all interested young people can benefit from at least six months' full time training and/or work experience; and (2) to pursue efforts designed to make vocational training available to young people who are without adequate qualifications and particularly those who are looking for work.  The Government will see to it that the resolution is implemented as soon as possible.  The social guarantee element, which is to involve a five year programme of action, is being referred to the Youth Employment Agency for achievement as part of a national youth employment policy within the five years specified.</P>
      <P>I conclude by thanking Senators for the attention that they have given this matter and to assure them that some of the other issues they have raised, in particular the whole question of the transition from youth to working life, will be the subject of consideration by the recently announced national youth policy committee which is to begin work shortly.</P>

      <P>I had indicated that I wished to speak, but because of my inexperience I also expected to be called. Unfortunately, the Minister had commenced his speech and I did not like to interrupt him.  I am concerned that the joint committees as announced did not also include a joint committee on youth affairs under which youth employment, crime, the drugs problem, education and leisure and so on could have been included and discussed on a joint all-party committee basis.  I should like specifically to ask the Minister, although I do not know whether I am in order in expecting a reply, if there is any move from his Department regarding the setting up of a joint all-party committee on youth affairs.</P>

      <P>While I accept everything that has been said in general about youth, I am sick to the teeth of the phrase &ldquo;our educated unemployed youth.&rdquo;  As a teacher, I can see every advantage in education, in case Senator Smith comes <Col N="1293" /> back on me, but I do not think it helps people to enjoy unemployment.</P>
      <P>I agree that the option of early retirement should be given.  There are many people in jobs at the moment in which the whole scene has changed &mdash; for example, teaching.  Many people who started teaching 20 and 30 years ago find themselves in a completely different scene at this stage.  Many of them might very willingly retire at an earlier age but they have to work for 40 years to receive full pensions.  Perhaps politicians should retire, earlier, but I suppose politics is a disease and it would need a new antibiotic to get rid of some of us.</P>

The whole question of unemployment is so serious that it is almost impossible to separate it from other problems.  To keep repeating that we are going to have an explosive situation because of youth unemployment is not going to help in the slightest.  I worry that that sort of talk encourages youth to riot.  There is no easy solution to the unemployment of youth. I have been disjointed in my efforts to be brief.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister and Senators from all sides who contributed to this very important debate.  I asked in the beginning that we should try to lift this debate above the normal political bashing that can take place on motions of this kind.  I am very glad that, with one <Col N="1294" /> or two exceptions, speakers confined themselves to addressing this question in a very sincere and courageous way.</P>
    <P>I should like, just before I make a few general comments, to deal with the question which was raised on this side of the House on the matter of attitudes towards the employment of married women.  We have gone through a long history of liberalising systems, regulations and laws with regard to trying to have equality as between the sexes.  I doubt very much if the eighties or nineties will be the time to redress some of the social objectives that have been achieved in this area.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Government's strategies have a clear social objective &mdash; creation of the conditions in which employment will be available for our people.  Employment is dependent on a lasting return to economic growth with a consequential increase in aggregate labour demand.  Economic progress and our desired standard of living can only be well founded on the country producing sufficient competitive marketable products to pay for our imports and other expenditures.  That is the reality of our economic situation and we must accept it.</P>
    <P>I can take most of that paragraph and understand it, but I am afraid I cannot accept it because the tenor of my contribution and the contributions of a number of Senators from all sides pointed to our ever-increasing numbers of young people, and looking at what all conventional, economic thinking has been able to do in this regard, I am led to the belief that unless we are far more radical about this question there is no way we are going to cope with this problem on the basis of the conventional economics.</P>
    <P>That is why in the beginning I put a number of questions to the Minister in relation to broader policy issues outside the Youth Employment Agency.  I purposely did not lay undue emphasis in my contribution on the Youth Employment Agency because I feel that any youth employment agency, whatever powers or whatever funds it has, can only make a very small contribuiton in this overall <Col N="1295" /> area of finding job opportunities, changing stereotyped attitudes towards longstanding economic thinking and in general fostering a new attitude towards how we look at work, and how we prepare ourselves for the future, a future which we hope will give job opportunities to all people of different classes and creeds and of different capacities right throughout our community.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister fell into the trap of believing that the Youth Employment Agency is the only source, because he refers to it in that way.  I am afraid that my motion, whether it was phrased wrongly or not, is a wider contribution in the context of this overall and very desperate problem facing the community. For that reason I have to say at the outset that the Minister is very clearly a young man, and a man who obviously has a bright political future ahead of him.  But if his prospects of retaining his job are enshrined in his speech, then I am afraid no matter what his capacity is, he is going to join this long queue.</P>

      <P>I do not want to treat this matter frivolously because it is far too serious, but I put it to him that as far as I am concerned and, I think, many other Senators we are disappointed that the Minister confined his contribution to this narrow range of activities in the provision of youth employment.  We are going to have further debates in this House, and arising from the success of this debate in the sense of the numbers of people who have contributed and the sincerity with which they contributed, I am very concerned about this matter and I am going to see that there is a follow-up.  There is no point in just having the debate today and having no follow-up.  We will invite Minister back at another time to deal with much broader questions than he actually dealt with in the course of this debate.  A number of issues were raised. Points were made by Senator Robb with regard to decentralisation.  He asked why give more power or more funds to the central executive which has already <Col N="1296" /> proved itself incapable and paralytic when it comes to coping with regional and local community demands?  We are going back there because that is where the power is at the moment.  If we could find a way &mdash; and we referred to this in previous debates on other matters &mdash; to transfer to the community real power in the decision-making process that affects their own lives, certainly we would support that and we would like to see it.</P>
      <P>There was another area that I questioned the Minister on, that is, whether these levies, however harsh and inequitable, are replacing funds from EEC and Exchequer sources.  English is a strange language.  It can say the same thing in three different ways and somehow or other, I wonder if the Minister has joined an illustrious profession that are able to say the same thing differently and go back and say that it was not said at all, because the simple facts are that while the Minister said it is not being used he then went on to mention the whole range of areas that the levies have been transferred to: State bodies, the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO, CERT, IDA, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the National Rehabilitation Board and the health boards.</P>

      <P>While the amounts of money being spent on the Youth Employment Agency is substantially greater than it was, it is not anything close to the amounts of money accruing to the State from the 1 per cent levy.  The balance is going into the areas I have mentioned or somewhere else.  If the Minister wants proof of that, I will come to page 20.  If what I am saying is not right I want to put this extract from his speech to the Minister:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1297" /> I shall confine myself, at this stage, to saying that there would seem to be a strong case to support the view that the question of allocation of levy proceeds is central to underpinning the co-ordination role of the Agency.</P>
    <P>If there is a task force set up to deal with these matters, and I am aware of some fairly strong arguments going on between AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency, I am afraid most arguments in this country are sometimes about land, though more often about money, and in this case I think I will be proved right. The more the State uses that levy to fund these crucial areas the less pressure we will be able to put on EEC sources and the less real work we will be able to do with the funds that are provided.</P>
    <P>I served as Minister of State and I know what the Department of Finance are like when it comes to getting a grip on matters of this kind.  That is why I want to see to the fullest possible extent these funds used exclusively for this overriding consideration. I am not happy that the Minister's answers are in accordance, I am not going to say in accordance with fact, because there are different ways of putting things, and one can argue that all of these funds are actually going to youth training or youth education or youth employment in some shape or form; what I am saying is there were existing schemes prior to the levy.  They were being funded by Exchequer sources.  These sources were being got from somewhere and now they are being replaced by the levy.  That is the point I am making.  I do not see any heads shaking and sometimes that means that I am fairly close to being right.  I am putting it to the Minister that we want to see a change here.</P>

      <P>The fundamental point I want to make and the one that I want to conclude on is that we will be coming back here again.  I would support Senator McAuliffe on setting up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee. I am loath to talk about another committee but we need one in which people would be actively promoting and wanting to see radical change in this area. If this represents ultimate Government thinking in this regard then we have a long way to go.  This motion highlighted a problem but has not succeeded in penetrating the depths of thinking of the Government on this matter.  We have to keep on fighting and keep arguing that there is a range of other options which we are going to have to consider in a far more radical and far-seeing way.</P>
      <P>With those final words, I would again like to thank everybody for their contributions and let us hope that we will see an improvement in the existing situation. Points were made about society and breakdown in law and order and matters of this kind.  We cannot turn a blind eye to these possibilities.  At the same time I have confidence in our young people, but this political system and the democratic process must reflect the genuine need for change.  Radical changes will be necessary if we are to put the young people in employment for any reasonable length of time.  No matter what other schemes are introduced, that must be our overriding consideration. That must be a priority.  Let us hope that we all can contribute in all sincerity to the changes that will make that possible in the fairly near future.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
