      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Robinson that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The facilities available to battered wives and their children at Brú Chaoimhín, Cork Street.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Nos. 1 and 2 are substantive motions in regard to two committees.  This matter was fully discussed on the expediency motions last week and I do not think they will detain the House for long.  Item No. 3 is the continuation of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill and we hope to conclude Second Stage and possibly take Committee Stage.  There has been no indication so far of anyone wishing to put down amendments.  No. 4 is the debate on developments in the EEC. This is a Government motion and therefore, there is no restriction in regard to time of debate or time for individual <Col N="836" /> speakers.  We will take this motion today; if the legislative business is not concluded by 2 p.m. we should debate the EEC motion from 2 p.m. if necessary up to 5 p.m.  I suggest we take the normal break from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed this Bill yesterday. The community service order is seen as another sanction available to the courts, in addition to the current sanctions. In the light of the discussions which have taken place here, it is important that yet again the inadequacies of many of the sanctions should be put on record, in particular the fact that all over western society, not just in this country, imprisonment and prisons have been seen to be an increasingly ineffective and expensive sanction for offenders.  Somewhere in the region of 60 per cent of prisoners have been in prison at least once before, which seems to give the lie considerably &mdash; unless there are many more of us with criminal intent who would otherwise be engaged in criminal activity &mdash; to the idea that imprisonment is a major sanction. For those of us with reasonably secure social and economic backgrounds and with a stake in society, prison may well look like a dreadful deterrent, but for people who have been in prison once, the deterrent value of prison ceases.  Prison <Col N="846" /> should be seen more as a reserved power than as a sanction which can work.</P>
      <P>It has been reported to me by somebody whose honesty I do not question, that in the view of the governor of one of our prisons over 50 per cent of prisoners would be better off in psychiatric hospitals and that their problems fundamentally were not problems of criminality but were psychiatric and social.  He felt the appropriate place for their detention should have been a psychiatric hospital, not a prison.  We lack a considerable amount of imagination about our prisons. In Denmark, for instance, there has been a quite successful programme of detoxification and treatment of vagrant alcoholics within the prison system.  Vagrant alcoholics take up a disproportionate number of beds, places or spaces in the prison service.  Something could be done there.</P>
      <P>I would remind Senators that we are a Christian community and the welfare of prisoners has traditionally been a major concern of Christians.  The sort of vengeance attitude that very often people concerned about law and order talk about, in terms of locking criminals up and throwing away the key, is a direct attack on the fundamental values of the culture to which we all give some allegiance.  Jean Vanier referred to prisoners as some of the wounded members of society.  That is not in any way to show a lack of sympathy for the victims of crime.  Anybody who has seen violence in action or been the victim of violence will know how horrifying the experience is even in a marginal way, for an individual.  Even for a relatively big, strong man like myself or the Minister, the experience of violence is a terrifying thing.  For a vulnerable old or young person the impact must be quite horrifying.  If one talks in defence of prisoners and their rights one is not in any way playing down the damage they have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of the welfare of offenders the Department of Justice Probation and Welfare Service deserves to be complimented. I, with my usual suspicion of that Department until recent years, did not think much of it, but as I have got to know it and as I have seen the quality of <Col N="847" /> people recruited into it and participated in it, and as I have seen the considerable imagination in terms of the training people have been offered, and the secondments offered to people to do certificate and social work courses, I have to pay tribute to the work of the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    <P>There is another organisation which I only recently came to know but which deserves to be complimented, and the Department of Justice's enlightened attitude to that organisation deserves to be commended, and that is, the Prisoners' Aid to Community Effort or PACE.  It is a very successful organisation which gets substantial funding from the Department of Justice.  But they could probably increase their activity tenfold if tenfold increases in funding were available to them.  It is a matter for regret that in this whole area, only a tiny proportion of the expenditure in the Department of Justice goes on the welfare of offenders, but what is being spent is being spent effectively.</P>
    <P>In the context of paying compliments, it is painful to have to record the extraordinarily negative attitude of the Department of Justice and successive Ministers for Justice to another organisation which works effectively and very constructively for and with prisoners, that is, the Prisoners' Rights Organisation.  I have never understood the harassment of that organisation. Some of their members are ex-offenders, and possibly will be future offenders, but this does not justify the extraordinary attitude &mdash; almost paranoia &mdash; towards that organisation.  That organisation have done a lot to awaken public opinion about conditions in our prison service.  For any reform minded Minister for Justice &mdash; the Ministers for Justice I have known in my political career have always laid claim to be reform minded &mdash; the enlightenment of public opinion by concerned organisations should be a positive factor in his work.  I regret therefore, the almost blanket refusal of the Department of Justice and successive Ministers for Justice to discuss anything with the Prisoners' Rights Organisation and the harassment <Col N="848" /> of that organisation by sections of the security and intelligence branches of the Garda Síochána.  It is both unnecessary and a waste of Garda resources.  As a former executive member of the Prisoners' Rights Organisation I would like to state my full support and my full confidence in the leadership of that organisation to operate within the law and to say there is no subversive intent involved in that organisation.</P>
    <P>The concept of community service as involved in the Bill raises the whole question of community.  Many people from very differing political perspectives are beginning to realise that a large part of the problem of crime in our society results from the almost absolute lack of the sense of community in major urban areas and the idea of returning people to the community from which they came to perform a positive service is what is envisaged here.  During a discussion before I came here a colleague made a valid point: he said if people do community service orders they have to be seen to do something which is constructive, valuable and useful to the community. The question of community is directly related to the inadequacy of law enforcement in many areas.  It raises the question that I have raised before, and which has been raised by the present Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, that is, the acceptability of our current law enforcement agencies in certain communities. Any proposals that will restore the acceptability of the law enforcement agencies in many of our urban communities is to be welcomed.  Imaginatively used, these orders could produce precisely that effect, but we have a long way to go.  The way to turn the tide of crime in urban areas in particular, is the renewed acceptability of the Garda as a community-based law enforcement agency.  There has been far too much of the &ldquo;Z Cars&rdquo; image portrayed, which is probably necessary in the areas of subversive crime &mdash; whatever that is &mdash; and security linked crimes, but in the areas of urban crime and urban alienation, a totally different policing approach, which could be linked to these community <Col N="849" /> service orders, will be the way forward, not more laws, more orders and more police.</P>
    <P>I again welcome the principles contained in this Bill, and look forward to their outcome and to their implementation in detail.  I have only one small reservation about the Bill, and it is one I am sure the Minister is aware of, that is the peculiar anomaly whereby in the case of community service orders the justice must seek the advice of a probation officer, but in all other areas it is entirely a matter for his discretion.  There are certain categories &mdash; particularly offenders under 21 or first offenders &mdash; where it would be no harm to extend the obligation to seek the advice and the assessment of a probation and welfare officer, but it is anomalous that it is only in the area of community service orders that justices must seek the advice of probation or welfare officers.  There are, as a result, very peculiar anomalies between one District Court and another and the way the District Justices use the probation service. With that small reservation I welcome the Bill, and congratulate the Minister on it and hope it works very successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Second Stage debate gives us an opportunity of examining the whole range of options available to us under the general heading of community service.  It also gives us an opportunity of indicating our concern that any future legislation in this area should have the same practical type of approach as is shown in this legislation and to recommend to the Minister that he give some consideration to the various points which we will be making on the Second and Committee Stages, both from the point of view of this legislation and any amending legislation which may come before us in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my own behalf I welcome the Bill because it makes an important contribution towards the variety of punishments available to a court dealing with offences of a minor nature.  If I have any doubts about the practicality of the legislation, it does not arise because of the system which is laid down in the Bill before us, but because of the necessity for the court <Col N="850" /> to make a deliberate choice that it is going to use the community service order technique in dealing with offenders.  This will set a fashion to either use it extensively or not at all.  If district justices understand the legislation fully &mdash; other judges can do so too but by and large this would apply to matters coming before district justices &mdash; and understand the possibilities of the legislation, then it can be used.  I recommend that the district justices enthusiastically utilise the legislation, at least in the initial stages, to see whether it can make a contribution towards this recurring problem of what to do with people who breach one of the rules of our community but not in such a fundamental fashion that restricting their liberty is going to be a sufficient deterrent, but because there is the possibility that the offenders will only be disimproved by being locked up in prison for a time.</P>
    <P>If a person robs a bank or commits murder, the overwhelming majority of people would agree that restricting the liberty of that individual is a good thing and we should have a prejudice in favour of doing that.  Of course, there will always be exceptional cases where it is not appropriate.  That type of crime which fits into the period when young people are trying to assert themselves within the community, trying to establish what their role is and showing by their actions their independence from the previous generation, results from a desire to show independence rather than any real desire to break the law.  A lot of the joyriding that takes place is not criminal in the ordinary sense of the word, but an expression of the desire of these young people to participate in what they see to be the good things in life, by being mobile, with all the added social advantages that being mobile confers on those who own cars. These sort of offences could be properly dealt with in this way.  The type of punishment could be more gentle than that which restricts the liberty of an individual or which makes them the subject of ridicule and is a constant reminder of their past misdeeds if they end up in jail again.</P>
    <P>Having spoken in that vein and having agreed with the philosophy of the Bill the <Col N="851" /> Minister has said everything I wanted to say about that.  There are one or two aspects of the Bill which concern me and which I will be taking up in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I would like to put the Minister on notice with regard to the points I am going to make.  The conditions required for the making of a community service order are laid out in section 4 which says that the court must be satisfied, having considered the offender's circumstances, that the offender is a suitable person to perform work under the order.  It is only right and proper that they should satisfy themselves. There is a precondition that it should be an offence for which the court would be of the opinion that but for this legislation the offence would be one for which a sentence of penal servitude or detention in St. Patrick's Institution would be the normal appropriate sentence. If the court is happy that there should be a custodial sentence in the absence of this Bill, the court satisfies itself that the offender is a suitable person and then seeks the consent of the offender &mdash; the Minister explained we must do that to ensure that we are not getting involved in a slave labour situation.</P>
    <P>The nature of this consent is something I wish to put to the Minister.  Consent is a very delicate flower.  You cannot say somebody has consented unless you put the options clearly before him and I do not see this provision in the Bill.  If the district justice has already decided that this would be an appropriate case to send somebody to prison but for this legislation and that the person is suitable to do this work, then he seeks the consent of the offender.  But before seeking the consent of the offender, the district justice has to explain to him the consequences of his accepting the community service order and the consequences which might follow and if he does not obey the community service order.  What the district justice does not have to explain to him are the consequences of not opting for a community service order.  The district justice does not have to say to the offender, that if he does not accept the <Col N="852" /> community service order, he will go to jail for one month, three months, six months or one year.  Is that really consent at all?</P>
    <P>Very often in the type of offences dealt with under this Bill, a short custodial sentence of seven days to one month will be in the mind of the court.  The theoretical custodial sentence which would be available to the court in respect of the conviction might be as high as 12 months in the case of a District Court, or considerably longer in the case of a Circuit Court.  The situation is then that the unfortunate offender &mdash; and I use the word &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; because he is unfortunately in that condition, whether it was through his own fault or any other reason &mdash; has to make the decision whether to accept the community service order without the full knowledge of what the alternative is.  Can he really be taken to have consented when he could say at a later date if he falls foul of his community service order and is charged with an offence that he had not consented?  I could imagine some inventive lawyer saying this man never really consented because he did not know what the alternative was. It may have been that the judge would only have sent him to jail for seven days, which he would have preferred.  The only reason this man accepted the community service order was because there was a possibility of him going to jail for 12 months.  In those circumstances, it would be proper for the court to present the options to the offender.</P>
    <P>This could be done in two ways.  We could add to section 4 (b) the words that prior to ascertaining whether the offender is consenting, the court shall inform the offender of the actual sentence which will be imposed if he does not consent.  Alternatively, a new paragraph (d) could be added to section 4 which would read: The alternative sentence which will be imposed if he does not consent ... That would be an additional requirement and there would be a necessity to ensure that that alternative sentence would not limit the power of the court to deal with offences under section 8 (1) (a) and 8 (2).  In other words, if the alternative sentence was put to the <Col N="853" /> offender and the offender decided to accept the community service order, and if he was in breach of the community service order at a later date, one of the options open to the court would be to send him back for sentencing for his original offence.  At that stage, the potential alternative sentence should not confine the court in these circumstances.  I feel very strongly that there will be a case made, and it will only be made where there is a dispute, that the offender cannot have consented unless he has full information.  In those circumstances, the Minister should make some amendment to cover that point.</P>
    <P>There is another point on the details of the legislation which I will be raising on Committee Stage, but it is an important point of principle.  The effect of section 7 and section 9 combined is that the work under a community service order must be completed within 12 months, but under section 9 there is a provision for an extension of time for the performance of work under a community service order when that is appropriate.  Section 7 (2) lays down that the community service order, even though it is out of time from the point of view of doing work should not lapse.  We could have the situation where the court extends the period of time for the completion of the work, and the community service order remains in force. There is no method by which it can be revoked other than the offender going to the court under the provision of section 11, or the probation officer doing the same but there would be a hiatus.  An offender could become sick, or there could be a good, legitimate reason for him not completing the volume of work under the community service order, or he might go to England.  That kind of thing is going to happen because many of the people we are talking about are very mobile.  If the offenders go to England there may still be offences outstanding against them, and next time they come back to this country they will be charged with the offences.  Many of these people do not have very deep roots in the community.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation the community service order could remain in force for an <Col N="854" /> indefinite period.  I do not agree with that.  The community service order should lapse automatically after a period of a few years because nobody is going to be given a community service order in respect of a very serious offence.  We would not like a situation to arise where if somebody applies for a job 20 years later there would be still a community service order against him which has never been revoked because the work scheduled under it was never completed.  It is important that that matter be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is an excellent piece of legislation. It is obviously going to give us a lot of opportunity of ascertaining not only the value of a different approach towards penal sentencing, but also an opportunity of assessing the willingness of the Judiciary to co-operate with this kind of imaginative approach towards penal reform.</P>
    <P>The question of whether or not additional legislative provisions are necessary to ensure this more enlightened approach towards dealing with trivial offences should be examined.  We will get an opportunity of considering that point when we see the response of the various judges and district justices to this legislation over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  In doing so, I see the Minister as a person concerned about our present awful crime rate.  This Bill has a new or changed tone about it.  I understand that we are trying to find alternative ways of dealing with convicted persons, or offenders as is the wording in the Minister's speech, to find new remedies and a different type of sentence and I sincerely hope it works.  I would like to know where the Minister is going to get the people to make it work, or to get places for these people when we decide to give them work rather than other sentences, when one considers the present rate of unemployment, even if we are talking about giving them unpaid work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill certainly cannot stand on its own and Seanad Éireann cannot dismiss its responsibilities in connection with the <Col N="855" /> present serious problems of violence and lawlessness.  We cannot support this Bill for any reason other than that it is part of further legislation to follow and I am glad to hear from the Minister that is so.  We need a wider plan to combat crime.  The Bill should come into force as part of a determined plan to make law-breaking unprofitable and to deal with the loopholes in the existing law, the Judges Rules and bail.  These, I understand, will be included in the next Bill, but should be mentioned in any Bill.</P>
    <P>Will we get results from the Bill? Nobody is more aware than the Minister that young and old are worried and are looking to us as politicians to take action against the crime rate.  I noted that Senator O'Leary mentioned the stealing of cars as something that the lads around the towns or cities want to do because other people older than they had cars and were mobile.  It is fine to take that line, but in the present situation as an elected Member of this House I will not be seen as going soft on any criminals &mdash; whether they be 15 or 50.  The introduction of this Bill could be regarded as a softening of our attitudes towards offenders at a time of rising crime.  With all support for what the Minister is trying to do, in fairness to us and indeed to the people who are looking to us for leadership, we should not be seen to take a soft line on any type of crime.</P>
    <P>In 1980, the number of offences known to the Garda was 72,782 mainly made up of offences against persons and property, including violence and larceny.  Only 29,017 or 39.9 per cent of these crimes were detected.  These are the figures and whether you are bringing in one Bill with another to follow, we are the protectors of society and when everybody else is knocking us, it is time to stand up and shoulder our responsibilities.  It is clear, in any event, that serious crime is on the increase.  I am confused as to whether serious crime is the subject of this or the forthcoming Bill.</P>
    <P>The stealing of a handbag with a person's month's salary or wages in it is not a small crime as far as the victim is concerned. I call them wages, but allowance <Col N="856" /> is the posh word I hear lately.  That may be all that person has and that must be taken into account in this Bill.  The chances of being punished for serious wrong-doing are lessening and now may not be the time for softening such punishment as the courts have a chance of imposing.  Each of our past four Ministers from all the main political parties has recognised this.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for introducing this new Criminal Justice Bill to try to rectify the situation and to prevent certain offenders from getting bail.  Here again I am stymied because bail is included in the next Bill.  We must take a more determined approach in dealing with the serious problem of increasing crime, with more arrests, more successful prosecutions and more offenders being sentenced by the courts.  This immediately presents another problem.  We all know that there is no room in the prisons any more.  Last year 1,200 persons were released from prison by the Minister for Justice before their sentences were completed, not because of any recognised remission or parole, but solely because cells were occupied and needed for other clients.  The Minister realised that he had to bring in some other type of treatment for these people.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan's figure for persons in jail needing psychiatric attention for mental illness if it is correct is frightening. I am sure that the Minister will correct it if it is wrong.  Last week when I was speaking on the Courts-Martial Appeals Bill I mentioned the need for an examination of mental illness in the Army and we have two Departments which may need to take an extra look at this matter.  The Minister for Defence ignored my remarks.  We are all human and one would wonder how somebody in prison for a long time could remain really sane.</P>
    <P>I notice from this Bill that the offender has the choice of doing community work. Here again, I see a softening of our attitude. To give a choice to somebody who has committed some pretty horrific crime seems to be wrong.  This service is available in England and that could be a very good reason for my not supporting it. <Col N="857" /> However, the Minister may tell me if it has worked over there.  I know I have been compared with somebody in England, but I would not copy what they do over there.</P>
    <P>We need a programme now and in the years ahead.  I know that the Minister means well and I sincerely mean that as a Fianna Fáil Senator and a neighbour of his in our constituencies.  I am impressed with his performance and I do not often throw bouquets like that at Fine Gael Ministers.  As politicians, we cannot throw in the towel and say that we cannot stop these offenders because the prisons are full or because they have a choice and may not like doing community work.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to people interfering &mdash; and it is not always the politicians &mdash; with persons who are sentenced to jail or to other punishment.  I am referring to people working in the social services field who make a case in court that the little boy or girl of 19 really did not mean to do that and to go easy on him or her. There is another side to that.  Persons have been dealt with roughly and wrongly but there must be a balance.  If somebody does wrong, it must be dealt with and the offender must pay the price.  If somebody is dealt with too harshly there should be somebody to assist him or her.  I think I am correct in saying that I cannot refer to the drugs problem on this Bill.  That is for the next Bill.  I am really caught.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell the House what our total Garda Force is today?  The reason I have for asking is that, if my figures are correct, the ratio is very high.  Some time ago in this State. certain sections of our people had not the greatest regard for the person in uniform for reasons that, indeed, everybody in this House knows only too well.  Then they got into all our good books and were respected by the whole community, regardless of the political divide.  But recently I have been worried because they are getting the same stick as we politicians are getting, also wrongly.  I would not speak ill of the gardaí.  There <Col N="858" /> was a period when they were totally and absolutely trusted, but perhaps we have now arrived at a stage when any institution of the State, whether it be the two Houses here, the Government or the Garda Force, is looked at with some suspicion. That would be a sad situation and we as politicians would have to do everything we can to correct that in our own constituencies.  There is less communication between the community and the man in uniform than there was some time ago.  With the present terrible crime rate, the buck has to stop on someone's desk and, despite my previous remarks to the Minister, the buck does stop on his desk. If he intends, as he has indicated since he became Minister for Justice, to deal with this dreadful problem, speaking for myself and for many of my colleagues on this side of the House &mdash; because at this stage I am probably considered one of the heavyweights on this side &mdash; we will give him all the support we can.  It is only together that we can solve it.</P>
      <P>Are we talking again about big money in implementing the community service? I notice that persons who get a sentence under this Bill do some hours under supervision and so are not supervised during the other hours and, as Senator O'Leary said, these people could drift and go to England.  Here again, this is taking a soft line and it is really not a time for being nice to people who commit criminal offences.  Could the Minister tell the House how he sees that this will work?  I have reservations.  I sincerely hope that it will work, for the Minister's sake and for ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed that the words &ldquo;probation welfare officer&rdquo; have been mentioned several times in the Minister's speech.  I wonder if he could co-ordinate this service, because we have in some constituencies a very, very good youth service, which was badly needed.  I suppose I should speak of counties when I am talking about youth services, but I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that the other word &ldquo;constituencies&rdquo; comes easier. There are excellent and committed youth leaders and these people should be consulted.  I have direct contact with them and these are people with whom I <Col N="859" /> have been dealing for a number of years. They may be the people who would help to make this legislation work for the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Then community service orders have the advantage to the community in that work of value to the community, which would not otherwise be done, would be performed under the orders. Some examples of this work would be: helping the disabled and the old with some of the problems which they have to face in dealing with their incapacities or helping organisations both voluntary and statutory which provide assistance for those people.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister that he could have a selling job there, but again it will take all of us to make it work.</P>
    <P>I am confused as to whether we are talking about staff, or whom are we going to involve to make this Bill work?  Crime must end.  Whatever length of time we serve in this House of the Oireachtas &mdash; all of us here this morning hope, I am sure, to stay as long as we can; I certainly do &mdash; we must work together as part of a deliberate plan to secure the end of crime and to restore the quality of life which this country enjoyed in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It deserves our support.  I sincerely hope it works for the Minister and will be only too willing to do anything I can at any level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give what I might describe as a cautious welcome to this Bill.  I belong to the school of thought which believes that major offenders should be punished and I certainly know that this view is pretty rampant.  People now feel that we are creating far too many rights for the criminal and not enough for society.  This Bill, nonetheless, is both progressive and challenging legislation.  As the Minister has said, it brings into our criminal justice system a new sanction which is different from other sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many aspects of the Bill about which questions would need to be asked.  On going through the Bill one sees <Col N="860" /> that it refers to persons over the age of 16 for whom, in the opinion of the court, the appropriate sentence would be one of penal servitude were it not for this Bill. The system under this Bill will be organised and supervised by the probation and welfare service of the Department of Justice. They are a very excellent group of people who have given good service to this country and they should be congratulated for that.  I wonder if, in the help that these people give and in the organising of this Bill the Minister would consider what role the juvenile liaison grouping of the Department of Justice can play.  They work hand in hand in many ways with the probation and welfare service.  For that reason, some consideration should be given to the role, if any, they can play in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The conditions under the community service provide for unpaid work for not less than 40 hours and not more than 240 hours within a one year period.  The point Senator O'Leary made of revocation of the order, makes things clear enough. Yet, I would have to ask can the judge or justice ask an offender for 240 hours for this year, 240 hours for next year and 240 hours for the year after?  It might be relevant to find out at what stage it ceases.  Does it cease in the first year when the 240 hours are done?  Is that clearly the maximum time that can be asked of an offender?  The important point is made that the person sentenced to community work must be suitable and be assessed by by a probation and welfare officer.  Again, it comes back to the important point that these people are going to play, because it is their report which is going to matter most when the justice comes to deciding on what the sentence should be.  The point is also made that suitable work must be available in the offender's area.  Naturally, it is very important that if people cause, say, malicious injury damage to the tune of £1,000 &mdash; and it is good training for them &mdash; that they should be made put back that same amount of money into the community, whether it be in painting or cleaning a canal, or voluntary work of some description.  I certainly subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> An aspect of this Bill which would worry me is that the offender must consent to the order, I do not know why this is so.  Why should he have to consent?  He has done the damage to the community and to society.  Why not tell him to do this and that if he does not do it he will go elsewhere?</P>
    <P>Another aspect which would worry me is the part which says that a person who fails to comply without a reasonable excuse may be liable on conviction to a fine of £300.  We all know that the type of people who get themselves into trouble would not have £300, or anything like that.  To suggest a fine of £300 is not a workable suggestion at all.</P>
    <P>We see from the Bill that the work that would be done would be of benefit to the community, work which would otherwise be left undone.  They should be made to do some kind of work and that aspect of it should be queried.</P>
    <P>There are advantages to the community service.  It provides a more positive and less expensive alternative to custodial sentences.  We know that Loughan House cost £45,000 per annum for an offender.  With that kind of saving, it is a Bill that has to be welcomed.  Atonement to the community for offences committed is important.  The opportunity for the community to have work done that would not otherwise be done is also important. While there is a lot of merit in the Bill and, in theory it is an excellent one, the whole Bill will be useless and will become another bureaucratic monster.  I recall we discussed in this House a litter Bill but there was no money provided for it.  Perhaps there are one or two litter wardens in some of the big cities.  I remember a courts Bill which was introduced but there was no extra staff to implement the provisions contained in it.  Unless extra staff are provided for this work, the whole thing will fall flat.  That is my fear.</P>
    <P>In my town of Athlone there are three or four welfare officers and they cover a region of 15 miles west, east, north and south of Athlone.  I am not sure that these people can look after and supervise a group of young and not so young offenders.  One of the advantages of the Bill is that a married man, instead of <Col N="862" /> going to prison, can stay at home.  All of this will require extra hard work on the part of the staff.</P>
    <P>The offender can say he wants to do the work from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.  Does that mean that the welfare officer must look in on him between the hours of 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. when he should be at home with his family?  We have the question of voluntary supervisors.  People who become involved in this area might for a while, out of the goodness of their heart, agree to do unpaid work.  Let us say we have a group of offenders doing a painting job and they require a painter supervisor. After a while he will say: &ldquo;I am not going to spend three or four hours supervising this work without getting paid for it.&rdquo;  It is reasonable to assume that if we have supervisors they should be paid.</P>
    <P>Who provides the equipment?  This is not mentioned in the Bill.  Who provides the paint, saws or if it is a cleaning up job the Wellington boots for the offenders? Where will the money come from?  Is it provided for in the Estimate?  I hope it is.  More money should be provided for this work because the cost of keeping an offender in jail or in an institution is extremely high.  This work could prove much cheaper in the long run.</P>
    <P>Has the consent of the unions been received or even looked for?  There might well be union difficulties.  Perhaps these people will be doing work that corporation or council workmen might be doing.  As regards insurance, what happens if these offenders are injured in the course of their work?  Where do they bring an action?  Is it against the State, the group of people who own the estate on which they are working or where?</P>
    <P>While giving a welcome to the Bill, it is a cautious welcome.  The Minister in his address to us referred to the kind of work these people would do such as helping the disabled and the old with problems they have to face in dealing with their incapacities or helping organisations, voluntary and statutory, which provide assistance for those people.  I feel that to allow people who should be in prison to help the disabled and the old will cause some problems for these disabled and old people.  It could be suggested <Col N="863" /> that rather than helping them, which they might be, they might be casing the joint for their own advantage.  They might be looking over the place to see where the entrances are.  This is the fear that will be prevalent in the minds of many people.  People who should be in prison will be working in the community and that will cause old and invalided people and the community to be afraid.</P>
    <P>This has been successful in England and in other parts of the world.  I accept that there is a lot of merit in it.  There are many practical problems which must be sorted out in advance.  Has money been provided?  This is the kernel of the Bill. We must have 50, 60 or 70 more probation officers.  I would suggest introducing this scheme in four or five pilot areas for a period of six to eight months.  People are living in fear.  Cars are being stolen, there are robberies and problems of all kinds.  Something positive has to be done. I hope this will help.  In theory, it is excellent.  In practice there is a question mark over it.</P>
    <P>Many people engage in crime because of home problems.  They see in the media and in films and shows that crime can pay.  They see the short prison or institutional term offenders receive.  Many of these offenders feel that crime does pay and this is something that should be corrected. The unemployment problem is a receipe for crime.  People have time on their hands.  A new challenge is necessary. I am not disputing that.  It all hinges on sufficient funding.  If we had sufficient money to put more policemen on the ground we would have fewer crimes.  I give a cautious welcome to the Bill.  It is excellent in theory and I sincerely hope that in practice it works.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Senators for contributing to this debate.  I found the speeches in general very supportive and many constructive suggestions were made.  I will be able to take some of them into account under section 14 of the Bill which allows the Minister to draw up fairly detailed regulations on the implementation of this Bill.  I should like to <Col N="864" /> make general remarks initially which will cover the ground raised by many Senators and then I will try to deal with specific points raised.</P>
      <P>First of all, it should be remembered that what we are talking about is giving the courts an alternative sanction which they can use instead of a prison sentence. It is not a soft approach, it is not something that would be imposed simply for minor offences.  A community service order cannot be imposed <i>in lieu</i> of a fine or <i>in lieu</i> of probation.  The Bill is specifically constructed so that where a justice or a judge considers that a prison sentence is appropriate under the sanctions available, he will now have an alternative and can sentence someone to work rather than to prison.  This has obvious advantages.</P>
      <P>The range of sanctions available to the courts at present is not sufficient in all cases to allow a judge or Justice to implement a sentence because it is more appropriate.  There are occasions when a suspended sentence, or putting somebody on probation, or a fine, or a prison sentence is not entirely appropriate. There are occasions when a justice or a judge has either tried everything else or feels that everything else is inappropriate and is left with only one sanction, that is, a prison sentence.  That is true especially in respect of short-term offenders.  Consequently, we have many people in our prisons who should not be there at all.  They are there because of the lack of an alternative sanction.  When somebody is sentenced for a crime society demands retribution of some sort.  The range of sanctions is limited.  The judge or justice is put in the position of having to implement the best possible option in the limited sanctions available.  This is an alternative sanction.  It is another option available to a judge or justice.  It is specifically an option <i>in lieu</i> of a prison sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised here and in the Dáil why the option was not simply left open and allow the judge to impose it as he saw fit <i>in lieu</i> of probation or a fine.  A judge makes a valid decision to fine somebody or put him or her on probation. The experience in other countries, <Col N="865" /> especially in Britain, would suggest that if it was not a specific alternative to a prison sentence then people who are now fined and put on probation would be sentenced to community service orders. The actual scheme of community service orders would, instead of relieving pressure on the prison system and becoming an alternative to the sanctions available, become the practice.  Instead of having a range of alternatives in dealing with prisoners, in the case of minor offences and in the case of short-term sentences or fines or probation the instinctive reaction would be to sentence people to work on all occasions.  That is certainly not the intention of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A prison sentence is frequently inappropriate for young offenders.  Take the case of a 16 or 17 year old who is in court and the inclination of the judge is to sentence him or her to six months imprisonment. If that person is in a leaving certificate class and about to take examinations after a short period, if the judge goes ahead with the sentence there would be a form of double punishment because of the present sentence plus the deprivation and the lack of completion of the education course.  Frequently what happens is that no action is taken in situations like that.  A community service order in such a case would be very appropriate.  A young person could continue his or her schooling and do community service work in the evening, on a Saturday or during school holiday time.  Such offenders could continue with their training, work, apprenticeship or education. A rather similar point could be made about people in family circumstances.  Is it appropriate to send to prison the main wage-earner in a family and make his wife and children a further charge on the State?  Would it not be better if a man in those circumstances could work at the weekend, on Saturdays or during holidays? Another example is the case of a person who, if sentenced to prison might lose his job.  Again there is a double punishment aspect here.  Frequently what would happen is that a judge would hesitate to sentence in circumstances like that.  Community service work could be appropriate in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> I am pointing out the advantages, of the Bill before the House and the positive advantages of having an alternative system. There is one other advantage and it is an advantage which I stressed in the other House.  It is not the reason why the Bill is being brought in.  The Bill is being brought in for the reason I have outlined. There is a consequential advantage &mdash; it will reduce the pressure on the system which is at crisis proportions.  Last year 1,200 people were shed from the prison system.  &ldquo;Shedding&rdquo; is the technical term and you can take it as a general rule it is so.  The cells in all our prisons are full all the time.  If somebody is sentenced for a very serious crime in one of the courts for five, six, seven or eight years then space must be provided.  The only way to provide it is to let somebody out who is on a short sentence.  I am not talking about people being let out under strict supervision nor am I talking about sentences being mitigated because it is felt on expert advice that an appropriate portion of the sentence has been served.  I am talking about simply letting people out to make space available for more serious offenders.  Last year 1,200 people were shed from our prisons.  It is obvious that the whole paraphernalia of justice would break down if the sanctions applied by the courts cannot be implemented.  We have approximately 11,000 gardaí engaged in the prevention and detection of crime.  We have free legal aid, courts and prisons and if at the end of the day an offender who was sentenced can walk through his local community again in, say, three weeks time or less, and virtually overtly insult the injured party and jeer at the gardaí, the system is breaking down.</P>
    <P>If we cannot provide the space in the prisons to deal with the problems why should we be putting people into prisons who should not be there at all in the first place?  People are worried about the cost of implementing this scheme.  Obviously money will have to be provided.  I hope when all Stages pass through the Seanad I will be in a position to make regulations and arrangements with the probation and welfare service to get them to identify <Col N="867" /> appropriate work in various communities around the country.</P>
    <P>I will not be in a position to implement this Bill until next year.  There will be money provided in 1984 for this.  It might be of interest to Senators to hear the cost. Suppose in a full year 350 orders were made, the cost per week will work out at £36.26 per community service order.  If in a full year 500 orders were made the cost would be reduced to £28 approximately. If the number of orders made in a year went up to 700 the cost would be £18 per week.  The average cost of maintaining a person in prison in 1982 for one week was £424.  I could make a good case to the Ministers for Finance and the Public Service for community service orders if we can deal with offenders at a cost of £18 a week as against sending them to prison at a cost of £424 a week on average. That last figure is a frightening one. Apart from the other arguments there is a very strong economic argument for what is being proposed in the Bill.  I do not want to give the impression that this is the reason it is being proposed.  I have positive reasons for introducing this legislation and from the comments made by Senators it is quite clear that they accept them.</P>
    <P>A number of specific points were raised.  Senator Eoin Ryan was very supportive in what he said.  There will be teething problems.  The experience in other countries, however, is that community service orders work well.  It is not an English idea.  It was started in New Zealand.  The British borrowed it.  Now it has spread right through Europe and is also in Canada.  It is a scheme that has worked well in European and other countries. We can learn from the difficulties they had.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon suggested bringing it in in a number of areas as a pilot scheme. The difficulty there is that justice would have to operate evenly in all parts of the State.  To have one form of sentence in one District Court area or county would probably be unconstitutional if the same sanction was not available to an offender in the next county.  We will have to bring it in as a national scheme and deal with <Col N="868" /> the teething problems as they arise nationally rather than trying it out, as the Senator suggested.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also made reference to the major Criminal Justice Bill.  An enormous amount of work has been done by my predecessors and my Department officials over a number of years on the preparation of this Bill.  I do not want to cast any aspersions on my predecessors but no memorandum was put to Government until I put one recently on this Bill. As this legislation would change many aspects of our criminal law obviously the sequence from memorandum to decision to draft Bill to final publication of the Bill is not something that we would handle lightly.  I assure the House that there is no hesitation in proceeding with this.  It is a priority of Government and I hope to have a Bill published before the Houses of the Oireachtas reassemble in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also asked about open centres and open prisons or semi-open prisons.  There are three at present. There is Shelton Abbey, near Arklow.  It is for adults and it holds about 60 prisoners. There is Shanganagh Castle which is near Bray.  It is for juveniles under 21 and holds about 50.  There is Loughan House in Cavan which is for adult offenders from 18 years of age upward. When it is fully operational it will hold about 120 maximum.  It has now been re-opened for a number of weeks.  The policy is to phase in the number of offenders rather than to have the full amount initially.  It is building up fairly rapidly and is now somewhere in the mid-sixties.</P>
    <P>Senator Eoin Ryan also made the point that there was no provision in the Estimates for 1983 and that is so.  I do not think I will need money in 1983 because between drafting regulations and making the necessary arrangements it will be 1984.  I intend to have money in the Estimates in 1984.  In the meantime, the court rules, regulations and administrative arrangements will have to be worked out. Again I draw Senators attention to section 14 of this Bill which gives fairly wide powers of regulation to the Minister. <Col N="869" /> That section will enable me to incorporate many of the very positive suggestions which have been made here.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan made the suggestion, which I agree with, that the probation and welfare service should link up with other agencies.  This should be done. Manpower, AnCO and various youth employment agencies and so on would be appropriate for a link up.</P>
    <P>A point has been made by a number of Senators and by Senator O'Leary specifically about whether it is appropriate that the consent of the offender should be required before a community service order is imposed.  There would be a difficulty if consent was not required.  Under various international obligations which we have and under practice in this country for many years, it would be totally inappropriate to say the least to impose what could be perceived as compulsory or forced labour on anybody.  There are two reasons.  The principal reason is, first of all, we do not want any perception that we are sentencing people to forced labour.  Consequently consent to the principle of an offender working is important. Secondly it is unlikely that an offender who did not consent to being sentenced to work would actually complete the work satisfactorily.  He would probably break down in the middle of the community service order, be taken back into court again and end up in prison.</P>
    <P>I would make a distinction between consent and choice.  It is not that the offender is being given a choice of sentence and asked which he would prefer. It is that the offender should consent to the idea of working under a community service order and that because he had expressed this consent he would avoid a prison sentence.  I know Senator O'Leary has more specific points to make on that and I will take them up on Committee Stage when he raises them.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan was generally supportive.  I know he has practical experience of dealing with offenders.  I was interested in what he said.  Some of the suggestions he made could be implemented in the regulations.  As regards the Prisoners' Rights Organisation, of which he was an executive member previously, <Col N="870" /> I am not aware of any harassment by gardaí of that organisation but if the Senator would like to have a word with me later on, I will discuss it with him.  He made the point that gardaí are unacceptable in some areas.  Obviously, this is something that should concern us all. There is a change in how gardaí are perceived. They are held in very high respect all the time by communities.  We need to work constantly at the absolute trust which was there in the past to make sure that there is no breakdown in relationships between the Garda Síochána and the community.  I would be particularly concerned in this respect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could trot out a statistic which has been trotted out many times before in different arguments. With over 50 per cent of our population under 25 years of age, it is vitally important that the contact between our young population and the Garda is close and is maintained, and that there would be no possibility of alienating our young people from the security forces.  The proportion of our population under 25 years of age is so large that we would be in great difficulty if this were ever to occur.</P>
    <P>That is why I am pleased that the recruitment programme for gardaí is proceeding. Many young gardaí are being assigned now to our cities.  In a change of policy of deployment, the traditional practice of not sending them to their home area has now been reversed.  For example, when many of the young recruits who were born and reared in Dublin and who are applying now in increasing numbers for the Garda, are passed out in Templemore, they are being assigned to Dublin districts, many of them within two or three miles of their own homes.</P>
    <P>A series of arguments militated against this in the past.  It was not police policy in the past to do this.  There are stronger arguments now, and in the urban areas people of urban background, people who were born and reared in a particular area, can be very effective as young policemen, having good community relationships with their own age group and their own peer group.  The policy now is to assign <Col N="871" /> them to, at least, their cities of origin and, very frequently, within a reasonably short distance of where they were born, reared and schooled.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also made this point that why, since under the Bill a report from a probation officer is required before a community service is imposed, this should not be the practice in the case of other sanctions also.  It is a valid point.  It is outside the scope of the Bill and is something I would hope we might have a look at subsequently.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised, except your own, a Leas-Chathaoirligh. You asked whether it was a copy of the UK legislation.  It originated in New Zealand and came in there.  We are learning a lot from the English experience.  One of the things which came across most forcibly to me was, first of all, the point I made about the pilot schemes, which worked in Britain and, secondly, the point that when it was introduced in Britain originally, it was also an alternative for a fine.  Many people who could be dealt with under fines were put on a community service order.  This imposed an added burden.</P>
    <P>The total Garda force is about 11,000 now.  That is not taking into account the present recruitment scheme and the next recruitment scheme which will be called up shortly and recruits will be passing through Templemore at the end of 1983 and into 1984.</P>
    <P>A point was also made about why offenders should be given the choice of how they should be punished.  I have dealt with that.  It is not a question of choice.  It is a question of consent, so that they would consent to work rather than a perception of forced labour being put abroad.  It is not a question of choice.  I have dealt with the cost also.</P>
    <P>There was talk about supervision not being full-time.  We have to work out the actual details of the supervision. Obviously, if somebody is on community work, there will not be a supervisor there all the time.  If somebody is on work anyway, the greatest supervision I think possible in any form of work is to see is the work satisfactorily completed at the <Col N="872" /> end of a period.  I hope this will be implemented by the probation and welfare officers who are very good.  I hope it will be implemented in an imaginative way.</P>
    <P>Anybody walking through any of our cities, towns, villages and, indeed the countryside, could identify in a day a whole range of things that need to be done.  They do not require great monetary resources, but they do require manpower resources.  Have you ever noticed the graffiti on our walls, for example, in towns and cities?  Would it not be appropriate for young offenders to clean them off?  What supervision is required?  If they are removed, they are removed.  That kind of work can be checked and supervised rather easily.</P>
    <P>Some Senators expressed concern about a suggestion in my speech that community service orders could enable offenders to help with the disabled and the old, and people like that who are in need of help.  The point made was that this would be difficult to sell and would probably cause concern in the community. I accept that point, but there are things that can be validly done.  For example, we have had the experience of a number of old people's houses in a town or city.  Sometimes the gardens remain undug.  The grass is never cut.  The hedges are not trimmed.  The front gate or the fence is not painted.  There is a whole range of activity that could be beneficial to the welfare of old people in our communities which would not necessarily involve close personal contact between the offender and the older person.</P>
    <P>I am not ruling that out either because when we talk about offenders we tend to speak of them as if they were a homogeneous group.  Of course they are not. The variations are vast.  People are being sentenced now to terms of imprisonment who, under this scheme, could work on a community service order, and many old people would find no problem whatsoever in relating to them or having them there to help or to aid.  I do not think it is possible for somebody like a Minister for Justice to specify a list of appropriate work and say this far shalt thou go and no further.  This will have to be implemented imaginatively and carefully by <Col N="873" /> the probation and welfare service in my Department.  Work which would be appropriate in one particular area because of a particular set of social circumstances might be inappropriate in another area.  The freedom should be there for the different types of work to be available and to be provided and to be supervised in a careful but imaginative way.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallen talked about a number of points which I have dealt with already. He talked about the sentences and the length of sentence.  The maximum sentence here is 240 hours in a year.  It would be the maximum sentence also under a specific community service order. Obviously, if somebody is back in court again, without pre-empting the report of the welfare officer, it would be difficult to see how you could continue on the community service orders as an alternative sanction to imprisonment if they were perceived not to be working in the sense of providing no correction whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The £300 fine which the Senator referred to as being unrealistic is the maximum fine.  If somebody is sentenced to the maximum 240 hours, that could be eight hours a week over 30 weeks.  If he decided not to do the work, obviously one line of approach being followed in the Bill is that you take that person back into court and the judge would have the discretion then to sentence him to imprisonment. Also the fact that somebody did not comply with the court order, the community service order, after giving his consent, would be an offence in itself.  It would be at the discretion of the judge to impose whatever fine he thought appropriate, taking also into account the fact that he would probably be imposing a prison sentence anyway because the work was not carried out.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points made.  If there is any other specific point, I am sure I can deal with it on Committee Stage.  I should like to thank Senators who contributed.  Under section 14 which allows me to make the regulations, and also more informally when I will be discussing them with the probation and welfare section of my Department, many of <Col N="874" /> the specific points raised by Senators can be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply on Second Stage touched on a point to which I should have referred.  I had a note on it but I overlooked it in my Second Stage speech, that is, the question of the Act applying to an &ldquo;offence for which, in the opinion of the court, the appropriate sentence would but for this Act be one of penal servitude...&rdquo;  The problem which the Minister referred to and which I would like to reiterate and emphasise is that it might be used as an alternative to a fine.  The Minister was quite right to emphasise that that should not be.  It is grand to say that the law says that, unless it is an occasion when a sentence of imprisonment would have been <Col N="875" /> appropriate, then it will not apply.  The dividing line between a fine and a prison sentence in reality is very thin.  Anybody who has attended a court, particularly at District Court level, knows there are certain set pieces that take place in court. The solicitor on behalf of the defendant pleads with the justice not to send his client to jail.  The justice says: &ldquo;I have to send him to jail.  This is the most scandalous thing I have ever heard of in my life.&rdquo;  It is all done, I suppose, to increase the tension and seriousness with which the offender is treating the occasion.</P>
      <P>Very often that is carried on and the justice has no intention of sending the person to jail, and is merely going through this ritual.  The difficulty which the Minister has correctly pointed out is that, if it is seen as an alternative to the kind of cases which ultimately would not have ended up in jail, it will only be an additional burden.  It is important that the Minister should emphasise that point in instructing the probation and welfare officers who, under section 4, will have quite a considerable say in whether it goes ahead.</P>

      <P>A query to the Minister. I would have thought it would have been appropriate to refer to young offenders. Presumably there was a problem.  I do not know what it was.  I would have thought that for young offenders the idea of community service orders as an alternative to imprisonment could have been emphasised more in this Bill because it is obviously an area of great importance. The stigma of imprisonment on a young person's career is obviously far greater than it would be for somebody heading into his fifties.  There is also a tendency to treat things differently.  Is there a reason why a particular emphasis could not have been put on young offenders in this section because obviously it will be a matter of interpretation.  The second thing which worries me on this section is the administrative practicalities where we are liable to have very differing interpretations of this section by members of the Judiciary in different courts.  I know there is an eternal problem about the Judiciary <Col N="876" /> and Legislature and the independence of one from the other.  Is there anything which could be done to get some sort of evenhanded interpretation of this, so that the probation and welfare services can have some evenness in handling it?  I can see different district justices taking very different views as to how this section will be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Two points have been raised.  First, why there is not more concentration on young offenders.  It applies to people from 16 years of age upwards.  There would be a difficulty if we were to reduce the age, which I presume is one of the points the Senator is making.  The practice at present is that the Department of Justice deals with offenders who are 16 years of age but, if they are under 16 years of age, they are dealt with by the Department of Education.  There are special schools to which people can be sent if they are under 16 years of age.  There would also be a difficulty if, under the general corpus of labour law, we do not allow people to work under 16 years in the normal way, and at the same time, we left it open to the courts to sentence them to work. There would be a major contradiction in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point made by both Senator Ryan and Senator O'Leary needs to be stressed.  The practical operation of this legislation will be the deciding factor in whether or not it works.  There is concern at the moment about a lack of uniformity in sentencing policy in different District Court areas and other courts.  I do not want to encroach on the line which divides the Judiciary from the Executive. There are provision under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, whereby the President of the District Court calls district justices together to discuss many matters, particularly sentencing policy.  I would like if the Bill could be looked at by district justices in this context.  I do not see any difficulty in harmonising the approach of probation and welfare officers throughout the country, because as a section of the Department of Justice they work directly to it.  Consequently, it is possible to make <Col N="877" /> the approach there uniform under this section of the Bill, so that the input in different court areas by different probation and welfare officers will be uniform. There is enough power under the Courts Act of 1961 to enable the President of the District Court and district justices to take a uniform approach to sentencing policy.  I hope they will do so, before the implementation of the Bill in 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 3 (2) the Bill specifically refers to unpaid work.  Presumably &ldquo;unpaid&rdquo; was put in very deliberately. Was it necessary to specifically say &ldquo;unpaid work&rdquo;?  Would it not have been possible to leave this open because, generally speaking, it will be unpaid work?  It might be that in particular circumstances suitable employment could be provided and pay could be offered for it which would be useful to the person concerned.  Further down the section says that these orders may be made in addition to the payment of compensation, costs or expenses.  An offender might have to pay some kind of compensation and expenses as well, and he would be willing to do this work but, under the Bill, he is forbidden to take work where payment would be forthcoming.  I agree that in general that it should be unpaid work and in general it would be unpaid work.  Was it necessary to specifically preclude the possibility of paid work being appropriate on some occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I understand the point being raised by the Senator. What he says has validity but there are two points.  First, it is an alternative to a prison sentence.  It is not a provision of an employment scheme of any sort. The second point is that, when this idea was first mooted, and when the initial briefing document was published on it, it was welcomed to a great extent by the trade union movement.  Both the formal <Col N="878" /> and informal reactions from the trade union movement were very much in favour of this.  One reason for that was that it specified unpaid work.</P>
      <P>If we proposed a scheme which would provide work for young offenders, who were working under a community service order as an alternative to imprisonment, probably we would have had practical difficulties with the trade union movement. It would be very difficult to argue, if we were actually paying for work done, that this was not work which could be paid for in the ordinary way under local authorities.  There was a practical need for introducing it.</P>
      <P>We have no intention of taking work away from the ordinary workforce.  One of the advantages of this scheme is that the community work could be done while somebody was still in employment, if there was another charge, or compensation to be met.  Someone in employment could be doing his full week's work and be doing the community service order work on a Saturday.  If somebody unemployed was doing community service work, of course he would be receiving unemployment benefit anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This crossed my mind. An unemployed person who is the subject of a community service order could well run into problems with the Department of Social Welfare with regard to his availability for work.  This is an administrative point which the Department of Justice and the Department of Social Welfare should be able to work out.  The Department of Social Welfare have a notorious reputation for taking the most extraordinary attitudes to whom is and is not available for work.  Since it is the object of this legislation not to interfere with people's other activities, it is very important that the consequences of being sentenced to community service would not be to deprive somebody of his unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  I would ask the Minister to make sure the necessary interpretations are put on it by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is <Col N="879" /> being discussed with the Department of Social Welfare.  Even if the discussions did not prove fruitful, and I am sure they will, the community service scheme is being organised in such a way that it would be appropriate for somebody who was in full-time employment to do community work.  Consequently if it is appropriate for somebody in full-time employment, it is also appropriate that it can be administered and somebody is still fully available for work if unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister's attitude on the distinction between consent and choice.  I do not agree with it.  I know they are two different words and I know they mean two different things.  What is involved here is both a choice and a consent.  It is quite true that the courts, in the first place, have a choice as to whether or not they will make this offender liable under a community service order.  The district justice can decide to send the person to prison or he can decide to do something else.  He has a choice in that regard, but once he has exercised that choice and has told the offender how he proposes to exercise that choice, then the offender also has a choice.  The offender has a choice of agreeing or of not agreeing.  It is quite clearly stated &mdash; his consent is needed.  The withholding or giving of that consent gives him a choice.  He does not <Col N="880" /> have the original choice, but he has a choice eventually.</P>
      <P>As I said in my Second Stage speech I believe very strongly that this section will run into difficulty.  It is right that the offender should be fully informed as to what the alternatives are.  Even if there were no possibility of the section running into difficulty I firmly believe that the offender should know what the options are.  He should know that, if he does not want to do community service order work, he will go to prison.  It is inherent in the application of the community service order that if he does not consent to it he will go to prison.  He should know for what length of time he is likely to go to prison.  It is important that he should have the full facts before him before exercising his choice.  At that stage it has become his choice, by the decision of the court exercising their prior choice.</P>
      <P>If it were to stop at that, I would still be in favour of the offender being informed.  But I am firmly of the opinion that difficulty will arise, if section 4 is not amended, in respect of an offender who consents to have a community service order made against him and who subsequently fails to comply for one reason or another with the terms of the community service order and is then referred back to the court for sentencing.  In those circumstances there will be an application along the lines that the offender did not in the first place properly consent to the making of the order, and that he should not be fined £300 or alternatively that the time has elapsed during which he could be properly sentenced for the offence for which he was found guilty at the earlier date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there would be an addition to this section which would have the effect of informing the offender &mdash; prior to the giving or the withholding of his consent &mdash; of the consequences of his action.  That can be done in one of two ways.  It can be done by inserting after (b) &ldquo;the offender has consented&rdquo;, a statement that prior to ascertaining whether or not the offender is consenting, the court shall inform the offender of the actual sentence which will be imposed if he does not consent.  It has the additional <Col N="881" /> advantage of ensuring that the court really only applies this in cases where they are going to send someone to prison.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, it can be done by the addition of a paragraph (d) to subsection (2) which says that before making a community service order in respect of an offender the court shall explain to him three things.  We should add a new paragraph (d), showing the alternative sentence which will be imposed if he does not consent.  In order to ensure that the offender could be dealt with in the normal way if he failed to fulfil his commitments, we would have to add a sentence saying that the alternative sentence shall not limit the power of the court to deal with the offender under sections 8 (1) (a), 8 (2), 11 (1) (a) and 11 (2).  They are the various circumstances in which the original offence is re-examined by the court and the opportunity is given to the court to re-impose a sentence.</P>
    <P>The purpose of that addition would be to ensure that the alternative sentence mentioned at the time of the making of the original order could be varied at a later date as there would probably be no record of it.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about that.  Even as the Bill is drafted the offender has a choice.  He does not have the first choice, but he has a second choice and it is a real choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Leary has raised a very interesting point.  I am not inclined to agree fully with him on this interpretation.  If the wording here was that the offender may exercise an option, quite clearly he would have to be told what the alternatives were.  I would not agree that in order to consent to any course of action a person must know the alternatives.  Consequently, I would not agree with him fully on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases the district justice may not in his own mind have decided what he will do.  He may decide that it is clearly a case for an order under this Act and offer this course of action to the offender without necessarily having considered what he would do in the alternative.  I am not sure that it would be entirely desirable <Col N="882" /> that the judge should have made up his mind; he may be a very enthusiastic upholder or believer in the principle of this Bill.  He might even go out of his way to say that unless a person consents he will impose a very severe sentence.  I agree that this is an interesting point but I am not inclined to agree fully with what Senator O'Leary has said.</P>
    <P>The second point is whether suitable arrangements can be made for an offender to do what is required of him under this Bill.  In any circumstances where there is a will on the part of the judge and the local probation officer, suitable work will be found.  The Minister has said that the whole purpose and success of this Bill depend on goodwill and people wanting it to work.  I certainly want it to work.  It is very commendable and should be made to work but there will be people who will not make the necessary effort or show the necessary ingenuity.  If that happens then quite clearly there will be applications made in the case of a person who is not given the opportunity of serving a sentence under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Take the case of two young people, both of whom are studying for an examination and both of whom are equally guilty of whatever the offence is.  If one is allowed to serve a sentence under this Bill and allowed to continue studying and eventually do the examination and the other is not given the opportunity and is sent to jail, the second person quite clearly will have a case for some kind of action under the Constitution that he is being discriminated against.  This may give rise to difficulties in the future.  I say that not in criticism of the Bill but every effort should be made to ensure that kind of situation will not arise.</P>

      <P>I do not see as many difficulties as Senator O'Leary.  At the time this offender comes before the courts, following much discussion with him through the probation officer or the welfare officer, will he not be told of the fact that he may be the subject of a community service order of so many hours?  At the end of the day will the judge not say to him: &ldquo;I sentence you to 50 hours community <Col N="883" /> service or if you do not want that you will go to jail for three weeks or a month&rdquo;?  Is it not as simple as that?  This section is much easier and much more simple than Senator O'Leary suggested.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think it is as simple as Senator Fallon has suggested but neither do I think is it as difficult as Senator O'Leary is making it out to be.  Senator Ryan has made the case very well for what I have in mind.</P>
      <P>The Bill is based on two principles. First of all, the case must be serious enough to justify sending the offender to prison.  Secondly, his consent is necessary before a community service order can be made.  It is true that the combination of these two principles involves some element of choice for the offender. The main reason for requiring the offender's consent is to avoid any conflict with international conventions prohibiting forced labour.</P>
      <P>If Senator O'Leary's points were accepted and pursued to their logical conclusion, not only would it be necessary for the judge to specify the extent of the possible prison sentence but also to specify details of the community service order, the number of hours of community work and what the nature of the work would be.  We would get into all kinds of practical difficulties.  It is not the intention that somebody who has offended and is found guilty will be presented with two choices in court and asked which he would prefer.  That is not the idea.  Consent is essential so that we would not be in conflict with international conventions prohibiting forced labour but that consent is a long way away from a position where there is a free choice on behalf of the convicted person as to how he should be dealt with under option (a) or (b).  A justice would not work in this way.  He might want to reserve his position to see whether the offender was amenable to perform community work.  He might defer his decision pending further information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary already made the point when he was talking about the importance of not using this legislation as <Col N="884" /> an alternative to fines, that there was a certain drama involved in courtroom proceedings where what is said does not always mean what it represents in so many words.  He made the point about increasing pressure on the accused.  If the justice was put in a position where he had to say categorically that a person was getting six months under these conditions in such an institution or alternatively getting so many hours of community work doing such a job in such a place on such a day, the specifics would be too detailed to be practical.  Secondly, there is the difficulty which the Senator mentioned when he raised the point about fines, that maybe this is part of the drama of the courtroom; a way of getting somebody to opt for community services rather than imprisonment or <i>vice versa.</i>  It is an interesting point that Senator O'Leary raised.</P>
    <P>The difficulty can be met in the practical working out of this if district justices adopt a uniform approach.  The regulations under section 14 can be drafted in such a way that uniformity of approach by the probation and welfare service can be required.  I do not accept the kind of amendment suggested.  If somebody does not complete the allocation of work under a community service order and subsequently returns to court and the defence makes the point that he did not understand or did not have full information when he exercised the choice, we will cross that fence when we come to it. I do not believe that the suggestion the Senator is making will hold up in court. If it does, I will be back again to amend it.</P>

      <P>I interpreted it as meaning that there was a choice here and I think the Minister will hear more about this choice.  Here we have a man accustomed to the courts scene warning his Minister that he will hear more about this.  The Minister talked about more information and in my Second Stage speech I spoke about trying to deal with the whole problem of the offender in a human way and getting the backup before the said offender is sentenced, whether it be to community work of his <Col N="885" /> or her choice or to a prison term.  It would require the goodwill of the community at very local level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be an argument as between consent and choice but there seem to be a number of prerequisites before the ultimate operation takes place.  The first is that the person be an offender within the meaning of the Act, which means that he must be guilty of a crime in respect of which penal servitude, imprisonment or detention in St. Patrick's Institution would be the appropriate order by the court.  The next prerequisite is the consent of the offender, whether he is willing to allow himself to come within the ambit of this Act, and it is at that stage that the question of choice arises.</P>
      <P>I take Senator O'Leary's point that the offender should have some idea as to what the choice is.  The difficulty may arise as to whether there will be a specific statement of fact by the court as to what the sentence or the detention period would be as opposed to the working hours which might be imposed under the Act.</P>
      <P>I can see difficulties arising in the event of the offender committing an offence under the Act not completing the hours and coming back before the court when the original matter can be dealt with.  Is it to be dealt with <i>de novo?</i>  Is the court completely to rehear the matter, in addition to dealing with the offence under the Act by virtue of which the offender can be fined £300?</P>
      <P>One could run into extreme difficulties on the basis that an offender could come before the court a second time before a different justice.  The original justice might not be alive or might not still be a justice.  The second justice could be faced with the difficulty of having to rehear the case totally unless the statement of the original detention period is made at the time of the first hearing.</P>

      <P>In some of the comments on this section there is a tendency to minimise what is happening to an offender.  A 240-hour community service order effectively means the equivalent of <Col N="886" /> one working day a week and for somebody who is working it means either a Saturday or a Sunday for 30 weeks.  It is not a small thing to have half your weekend taken up and that much of your freedom restricted.  The penalty element involved is very real.</P>
      <P>The more I listen the more I am in agreement with what is being said.  It would be preferable that the individual would know what prison sentence was to be imposed if he did not become the subject of a community service order and the practicalities are quite extraordinary. I am not going to move an amendment but it would be rather difficult if somebody who failed to meet a community service order came before a different district justice.  Presumably there would be an inclination in any human being to react both to the original offence and the non-compliance with the community service order and therefore the person could be subject to a more severe sentence of imprisonment as a result.  It could have been provided that the alternative prison sentence would be stated at the time the order was made.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I was not present for part of the beginning of the debate due to the fact that I was in court.  There is a parallel with the idea of the suspended sentence where frequently an offender in the District Court, say in the Bridewell District Court, will get a suspended sentence which means that if he is of good behaviour during the course of the sentence he will not be put in jail but if he commits another offence he will have to serve the sentence.  To allow him to know what the alternative sentence to the community service order would be is not beyond the wit of man.  It would be parallel to being able to tell him that his suspended sentence is so much.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are obvious practical difficulties and there is no doubt that there will be teething troubles when we come to implement this.  There is the difficulty of unevenness of sentencing practice between our courts and this could be transferred to this legislation.  There is also the difficulty of how arrangements can be made in different court areas to have an appropriate range of work which is relatively uniform throughout the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I can see the difficulty being pointed out by the Senators.  Somebody may decide he does not want to go to prison and that he will consent to work of a community nature instead.  That is where the consent comes in.  I do not think it is appropriate to go on and list a range of options and ask which he would prefer. I do not think that is appropriate.  Even if it was, I do not think it is possible to bring that situation about by amending the section along the lines that Senator O'Leary suggests.  We would still have the practical difficulty.</P>
      <P>A judge faced with an offender must take his general demeanour into account. This must be a consideration when he decides whether somebody will be fined, given a suspended sentence or sent to prison.  Whether he would or would not consent to doing work for the aggrieved community could be a factor in making up the judge's mind about the length of prison sentence which he would impose.  We can overcome the difficulty through the regulations under section 14 and by a more uniform approach on the part of district justices.  I do not see the amendment along the lines suggested by Senator O'Leary as really helping the situation.</P>

If a person is the subject of a community service order and during that time commits another offence it seems most unlikely that the judge before whom he comes for the second offence would feel it appropriate to impose another community service order.  If he, in effect, abuses the advantageous way in which he has been allowed to serve his sentence by committing another offence, I cannot envisage a situation where a judge would give him the option of the imposition of another community service order.  I wonder what was in mind for this section, other than the situation I have mentioned, which would rarely occur in practice.</P>

      <P>There is a slight tendency here to treat community service orders a little like, say, suspended sentences or a lesser sanction than imprisonment, in the sense that if a person is sentenced to a <Col N="889" /> community service order on one occasion perhaps the next time he comes before the court he would expect an escalation of the penalty.  I do not think this is intended.  It should be regarded as an equal sanction which could be used against the same individual on a number of successive occasions and not just for first offenders.</P>
      <P>Petty offenders who spend a lot of their lives in and out of prison take up an enormous amount of the resources of the prison service with no great benefit either to themselves or the community.  I have had some experience with this type of offender and whether they would be appropriate people for community service orders is a matter that we would have to discuss.  I do not think any impression should go abroad from here that a community service order is just a first step to prevent people from going to prison and that if it does not work they will go to prison on the next occasion. This is not the way to deal with it.  It is a sanction which could be applied over and over again even to the same people.</P>

It might not work as a deterrent and if somebody committed an offence again I would envisage a situation where another community service order would not be issued.  I am using &ldquo;not working&rdquo; in the sense of somebody not actually doing the work laid down by the community service order.  If it is clear that somebody will not perform the work required then it would not be appropriate that a further community service order would be imposed as a general practice, although obviously there would be individual cases where that would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>Section 7 (2) and section 9 are really inter-related.  One refers to the other.  It is stated that subject to section 9 the work to be performed under the community service order shall be performed within a period of one year beginning on the date of the order.  Unless revoked the order shall remain in force until the offender has worked under it for the number of hours specified on it.</P>
      <P>Section 9 deals with the extension of the time for the performance of work.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where a community service order is in force and, on application by the offender or a relevant officer, it appears to the District Court that it would be in the interests of justice, having regard to circumstances which have arisen since the order was made, to extend the period of one year specified in section 7 (2), the court may, in relation to the order, extend that period.</P>
      <P>This would appear to give the power to the court to extend the period without limitation.  It does not extend it for a specified period but open-endedly.  This is my interpretation of it; if it is wrong I would like to know.</P>
      <P>If you take section 9 and apply it to section 7 (2), which refers to section 9, the effect could be that the community service order could be extended under the provisions of section 9 and could remain in force indefinitely.  This would probably happen if the person was ill and was unable to perform the work and an application was made under section 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an open-ended extension can be given, the community service order can remain in force forever.  The community service order should terminate after a period of time.  Obviously, if the offender has deliberately not done the work specified under the community service order he will be dealt with under the provisions in other sections.  It is only where there is a good reason that the extension will be applied for and that the consent will be given for the extension of that period. It should not be open to the courts to <Col N="891" /> extend the period indefinitely pending the improvement of a person's health. There could be a situation where the community service order would remain in force for the remainder of a person's life.  For the sake of putting the past behind somebody it is important that the community service order should automatically lapse after a period of time.  I had hoped that the Minister would have included a suggested amendment to this section to the effect that no order should remain in force after a period of three years from the date on which the order was first made or alternatively in respect of section 9 that it would be amended so as to extend the period but not beyond three years from the date of the first order.  I would like to hear the Minister's viewpoint on this.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Senator combined section 7 and section 9. The extension beyond the one-year period for the completion of the community service order would be to enable the offender to complete the work.  In other words, it would be beneficial to the offender and that would be the reason for it.  I note the point made.  Where an offender for whatever reason fails to comply with the order it will be the duty of the probation and welfare officer to bring him before the court.  It is a matter for the court then to decide what to do and in suitable cases it could revoke the order.</P>
      <P>The Senator is worried that orders might be left in existence for years, possibly by default.  I can deal with this in two ways other than amending it.  Firstly, the instructions that will be given to the probation and welfare service will ensure that no such situation as is feared will arise.  If it is thought necessary, it can also be dealt with by regulation under section 14 so that this particular difficulty will not arise.  I will see if I can draft an appropriate regulation under section 14 to deal with that point.</P>

      <P>Most speakers will agree that this is the kernel of the Bill, because it deals with the finances that will be available for the implementation of the Bill.  The Minister said he should get money in next year's budget.  Money might be saved under this Bill because as the Minister said it will cost £18 a week for a community service order, and 500 service orders at £18 each would be less than £10,000.  I do not understand that, and perhaps the Minister would explain it.  If it costs over £400 per week to keep a man in prison, 500 people in prison per week would cost £200,000; and £18 multiplied by 500 would cost less than £10,000.  That would be a huge saving. The Minister might explain what he meant by that.  With the savings that can be made in this Bill the Minister has a very strong case at Government level to get the money he needs for the implementation <Col N="894" /> of the Bill.  Will he be employing extra probation and welfare people, perhaps 50 to 100?  Is he going to provide money for the supervisors?  Is he going to provide money for equipment?  Is he going to provide money for painting, paint brushes, carpentry and all the equipment that would be necessary for community work?  Then there is the question of insurance.  What happens if an offender is injured in the course of such work?  Is there a contingency fund for that?  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that aspect, because this is the kernel of the Bill.  If he has not sufficient funds, it will not be operational.</P>

In a country with the distribution of population we have outside the urban areas, and in the areas where there are no prisons, is it envisaged that staff will be located in areas where there are presently no officers of the Department of Justice in the probation and welfare service, or will these orders have to be served at one remove from the probation and welfare service, or will people have to travel to where they can be supervised?</P>

Obviously this will impose an extra burden on the probation and welfare service, so there will have to be extra probation and welfare officers.  There will have to be supervisory staff as well, actually supervising the work under the guidance of the probation and welfare service.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes. hammers, but if would not be a major cost item.  The point I was making about comparisons between the cost of this system and the cost of the prison system is that obviously the more community service orders that are implemented up to a certain point, the lower the cost <i>per capita</i> of each community service order. If you get new staff obviously you will get one level of cost at 350 orders, and another level of cost at 500 orders, and another level of cost at 700 orders per year.  If we take the middle one it works out at £28 per week per order on the basis of the proposals I am putting up for extra staff, against £424 for a place in prison. That is the figure I was dealing with. Senators asked if the finance would be available.  Obviously, when the Government took a decision to put this Bill to both Houses of the Oireachtas and to go ahead with this as a policy decision there was a concurrent decision that funds will be provided to implement this system.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a question on Second Stage, and I do not think he answered it.  He said the number of prisoners had not increased significantly over the years.  That could mean that there was not room for any more prisoners, or is it the fact that there has not been a significant increase in prisoners over the last ten years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will have to check the actual figure, but speaking from memory the figure was just under 1,000 and it went up to just over 1,200.  That figure has gone up substantially this year, partly because there was not a great increase in crime until recent years, and the space is not there. Many warrants are not executed and many people are being shed from the prison system, especially in 1981 and in the early part of this year.  The extra accommodation available in Loughan House and in the second wing in Cork prison is helping, and I hope the community service order will be another input, but there is still some shedding from the prisons.  It is very difficult to get an accurate figure on how many warrants are outstanding and waiting to be executed if prison space is available.  It is very hard to project what will happen in the future.  If the different policy of deploying gardaí is to be effective, it will be shown by extra detection and extra convictions.  When we introduce the Criminal Justice Bill in the autumn giving extra powers to the Garda, if it is effective it will result in extra convictions and extra people going to prison.  As I said it is very difficult to project future prison needs.  It is an enormously costly system and is a huge burden on the taxpayer. When people are talking about vandalism and crime, about mandatory prison sentences and the desirability of keeping people in prison for very long periods, they might remember the figure of £424 <Col N="897" /> per week per prisoner out of their own taxes.</P>

Therefore, I am glad to have had the opportunity to deal with him on this Bill. I was more than pleased with his response both on the Second Stage and Committee Stage and I would like to compliment him for the open and generous way he dealt with various points, particularly on Second Stage, points which it probably could have been argued had no real relevance to the Bill.  I would like to compliment him on this Bill because I expect with the next Criminal Justice Bill I will not be in a position to be as reasonable or understanding as I am today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Nineteenth and Twentieth Reports currently before the House outline developments within the Community for the 12 months from July 1981 to July 1982. Community business during this period was dominated by the issue of the future financing of the Community and the demands of the UK for a reduction in their so-called &ldquo;net contribution&rdquo; to the Community budget.  This issue has continued to dominate Community business up to the present day and in the months ahead we will be dealing with many more of these issues.  Irish policy in these negotiations has remained essentially unchanged under successive Governments. We have continued to press the urgency of the case for an increase in the Community's Own Resources.  That, of course, in the main concentrates on getting the VAT limit of 1 per cent raised. At the same time, we have vigorously opposed any attempt to seek so-called &ldquo;budgetary balance&rdquo; by undermining the principles or operation of the common agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>That is, of course, the area which has the greatest interest for Ireland in the area where we had to defend consistently the policy which is so important to our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the EEC is fast approaching the currently agreed ceiling to their own resources has tended to place a straitjacket on the development of the Community.  With unemployment reaching almost unprecedented levels in Europe, there is an urgent need to develop existing policies, in particular the <Col N="899" /> regional and social funds, while at the same time designing new policies in such areas as industry, transport and the new technologies.  Only in this way can the Community demonstrate its responsiveness, and thereby its relevance, to the needs of the peoples of Europe.  Successive European Councils &mdash; the most recent being the Stuttgart meeting of 17-19 June &mdash; have underlined the importance of such development.  However, the absence of agreement on additional resources effectively continues to hinder its achievement.</P>
    <P>The recent Stuttgart Summit, as the Taoiseach indicated to the Dáil on his return, provided a strong impetus for the resolution of the current impasse.  A special emergency procedure, for instance, has been instituted to speed up consideration of the basket of measures now on the table.  The first phase of that will be tomorrow when we have a special Council meeting in Brussels to agree timetables and arrange this series of meetings that I will refer to over the next six months.  Special Councils will be held involving Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance and Agriculture.  These councils will review the entire range of questions at issue and will report to the Athens summit on 6 December which, we anticipate, should be in a position to take definitive decisions on the future financing and direction of the European Community. This is of vital importance for the future of the Community, and for Ireland's position within it.</P>
    <P>The alternative to an early decision to put new own resources in place would be contraction, decline and disillusionment. I cannot believe that any Government in Europe, conscious of the achievement and potential of the Community, would wish this to happen.  Stuttgart, in a sense, bore witness to this.  We now, as a result, have the political guidelines and the accelerated procedure to enable us to advance and progress, but we must do so quickly.  Time is no longer on our side. In fact, the recent statistics available in regard to agriculture spending bring this point even more closely home to us.</P>
    <P>The debate on the future financing of <Col N="900" /> the Community is taking place against the backdrop of the world recession &mdash; a recession which has placed severe constraints on the budgets of all Governments and institutions.  Its most tragic manifestation for the Community is the escalating rise in unemployment in all member states.</P>
    <P>Successive European Councils have devoted considerable attention both to analysing the underlying causes and to the development of policies to counteract the recession.  They considered that the objective of reducing unemployment called for a co-ordinated policy among the member states to promote productive investment, to increase competitiveness and productivity, and to develop a Community industrial strategy based on a technology and innovation policy. Agreement was reached to step up efforts to modernise European economic structures, to increase the convergence of the Community economies and to develop a specific Community measure to combat unemployment, especially among our young people.  All of you with an interest in this country will see how important these areas are to us at home.</P>
    <P>This fight against unemployment continues to be the Community's number one priority.  The recent agreement on the review of the European Social Fund marks an important development of the Community's strategy.  Two points in this review have special significance for Ireland.  First, 40 per cent of fund aid will be devoted to the six &ldquo;super-priority&rdquo; regions, which include Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Under the Commission's original proposals, it was proposed to abolish the existing legal guarantee of 50 per cent of the fund for regions eligible for regional fund aid.  Indeed, some members were opposed to any regional allocation of social fund aid.  It is, therefore, a considerable achievement that we have obtained a guarantee of 40 per cent of the fund aid for the super-priority regions which, on average over the last three years, have received a total of 38 per cent of the fund's aid.</P>
    <P>The second point in the review which I wish to note is the allocation of 75 per cent of the fund's resources to the promotion <Col N="901" /> of employment among young people.  The effect of these two points, the regional and youth allocation, should be to ensure that we can further intensify our efforts to provide employment, training and work experience for the young people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Already, as can be seen from the tables in both reports, Ireland receives considerable aid from the social fund.  In 1982, for instance, some IR£73.2 million had been received for operations in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Nineteenth Report notes that in October 1981 the Commission submitted their proposals to amend the regional fund regulations.  I regret that agreement has not yet been reached by the Council on this review.  Following discussions at a number of recent council meetings which I attended the major outstanding issue is the degree to which the fund's quota section should be further concentrated on the less developed regions of the Community.  Ireland will continue to seek effective further concentration of the fund's resources.</P>
    <P>With regard to payments from the fund, the Nineteenth Report points out that in 1981 Ireland received IR£53.9 million from the quota section and IR£0.66 million from the non-quota section for the special border areas programme. The equivalent figures for 1982 were IR£64 million from the quota section and IR£2 million from the non-quota section.</P>
    <P>I turn now to agriculture where the prices agreement for the 1982/83 marketing year provided for an overall level of price increase of 11 per cent.  Agreement was reached late into the marketing year on 18 May and then only after a UK attempt to block agreement had been successfully challenged.  The agreement this year on agricultural prices resulted in an overall increase of 9½ per cent.  Once again, however, agreement was not reached until late into the 1983-84 marketing year &mdash; on 17 May.  Successive Ministers for Agriculture have protested strongly at this tendency for delay in agreement on the prices package.  Such agreement should be arrived at prior to <Col N="902" /> the commencement of the marketing year for milk and beef in April.</P>
    <P>There were intensive negotiations during the period under review aimed at the establishment of a Common Fisheries Policy, which was finally agreed early this year.  The adoption of what is, in effect, the third fully developed policy area in the Community, demonstrates the continuing vitality of the EEC and marks probably the most important development in the Community in recent years. The adoption of the CFP now opens the way for the future long-term development of the Irish fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Progress was achieved in the negotiations on the accession of Portugal and Spain to the Community in the first half of last year, when agreement was reached on mini-packages of certain chapters listed in the report.  Following the request by the European Council last June, the Commission submitted to the European Council of 2-4 December 1982, an inventory of the problems posed by enlargement. The recent European Council on 17-19 June adopted a declaration which contained a statement that the accession negotiations with Spain and Portugal will be pursued with the objective of concluding them, so that the accession treaties can be submitted for ratification when the result of the negotiation concerning the future financing of the Community is submitted.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with the other member states, wishes to see a speedy and successful conclusion of the negotiations on enlargement of the Community.  At the same time, we emphasise that a solution to the problems facing the Community in the area of own resources is required in order to ensure that the Community can cope with the effects of enlargement.  The link between enlargement and a solution to the future financing of the Community is recognised in the European Council declaration to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>A referendum held in Greenland on 23 February 1982 resulted in a majority in favour of withdrawal from the Community. Arising from the results of this referendum, the Danish Government presented a request that Greenland's status in the European Communities be <Col N="903" /> changed from that of full membership to that of association as one of the overseas countries and territories.  The Commission has issued its opinion recommending that the Community accede to this request.  Discussion of the subject within the Community is proceeding.</P>
    <P>In March 1982, the Greek Government presented a memorandum concerning its position on its relations with the European Community.  The memorandum referred to the economic problems of Greece, which it attributed partly to Greece's membership of the European Communities and suggested that special arrangements be adopted to alleviate these problems.  The European Council of March 1982 requested the Commission to study and report on the memorandum. In June 1982, the Commission set out the results of its initial consideration of the Greek demand, for which it tried to find answers compatible with existing constraints. In March of this year the Commission presented a more detailed report on the subject.  This report sets out a number of proposals for Community measures in response to the memorandum.</P>
    <P>The subject was discussed at the European Council on 17-19 June.  The European Council welcomed the Commission's examination of the problems.  It also welcomed the fact that the Commission intends shortly to submit specific proposals, including their financial aspects, in various sectors complementing its earlier proposals.  It invited the Council to examine these proposals with a view to concrete decisions before the next European Council.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Community's external relations, the period under review has seen a deepening of the international recession which has placed some strains on the world trading system.  It is very heartening for Ireland, as a small open economy, that the Community and its major trading partners have, in general, avoided a protectionist response to these strains and that at the GATT ministerial meeting in November 1982 delegates undertook to resist protectionist pressures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> This is not to say that there are not difficulties.  Senators will recall the dispute with the United States over European steel exports.  I am happy to say that an agreement was reached in this matter. The United States and other trading partners such as Australia and New Zealand, have also criticised aspects of the Community's agricultural trade policy.  This was also a particular issue at the GATT ministerial meeting.  I am confident that a satisfactory accommodation can also be reached in this matter.  At any rate the Government will seek to ensure that the Community's right to a fair share of the world market in agricultural produce, which was confirmed in the Tokyo Round negotiations, is maintained.</P>
    <P>The growth in the Community's adverse trading balance with Japan was a matter of serious concern in the period in question.  Senators will appreciate that for certain member states, which manufacture goods such as motor cars, television sets, etc., which are in direct competition with Japanese goods, this is a very sensitive matter.  The Community has, therefore, sought to encourage Japan to open its markets to imports of manufactured goods.  I am encouraged by the steps which the Japanese Government have taken in this regard.  It is, of course, too early to say what their effect will be but the Japanese Government have shown increasing understanding of the concern with which Japan's trade surplus is viewed by her trading partners and this augurs well for future relations between the Community and Japan.</P>
    <P>I might perhaps mention two other developments which encourage me in the view that the world trading system will survive the current recession.  One was the extension to 1986 of the GATT arrangement on international trade in textiles, the so-called multifibres arrangement. Without the disciplines imposed by this arrangement it would be quite impossible to ensure that while developing and newly industrialised countries got a fair share of the world market in textiles, older textile industries in the developed world had the required breathing-space to adjust to the competition.  The other development was the amendment of the <Col N="905" /> OECD arrangement on export credits, adjusting minimum interest rates upwards, particularly for those countries classified as &ldquo;relatively rich&rdquo;.  This avoided a free-for-all in the rates offered under officially supported export credit systems.</P>
    <P>An outstanding feature of the Community's development policy is the &ldquo;Plan of Action to Combat Hunger in the World&rdquo; which followed an Italian Government initiative and a number of European Parliament Resolutions highlighting the worsening problem of world hunger.  As part of this programme, the Development Council of 3 November 1981 agreed to grant 40 million ECU in exceptional food aid to the least developed countries.  The plan of action provides for a food strategy approach which seeks to take into account all aspects of the agri-food problems in these countries and to integrate them into a cohesive national development policy.  This approach also provides a framework in which the developing countries national policies can be more effectively linked with foreign aid operations.  Mali, Kenya, Zambia and Rwanda have been chosen as the initial beneficiary countries.</P>
    <P>Progress was made at the Versailles Economic Summit of June 1982 in the direction of agreement on the early launching of global negotiations on international economic co-operation for development, and this was welcomed by the Community.  The unfavourable world politico-economic climate has unfortunately meant that further advancement has since then not been realised.  Ireland and its Community partners are committed to these negotiations and we are continuing to press for them.  A more realistic and pragmatic approach is now being adopted by the developing countries, as evidenced by the non-aligned summit in New Delhi in March and the Buenos Aires ministerial meeting of the G77 in March-April, but the outcome of the recent UNCTAD VI meeting in Belgrade did not live up to the concrete expectations many people had.  This meeting concluded last Sunday.  It was not a failure but did not reach the level of progress many of us wished.  The period under <Col N="906" /> review saw two particularly significant developments in the EPC process.  The first of these was the London Report, agreed by Foreign Ministers on 13 October 1981, and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 October.  The London Report contains a review of the working methods and administrative arrangements of political co-operation. The main body of the report introduces various improvements and adjustments to this machinery, as detailed in Chapter 19 of the 19th Report.  In the preamble to the London Report, the Foreign Ministers note with satisfaction that considerable progress has been achieved towards the objective of co-ordinating as closely as possible the foreign policies of the member states.  They recognise that EPC has developed to become a central element in the foreign policies of the Ten, so that the Community and its member states are increasingly seen by third countries as a coherent force in international relations.  The Foreign Ministers agreed also that foreign policy questions bearing on the political aspects of security would continue to be discussed, thus stating formally what has always been the practice with regard to discussion of security issues within EPC.</P>
    <P>The second important development was the launching, on 4 November 1981, of the Genscher/Colombo proposals on European union.  These proposals were discussed intensively throughout the period under review.  As the House will know, the negotiations on this matter resulted in agreement on the solemn declaration on European union which was signed by the Heads of State or Government of the Community Member States in Stuttgart on 19 June.  The solemn declaration on European union involves notably the bringing together under the umbrella of the European Council of the functions of the Communities and of EPC while retaining the essential character of each, the one based on the Treaties and the other on informal ministerial agreements. Closer cultural and legal co-operation is also envisaged.</P>
    <P>Ireland sees the signing of the solemn declaration as a particularly timely reaffirmation of the commitment of the member <Col N="907" /> states of the Community to the ideal of economic and political solidarity which inspired the Community at its foundation. Such a reaffirmation is needed as an inspiration to all of us, in all Community countries, as we face into a crucial set of discussions on the future membership, policies and finances of the Community.</P>
    <P>The solemn declaration is, of course, in itself no more than an inspiration, it must be followed up by practical action: as Ireland has consistently urged, economic and social progress and the creation of greater convergence between the economies of the member states is the only basis on which to secure progress towards European union.  It is the concrete and visible measures taken in these areas which will intensify the interdependence of the member states and which will form the basis of the co-operation which is essential if the task of building a European union is to succeed.</P>
    <P>In keeping with their objective of reaching a common stance and speaking with one voice on important questions of foreign policy, the member states have continued to concern themselves with the various areas of tension and conflict in the world.  During the past two years the problems of Poland and the Middle East in particular have consistently figured in discussions among the Ten.</P>
    <P>The Ten condemned strongly the invasion of Lebanon by Israel in June 1982 and reaffirmed their support for the independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon.  In addition they are convinced that any attempt to bring a lasting peace to the Middle East must, of necessity, provide for self-determination for the Palestinian people.  This, together with the principle that the state of Israel has a right to a secure and peaceful existence within recognised borders, remains central to the Middle East policy of the Ten.</P>
    <P>The situation in Poland and the negative impact of that situation on East/West relations generally, continues to be a cause of major concern.  Martial law was declared in Poland in December 1981 and the Ten, both jointly and individually, expressed their disapproval, to put it mildly, of events at that time.  In their <Col N="908" /> statement on 4 January 1982, the Foreign Ministers appealed for an end to martial law, the release of detainees, and the restoration of a genuine dialogue with the Church and Solidarity.  The Council of the European Communities also demonstrated its disapproval of the pressure exerted by the USSR and other Eastern European countries against efforts for renewal in Poland by placing a limit on the importation of certain goods from the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Although martial law was formally suspended at the end of 1982, this suspension was accompanied by a series of repressive legislative measures which are still in force.  The Heads of State and Government of the member states at their recent meeting in Stuttgart expressed their conviction that only a national reconciliation which takes full account of the aspirations of the Polish people, can lead Poland out of its grave crisis.</P>
    <P>At the CSCE meeting in Madrid, the Ten have been, and still are, working for agreement on a balanced and substantial concluding document.  A decisive stage has now been reached on these negotiations and I hope that it will be possible to bring them to a conclusion soon.  There have been considerable developments over the past few days.  The Ten, together with a number of other Western delegations, while largely accepting the text of a draft concluding document presented last March by a number of neutral and non-aligned countries consider that some minor improvements to this text are required, designed to strengthen the implementation of the human rights dimension of the Helsinki Final Act.</P>
    <P>The period covered by the Twentieth Report saw an outbreak of hostilities in the South Atlantic.  This regrettable episode was an issue of major concern to EPC, but I will confine myself here to expressing the hope that we have seen the last of armed conflict in that region of the world.</P>
    <P>The situation in Central America in recent years has been marked by large scale human rights violations; the continuation of long-standing social and economic injustices and increased tension <Col N="909" /> within and between certain countries of the region.  This has been of considerable concern to all members of the Community. Particular attention was given to the possibility of allocating more Community aid to the region, in an effort to lessen the grave economic and social problems which have given rise to many of the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Following its Stuttgart meeting, the European Council issued a statement on Central America in which they expressed their support for the initiative of the Contadora Group, for a political solution springing from the region itself and respecting the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers.  The Heads of State and Government underlined the need for the establishment of democratic conditions and the strict observance of human rights throughout the region.</P>
    <P>The Ten continue to follow closely events in Africa, particularly in the southern part of the Continent.  During the period under review, they welcomed and supported the efforts of the contact group of five western states to find an acceptable basis for the implementation of the United Nations plan on Namibia.  The Ten continue to voice their condemnation of the apartheid system in South Africa.</P>
    <P>The situation in Afghanistan remains a threat to regional stability and to international peace and security.  At its meeting on 29-30 March 1982 the European Council issued a statement which emphasised the importance of reaching a political solution on the basis of the complete withdrawal of foreign troops and respect for the independence, sovereignty and non-alignment of Afghanistan.  Unfortunately the troubles in that country still continue.</P>
    <P>The Ten continue to the concerned at the failure to achieve any progress towards a negotiated solution to the crisis in Kampuchea.  In his statement to the ASEAN meeting on 19 June 1982, the then President-in-Office of the Ten, Mr. Tindemans, reaffirmed that the Ten continue to believe that Vietnamese troops must be withdrawn from Kampuchea, that all internal factions must be disarmed <Col N="910" /> and the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own future free from intimidation or coercion must be respected.</P>
    <P>The situation there is a cause of continuing concern to everybody.  The immediate prospects of a solution in that area seem very remote.  An unfortunate consequence of the problem in Kampuchea is the very big number of refugees on the border between Kampuchea and Thailand. I mention that having had an opportunity of seeing them when I was attending a recent meeting in Bangkok.  It would leave a prominent and indelible mark on anyone to see the conditions under which these unfortunate refugees live, camped between two borders of Thailand and Kampuchea.  They cannot get into Thailand and they cannot go back into Kampuchea.  In fact, they are hounded along the border strip.  In one area I came across a group who had to move for the sixth time because of shellfire. That is an illustration in human terms of what conflict can lead to.</P>
    <P>The member states have followed closely events in Turkey, since the military takeover in September 1980.  During the period under review discussions among the Ten have concentrated on human rights issues.  In February 1982, Mr. Tindemans visited Ankara and made known to the military authorities the concern of the Governments and of the people of the member states at the situation in Turkey.  This concern focussed particularly on alleged instances of torture of prisoners and other human rights violations.  It is hoped however that the parliamentary elections scheduled for 6 November next, will herald a return to democracy in Turkey.  I hope the next time I report to the House we will have seen a return to democracy there.</P>
    <P>The Community are now looking forward to their third enlargement with the accession of Spain and Portugal.  The Ten recognize the political importance of membership for these two countries, and have therefore, agreed to associate Spain and Portugal as fully as possible with the procedures of European political co-operation. The two future Community members have been kept informed regularly <Col N="911" /> of developments within political co-operation with a view to gradual harmonisation of their foreign policy positions with those of the Ten.  During the period under review, the first meeting at ministerial level took place between the Foreign Ministers of the Ten, and their Spanish and Portuguese colleagues.  This meeting saw a valuable exchange of views on matters of current interest to both sides.</P>
    <P>All in all, then, there was considerable progress and activity in the area of political co-operation in the period under review.</P>
    <P>I have here been able to give only a brief summary of the major developments in the Community in the period covered by the reports being debated today.  I would, of course, be happy to respond to any questions which Senators raise on these or other developments related to Community affairs.</P>
    <P>The period under review was a difficult time for efforts to develop new policies in the Community.  Despite the efforts of member states to move ahead, the necessary political will was missing.  To some extent this reflected the depth of the recession but now, as we see the first signs of recovery in the international economy, we perhaps can look forward to a more decisive, coherent and relevant response to the problems of the Europe of the eighties and beyond.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, the Community will have to come to terms with the central issue facing it and overshadowing all other problems &mdash; its future financing.  Following Stuttgart, as said earlier, negotiations will be started under a special emergency procedure to enable the necessary decisions to be taken at the earliest possible date.  I intend that Ireland will play an active, positive and progessive role in these discussions.  It is most important for our very relevance as a Community that we achieve a qualitative move forward in Europe.  Ireland will be fully involved in the urgent efforts towards this most important goal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate but I deplore the fact that it has taken so <Col N="912" /> long for this report to come before the House.  The report deals with the affairs of the Community since 1 July 1981.  That is two years ago despite the fact that section 5 of the 1972 European Communities Act provides that we should have a twice yearly report and debate in this House on the developments in the Community.  In case the Minister might feel aggrieved that I should express annoyance at this, I would add that during the short period in office of the previous Government there was no report either.  I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that immediately after the recess, in the autumn, we will have the reports covering the period up to this year.  It is nonsense to be discussing a report on the affairs and business of the Community two years ago especially during a period when great pressure is being experienced, not only at Community level, but at national level.  We are entitled to make some input into the management of the Community.</P>
      <P>The concept of the Community comes in for more criticism than praise.  Many people, with different political views, view the Community from a negative point of view.  Greater emphasis should be placed on the achievements of the Community.  There should be recognition of the benefits which have flowed from our membership of the Community.  A concerted effort should be made to maximise the support and aid which have flowed from the Community since 1973.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State for the very detailed report he made to the House.  He has covered the period under review, paragraph by paragraph.  His open approach is welcomed by all concerned.  We all support him and his Minister's efforts to bring about greater equality not only here but in the Community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent figures prove beyond doubt that this country is a net beneficiary from membership of the Community.  The indications are that we will continue to be so.  A strong Community with well-conceived and developed policies is in Ireland's interest.  From the time Mr. Costello proposed that we should seek membership in the early sixties, which <Col N="913" /> was supported by Mr. Seán Lemass when he was Taoiseach, I have followed the progress of the Community.  There is need for the development of a number of policies.  I urge all Ministers to ensure that the development and the introduction of new policies will not be at the expense of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The CAP has not only provided benefits for producers and processors but has provided the Community as a whole with a very stable food supply.  When people criticise the Common Agricultural Policy they should remember other power blocs such as the Soviet Union and China that are not able to feed their population.  It is ironic to find people criticising a policy and seeking to have it dismantled when it is successful in feeding the population of the Community. Through the generous policies of the Community, a considerable amount of food aid is disbursed through the food aid programme to many countries.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech he mentioned the Community's policy and programme to combat hunger.  This is a very laudable policy.  He said that Mali, Kenya, Zambia and Rwanda would be the initial chief beneficiaries from this increased aid.  I should like to ask the Minister why Niger, which is in many ways one of the more oppressed land-locked countries, has not been included in the first tranche of this programme.  Looking at it dispassionately their case would surely rank for a stronger commitment.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is constantly under attack.  If we were to concentrate our efforts on controlling some of the abuses and, to a lesser extent, some of the minor frauds which are committed against this policy at the expense of Community funds in general, we would make a greater contribution.  In dealing with the European Communities we, as a nation, should have a policy which would clearly assist, support, advise and facilitate Irish firms, or Irish farmers, or Irish industrialists, or Irish small business projects, to maximise the benefits they can obtain through European Community policies.</P>
    <P>This is very important, It beats me to find after ten years that there are so many <Col N="914" /> headings under which funds could flow to this country, were it not for the fact that the various Departments of State like to keep all these schemes under their hats. This is particularly annoying.  For instance, we have organisations such as the health boards.  They can requisition whatever funds are required either through the county councils or the Department of Health, so they are not particularly worried about their own funding.  If they had a little more energy and investigated all the avenues open to them to claim recoupment under the Social Fund, it would be in the national interest for them to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's Department will look at this problem.  There should be absolutely no secrecy in Government circles about how aid should be applied for, or about the problems associated with it. There is one area in the transport policy where we have slipped up.  I spent two years as President of the European Parliament's Commission on Transport.  I hoped in the mid-seventies that it would be possible to devise a policy that would recognise this country's inaccessible position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other eight member states.  In the interests of fair competition we should be compensated for the fact that it is so expensive either to import to or export from this country.  Yet, the fact of our geographical location has not been compensated for in the policy to date.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will inform his colleague, the Minister for Transport, of this and ask him to investigate what proposals we could make to assist the transport industry in this regard.  To equip himself with rolling stock the private haulier has to pay much higher taxes than his competitors even in Northern Ireland.  There is a very obvious and recognisable element of unfair competition here.  Our people will have to get a fair crack of the whip.  Under the Treaty of Rome we are entitled to be compensated so that our hauliers will be able to compete effectively with competition from Northern Ireland, the UK or the Continent as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the situation regarding the budget.  It is rather difficult to be effective because in <Col N="915" /> the Nineteenth Report we are talking about the first budget of 1981, that is, the European Community budget.  It was decided there that a reduction of 561 million European units of account in the appropriations for the FEOGA Guarantee Section &mdash; that is the agricultural price support &mdash; would be made.  They increased the appropriations to the Regional Fund by 200 million ECU.  They increased the appropriations to the FEOGA Guidance Section by 50 million European units of account, and appropriations to the food aid programme by 100 million ECU.  I should like to ask the Minister if the actual payments were increased similarly.</P>
    <P>I know it is quite laudable to increase the Regional Fund, the appropriations for foreign aid, and the contribution for the Co-operation with Non-Associated Developing Countries.  It is acceptable to have a transfer of payments from one side of FEOGA to the other.  I do not think we can continue to spend greater amounts of money in other fields at the expense of the common agricultural policy.  In the entire community it is the only policy which has been effective, which has worked, which has done exactly what it was designed to do &mdash; provide a stable market and a stable supply of high quality food for the population of Europe.  It has been successful.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and our Government will make greater efforts to ensure that the Community will decide to increase their own resources, that is, that they will go above the 1 per cent VAT which is the amount it takes to run the Community.  The Community cannot stay static.  It must develop.  We must have policies that are aware of and recognise the needs of the present vast population and also provide for the future.</P>
    <P>Reading over the statistics on the payments to this country, and looking at the way we have benefited from FEOGA, both in the guidance and the guarantee sections, but in the guidance section in particular, it is regrettable that we have been able to take up such a very low percentage of the appropriations which were earmarked for various developments here.  We rank second lowest on <Col N="916" /> that list.  This, to my mind, means total inefficiency in much of the co-operative sector.  The only bright spot in the entire country when it comes to availing of and benefiting from the FEOGA guidance sector is the Kerry Co-op which was in the news recently.  If they applied for a grant they went ahead and availed of it. The percentage of the take up in this country is disappointingly low, and something should be done about it.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the IDA, to the Department of Agriculture and to the civil servants who are operating the schemes, that they should examine their conscience and see which side are they on.  It took many years for the IDA to get around to the payment of enabling grants to enable people to take up FEOGA grants.  Now they have finally consented to do that.  I admire their work and I believe they have excellent people there.  They go after the jobs and they do their best to provide new jobs.  They cannot expect that every industrial development they fund will be 100 per cent successful.  More of their staff should give greater emphasis to servicing the community.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why after ten years every official in the IDA dealing with FEOGA grants, or dealing with the regional fund does not understand the section down to the very last comma, the very last detail.  It is unacceptable that they can make mistakes, and drag their heels and force Irish companies starting off to borrow bridging capital &mdash; to take up the slack where IDA grants should have been paid &mdash; at 20 per cent interest from the Industrial Credit Corporation, another semi-State organisation.  Do we want these companies to get off the ground?  Do we really believe in providing job opportunities, or are we going to sit back and see indolence in one semi-State organisation forcing young industrialists to go out of business &mdash; especially smaller companies where they have not got the expertise.  The big industrial corporations have their own accountants and project managers.  They are able to look after their own business.  Small concerns employing 20 to 40 people in the processing sector or in the input sector have not got the experience and you cannot <Col N="917" /> expect them to have the professional expertise from day one.</P>
    <P>There should be somebody in the IDA who could give them an indication step by step as to how to apply for a FEOGA grant and how to claim the grant when the grant is paid.  The enabling grants should be paid the day they are sanctioned instead of forcing these people to pay 20 per cent or 22 per cent to the ICC in the form of bridging capital.  I estimate that some 80 per cent of the FEOGA grants made available to industrial development in this country goes to the banks, the ICC and the ACC by way of interest on bridging capital.</P>
    <P>That is a disgrace and the Government must look seriously at that situation.  It is grossly unfair to the entire concept of the common agricultural policy or the European regional policy whereby the moneys are made available for the specific purpose of assisting the development of industries in rural Ireland or, indeed, in any part of the country.  I would ask the Minister to see in what way the processing of these loans can be speeded up, and how people with ideas who are making the investment can be assisted in the process.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal very briefly with the Nineteenth Report, paragraph 10.14, page 44, under the heading Energy R &amp; D and Demonstration Programme (1979-1902).  Paragraph 10.14 is the Alternative Energy Sources Demonstration Programme.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The contract for phases II and III of the Bord na Móna, Forestry and Wildlife Service and Electricity Supply Board short rotative forestry project has been signed.</P>
    <P>I have been interested in this programme since the first energy crisis back in 1974. In Counties Laois, Offaly, Kildare and Westmeath there is a concentration of workers who are engaged by both Bord na Móna and the ESB.  The bogs will be cut out over a period of the next 20 years. I am appalled that there is no long-term plan by either of those excellent bodies to conserve jobs in the Midlands or to create further jobs.  The biomass project <Col N="918" /> which I thought held out a ray of hope that workers in the Midlands could continue in industrial employment seems to be suffering from apathy and the indolence in both Bord na Móna and the ESB. Of course DG 17 I believe must bear a significant part of the blame for this.  I am not satisfied that either of these semi-State organisations have availed of the finance, the funds, the grants made available to carry out this biomass experiment and see if we could have an alternative, an ongoing self-replacing energy source by way of fast growing trees.  Bord na Móna reluctantly made available some 50 acrea in Clonsast and then seemingly forgot about them.  The last time I looked at them they were in an unholy mess and finding it difficult to compete with the weeds, or whatever.</P>
    <P>I also know that the ESB have not been terribly co-operative.  They have not put in furnaces that are necessary.  They too have adopted a half-hearted approach.  I believe the planners in the ESB were peeved because they were not allowed to build their four nuclear energy reactors in Wexford.  I do not think that is good enough.  If funds are made available from the Community, and especially if the people who are going to benefit directly, the agents handling them, or semi-State organisations, there must be some share of accountability.</P>
    <P>I should like to contrast the way we do our business with the United States where the Office of Technology Assessment reports directly to the Senate and the President on what should or should not be done by way of technological advancement and development.  They are given a ruthless examination.  We have the National Board of Science and Technology. That organisation got off to a marvellous start when it was under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, but recently it was transferred to a different Department.  It does not have the same clout, it does not have the same teeth.  It obviously has lost all its power. It has no supervisory role worth a damn at present.  That transfer alone caused the relegation and the demise of the experiment on biomass.  It did not get a fair chance because in the first report I read <Col N="919" /> it was possible for figures of ten tons per acre to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Experiments carried out in the US and Canada, in France and in Sweden were successful and in all those countries they do not have the same growing facilities that we have.  I am going by the agricultural scientific reports I come across or that are made available to me.  The best use is certainly not being made of those EEC grants.  The whole experiment was mismanaged and, to my mind, there is no obvious Government supervision.  The authority of the National Board of Science and Technology has been eroded. That body should be taken back under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach so that they would have at least some influence in the pecking order.</P>
    <P>There is an article by M.J. Drennan, A.J. Cole and J. O'Dwyer in the current issue of <i>Farm &amp; Food Research</i>, a publication by An Foras Talúntais.  The article headed &ldquo;Two Beef Production Systems on Peat Land&rdquo; is relevant and I should like to quote two paragraphs from it which will illustrate the point I want to make:</P>
    <P>Previous studies have shown the potential of reclaimed cutover peatland to produce grass.  Likewise, satisfactory performance has been obtained with mature cattle in grazing studies on peatland.  When provided with adequate copper a suckler herd has been satisfactorily carried on reclaimed cutover peatland.  The objective of the present work was to use grass grown on peatland (grazed in summer and as silage in winter) to take calves from birth to slaughter and also to keep high producing cows (multiple sucklers). The only other source of that feed consisted of milk in the calf stage and beet pulp based concentrate.</P>
    <P>The article goes on to tell us in great detail exactly how they arrived at the present result.  I quote again:</P>
    <P>The results of these trials show that with suitable copper administration calves can be satisfactorily taken from birth to slaughter at 2 years of age on <Col N="920" /> cutover peatland when the main feed source is grazed grass in summer and silage in winter.</P>
    <P>That brings us back to 1974.  I have read over that report.  I want to compliment the people who have been working assiduously on that research project.  It is a rather optimistic report.  I should like to say to Bord na Móna that under the Turf Development Acts they have not got the power or the statutory authority to engage in any activity other than the production of fuel and energy.  If Bord na Móna think it is desirable or expedient for them to start farming 5,000 or 6,000 or 10,000 acres in 1,000 acre farms and think they can get away with that kind of State farming in this country, how can the average Irish farmer with 35 or 36 acres compete with such a semi-State organisation?</P>
    <P>My other objection is that if the 10,000 or 12,000 acres in the counties of Offaly, Laois, Westmeath and Kildare were all turned in over the next 15 years when they are cutover and are no longer of use in the production of peat, and turned into 1,000 acre State farms, they will not be able to carry 1 per cent of the workforce engaged in the energy industry at present. That would be a shame.  I ask the Minister of State, having regard to the fact that there is obvious mismanagement in the administration of grants from the European energy programme to ask his colleague with responsibility for the Irish Land Commission to look again at the question of reallocating the bogs to the farmers from whom they were compulsorily acquired for as little as half a crown an acre in the thirties and forties.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 10.14 on page 44 of the Nineteenth Report we see that the contract for phases II and III of the Bord na Móna, Forestry and Wildlife Service and Electricity Supply Board short rotating project has been signed.  The House should concern itself with what has gone on since then.  I know it is two years ago, but they have very little to show for it. They have not even shown the will to succeed or to make any great contribution towards this.  I am most annoyed that obviously in those semi-State organisations <Col N="921" /> there is no forward planning.  No hope is held out for the continued employment of the very large and excellent workforce those semi-State companies have in the midland counties I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>The problem arises that it is difficult to get information on those programmes.  I do not see why in any public bodies there should be such secrecy surrounding such experiments or such parts of the activities of either Bord na Móna or the ESB.  We must look at the usage of those bogs.  We are concerned about energy.  Experiments in the US on the liquid fuel production &mdash; that would be alcohol production &mdash; have been most successful.  If the grants are available to us to carry out similar experiments, we have an obligation to do so.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Fund there are quite a number of training programmes.  The European Community provide the funds for AnCO or any other of these semi-State organisations for training or retraining programmes and there is no reason why they should not be prudently spent and very closely looked at.  Above all, there should not be duplication.  I note in our area in the last year or so that some of these European-financed courses have tended to compete with the normal courses under the aegis of the Department of Education.  For example, a course can be organised in any vocational school and the Department of Education insist that adult education courses must be self-financing.  From the advertisements in the provincial papers it appears that in the midland counties last year some of those courses had a £30 enrolment fee.  The following week on the same paper there will be an advertisement for a European-financed AnCO course where £30 per week is paid to students to pursue the same studies.</P>
    <P>Is it just because the money is coming from, Europe by way of a grant that it should be spent without regard for the taxpayers or for what the end product will be?  It is wrong that there should be competition between one agency and another.  It is wrong to have Social Fund moneys used in direct competition with the Irish taxpayers' funds in this way. <Col N="922" /> This calls for scrutiny and I would ask the Minister to have a look at that aspect of the expenditure of the Social Fund.  I do not accept that there can be one course under the aegis of the Department of Education through the VECs who are insisting on £15 or £30 as an enrolment fee while in some rented accommodation, with teachers who may not have their ceard teastas and all the qualifications they would need if they applied for a full-time teaching post under the Department, pupils can be paid to pursue much the same kind of studies.  This is a gross violation of the spirit of the Community and it cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I would like now to talk very briefly on the powers of the European Parliament. In the seven-and-a-half years that I spent there we had great visions, as we prepared for direct elections, of the new directly elected Parliament having a greater say and greater powers.  It is necessary if the policies are to be effective that they should reflect the views and the aspirations of the citizens from all over the Community.  It has not happened like that.  I am disappointed that the Parliament has not taken greater powers in its first term as a directly elected Parliament and as representatives of the people of this Community.  I believe in the democratic process but if the Council of Ministers continue in so many ways to frustrate the wishes of the elected representatives of the European Parliament then I do not think the Council are helping the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to conclude with two further points.  First, there are too many obstacles to inter-Community trade which are not being tackled strongly enough and I would hope that the Government would have a greater input to the debate.  There are many official requirements and we suffer from the requirements of other member states. Despite the Buy Irish campaign the Irish purchaser or housewife does not seem to discriminate against the produce of other member states, whereas in other countries certainly the people discriminate in many instances against goods originating in this country.</P>
      <P>The final point I want to make is on the Regional Fund.  During 1974 and 1975 when Lord Thompson of Dundee was Commissioner for Regional Policy I worked very closely with him as chairman of the Regional Policy Commission.  He coined a word &lsquo;additionality&rsquo; because he said the Regional Fund should be an addition to the expenditure already being made in the various member states. Unfortunately, while the payments from the Regional Fund to this country have increased significantly, there is still no sign of this being an addition to the funds that would normally be spent.  Where there are large infrastructural developments in progress, such as road improvements or telephone exchanges, one sees signs saying that this work is assisted by the European Regional Development Fund.  That is very laudable but it is not what was intended in the legislation.</P>
      <P>I worked very closely with the Commission during the years previous to the institution of the fund and in the formative years after the fund came into operation and the view was that the fund would be for the creation of job opportunities. In our experience in this country it has tended to substitute for the Road Fund and for the normal capital Exchequer programme for the provision of telephone exchanges, harbour developments and so on.  The fund would be better spent if it were spent in the various remote corners of the country to provide direct employment in the productive sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> I am glad the Minister has taken up where he left off during his previous term his very important contribution towards development aid throughout the Third World.  It is important that a Government should have a Minister in charge of development aid.  We may be going through a difficult economic phase here, but when you look across the world &mdash; and you do not have to look very far &mdash; there are communities and countries whose development is very far behind that of Ireland. It is appropriate that we should have the political will to share our good fortune and to try to bring as much comfort as possible to the oppressed and the under-developed people in the world.  I am happy that the Minister is putting in the effort and that he travels personally to as many parts of the globe as possible to see at first hand the problems.  It is not possible to appreciate the effect of hunger and famine without actually coming in contact with it.  I hope that he will continue to press for a greater share of the country's resources to be allocated to that part of his brief.  I hope that despite the fact that we are going through a lean period our Government will do their utmost to achieve the target set by the United Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is not before its time that these two reports are presented to us.  Since this Oireachtas assembled these documents have become more and more of historical value rather than documents which should be discussed here in a comtemporary manner.  Irrespective of the fact that many changes have taken place since these reports were published, we should welcome the opportunity to discuss them.  The Minister in his speech gave the up-to-date situation on the topics discussed in the reports.  It must be said that if one did a precis of these two reports and each of the preceding reports it would be apparent that, except for changes of dates and changes in certain figures, the objectives are much the same.  The objectives have not been met and the main items discussed are usually virtually the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of these discussions <Col N="926" /> has been the economic and social situation and the consideration of matters which would give practical implementation to measures which would case the huge areas of disarray in social and economic activity of member states.</P>
    <P>There has been dramatic failure by the EEC to supply the social and economic needs of the weaker states in the Community. This failure to give help and support to less well-off member states continues. There has been absolutely no change in this from the time we entered the Community.  The considerable pressure at budget time each year contributes to this problem.  There are pressures to eliminate the CAP and other social fund provisions which would give to countries like Ireland a fairer share of the cake within the Community.  The difficulties last year when negotiating farm prices did untold damage to our economy.  We must find a more acceptable way of negotiating which will give the farming community a reasonable and necessary updating of price and support mechanisms which they need.</P>
    <P>The farming community play such an enormous part in the economic life of this country that it is essential to have proper negotiating methods which will give a continuity of economic planning to this vital sector.  Without this continuity of economic planning and a negotiation procedure which will give an earlier price rise structure to the farmers through the CAP and through other support mechanisms, the benefits which have accrued in the past to this country through these supports will be dissipated totally.  The <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements that now seem to be in vogue do not give confidence to the agri-based sector.</P>
    <P>One of the major inhibiting factors in the industrial sector over the past few years has been the undue and in many cases penal interest rates being levied by banks in Ireland.  Equally the penal rate of inflation has been an inhibiting factor. All sectors of the agricultural business are agreed that inflation and interest rates are the two major factors hampering the planned and profitable business that <Col N="927" /> agriculture should be.  It was extremely noticeable that interest rates were considered to be of prime importance, whether dealing with companies in the beef sector such as Clover Meats or in the dairy sector such as Avonmore.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a long-term stabilised interest subsidy or interest rate which would give to these industries the type of help that they need to plan their business for the next four, five or six years.  In a cheese factory such as we have in Avonmore up to £8 million worth of cheese has to be kept in cold storage for seven or eight months to give the breathing space that it needs before it is put on the market.  One must consider the amount of money tied up and the difference it would make if the same interest rate applied in Ireland as applies to cheesemaking enterprises in Holland or Germany.  The interest rates that are applied in the agricultural section here are in excess of 15 per cent, while in Europe the average interest rate would be in the region of 5½ to 6 per cent.  One sees the difficulties that are experienced by this section.</P>
    <P>The support that should be available from the EEC has not been forthcoming. When one considers Avonmore and its impact on the local economic scene one realises the value of trying to have the EEC give us some type of continuity of interest subsidy or an interest mechanism that can help out in this sector.  One has to consider that there are 1,600 people directly employed in this industry and that there are 2,350 suppliers.  It can be said with certainty that if you have 2,350 suppliers in the milk sector, then each of these would have at least a three to one ratio of employment on the farm.  In that industry in County Kilkenny and the surrounding areas we are talking in terms of about 10,000 people.</P>
    <P>We had the unfortunate situation in Kilkenny where we had an industry set up on 13½ acres in which Irish banking money, Irish commercial money and American commercial money was involved.  The investment in Fieldcrest turned out to be £35 million which was lost to the Irish economy.  That £35 million <Col N="928" /> was spent on 13½ acres.  There was a proposal that we could use 100 million ECUs in agriculture and that this would give to agriculture a profitable business mechanism.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many people could justify the spending of £35 million on 13½ acres when one considers the minimal amount of money that would be required to update the meat processing factories. If one put £35 million into the pig meat factories and if we got 35 million ECUs, we would have the basis not alone for updating the facilities available in these meat factories but we would get them on to a competitive level.  There is no doubt the markets are available and the product is also available.</P>
    <P>One of the problems of the very high interest rates is that this is a time when we need to increase our cattle herd.  An increase in our cattle herd is important not only to the agricultural community but to the industrial sector and our employment potential.  Unfortunately farmers at present are not able to bring their cattle herds to the necessary level because we have such high interest rates. They are not able to buy at the right time and they are not able to keep their cattle for long enough because they have to keep paying off the banks at penal interest rates.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the export of cattle on the hoof creating major problems for the industrial sector and that it would be better to have these cattle processed in Ireland.  There is certainly a place for both cattle on the hook and cattle on the hoof.  There is a place for both of these individual industries.  We must have enough cattle to keep factories going on a continuous basis so that when people go abroad to sell for us they can guarantee a supply.  There must be an attempt made from within the EEC to provide some sort of help to bring interest rates down and this would enable an increase in our herd numbers.  We can, by doing that, support the very necessary export of cattle on the hoof and also give the numbers of cattle, sheep or pigs to our factories to increase the employment.</P>
    <P>The Community has not grasped this nettle at all and unless they do so we <Col N="929" /> cannot see the full potential of agriculture being achieved.  There never will be equal economic levels of activity within the Community.  There must be help and support on a far greater basis than at present in these very important areas of interest support and help in decreasing our inflation problems.</P>
    <P>I realise that an attempt was made last year, and still continues, to help out farmers who have got themselves into difficulties because of borrowing requirements which were brought about by attempts to upgrade enterprises or to purchase land to bring up holdings to an economically viable size.  There were too many regulations and conditions placed on this package and because of that it has not been as successful a package as one would like to see.  Of the farmers who are in economic trouble with their bank and with lending agencies only 35 per cent have either been processed or approved under these support measures.  This is after nearly two years of this type of economic help being introduced by the Government and the EEC.  I do not for a moment suggest that farmers or borrowers other than farmers who get into difficulties because of their own lack of business acumen or because they borrowed for non-productive purposes, or who borrowed for productive purposes and did not use the borrowings for those purposes, should be in any way helped by the banking system, the Government or by anybody else.  They should have to bear the same failure problems as any other sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>During the past few months we have had the first consciously planned devaluation of Irish currency and the actual size of the devaluation was less than the scheduled changes in central rates against the ECU might suggest, because of the 2¼ per cent band of flexibility around the central rate.  In the aftermath of the realignment the Irish currency moved from close to the bottom to the top of the table while the revalued Deutschemark dropped to the bottom of the band, and this repeated the experience of revaluing and devaluing currencies in previous realignments. The outcome was to produce <Col N="930" /> a change in the value of Irish currency against the Deutschemark of about onehalf the stated change in the central rates against the ECU.  The basic effect of the devaluation was to offset the exceptional rise of the currency against sterling which served to warrant competitiveness still further in a period when manufacturing unit wage costs in the Republic were rising at a faster rate than in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>As a non-economist it is very hard to judge if the devaluation in the long-term will have the effects that were perceived to be needed, or whether it will be a failure.  There is no doubt that in the short-term it did offset some of the problems we were having when our currency was again approaching the very high valuation that was put on the English pound over the past number of years.  Pressures on the Dublin money market have eased in the aftermath of the currency realignment and bank interest rates have been reduced, but not to the level which ruled before the realignment.  When we look at interest rates right across the world we find that our interest rates are much higher in real terms than in any of the countries to which we are exporting or from whom we are buying.</P>
    <P>The speculative pressures which developed in the European currency markets prior to the realignment have been removed and the prospect of a movement towards lower interest rates in European countries has been improved.  The adverse impact of competitiveness from the decline in sterling from the autumn of 1982 onwards has been at least partly offset and the realignment of the green £, the artificial agricultural exchange rate, has provided an additional gain to farming income in the Republic.  The devaluation of the Irish pound, however, provides no solution to the problem of declining competitiveness.  The long-term inflationary impetus released by devaluation could, in the circumstances of the Irish economy, work towards offsetting the immediate competitive gain unless steps are immediately taken by the Government to contain them.  A devaluation provides no soft option and no escape from the need to prevent costs <Col N="931" /> from rising at a faster rate than that occurring in other countries in trade and employment, if trade and employment are to be maintained.</P>
    <P>During the period mentioned we had the Williamsburg Summit.  That meeting took place in a magnificent setting near Washington.  The so-called world leaders met in that seventeenth century mansion. It is possible they were influenced by their surroundings because nothing came out of that summit that would give hope to any unemployed person in this country. From the point of view of employment potential, they have given us nothing.  We heard of major conflicts at that summit because of what the United States thought should be done.  We saw the protectionism of the United States coming back.  They said there was a need to keep interest rates up and to stop any refuelling of the economy of the United States, except on a long-term basis.  That statement was made at a time when we in Europe depend so much on the United States as a major economic unit and need their help in giving an impetus to the market place and releasing into this economic area some of the benefits that are now re-emerging because of the refuelling of the economic situation in the United States.  I believe we are coming to the run-up to an American Presidential election.  Within the next few months we are going to see more and more fuelling of the economic situation there, not for any economic reasons but because President Reagan will be trying to hold on to his seat.  He will be trying to stimulate the American economy.  If he does not help the other economic areas of the world, the present upsurge in economic activity in the United States cannot continue.</P>
    <P>We had the European Stuttgart Summit and there is no doubt that a feeling of helplessness is emerging.  We have seen in both the Williamsburg and Stuttgart Summits a hardening of nationalistic attitudes and because of this we cannot see the basic tenets of the EEC being implemented.  The Minister stated that as part of this Stuttgart Summit a special emergency procedure has been instituted to speed up consideration of the basket <Col N="932" /> of measures now on the table, that a series of special councils will be held involving specific Ministeries to review the entire range of questions at issue, they will report to the Athens Summit in December 1983, and that there will emerge decisions on the future financing and direction of the European Community.</P>
    <P>That paragraph contains many of the pious platitudes which have been in the reports of the European Economic Community over the past number of years and this basket of measures now on the table is something that will read well but I would like to see what practical value these special emergency procedures have been in the European Economic Community when every month we see a rise in unemployment rates which is totally unsustainable.  This rise in the unemployment rate is creating problems not alone in the social and economic fields, but it is taking away from people their dignity to live in their own community, to be part of that community, to work to help it and to feel they play a part in the structure of that community.</P>
    <P>This range of talks is vital to the future of the EEC, and more particularly to the continued membership of Ireland within the Community.  As the Minister stated, time is not on our side; and time is definitely not on our side when one looks at the social implications of unemployment. The EEC must take a lot of blame for the fact that unemployment levels have been allowed to rise in the EEC because of the economic stances taken up by individual Governments, when it appears that the dropping of an inflation rate is much more valuable than keeping 100,000 people in work and when one sees the number of young people in this country who have suggested &mdash; and it is being suggested to them every day by outside commentators &mdash; that at least one-third of them will never work.  It is time for the Ministers and the EEC to do something about these problems rather than setting up special councils and meeting at special summits.  I notice the next summit will be held in Athens in November.  Summits were held at Stuttgart, Williamsburg and Tokyo.  The range of summits that have <Col N="933" /> taken place to provide answers &mdash; which they never provided &mdash; is amazing.  I do not think these summit meetings do anything but create arenas where international wars can now take place without a shot being fired &mdash; something akin to the Olympic Games.  If you cannot go out and fight with tanks and guns, you can fight battles in the press, on the radio and on television.  These battles are of no use to anybody, except that they give publicity to the people who make the speeches.</P>
    <P>These leaders have not settled one economic or social problem.  As the Minister stated, in the year 1982 we received £64 million from the quota section of the Regional Fund and £2 million from the non-quota section, but this was not sufficient for our needs.  Although in plain money terms it was an increase from £53.9 million and £0.66 million in 1981, considering our inflation rate and the increasing need to bring our infrastructural and social services up to date, it was not an increase in real terms; rather it was a decrease.  The objectives of the EEC at the beginning were that we would bring the less well off countries of Europe in line with the richer nations, but this objective has not been reached.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the difficulties experienced on our economic front because of delays in implementing agricultural prices on 17 May 1983.  I will not go further into that at this stage.  The Minister stated that he wishes to see a speedy and successful conclusion to the negotiations on enlargment of the Community. That does not seem to be right in view of the fact that we have not even started to tackle the problems in the Economic Community.  I do not see why we should speedily enlarge the Community until we solve some of the present economic and social problems in the European Community.  When we look at the countries that are at present negotiating to enter or who have been accepted, we see that it is not the economically advanced countries in Europe which will be the major sufferers.  We will see a levelling down of our economic standards because we are bringing in further agriculture-oriented countries.  The pressure, therefore is, going to be from the <Col N="934" /> economically developed countries to stop supporting what they consider to be lame duck countries.  They are not lame duck countries; they are the countries which are now negotiating to get into the EEC. I do not think we should bring anybody else into the Community until we solve our present problems, until we see a deliberate and positive attempt being made to bring the standards of living of the Irish people up to those of the Germans, the Dutch or the Belgians, or to bring the standard of living of the Italians up to levels which could be sustainable. At this time to be considering enlargment is not an option we should entertain.  In the Minister's statement there is a sentence which says that the link between enlargement and a solution to the future financing of the Community is recognised in the European Council Declaration. Again, I suggest that this is one of the pious, platitudinous statements which mean nothing and will not help our way forward.</P>
    <P>When we come to the sections dealing with the Community's external relations, it would appear that the Community accept the fact that there is a deepening international recession.  To put into a speech that the EEC accepts that we have a deepening of the international recession would appear to be something any schoolboy could put into a statement, but it makes no difference to the fact that we are in an international recession and I do not think putting it into the statement is going to do anything for the document the Minister has placed before us.  There has been a protectionist attitude growing up, irrespective of what the Minister says, in the international economic situation. The Minister said it was heartening for Ireland as a small open economy that the Community and its major trading partners have avoided a protectionist response to the strains, and that at the GATT ministerial meeting in November 1982 delegates undertook to resist protectionist pressures.  This is a fallacy.  It is very easy to state at one of these meetings that we will avoid protectionist measures, but when one looks at what is happening in the open market place, there is no doubt that this statement is not true. <Col N="935" /> Anyone involved in business in this country will say that there has been a huge increase in protectionist attitudes and that this has major problematic implications for us because we are a small, vulnerable and very open economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the problem we had with the United States regarding steel exports.  He did not mention the heavy pressure exerted by the United States when negotiations and contracts were being signed for the provision of gas from the Soviets.  The Community, as stated by the Minister, has sought to encourage Japan to limit their exports.  It does not appear that this encouragement is succeeding.  It appears that the flow of Japanese consumer durables remains at an extremely high level.</P>
    <P>It is unsatisfactory that the economic group which includes the most advanced countries, technologically speaking, in the world cannot get our trading levels with Japan into something approaching an equitable but competitive level.  It should be said here that we appreciate the level of Japanese investment in Ireland.  There is no doubt that their investments in some areas have been extremely successful, and in others they have not, but I do not think the success or failure of the Japanese firms which have come here has been because of the trading situation or work relations in Ireland.  The firms which are not too successful are in areas where businesses throughout the world are not doing too well, particularly in the textile area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Community development policy to combat hunger in the world.  How can this policy effectively work when in reality the people who control the supply of food and the supply of gestation seeds are multi-national companies which have no realisation of the problems of the Third World, but who will use the Third World? Their food research facilities are not geared towards providing for people in the Third World.  They do not help these countries and it is left to smaller countries like Ireland through operations like Gorta, which are subsidised by the Department of Agriculture and by private <Col N="936" /> donations, to provide expertise in the agricultural areas in these countries, and to provide people with the know-how to help these people to help themselves. It is at areas like this the EEC should be looking rather than at work through the EEC to help Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the recent meeting of UNCTAD VI at Belgrade.  There is a paragraph in the Minister's supplied speech which has been crossed out.  I am not too sure why; perhaps it was because of the lack of progress to date at that meeting.  The Minister said the outcome of the recent UNCTAD VI meeting in Belgrade did not live up to the concrete expectations many people had.</P>

      <P>If anybody was reading the results of that conference he would have to analyse the results from two sides.  Section three would suggest that there was a total failure by the section one countries to grasp the needs of the section three countries.  There was a wide divergence of opinion.  The western nations, particularly the United States, said that the conference was a success and that many concrete advantages would result, but the people from the Third World countries were totally opposed to the view that the conference was anything but a show of protectionism by the stronger nations.  They issued a statement after the Williamsburg Summit that the western nations had failed to grasp the nettle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech and in the two reports mention is made of what is happening in the world&mdash;in Poland, Afghanistan, El Salvador, the South Atlantic, Central America, and many other places. There is no doubt but the failure of the EEC to play a major part in attempting to solve the problems of these areas is something the Community cannot be proud of.  The Middle East was mentioned by the Minister and in the two reports.  There is a wide divergence of <Col N="937" /> opinion as to what exactly is happening in the Middle East.  Successive Irish Governments and the EEC have taken positive lines on occasion on what is happening in the EEC but they have not been strong enough in their attitudes towards the United States, Israel, Iraq, Syria, Iran or the USSR.  When one looks at the cauldron that is the Middle East one has to realise the difficulties facing those countries.  The EEC should adopt stronger attitude, but unfortunately what we are getting from the EEC in relation to anything involved with the world economic order or the world power order is a consensus, and, generally speaking, the consensus that emerges is the weaker attitude.  The strong attitude has not emerged.  There was not strong enough criticism of Israel for its invasion of Lebanon.  There was not strong enough criticism of the United States for its support of the Israelis.  There was not strong enough criticism of Israel for its support for the Christian Phalangist Movement in the Lebanon when they went in and took apart the camps of Chatila and Sabra. When one considers the appalling outcome of those massacres, it has to be said that we, as Europeans, must take part of the blame for not being strong enough in our condemnation of attitudes of expansionism by states such as the Israeli State and the invasion of Afghanistan by the USSR.</P>
    <P>There is a debate going on in Europe at present about the placement of Cruise missiles and short-term missiles on NATO bases.  I do not think we can visualise the effect the placement of these missiles can have for the future of this country.  People can say what they like; they can say we should stay out of this particular argument, because it has nothing to do with us, but the placement of Cruise missiles on European soil takes away from us and from the European countries in which they are placed, the type of sovereignty that we need.  That does not mean we should not be as highly critical of the USSR for the number of short-range missiles that they have placed in strategic positions right across the eastern countries of Europe, and which, at this time, could take Ireland apart.  When <Col N="938" /> we look at the various groups which are protesting against the placing of missiles, unfortunately the impetus seems to be more against the United States than against the USSR.  It is easier to get at the United States because they have a more open attitude and we know what is going on.  We know what their fears are; we know what their national interests are, but it is much harder to find out where the USSR missiles are and it is not easy to find out what is taking place in countries under the economic aegis of the USSR.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that on 16 July there is going to be a march in Dublin from the US embassy to the USSR embassy.  In this way, it might focus people's attention on the fact that we are not dealing with one major super power when we talk about the placement of missiles or armaments which are horrific in nature, but that, hopefully, the emphasis will be placed on the fact that the two major super powers are involved in this terrible build-up of missiles.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of weeks we have had visits from two major politicians from the United States.  One of them was Mr. Bush whose main objective in coming to Europe was to try to persuade European Governments and peoples that the United States Government were not doing anything other than protecting their own interests and the interests &mdash; they say secondly &mdash; of the European Community.  I do not believe that this is so.  The United States are only serving their own interests.  They should not hide behind the countries in which they are going to place these missiles.</P>
    <P>Some of the major developments that have taken place in the Middle East over the past 12 to 18 months have included the massacres in Sabra and Chatila, the expansion of Israel <i>de facto</i> into the whole of south Lebanon, right into the city of Beirut.  This has meant that the total area from Beirut down to the border with what was Israel is now virtually an Israeli State, economically dependent on Israel and <i>de facto</i> part of the Israeli State.  The Israelis have consistently refused to withdraw from this area and hide behind the fact that they will not <Col N="939" /> withdraw until Syria withdraws.  So we have an <i>impasse.</i>  There is no doubt that Syria has no more right to Lebanon than Israel has.  Until such time as all troops from all countries are withdrawn from Lebanon, there can be no hope for peace.</P>
    <P>Premier Begin has said that even if Syria withdraws from Lebanon, Israel will want a 23 mile protection zone within the State.  This is an area which she has had since 1976 when, with the help of the Christian Militia in that area, she walked over the rights of both Christians and Lebanese people.  Not only that, but they have shown total disregard for the mandated troops of the United Nations, including the Irish troops in that area. That total disregard for the mandated troops of the United Nations is something which must be abhorred.  We are proud of the fact that the United Nations troops, including the Irish, have attempted to keep peace in this area.  It does not appear that one can live in this world when one has neighbours like Israel and, to a lesser extent, Syria.</P>
    <P>People here do not seem to realise that the EEC have not given any major impetus to attempting to see that the Iran-Iraq war will be brought to a conclusion that will not create a monolith State on one side, to the total elimination of the other State.  At present, it would appear as if the Iraquis would agree to a ceasefire.  If the weight of the European Economic Community could be brought to bear on the international scene, this might happen.</P>
    <P>The recent developments in the Middle East are extremely worrying.  The increasing tension between Israel and Syria could lead to an armed conflict which would probably not be limited to those countries.  In making that statement, it must be said that we are seeing here a major confrontation between States which are supported on one side by the United States and on the other side by the USSR.  Therefore, any major confrontation taking places between these two countries cannot be confined to the countries themselves but will have major implications on the international scene. <Col N="940" /> These implications could be horrific.</P>
    <P>At the very least, the tension is likely to thwart efforts to restore the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon, efforts which the European Economic Community have rightly encouraged.  The Ten statement of 22 March was justified in saying that the Reagan initiative indicated a way to peace that if that and the Fez proposals could be brought together, it would appear that there is a readiness in that area to join these two proposals together and that if these two proposals could be brought closer together, the Palestinian National Council would and could help in solving the present Middle East crisis.</P>
    <P>The time has come, as the Council statement of 10 March said, to move beyond statements of principle and find a means to reconcile and implement the various peace proposals.  Unfortunately, since 22 March we have seen within that area a number of moves which will not help to solve the problem and which seem to further distance the peace process. We saw major efforts being made by the leader of the PLO and PNC, Major Yassar Arafat, and the State of Jordan to try to reconcile themselves, and to get the Israelis and Americans to agree that a State could be set up which would be independent.  It has been stated by the Israelis that their wish is to have an independent State on the West Bank, but when one looks at the proposals in the Camp David Agreement, one finds that the independence they suggest is absolutely not the type of independence which is needed and is not compatible with actual independence.  How can one be in an independent State if a next-door country has the right to supply their water, the right to supply the civilian government, and the right to provide the defence mechanisms?</P>
    <P>While the EEC's Venice Declaration of 1980 achieved few tangible results, it re-established in the Arab world the credibility of Europe's role as a mediator.  It is, therefore, suggested that the European Community should take the initiative in proposing a conference to which the United States, the Soviet Union, a number of European Council countries, <Col N="941" /> Israel and the Arab States mostly directly concerned, including the PLO, should be invited.  On this matter, it is significant to say that in August of this year a conference was to be held in Paris.  This conference was set up by the non-aligned countries, generally speaking, under the chairmanship of one of the four vice-secretaries of the United Nations.  But, unfortunately, not one of the members of the European Community would get officially involved in the running of this conference, even though over 300 countries were going to take part.  Because of the fact that the European Communities would not get officially involved, this conference has had to be postponed.  Especially at this very highly volatile time in Middle Eastern affairs, a conference of this nature could have done nothing but good.</P>
    <P>Even though the difficulties might seem insurmountable, nevertheless there are movements evolving in that area which will make a peaceful solution to the problems easier.  It is significant to see the numbers of people who are involved in the Peace Now movement in Israel.  They are coming out into the open.  They are stating the case which is there to be stated, honestly and openly, that there must be a peaceful solution within the Middle Eastern situation, that it cannot be brought about by force and that that area should not be used as a cockpit by the major powers of the world. There is a tremendous affinity between the peoples who live in the Middle East at present, whether they are Arabs or Jews, whether they are Sunis or Phalangists, whatever their religion, they have a fantastic affinity to the place in which they were born.  It is up to us, as a member of the European Community, to ensure that this is recognised.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of an initiative coming from Western Europe is that it would be harder for Israel or for the PLO to decline to attend than if the invitation came from, say, either of the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva conference.  If both did attend, it would bring much nearer the mutual recognition of Israeli and Palestinian rights, which is an essential prerequisite for a peaceful settlement.  It is <Col N="942" /> my view that the Palestinian National Council endorsement in Algiers of the Brezhnev settlement of 15 September 1982 was deliberately designed to imply a willingness to accept mutual recognition. It is hoped that at the next meeting of the European Council cognisance will be taken of the problems that exist in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that the United States and Israel should look at the efforts that were made by people such as Major Arafat from the Palestinian National Council who represent the objectives and the needs of the people, who are extremely moderate people.  If they do not listen to what is being said, they will find that the moderates in the area will be overruled totally by the radicals.  If that happens not alone will the rights and needs of the Palestinian people be overshadowed and lessened, but the status of that whole Middle Eastern area could be changed radically.</P>
    <P>The presentation of these two reports was long overdue, but it did give us the chance to debate some of the matters which were in them.  At last, the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the EEC has been set up and, hopefully that committee will start its work immediately.  The sooner that committee starts work, the sooner we are going to see an effective Irish stand on matters pertaining to this country within the EEC.  The committee has not operated properly for the last four to five years. There has been no preliminary work done by Members of this Parliament on essential legislation which will be presented and which has been presented to the European Parliament.  It is the only committee which can have a look at proposed legislation and proposed regulations.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that before we meet again in October the committee will have formally met, that the parameters under which it should operate will be set out and that it will be a continuous and effective means of providing, as between this Parliament, the European Parliament and the European Commission, the bridge which is so obviously necessary when one looks at the many problems <Col N="943" /> which we have in the country and which have not been resolved up to now by our membership of the EEC.</P>

      <P>It is a very hot, sunny afternoon to be discussing the developments in the European Communities. However, like other Senators, I feel that it is vital that we take stock of recent developments and, more particularly, lack of developments there.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs has made a detailed and considered speech on this motion.  He has ranged over a wide area.  In some parts of his speech he has dealt in a very minimal way with important areas, but he has said that he would be willing to answer more specific questions in his reply and we should avail of that opportunity to put questions to him.</P>
      <P>The first point I would like to make about his speech and, really, about the Community as it is developing, is that he has not been completely frank or forthcoming about the enormous difficulties and the very real disappointments at the European Community level at the moment.  This is not a new thing.  It is something that has been a feature of developments in the Communities, certainly in the last half decade.  It is fair to say that the EEC suffer from the dilemma of its present stage of development.  This dilemma is serious for the European Community and it is also extremely serious for a country like Ireland, with our own development needs caught up in this process.</P>
      <P>We forget from time to time that there has been such a major transfer of powers from the national Governments to the Community level.  Yet, one of the greatest dilemmas facing the Community is that it lacks at present the financial underpinning and structure and is refusing to date to provide itself with a financial structure to cope with some of the most serious problems, such as the major problem of unemployment and industrial development at the Community level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to reflect on the real nature of the problem as it has stagnated over the last couple of years in this discussion <Col N="944" /> on the provision of own resources for the Community.  We should view it in a perspective of looking more closely at the extent of the transfer of power away from national Governments, and specifically away from this Government.  The Irish Government have voluntarily, by participating in the Treaties of the European Communities and the Accession Treaty, given up the power to take steps to protect our own sectors of the economy, to promote industrial development here in particular ways, to favour domestic products in particular ways.  I am struck by this as somebody who lectures on European Community law.</P>
    <P>One can look at the legal transfer of power and at the way in which this transfer has been upheld in the case law of the Court of Justice in so far as cases have been either brought by the Commission against members states for failing to fulfil their obligations or have arisen in national courts and been referred to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg under Article 177 for these preliminary rulings, setting down guidelines on the interpretation of Community law.  Whatever the way in which it comes before the Court of Justice it has been very significant to see the definitive upholding of the rule of Community law at a time when the political commitment is not nearly so strong. The court has upheld the rules, the Commission enforces the rules and member states are bound by those rules.  But the further development of the Community towards a more balanced regional and social structure has not happened.</P>
    <P>It is worth reminding ourselves that we cannot protect home industries by having restrictions on imports.  We cannot aid sectors of our industry or regions of Ireland unless we have the express permission of the Commission of the European Communities.  We are prevented from various quantitive restrictions or measures having the equivalent effect, or charges having the equivalent effect of customs duties, or all the other whole range of instruments that national Governments use to promote and protect their industries and, in particular, to cope with periods of very high unemployment. We now have very high unemployment <Col N="945" /> and a young growing population but we have transferred from our Government a great proportion of the legal and political capacity to deal with those problems.</P>
    <P>The situation was brought home in the case that was brought against Ireland for the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  We were successfully prosecuted in the sense of being brought before the European Community Court in Luxembourg which gave judgment last November to the effect that the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign was an infringement of Article 30 of the Treaty. That is an illustration of the bind we are in.  We cannot do it ourselves and yet we are part of a community development where the Community is failing to commit to Community level sufficient resources to ensure that the kinds of developments that are going to take place in it will generate the benefits in the areas of industrial development and in the creation of employment which would justify this transfer of power.</P>
    <P>We must seriously question whether we can continue to accept the essence of our commitment to the European Community, that we give up the power ourselves to take steps in these areas if the Community is not prepared to face more urgently and more seriously this crisis of its own lack of capacity and the fact that the strain of coming near to the ceiling of its financial resources in the last few years has undermined and crippled any strategies and proper development of policies at the Community level.  You cannot have an industrial policy or a policy in relation to employment when you know that you are very near the ceiling of the financial resources in the budget of the Communities. The failure of some of the larger member states, specifically of Germany and the United Kingdom, to be prepared to make the commitment to increase the resources of the Community is very significant because in many ways they may have a different perspective on development in the Communities.</P>
    <P>This country, following the referendum in May 1972, made a very full commitment to membership of the European Communities and this was a commitment widely supported at the time.  We are now at a stage when the fact that we have <Col N="946" /> transferred so much of the power to take action in areas of the protection of industry, employment creation, employment maintenance without getting the <i>quid pro quo</i> of developed regional social policies, particularly in industrial policies and policies to cope with unemployment at Community level means that we are beginning to suffer an accentuation of our problems.  Our problems are deep and intractable with a young growing population, but they are now accentuated by the inability of the Community to evolve policies and the fact that we have transferred our own capacity in many areas to dictate those policies.</P>
    <P>There has been in a curious way that has not been sufficiently realised, a two-speed Community of a different sort than is usually described.  There has been a legal Community created by the obligations that member states have undertaken and by the consequences of those obligations in the transfer of powers from national Governments to the Community institutions.  There has also been the political speed which has not matched the commitments given at an earlier stage in the legal transfer of powers.  They have not matched the legitimate expectations that if you hand over the power to cope with a situation yourself, you expect that the Community through its development and through the very specific commitment made to achieve balanced, regional social development would create the necessary financial and political instruments to do that.  It has failed singularly to do that.  We should put more focus on this.</P>
    <P>When the Irish Government call for greater development in the area of regional or social policy it is often thought that this is the Irish Government or Irish politicians with the begging bowl approach looking for more aid from the Community.  The way in which we should present it is quite different.  We should point to the fact that we have made this enormous commitment, an enormous act of trust, because that is what it was, in binding ourselves to a legal obligations to transfer these important powers from the national Government, from the control of the Government and people of Ireland to the EEC institutions and it has not <Col N="947" /> been matched by the kind of development which is essential for the economic and social well-being of our citizens.</P>
    <P>We should be upping the ante and demanding a greater commitment and we should be expressing the situation more in this way.  We should hear our Ministers spelling out the extent of the commitment that has been made by this transfer of powers and the importance of its achieving the financial basis on which it is possible for the Community to begin to tackle the problems.  They can be tackled only at Community level if it has the financial instruments and infrastructure to do this.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem is a psychological one.  Politicians in this country and politicians in other member states do not want to admit how much power they have lost.  Politicians still want to be the Government doing important things for the Irish people, not admitting that they lack the power and the capacity to tackle many of the problems because that power has been transferred elsewhere and because the arena to which it has been transferred is largely stagnating on itself and is failing to create the financial capacity at Community level to move on and develop strategies and policies.  Politicians, apart from being unwilling to admit the extent of the transfer of power, also are not slow to blame the Community for failures partly at a national level in what we can do ourselves &mdash; we have not transferred all power to the Community &mdash; and partly because the Community can be, at times, an easy target for passing the buck, for blame for inaction or inactivity elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This has been reflected in the contributions of other Senators who have spoken.  Unless there is a clear and constructive decision in the area of provision of the financial resources of the Communities in the next few months, the Community will be choked in a way which will potentially damage it as a viable political unit.  It has already been damaged in the momentum which might possibly have been sustained.  The damage could be an erosion of belief in the Community as an economic and political <Col N="948" /> structure.  We might see more countries or units than Greenland seeking to contract out of membership of the Communities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Stuttgart meeting resulted in the establishment of an emergency procedure requiring much greater concentration in meetings of Foreign Ministers between now and the European Council in Athens, with a view to resolving this issue.  It shows evidence of a realisation of the seriousness of the situation, but time is running out, both in a political and in an economic sense.  The extent to which time is running out in an economic sense does not come through to me in the part of the Minister's speech where he refers to the question of unemployment. He says that successive European Councils have devoted considerable attention both to analysing the underlying causes and to the development of policies to counteract the recession.</P>
    <P>The thrust of that brief paragraph where he discusses the way in which the Council has been looking at unemployment, does not seem to reveal the irreversible trends in unemployment in this country and in other European countries. There is need not just for a hope that the world recession will allow an improvement in certain areas but for a recognition of underlying factors which should change our approach to work, our assessment of the life and work cycle of individuals and families in the Community and the fact that even if there is an upturn in the economy the likelihood is that further developments in technology and automation will continue the present decline in industrial and manufacturing jobs.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Community can develop high technology areas but they are by no means necessarily areas which will guarantee high levels of employment. It is necessary for Ireland, with the highest unemployment rate in the Community and the fastest developing young population, to be more innovative and more insistent on the Community looking, not in a political way at how the situation can be covered up in fine language, but at the reality of these irreversible <Col N="949" /> trends and at the changing economic situation in which we find ourselves in the last quarter of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the allocation of the Social Fund and to the fact that 40 per cent of the fund aid will now be devoted to the six super priority regions. Included in that are Ireland and Northern Ireland.  That is very welcome.  Ireland has benefited very substantially in the area of retraining.  Given the problems of women in employment in Ireland, we are still failing to avail adequately of the special provision for retraining and training of women.  Other countries, notably Germany, have done considerably better proportionately out of that part of the fund.  If we have succeeded in establishing that Ireland is a super priority area as far as the EEC are concerned, are we happy that we have properly and adequately identified our own super priority area?  In other words, have we an adequate social and regional policy to match what we look for from the European Community?  In that regard, I was depressed to note the reference by the Minister to the fact that there still is not agreement on the proposals to amend the Regional Fund regulations.  This is something which is much better discussed in the appropriate committee of the Joint EEC Committee.  I welcome the re-establishment of that committee.  The proposal by the Commission was submitted in October 1981.  There has been an undue delay in the re-establishment of that and I hope the Minister will give us some more information on it when he replies to this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fixing of agricultural prices.  It would be helpful if he could expand a little on the reasons why the fixing of farm prices has come so late in the year.  It was done towards the end of May in both 1982 and 1983. This has had a very adverse effect on farming in Ireland.  The marketing year for milk and beef is from 1 April and the delay and uncertainty have had very adverse consequences.  It seems, from reading the newspaper accounts each year of the negotiations, stopping the clock and all-night sessions, that there are very clever tactics employed particularly <Col N="950" /> by the United Kingdom negotiators who are not as anxious as a country like Ireland to conclude these negotiatiois. If the basis of the delay is political tactics, then surely it ought to be possible for Governments who want to see a conclusion of the agreement on farm prices earlier each year, to evolve tactics to out-manoeuvre the countries who are seeking to delay conclusion of those negotiations.  They should devise strategies whereby it would be possible to conclude this vital area of decision before the end of March and not as happens now towards the end of May in any given year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to focus the attention of Senators on the present situation in Brú Chaoimhín which has been functioning since 1978 as a shelter for homeless women and children and for battered women and children.  The shelter, as many Senators will know, is located at the rear of the old St. Kevin's Fever Hospital and its present facilities consist of two separate prefab wooden structures which are quite small.  I had an opportunity of visiting the shelter two days ago. I was very saddened and very depressed by what I saw.  I am, therefore, glad to have this opportunity of raising the matter and I am pleased that the Minister of State has come into the House for the debate.  I look forward to his response to a number of points I will make.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of attempts to draw attention to the facilities. Women's Aid, now known as Family Aid, reported last December on the conditions in Brú Chaoimhín.  A number of doctors who have treated children there have drawn attention to the facilities. There have been a number of informal meetings between social workers in bodies like Family Aid and the community care section of the Eastern Health Board to see what could be done to improve the physical facilities and the services offered to families who find themselves in Brú Chaoimhín.  My understanding of the situation is based to a considerable extent on their professional assessment of it and their concern to see what can be done.</P>
      <P>The two prefabs are both used as dormitories. One of them is locked during the daytime and the other one also serves as the living accommodation for any of the women and their children who are there during the day.  One of the immediate problems is that there is no supervision in the prefab during the day and inevitably during the unsupervised hours, which are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., there can be a certain amount of vandalism and theft of items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 25 to 30 residents, on average, are in the prefab on any given night.  The <Col N="952" /> facilities where they live are very primitive indeed.  When I visited the prefab, which was open during the day time this week, there was an open dormitory area with 11 beds and two cots in it.  There was no privacy whatsoever, no curtains or partitioning between the beds.  In a small room beside the dormitory there were three lavatories, two of them installed relatively recently, one of them out of order, and a small bath which is used by the women for washing their clothes, because they have no other laundry facilities, as well as bathing.</P>
    <P>There are six tall rather unsafe lockers in the dormitory.  There are no keys to them and they are structures which cause problems with children when playing because if they fell on a child they could cause some injury.  There are no washing facilities.  There is no clothes line.  There is no office where families could be spoken to individually by a social worker. One-third of the prefab structure, unit five as it is called, is used as a shelter for the women and children and two-thirds of it is a sacristy and chapel which is used once a week.  So more than two-thirds of the space of this long prefab is empty and yet devoted to Christianity.  In the other third is the reality of a very urgent human situation involving very vulnerable families. If Christ had visited Brú Chaoimhín He would have had something to say about this strange sense of priorities.  It appeared that it would be very valuable to Brú Chaoimhín to have more space and particularly more privacy.</P>
    <P>The numbers using Brú Chaoimhín have increased dramatically.  It was established in 1978 as an emergency provision for homeless or battered wives suffering from domestic violence.  In 1980 the shelter catered for 943 bed nights, meaning 943 beds uses but, of course, some of those would be by the same person over a series of days or repeatedly throughout the year.  In 1981 it catered for 4,508, in 1982, for 8,239 and for the first quarter of this year the number of women and children is 2,872 in these two small dormitory prefabs with the very frugal facilities that I have described.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the number of women and children needing to use the shelter <Col N="953" /> increased after the fire in the Women's Aid shelter in Harcourt Street.  We discussed that on the Adjournment in this House at the time.  There was reference to the building of a custom built shelter which I understand is in the process of being built.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify the expectations in relation to the Women's Aid shelter in his reply. There is no doubt that the demand for the basic resource and facilities of the shelter is greater than ever.  The economic pressures and the need for a refuge from domestic violence is a reality of life.</P>
    <P>We must focus on two aspects of Brú Chaoimhín and that is what I should like to do in the brief time afforded by a debate on the Adjournment.  First, I will focus on the physical facilities and how these might be improved and equally, if not more important, on the need for better services and co-ordination of services for the women and children who come to Brú Chaoimhín.  In both these areas there seems to be considerable scope for improvement.</P>
    <P>The physical facilities were examined in a report which was compiled by a community worker with the Eastern Health Board and a voluntary worker in Brú Chaoimhín who has been working there since January 1983.  Copies of that report were sent at the end of May to the senior officials in the Eastern Health Board and the senior officials in the Department involved in this area.  Copies were sent to Dr. P.K. Murphy, the Director of Community Care, area three of the Eastern Health Board, the Chief Executive of the Eastern Health Board, to Mr. Donoghue, the Programme Manager of Community Care, to Mr. Hickey, the Programme Manager of the hospital section, to Dr. Ivor Browne, the Chief Psychiatrist of the Eastern Health Board, to Mr. Pat Sheehan the Senior Executive Officer of the hospital section of Saint Mary's Hospital and to Mr. Andy Russell, the Assistant Section Officer of Brú Chaoimhín.  The contents of the report are known to the senior responsible civil servants.  There has not been much evidence to date of any substantial response to that report.  One of the things that we can do during a debate such as this is <Col N="954" /> affirm the importance of improving the facilities and services in Brú Chaoimhín because the families there are in critical need.</P>
    <P>As to physical facilities, the main recommendation &mdash; this was certainly something to which I subscribed when I saw the situation &mdash; is for a full-time supervisor in the form of a housekeeper during the day time.  It is impossible to do anything in relation to physical facilities until there is that supervision.  If some physical facility is provided it may well be either damaged or removed if there is no supervision.  Also it is impossible to create a proper supportive environment unless there is somebody there full-time. There needs to be somebody there to supervise cleaning, to ensure that the kitchen is kept in order if used by families in turn, and so on.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is no doubt that the building badly needs painting.  It needs internal and external painting, internal painting being the priority.  The provision of some form of partition between the beds, for example, a fire-proof heavy curtain, would be a high priority.  If families are coming in distressed circumstances, often late at night, having suffered violence they should have some privacy. If they come late at night they very often want to sleep during the day time.  It is often the case that several beds are occupied by adult women trying to sleep while there are 15, 16 or 20 children running up and down in the prefab shelter and in and out of the lavatory area and the kitchen area.  Clearly that lacks the most basic privacy and decency.  It would also help if individual tables and chairs were provided rather than have the single long table that is there at the moment.  They need more cooking facilities and they need laundry facilities as a matter of great priority.</P>
    <P>The majority of the occupants of Brú Chaoimhín are children and yet there are no facilities for children.  I understand that the position is that children are required to be kept in during the daytime. Anybody who has children would know that one cannot require children to remain in a building during the day time. It is a form of cruelty to the children and <Col N="955" /> also a further depressing aspect for the adults concerned.  They need play facilities, perhaps an adventure play area.  I saw the beginnings of a wall being built in an area which I understand will be used as an enclosed play area.  Apparently that wall is being put up without any consultation with anyone.  Suddenly something is being done but it is not being done in a way which perhaps somebody who would want to use it as play area would decide to do it.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify who took the decision and what is intended in that play area.  That presumably would mean that the children would be allowed to be out in that area.</P>
    <P>On the question of co-ordination, the view of those involved in the resources of the shelter is that it could be better used if it was concentrated as a filter for women who are either homeless or victims of domestic violence.  If they were to come to Brú Chaoimhín and then be filtered on from there to Family Aid or to Regina Coeli or the other hostels or agencies, there should be greater co-ordination in relation to where they would go and in relation to their health care needs, housing needs and legal needs.  One of the frustrations of the present system where there is a lack of co-ordination is that some families end up in the shelter with four or five social workers dealing with different aspects of problems relating to them.  Other families have no social worker at all and have no service of a psychological, health care or counselling nature.  There does not appear to be a proper structured co-ordination of services.</P>
    <P>I know that this is a major concern of the Minister for Health.  At a time when resources are scare we need to ensure that we make a proper, thoughtful and well-structured use of resources.  Brú Chaoimhín is a good example of where the shelter is being over-used in the wrong way.  Sometimes women and children have to be turned away at 3 o'clock in the morning and have nowhere else to go.  At other times, families have stayed too long in Brú Chaoimhín in unsuitable conditions because they had nowhere else to go.  All in all, it seems inadequate that a <Col N="956" /> shelter which is dealing with the most vulnerable women and children should have no supervision and no expert counselling during the day time, no privacy and no follow-up for the families.  There is no proper continuity in the service.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we spent some time setting up a Joint Committee on women's rights. In my view, the picture in Brú Chaoimhín is where women's rights begin.  These are the most vulnerable women and children. Yet they are the most deprived in a society which characterises itself as a Christian, caring society.  Therefore, I hope that the representations that have been made from within the Eastern Health Board will be helped by the political support from this House and that we will see better physical facilities and better co-ordination of resources and help for the women who come to Brú Chaoimhín and, in general, for homeless women and children and victims of domestic violence in our society.</P>

      <P>A play area was provided for the children in the portion of the grounds adjacent to the unit.  A covered-in area will be made available. Roof repairs were carried out.  Parallel to this the following medical and welfare services were arranged by the health board.  General practitioner services were arranged with a doctor across the road and he visits residents in the unit as frequently as required.  The director of Community Care arranged regular weekly visits by the public health nurse. She is also available as requested after that.  Social workers from Family Aid visit daily and the board's local social workers are available as required.  The local community welfare officer is available daily.  Indeed, the Sisters of the Missionaries of Charity started a day class at Donore Avenue which the children of the residents are attending.  The sisters also visit regularly.</P>
      <P>That is basically a follow-up to the Women's Aid and local GPs' recommendation.  If the Senator has seen a different picture as she says she has &mdash; I have no doubt that is what she has seen &mdash; I will have this matter investigated.  I will demand a report from the health board and have these matters pointed out.  We are dealing with the most vulnerable section in our society.  I remember a few years ago when I was Lord Mayor visiting the Women's Aid centre in Harcourt Terrace.  It was the most pathetic sight I ever saw in my life.</P>

      <Col N="958" /> I fully agree with the Senator about a housekeeper or somebody being in charge.  Basically these are people who have had traumatic experiences and are helpless.  They need support services and back-up services.  The Senator mentioned a report the Department should have got. The Department did not receive the report.  We will be seeking a copy of it to see what can be done.  Mention was made about cubicle curtains and curtain rails. My information is they have been provided.</P>

      <P>That is why I indicated this is a very worthwhile debate.  It is highlighting something that needs to be highlighted.  Mention was made about the new refuge that is being contemplated in Rathmines.  The building is due to commence in September.  As the Senator is probably aware Family Aid have been very much involved in this right along, even to choosing the builder.  Hopefully, it will be ready for occupation in September 1983.  That will make a significant difference.  One of the good things about it is that it is being constructed so that it can be extended.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned a number of points about privacy.  I agree people should have privacy.  The furnishing and the long institutional tables are not good enough.  We will also look at the question of playgrounds.  We are trying to keep a family unit together.  We should endeavour to do all we can to keep that unit as cohesive and organised as we can.  We can do that by giving it its own personality and not by institutionalising it at an early stage.  I will be looking into that.  I will give the Senator the report I get from the health board and let her know what is going on.</P>
      <P>The building is old and it is very hard to do anything with it.  The question of painting and refurbishing should be looked at and carried out.  We are talking about families which have had a rough and tough time.  It is up to us all to make it as pleasant as we can for whatever time they want to remain on there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Family Aid have been very good over the years in orchestrating and organising <Col N="959" /> this.  The refuge in Rathmines will be a monument to their persistence and ability. There are facilities in Cork, Water-ford and Kilkenny.  They have acquired a school in Limerick, which they are refurbishing, and in Galway.  I should blow the trumpet of the previous Coalition who made all the funds available. That should be said.  I read a criticism of it recently by a member of my own party but one has to give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>We are talking about Brú Chaoimhín this evening.  I would be very concerned if I am getting information which is at variance with the fact.  I will want to know why.  It is not good enough for information like this to be given.  I assure the Senator that I will have this investigated as from tomorrow.  I will send the Senator a copy of the report.  I look forward to <Col N="960" /> any observations she may have to make on the report and any help she can give us on this.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the way in which he has responded to this matter.  It is clear that he attaches to it the priority which it warrants.  I will ensure that he has a copy of the report which details specifically the problems and highlights the fact that a number of women who use the shelter are travelling women which is also a part of the need for the co-ordination of services for them.  It is well spelled out in this report.  I look forward to receiving a further report from the Minister.  I will be delighted to have an opportunity to comment and come back again on it.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 12 July 1983.</P>
