      <P>I have received a message from the President that, after consultation with the Council of State, he has referred the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983 to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution for a decision on the question as to whether the said Bill or any provision or provisions thereof is or are repugnant to the Constitution or to any provision thereof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going on to the Order of Business, I consider that it would be inappropriate if this sitting of Seanad Éireann did not avail of the opportunity to convey in the strongest possible terms our condemnation of the atrocious events in this country, North and South, and outside of it over the past week.  The cowardly and contemptible act of kidnapping of innocent people from their families and homes and held to ransom by paramilitary organisations must be outlawed by all of us who value and defend the freedoms and rights of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In bringing the most recent episode of Mr. Don Tidey's release to a conclusion <Col N="1022" /> we lost two members of our most respected security forces in the murders of Garda trainee Sheehan and Private Patrick Kelly, both from families who have given sterling service to this nation in the Garda Síochána and the Army.  To date, we have lost ten members of the Garda Síochána and for the first time since the foundation of the State we have lost a member of our Army in combat in this country in incidents involving groups who dare to use the name &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; or, indeed, at times &ldquo;socialists&rdquo; in their organisations' names.</P>
    <P>If these events were not enough to shock and numb this nation, the week brought further death and destruction to the heart of London, where many of our relatives and friends who are Irish, and indeed many people from throughout the Commonwealth and America and other nations had gathered, and where many Irish people live and work.  This outrage took place at a time when the maximum death and destruction could be inflicted on those innocent people engaged in the normal practice at this time of the year of goodwill, of Christmas shopping.</P>
    <P>What a shame it is on all of us.  What possible cause or belief or campaign could justify these acts of wanton destruction? I would call today on all paramilitary organisations, and there are some on both sides of this unfortunate fence, and on the supporters and sympathisers of these senseless killers, to stop these acts of madness.  The excuse, if one could call it that, is that the recent London bombings were not authorised by the IRA, and this signifies, if we are to believe that it is an excuse, that even they have lost control of these maniacs.  We must not forget that in the past responsibility was claimed &mdash; if that is the appropriate word to use &mdash; for similar murders.  Could it be that, possibly, the IRA now realise that all reasonable people throughout this country, North and South, and in England, want totally to dissociate themselves from their dreadful actions?</P>
    <P>If a truce was possible it would then rightfully place a renewed responsibility on politicians of all different beliefs in Ireland, North and South, and in England, to use all the democratic institutions <Col N="1023" /> that are available to us in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in the Houses of Parliament in Britain, in the Assembly and in the Forum to make rapid progress towards an acceptable lasting and peaceful solution to the underlying problem of our country.  I commend you, a Chathaoirligh, on your statements and in your actions as a public representative in your own area where some of these events are taking place, for having asked for the Ministers for Justice and Defence to investigate the whole area surrounding the unfortunate accident that happened to Gerard Wrynne.  This House sends him our best wishes for his recovery.  You can be assured, a Chathaoirligh, that you have the support of this House for those actions which you have taken.  With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I would ask the other groups in this House to join with us in extending our sympathy to all the families who have been bereaved in these tragic events.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Acting Leader of the House in expressing our contempt for the actions which have taken place, purportedly in our name, over the last few weeks.  What benefit will it be if we in this House express our sympathy to the people who have suffered so much because of these atrocities? It does not seem that the people who perpetrate these atrocities are listening to the majority viewpoint in this country. They can only be called savages. They do not represent republicanism in any shape or form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said, Garda Sheehan comes from a family who have given fantastic service to this nation, as have the Kelly family.  The Garda are doing an immense amount of work on our behalf in tremendously difficult circumstances. They are being taken from their cars, hidden away and their uniforms taken from them.  They are an unarmed and very highly disciplined force.  If the atrocities that are being perpetrated upon the Garda continue we will have more demands for arming the Garda.  I do not think anybody here wants to see an armed police force.  We have seen the <Col N="1024" /> excesses that can be caused with the presence of an armed police force.  We are very proud of the fact that the Garda in exceedingly difficult situations over many years have been able to hold the line between anarchy and peace.  We have the back-up of the Army who are very well trained.  I hope that over the next few months when gardaí are sent out on patrol at night or if they are setting up road blocks, they at all times will have the support of the Army rather than, as is happening at present, people calling for the arming of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The IRA now deny responsibility for the atrocities which took place in London. It is cynical when a group say that the bombing in London was carried out by a member of their armed forces but without the permission of the IRA.  Gerry Adams now seems to want to get away from what happened regarding the Tidey affair.  At the same time he says that the people who perpetrated the kidnapping and the subsequent actions were doing the right thing.  That gentleman and the organisation to which he belongs should be condemned.  There has not been any condemnation from Sinn Féin for the actions.</P>
    <P>Recently on the occasion when we were passing a vote of sympathy with somebody else, Senator Robb made a statement that if Sinn Féin and those who support them are not put strictly in their place the destabilisation which has happened in the North will start to occur here.  We have seen this.  It shocks me to see that we have supposedly prominent businessmen in Wexford and in Mayo in the last week giving support to organisers of very serious crimes, people who live here under the protection of the State and yet they are going out helping known killers.  I would like the Leader of the House to extend my sympathy and Fianna Fáil's sympathy to the relatives of Private Kelly and Garda Garry Sheehan and equally to the relatives and friends of whose who were so callously murdered in London at the weekend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, to be associated with the expressions of sympathy in <Col N="1025" /> respect of both these tragic events mentioned by Senator Ferris and I would like to add all those innocent victims who died in the North of Ireland during 1983. The killing of a garda and a soldier on active duty, places, in our opinion, in their proper context the Provisional IRA and their lackey boys in Sinn Féin. These people are the enemies of this Republic, of this House and of the people we represent.  The Fine Gael Party will ensure that they will play their part so that the institutions of this State will not tolerate the cycle of violence which has happened in the North being repeated here.</P>
      <P>Those who might be tempted to test our determination should be warned that we will not be as vacillating or as weak kneed as the British administration in the North in this regard.  We will not play &ldquo;footsy&rdquo; with these gangsters and murderers. We will give no credibility to them by talking to them.  I believe that applies equally to this Government or to any possible alternative administration in this country.</P>
      <P>Our thanks must go to the members of the security forces for their efforts in the recent past and our deepest sympathy must go to those who were bereaved.  We were all elated that the victim of the recent kidnapping was released without the payment of ransom.  Unfortunately, during the publicity surrounding that recent kidnapping it was reported that another major Irish store had paid some money in a similar case.  If that is true it reflects little credit on that store.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Harrod's bombing, no words can express our revulsion at this type of action.  The perpetrators of this act claim to be acting in the name of Ireland.  If they did what they did in Ireland's name I would, of course, be ashamed.  They have no right to speak on behalf of the Irish people and, therefore, I refuse to accept that they have shamed our country.  They have, of course, temporarily confused some people in Britain. Some people may feel that they have in fact associated all Irish men and women with this kind of action and, correspondingly, that we should accept part of that guilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> The Fine Gael Party, which I represent, do not accept nor indeed should any other party in this House accept, any guilt for what were the actions of lunatics completely outside the bounds of reason and actions carried on without our authority and without our permission.  Our message to them is clear: Get off our backs, leave our people alone.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan said, and I concur, that we should appeal to voters not to support fellow travellers of this type.  Just as during the Second World War Hitler made a pact with Stalin because it suited him at the time, these people would make a pact with the devil if it advanced their twisted principles in any way.  For example, they now make great play of the fact that they lead a fight against drugs.  If it suited those people to sell drugs in the morning to advance their cause that is what they would do and they would seek to justify it.  We must make sure for the remainder of this year and next year that we will resist all attempts to cloak these murderers with platitudes and smooth talk.  We must extend out sympathy not only to the recently bereaved but to all the innocent victims of the continuing cycle of violence in the North of Ireland in 1983.  It is appropriate at this, our last sitting of 1983, to include those people as worthy of our sympathy at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent Group I would like to join in the expressions of opinion expressed by other Senators.  We must all join in the expression of sadness and horror at the recent events that have taken place both in our own country and in London and, of course, in extending our sympathy to the relatives of all those who have been killed.  The killing of Garda Sheehan and Private Kelly marks a dangerous new departure in the violence that is being carried out by the Provisional IRA in this country, North and South.  Up to now we have had this killing of security forces going on in the North and we have felt very badly about it, but there has not been to the same extent this spill-over into our own jurisdiction of this particular form of violence.  Not only is it horrifying <Col N="1027" /> but it is highly dangerous and a very bad sign for the future that we should find members of our own security forces being killed in this kind of operation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the way in which they died, we must be extremely proud of the fact that in the record of these kidnappings that have taken place in this country all our Governments and our security forces have resisted so firmly the idea that ransom should be paid and encouragement should be given to this type of violence and horrible crime.  We must be proud of our record that people have been rescued and that Mr. Tidey has been the last in this series to have emerged safe from his ordeal.  We must congratulate him and his family in emerging successfully from it.  The families of Garda Sheenan and Private Kelly can feel very proud that their sons and brothers have played a part in carrying out this policy and this important chain of events that will tend to discourage the proliferation of this type of crime which is very difficult to deal with.  We should all be proud of the way in which they served their country while at the same time mourning their unnecessary and tragic deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the bombing in London, other Senators have said much of what I would have said about it.  I feel that one of the major things that must be said about this type of bombing, which, inevitably, will involve the deaths and maiming of totally innocent people who are just going about their ordinary business, particularly just before Christmas, is the total impossibility of justifying an action such as that on any kind of grounds of principle, policy or political aims.  It cannot be excused either by saying that a warning was given or by saying.  &ldquo;It was one of our men who did it without authority&rdquo;. The idea that issuing a warning a mere half hour before the bomb went off in an area of London which was crowded by Christmas shoppers and at a store which I understand can hold 20,000 people at once, could save innocent lives in those circumstances is mere madness. The idea of saying, &ldquo;It was one of our members who did it without our authority&rdquo; again is very far from being any form <Col N="1028" /> of justification or excuse.  The only sign of hope that perhaps may come out of this kind of excuse is that not only by the official statement but by a number of statements by leading members of Provisional Sinn Féin it appears that they are at last beginning to see that public opinion in this country is totally revolted by this sort of action and that they wish to distance themselves both from the Tidey kidnapping and from the bombing in Harrord's.  We can only hope that the fact that these leading personalities find it necessary, on a political basis, to withdraw a little from the actions of their armed comrades, whom they were so proud of previously, must show that they realise that ordinary people here are horrified and completely revolted by the kind of thing that they are doing.</P>
    <P>With Senator Lanigan, I hope very much that this kind of incident and what has been going on over the past few days in the Ballinamore area will not be used as a reason for making the Garda into an armed force.  This would be an extremely wrong step to take.  We have a police force which commands the respect, allegiance and friendship of the vast majority of our citizens and to turn them into an armed force would be a very grave mistake. They have suffered and no doubt they will continue to suffer, but they suffer and continue to suffer with the support of the ordinary people.  It would be very dangerous indeed to change them into an armed force.  I agree with Senator Lanigan that much the better course would be to provide back-up from the Army in conditions when they are likely to be in danger.  I know that this sounds like sending out young men such as Garda Sheehan into situations where they may be in danger of wounding and death, but in our democratic civilisation the idea of maintaining an unarmed force of police is extremely important and indeed crucial.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I join with other Senators in extending the sympathy of this House to the relatives of the two men who were so tragically killed and to the relatives of all who were killed and wounded in the London bombing and in subsequent violence. I join with Senator O'Leary in <Col N="1029" /> extending sympathy to all those who have been bereaved, wounded and struck down in the violence that has occurred during this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridRodgers" hpid="Mrs. Rogers Mrs. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself with the expressions of sympathy extended to the families who have been bereaved in this last week in this part of the island and in the North.  About 18 years ago in Northern Ireland the first of the victims of the present spate of troubles was killed.  He was a young Catholic named Peter Ward.  I know exactly the circumstances in which he was killed and everybody in Northern Ireland still remembers that man's name.  A few years later the first policeman to meet his death in that spate of troubles was killed in Northern Ireland.  We also remember his name very clearly.  He was Arbuckle.  I do not need to refer to any files to remember his name.  He was killed by Loyalist paramilitaries. That is incidental, but the point I am going to make has a crucial bearing on what will happen in Ireland from this day on.</P>
      <P>Yesterday a UDR man was buried in Maghera in south Derry.  Could anybody, North or South, tell me his name today? Last week a young man from east Belfast, a Catholic, who happened to be walking home at the wrong time of night in a Loyalist area was shot down.  He was buried this day week as this Seanad was meeting.  Can anybody, North or South, remember his name?  I very much doubt it.  What happened in the last week in this part of the country has brought home to the people of Ireland exactly the nature of the threat which we all face.  The names of Garda Sheehan and Private Kelly are household names in Ireland today.  We must ask ourselves if it is possible that in ten or 15 years time they would rate just a few lines in the papers or would we even be able to remember the next day who they were or, indeed, that the thing had happened at all?  If someone had told me 18 years ago that I would not remember the name of someone who was killed last week or shot yesterday I would have said that that was utter nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country is facing the greatest threat that it has faced since the foundation <Col N="1030" /> of this State.  What has greatly helped and enhanced the fortunes of those people who want to undermine democracy in this country is the problem of the ambivalence which has affected all of us and it would be dishonest of us not to recognise that.  At times in the last 15 years I have felt conflicting emotions and I have been slightly less sorry about some deaths than about others.  That is one of the facts of life in Ireland.  We must rid ourselves of that ambivalence which is the greatest friend of the paramilitaries who play on it.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to disagree with Senator Seán O'Leary when he called them lunatics. I do not consider them lunatics and I do not think anyone should.  Those people who carry out those acts of violence are not mindless either.  Many people talk of them as mindless, but they know precisely what they are doing.  They know precisely what they are about.  They are out, let their own words say it, to take power in Ireland by the gun and the ballot box.  They are not out to free Ireland, they are out to take power in Ireland and let us not forget that.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Seanad Éireann, representing as it does 93 per cent of the people of this island &mdash; that is Nationalist Ireland &mdash; also represents North and South, Catholic and Protestant, although perhaps not Unionist opinion.  I hope that the message goes out clearly to the rest of the world today &mdash; and in this I agree with Senator O'Leary &mdash; that the atrocities carried out in London were not carried out in the name of the Irish people. They do not have the support or the agreement of the Irish people.  They are abhorred by the Irish people.  I would say, therefore, that this country, and this part of the country in particular, has to be very much aware of the threat that is facing it.  The community, politicians and so on must rid themselves of this ambivalence. The time for this, and for people remaining silent when things needed to be said, is over.  There are only two sides now.  You are either on the side of the State and the institutions of this State, on the side of the forces which protect our institutions, or you are not.  There is no <Col N="1031" /> middle way in the present climate in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have a difficulty here, Senator Fallon, in that you are a neighbour of one of the victims as I appreciate.  Senator Ellis comes from the same area as myself and if the Leader of the House agrees on this I will give you a few minutes each.  I do not think there will be any objections but I do not want to invoke procedure here on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew Private Patrick Kelly very well.  He was very much a quiet, unassuming family man.  His hobby in life was fixing cars, tinkering with engines and such work.  It is a very sad occasion when this House or any House should have to pass a vote of sympathy with his widow and his family and equally with the family of Garda Sheehan.  Whilst the name of Paddy Kelly, who was stationed in Custume Barracks, Athlone, will appear in the history books of the future as the first Irish soldier since the Civil War to be killed in this country in this style combat, this will be no consolation whatsoever to his young widow and family.  I, too, would like to offer my deepest sympathy to his family and to the family of Garda Sheehan, and to condemn the violence of the past weeks and years.</P>
      <P>I share the concern of Senator Rogers for the future.  The deaths of these two young people in our security forces in the past week will have very serious repercussions for this country for the future.  I hope people will accept that a united Ireland can be achieved only through democratic means and certainly not by the methods that have been used recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express to the families of Private Kelly and Garda recruit Sheehan my deepest sympathy.  It was a tragedy for me on my return to this country to read in the papers in Dublin last Saturday morning what had happened in my home town.  It was sad and disgusting to me and to the people whom I represent here that such an action <Col N="1032" /> should take place anywhere in the country. It is sad that two men who were the custodians of the safety of the State and its citizens should die in such tragic circumstances. What has been said here today also reflects the views of those whom I represent, namely, the people of County Leitrim and of the town of Ballinamore.</P>
      <P>One or two matters have slightly annoyed me in this situation.  I refer to some of the media and to some of the Press coverage that has been given to that part of the country.  In my opinion, and I investigated the matter last night, some of the reports in the Press yesterday were totally untrue.  I challenge the Press people who made the statements yesterday to show me where members of the security forces were not given fair and adequate treatment or served in any business premises in Ballinamore.  I went home from Dublin especially to see what was the position and I can state I could not get confirmation of the statements made in the Press.  I have no doubt the Cathaoirleach will vindicate what I have said.  The people of Ballinamore have not been and never will be intimidated by anyone, paramilitaries or otherwise.</P>
      <P>A very close friend of mine was critically wounded at a checkpoint on Friday night.  I was glad to see the Cathaoirleach lend his support to my call on Saturday evening for a full investigation into the tragic accidental shooting of John Gerard Wrynne.  He is a close personal friend and the last person who parted with him on Friday night was a very close member of my family.  I hope the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice will arrange in the very near future to have a full investigation of this incident carried out.  It has left a kind of suspicion in the minds of some and I have no doubt that both Ministers will ensure that the situation is clarified in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears from Garda reports today that the seige, as it might be called, may continue over Christmas.  I hope the Garda and the Army will use all their tact to ensure that the area is allowed to enjoy as peaceful a Christmas as possible.  The people of the area who have, I hope, no <Col N="1033" /> involvement in this atrocity, have been brought to the notice of the world and I am sure those in command of the security forces involved will ensure that they are allowed to have a peaceful Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish on behalf of the House to extend the sympathy of the House to the families of Garda Gary Sheehan and Private Patrick Kelly on their sad loss.</P>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of horror and revulsion at the dark and terrible deeds that have been committed allegedly in the name of the Irish people.  There is little I can add to what has already been said except that I am particularly grieved as these deeds have been committed in the Ballinamore area which is my own town.  I want to emphasise that the evil perpetrators of these deeds do not find acceptance or approval in the area.  This is borne out by the fact that in the last local elections a certain party got less than five per cent of the poll.</P>
      <P>I also express our thanks to the security forces for the good work they have done on behalf of the community.  They are getting the unstinted support of the vast majority of the local community.  It is very regrettable that one local person, Mr. Gerard Wrynne, was injured and I sincerely hope that he will soon recover. I hope that an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the incident will be undertaken.  It is very timely, indeed very urgent, that those who actively or otherwise support the evil-doers should take stock of their position, even at this late stage when so much suffering has already been caused.</P>
      <P>A lot of damage has been done to the good name of the area as a result of the bad publicity surrounding the event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order and in doing so I am trying to ensure that Government business is completed on time.  The Order of Business, as I will outline it, takes into <Col N="1034" /> consideration the availability of Ministers and I am also trying to facilitate Members of the House.  It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 9, 2, 3, 6, 7, 4, 5 and 8 in that order if possible.  With regard to No. 7, if time does not permit that item to be taken before Nos. 4 and 5 then that item will not be taken at the appropriate time, namely, 5 o'clock or before.  It depends how the rest of our business proceeds. Agreement has been reached with the Opposition to have a full debate on the substance of the Appropriation Bill on Tuesday, 17 January and Wednesday, 18 January 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I should like to refer to the moving speeches and tributes made this afternoon in this House and somewhat similar speeches that were made recently on the murder of Edgar Graham and to express the conviction that it is not enough for this House, with increasing frequency on the Order of Business, to express deep, heartfelt and poignant tributes.  I recall in particular the moving speech made by Senator Robb on the death of Edgar Graham and this afternoon a very brief but moving speech by Senator Rogers.  I ask the Acting Leader of the House if, since the Seanad is going to come back early in January for the debate on the Appropriation Bill and other business it might be possible to have a day when we could have a more structured and adequate opportunity to take stock of and assess the whole situation on this island, with particular reference to Northern Ireland. As I happen to be a member of the body in question, I am well aware there is a Forum debating and discussing Northern Ireland but I think this House can make a unique contribution.  It is peculiarly representative in the way Senator Rogers mentioned.  So serious and urgent is the situation, it would be desirable that we have an opportunity early in the New Year to come together for a full day to examine and to discuss the kind of issues that are only coming up tangentially and briefly at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to two matters on the proposed Order of <Col N="1035" /> Business.  First, I refer to item No. 7 which is the Fine Gael motion on alcohol abuse.  I assure the House that we have no objection to that being postponed.  I am aware that the Acting Leader of the House might have some difficulty with regard to Ministers and that it may suit him to take it now but in the event of it not suiting him to take it now we have no objection to it being postponed by a further order of this House at a later time during the course of discussions today.</P>
      <P>With regard to item No. 8 there is absolutely no possibility of getting a full discussion on that today.  It is right to order it but not without recognising that we may have to adjourn it; we might put it through and deny ourselves the opportunity of discussing it at a later date.  It is vital that this matter should be discussed and I should like to ask the Acting Leader of the House what his intentions are if the rest of the business takes us up to 8.30 p.m. which is very likely?  Is it his intention to sit tomorrow or to postpone discussing it until January?</P>

      <P>Senator Robinson raised a very important point which I will communicate to the Leader of the House on his return to see if it is possible to have a properly structured debate on this very important subject.  I wish to thank Senator O'Leary for his comments with regard to item No. 7, because I ordered business so as to give preference to legislative matters.  If time permits it is our intention to discuss item No. 8 but, if not, I am sure we can reach agreement with the Opposition to decide when we should discuss it.  There were complaints that it was not ordered for last week but that was because I felt we would not reach it. I am not too optimistic about reaching it today either but because a Minister is available I have ordered it.  We can decide later, by agreement, whether we should sit late to take it or to postpone it until after Christmas.  The ordering of this item indicates the importance which the Government place on this report.</P>

      <P>When the terms of reference of these various committees were being discussed last July, a number of us felt that there was a lack of standardisation, that each set of terms of reference was drafted by the Department or the individual responsible and that there was a lack of overall standardisation.  It is important that a committee like this will have the capacity, which they now have, to invite and take the verbatim record of evidence from the public.  However, I was under the impression that the committee were already doing this.  I am not a member of that committee but I thought they were hearing RTE and other bodies with regard to local radio. <Col N="1037" /> that this was being done in public and that they were taking a record.

      <P>There are so few opportunities to comment on committees that I hope you will bear with me on this occasion.  It is desirable that the committee should be empowered to take evidence and to report on the evidence they take from the public.  I was surprised to learn from a member of the committee that small business have been defined as including any business that has 100 employees or fewer.  If this is correct, it is a very broad definition of small businesses because it includes almost every business in the State.  I raise this matter because when we decide to set up a committee we should have a fairly accurate idea of what the focus of that committee will be and the title of the committee would not lead me, as a non-member of that committee, to consider that it was going to so enlarge their scope that it would consider businesses which must include practically all the Irish-owned businesses in the State and a very wide number of businesses.  Therefore, would it be possible for us to consider how this <Col N="1038" /> may affect the capacity of the committee to report in due course?</P>

This is a very important committee and, while they may appear to have a very wide scope, if you compare the position with most European businesses they consider that a firm employing 400 people is a small business.  In our dimension by defining a small business as one which employs under 100 people we will be including many areas, rural and urban, where small businesses are encountering so many difficulties.  It is vital that we take evidence from the relevant agencies, banking and managerial systems.  It is also vitally important that many submissions being heard by this committee should be taken in public.  I fully endorse and support the motion that we adopt this procedure in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fees are payable to the Department of Agriculture in respect of cattle, horses, sheep and pigs presented for veterinary inspection at meat factories under the Fresh Meat Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  The present rates of fees are inadequate to meet the cost of the veterinary inspection service provided by my Department.  The cost of providing these services has increased steadily over the years.  This is mainly attributable to increased salaries and inflation as well as to some expansion in the industry and increased diversification.  It is necessary that these fees should be brought more into line with the cost of the service.</P>
      <P>The draft regulations now before the House propose to raise the fee for cattle from £2.20 to £3.25 per head, for sheep from 38p to 55p per head, for horses from £2.20 to £3.25 per head and for pigs from 72p to £1.10 per head.  This will bring receipts more into line with the true cost of the inspection service in that area.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the rates proposed, the receipts will be £5.8 million in a full year while the cost of the meat service is estimated at £7.3 million.  I propose to bring the increases into effect on 1 January 1984.  It is my intention to increase correspondingly the fees in respect of veterinary inspection of live animals as from the same date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the imposition of any new levies at this time in view of the economic situation in agriculture.  We all know, and the Minister realises, that agriculture is going through a very tough period, and has done so all through 1983. We have heard in both Houses of the number of farmers who got into financial difficulties through borrowing from lending <Col N="1040" /> institutions to develop their farms and who now find they cannot meet the interest rates being charged and at the same time the Government are suspending the farm modernisation scheme in an effort to save money.  This was a very bad move.</P>
      <P>I hoped that before the end of the year the Minister would have announced the reintroduction of the farm modernisation scheme, but unfortunately that is not so. The Government, by suspending the scheme, have taken almost £11 million out of agriculture at a time when that kind of investment was very badly needed.  Earlier in the year the Minister of State promised that this scheme would be reintroduced in November and that special notice would be taken of providing accommodation to get cattle in off the land.  Unfortunately that has not happened. Cattle should be off the land by now but unfortunately they still have no roof over their heads.  The Minister has not reintroduced the farm modernisation scheme and, apparently, we will be facing into the new year without it being reintroduced. For those reasons I oppose the imposition of those charges.</P>
      <P>Some years ago when we were in Government and similar charges were being introduced, there was an outcry from the Minister's party, although agricultural earnings were much higher then than they are now and prospects for agriculture were much better then than now.  Those charges were withdrawn at a later period.  Until such time as we can chart the way forward more clearly and see light at the end of the tunnel, those charges should not be increased.</P>
      <P>We saw the opposition there was to the milk super-levy from all sections of the community.  Until such time as that issue is settled and farmers know and understand where they are going, we should not agree to the imposition of those charges.  That is the stand I am taking and the Minister would be well advised to hold off for the time being because I am sure he, like every other public representative, has been under pressure from the farming organisations not to increase those charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I would like to thank the Minister for last night's announcement <Col N="1041" /> about the Tuam sugar factory, even though it does not come under this motion.  As I have been involved in that campaign for so long it is only right that I should compliment the Minister on finally giving a decision, even though it does not suit everybody &mdash; and it does not suit me.  All I am afraid of is that the cure may be worse than the disease.  It would be unfortunate if we had to let go half the work force to achieve what the Minister intends.  I am sure nobody in Tuam wants to see that happen.  I ask the Minister, in this season of goodwill, to make sure that, whatever capital allocations are made to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, half will be allocated to Tuam to modernise the plant and make it more efficient.</P>

      <P>Except to say one sentence. The Government have taken a decision and it is now a matter for the Irish Sugar Company to run Tuam effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While supporting these regulations, they should be stabilished at this level and we should not have to face further increases in inspection levies of this sort for some time because the margins in the beef and pigs sectors are becoming tighter. This relates particularly to the area of pig production where margins are very tight at present and increases per head have a severe effect.  There is a reduction in slaughterings of beef at factories as against overall slaughterings.  This is a factor which has to be borne in mind. People who are now doing this work slaughtered more animals in the past. <Col N="1042" /> That fact cannot be overlooked by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>We must make certain that the standard of our products coming from bacon factories or meat plants, be they sheep meat or beef, is of the highest order possible. This relates to the home market and to the very important export market.  While people will complain about the level of headage payments for inspection, we must leave no stone unturned to ensure that we have a product of a very high quality.  These charges are necessary.  On top of other charges we will be discussing later, they are putting a fair burden on people.  I would like to think we could see a stabilisation of these charges at this level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Hussey, I want to express my opposition to these proposed increases.  The proposed increases are £1.5 per head in respect of cattle, from 38p to 55p in respect of sheep, £1.5 in respect of horses, and 72p to £1.10 in respect of pigs.  The last is a very savage increase when you consider that every pig in this country at the moment is &ldquo;dying in debt&rdquo; and very few of them are leaving a clean slate behind them.  Anybody who looks at the pig industry will see that is the position as of now.  The Minister's action in increasing these charges shows his lack of knowledge of and his lack of insight into the pig industry. He should have allowed the present charges to continue until such time as the pig industry was in a position to pay extra charges, which appears to be a long way off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the increased charges and fees for cattle, the direct State deduction for every animal slaughtered is approximately £4 per head, which is made up of £3.25 under the new regulation for veterinary inspections and 70p for CBF.  It might be better if it was the other way around.  If you look at the amount of money being put into CBF and their activities, you will see they are not being given the necessary funds to carry out a proper marketing job for our No. 1 product, namely, meat.  I wonder how these charges are justified.  In a factory that slaughters 400 cattle per day <Col N="1043" />&mdash; and that is not a big factory as far as we are concerned &mdash; a charge of £3.25 per head means that £1,300 a day will be collected in that factory from the farmers. How many people are employed on meat inspections and AO work in those meat factories?  I would love to know what the wages bill for a factory like that would be per week.  A figure of £1,300 a day collected five days a week is £6,500 in inspection fees.  That £6,500 would pay many veterinary inspectors.</P>
    <P>In taking this action the Minister will reduce the number of cattle killed on this side of the Border.  For the past 12 or 18 months it has been much more beneficial for farmers to kill their cattle in Northern Ireland with the variable permium, which the Minister promised to deal with some months ago.  It would leave fair competition for Irish factories if it were still in operation.  We could mention many other things this Minister and this Government promised the farmers in the past 12 or 18 months.  We had an agreement with the EEC for a free pre-movement test.  We have not heard anything about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey mentioned the fact that the farm modernisation scheme was suspended supposedly until October 1983.  I am beginning to think it will be extended to October 1984 because, while the Minister has a commitment to agriculture, he has not got a commitment from the other members of the Government to give farming a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to defer these increases because it is a simple case of taking more money out of farmers' pockets. We all know the situation in which the beef farmers and the dairy farmers find themselves.  Like Senator Hussey, I am totally opposed to these increased charges which are aimed at the sections who are forced to pay them because you have to pay them to have your animals slaughtered.  Possibly the Minister will be coming back here in the future looking for further increases.  It appears that this Government have an ambition to charge farmers for every facility being provided for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>No one likes to raise charges for anything.  I remember Senator Hussey actually proposing a similar Bill here.  He made the point that values were slightly different then.  The reality is that the Minister has a responsibility to provide this service which costs the taxpayer something in the region of £7.3 million.  If the Minister did not carry out his responsibility in this regard, he would be doing a disservice to the consumer who depends totally on the inspectorate to inspect throughly animals slaughtered for human consumption.  Recently there was an outcry about contamination of food products, much of which the media overplayed.  The Department's figures contradicted much of what was said about antibiotic residues.  These inspectors have to be vigilant about lesions in animals killed for human consumption.  That responsibility rests with the Minister.  It is only fair that the sector involved should pay a contribution towards it.  They are not being asked to pay the full cost, which would be extremely high.  I agree that levels of profits, particularly in these areas, are pretty slim.  I do not think the position in the pig industry is as bad as Senator Ellis said.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a responsibility to the consumer and if we approach it on that basis and if the Minister, when he looks at the four-year plan on agriculture, implements <Col N="1045" /> sections of it within the required period, agriculture can proceed with a specific plan.  The animals which we are talking about &mdash; cattle, horses, sheep and pigs &mdash; will come into their own and there will be a proper programme.  Reference was also made by Senator Ellis to the disease eradication programme which the EEC were prepared to fund.  I must correct him and say that it was his Minister for Finance who negotiated the deal in Brussels and put the embargo on the public sector which could not allow the scheme to be implemented.</P>
    <P>I believe this motion is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be the last to claim any close working involvement with the subject matter of this motion but I am interested in an aspect which has not so far been discussed, namely, the Minister's intention to increase correspondingly fees in respect of veterinary inspection of live animals as from the same date.  I presume this is a reference to the proposed draft order in relation to fees for exporters' licences.  I would welcome further explanation and clarification from the Minister since under Community law we would only be entitled to charge fees in this area if they were quite definitely related to the cost of inspection; otherwise they would be potentially a charge on exports, contrary to the free movement of goods.  It would be helpful to have further details of how these licences are issued and the cost.  Is it the case that even with the increase in export licences they would not bear the full cost, or is there a spread cost between inspection fees for cattle and other animals slaughtered and the export licences?  Are they all covered by the same scheme without a breakdown?  I could see the danger of the possibility of a challenge to an increase in fees for exports raising an issue of Community law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the point already made that these fees are being increased quite substantially in real terms and must necessarily be a burden borne by those <Col N="1046" /> either bringing cattle for slaughter or for export.  I fully support the view that it is necessary to maintain a high quality and to be very careful about the quality of our fresh meat.  We must be concerned about recent reports and analyses of the situation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would give the House further information on the way in which the fees are composed.  Are they determined by the veterinary profession or are they strictly controlled by the Government?  If we are dealing with a profession setting their fees, our approach should be to look seriously at the basis for those fees to see whether they are justified and whether we should be passing them on by way of these orders.  It would be helpful to have this information, particularly for somebody like myself who is not as familiar with the situation as some other Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that these fees are very necessary.  The figure of £3.25 per animal may look a little high and it is a fairly steep increase.  I accept that the Minister has investigated the matter and finds this level of fees to be necessary.  It is very important that these inspections should take place.  We are all aware of the amount of taxpayers' money which has been spent on the disease eradication programme and it is to be hoped that we are now making some progress.  Nobody likes an increase which will hit his pocket and the person producing beef has no escape.  I am not sure that Senator Ellis is correct in saying there will be a greater movement of cattle across the Border.  I do not think this will happen to any great extent, although even without these increases there has been a certain amount of cattle movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister intends to introduce this measure in relation to the live trade.  The levies introduced between 1979 and 1981 by the Fianna Fáil Government were counter-productive. Many people tried to escape payment and the best way to avoid paying the levies was to have more sales on the land. There was a lot of movement of cattle from one farm to another in an attempt <Col N="1047" /> to escape the levies.  This may have contributed to the spread of disease.</P>
    <P>I would agree with other speakers regarding the level of profit on cattle.  I am in this business and I know that the margin of profit is very small.  We should be encouraging more people to go into beef production.  I have noticed a reluctance on the part of farmers during the past few months to buy in cattle for fattening in the winter.  This is due to the very small profit margin.  I am referring to the sales at Ashbourne, Kells and other places.  Barley is very expensive and if a farmer has to borrow money his profit will be very small.  Successive Governments in recent years have been attempting to increase cattle numbers.  This encouragement must be sustained because it also affects other sectors.  We must have people to fatten cattle, otherwise the dairyman will have trouble selling his calves.  We have to think of the barley growers.  We must fatten cattle and by doing so we are making a market available for the barley growers.  I know that it gives the Minister no great pleasure to introduce these charges.  It is something that has been done before and will possibly be done again.</P>
    <P>The only thing that concerns me at the moment is the question of the levy on live cattle.  Perhaps the Minister might explain how he intends ot introduce that. I am sure that he has no choice in the factories.  I want to warn him about the effects the last levies introduced had on cattle sold in 1979 and 1981.  There were then great complaints from everybody involved in the disease eradiction programme. I know a bit about that as I was on the Animal Health Council for some years and I am chairman of the Animal Health Council in County Louth.  Many farmers at that time expressed the view that the levies had an effect because people were moving cattle at night from one farm to another, rather than pay the levies.  I hope that the Minister will keep that in mind.  We spend millions of pounds on the disease eradication programme. Perhaps we are making some progress though maybe not as much as we would like.  The DVO in my own <Col N="1048" /> county told me that he is very happy with the results.  Hopefully, the results will be as good elsewhere during 1984.</P>

      <P>I wish to point out that this increase which the Minister has brought forward must be seen in the right light with regard to charges and quality control in one of our most important expert sectors, the carcase meat sector.  Like Senators Ferris and Robinson, I believe that if we are to maintain standards it is important that we have proper and adequate inspection by the Department.  The Department and the Government must be able to stand over these products and we must pay for these services.</P>
      <P>In recent times there has been much publicity about the quality of meats.  At one stage the export of animals and meat to an EEC country from here was held over because of a refusal to finalise approval for export.  In such a situation the Opposition must realise that the Minister, is weighing up the pros and cons of this additional charge, must take into consideration the possible jeopardising of that very important export trade. Results from inspections must be forthcoming and the onus is on the veterinary profession who carry out these inspections to report back.  If there is a particular reason for any carcase or its origin to be identified, that must be done as a follow-up in return for the expenditure involved.</P>

    <P>Much of the criticism from the other side of the House today has concerned a lack of commitment by this Government <Col N="1049" /> to agriculture in general.  I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Agriculture for the way in which he has shown a very great commitment to certain sectors of agriculture, particularly in the west, by his proposal to keep Tuam sugar factory open.  This was long awaited and the Minister at all times had said that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  Some speakers confused item 2 on the agenda with item 3, notably Senators Hussey and Lennon. The item we are dealing with refers to veterinary inspection fees.  Item 3 refers to bovine disease levies.  I am somewhat worried about the introduction of the increase in the inspection fee on pigs from 72p to £1.10p because of the very depressed state of the pig industry at present.  My departmental advisers tell me that the pig trade is cyclical in nature and that hopefully the present depression will not last too long.  I would hope their judgement in this regard is found to be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members of the Opposition objected to the increases.  They must bear in mind that the services in question cost £7.3 million and, even taking these increases into account, the fees will realise a sum of £5.8 million only.  If the fees were not increased the extra cost would have to be borne by the long-suffering taxpayer.  That is the option.  Ideally, the fees should equate with the cost of the service.  Having said that, I should mention that I met a deputation yesterday from the Fresh Meat Exporters' Association when I promised that I would examine the whole system of veterinary inspections at factories to ascertain whether its costs could be reduced.  Obviously, such would involve discussion with the veterinary unions concerned.  In that regard I <Col N="1051" /> might answer a question posed by Senator Robinson as to who fixes the fees. They are fixed by the Department of Agriculture who, having studied the cost involved, then decide on the appropriate fees.</P>
    <P>Another question the Senator posed was that of live exports.  She asked: why did the veterinary fees apply to live exports.  Each country to which we export requires a veterinary certificate in respect of each animal exported.  Therefore, each individual animal must be examined by a veterinary surgeon; hence the cost of a veterinary fee for live exports.  Also we must bear in mind that the value of our beef exports, that is meat and live cattle exports, is £800 million per annum &mdash; a sizeable sum.  It is vital that we do not do anything that would jeopardise that trade.  For example, if our veterinary services were seen to be less than adeqate, it could damage our export potential.</P>
    <P>There has already been the controversy in regard to antibiotics in milk and hormone growth promotors in animals which has given rise to a certain fear among the public and has reduced considerably the actual comsumption of milk here.  I would hate to incur the risk of jeopardising our export trade in beef which, as I have said, runs to the extent of £800 million per annum.  Therefore, it will be seen that this service is absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis said I had promised to deal with the variable premium operated in Northern Ireland and Britain as an incentive to meat factories in both places to export at lesser prices than is the case here in the South.  I promised I would raise the matter with the EEC Commission at the Council of Ministers' meetings in Brussels.  We have repeatedly done so but have been unsuccessful in persuading the Commission to bring forward a proposal for the elimination of the variable premium or, more correctly, for the introduction of what might be termed &ldquo;a claw-back&rdquo; on the premium as at present obtaining.  The variable premium constitutes a rather complex system of supporting prices in Northern Ireland and in Britain.  We do not totally oppose that <Col N="1052" /> variable premium because it benefits considerably our beef producers.  What we object to is its use in order to bring about unfair competition with our meat factories. That is why we are seeking the removal of an element only of that variable premium, not the premium in its entirely.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the farm modernisation scheme which we had proposed to reintroduce in late autumn.  But then we had hoped also to bring in the Book of Estimates in October.  The reintroduction of the scheme in its revised form has been delayed because, for a variety of reasons, the Estimates have run approximately two months later than had been anticipated.  Now that the Estimates have been published an announcement of the revised scheme is imminent. I would hope it will be announced within a matter of days.</P>
    <P>I think that covers the bulk of the questions raised in the course of this debate. The point raised by Senator de Brún is not relevant to the motion before the House.  But I shall communicate with him letting him know the up-to-date position in regard to that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979, which was introduced by a previous administration mainly to secure a financial contribution from the farming sector towards the cost of the Bovine TB and Brucellosis Eradication Programme. <Col N="1053" /> The Act provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the introduction of levies of £3 per bovine animal slaughtered or exported live and 0.5p per gallon of milk received for processing. The Act also provided that these levies could be varied by regulations and the rates of levy which had operated from 1 September, 1979 were, in fact, fixed at &ldquo;nil&rdquo; with effect from 1 February 1981.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the seriousness of the current Exchequer situation the Government have decided that once again farmers should be asked to contribute to the cost of the eradication programme.  However, mindful of the various charges and input costs which already fall on the farming sector, the Government took the view that reimposition of the original rates of levy would be inappropriate in present circumstances.  The rates of levy now proposed &mdash; £1.90 on cattle and 0.3p per gallon on milk &mdash; are approximately 40 per cent below those imposed in 1979 and very substantially lower when account is taken of reduced money values since then.</P>
      <P>The proposed levies, which will operate from 1 January next, are expected to yield £5 million in the year 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, taxpayers' money amounting to £750 million at present-day values has been invested in the programme.  This figure does not take account of administrative costs.  In this context the contribution of £5 million being asked of farmers in 1984 must be seen as relatively modest.  It should also be seen as an investment by farmers in the future growth and development of the livestock and livestock products sector.  The potential for growth and development is hampered by the ravages of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis which slow down the process of increasing the national herd, cause loss of thrive in cattle and cut into milk yields.  It is in the best interests of farmers therefore that we get rid of these two diseases as soon as possible and I will be looking for a redoubling of effort by all concerned, including the veterinary profession, the advisory service, my Department and the farmers themselves, particularly in relation to bovine TB so that the eradication programme can be brought to a successful conclusion at the <Col N="1054" /> earliest possible date.  Achievement of this objective will bring greater returns to the farming community in terms of increased volume and value of livestock and livestock products.</P>
    <P>Progress towards the final eradication of brucellosis has been most satisfactory. With fewer than, 1,400 herds now restricted because of this disease, the economic benefits of this situation are being felt by farmers throughout the country.  Regrettably, the same cannot be said about TB in the earlier years of the eradication scheme very substantial progress was made, but there has been little or no reduction in the national incidence of bovine TB in the past couple of years, and the deteriorating disease situation in certain counties has become a matter of very serious concern.  These are counties in which ten years ago the battle against TB was thought to be well on the way towards being won.</P>
    <P>In line with the experience in other countries which have carried out eradication programmes the elimination of the final residues of TB infection can be a difficult task.  Therefore, with a view to speeding up the eradication process, I have arranged for a review of all aspects of the bovine tuberculosis scheme when the current round of testing ends early in the new year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. T. Hussey Mr. T. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the proposed levies for the same reasons that I gave in dealing with item No. 2.  In the present state of agriculture increases of this nature are not justified.  Every year in this House &mdash; and indeed in the other House, too &mdash; we have discussions on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  It is most unfortunate that, after all those years and having spent millions of pounds on the eradication of this disease, we are still almost as far away as ever from getting rid of it.  In some counties the incidence is worse that it ever was before.  I cannot understand why the veterinary people and the Department's officials cannot come to grips with this problem and find out what is causing it.  There must be some reason why areas that had already been declared clear are now suffering <Col N="1055" /> again from the ravages of TB.  The situation is very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country depends very much on the export of live cattle and indeed of fresh meat.  I am afraid that sometime in the near future our counterparts in Europe will say to us that they have had enough of this kind of thing, that they are no longer prepared to accept our cattle or meat until such time as we rid our herds of TB and brucellosis once and for all.  The eradication schemes have been in progress for the past ten or 15 years but there is still no light at the end of the tunnel so far as TB eradication is concerned.  That is a sad state of affairs. I do not know who is responsible.  Indeed, farmers cannot be blamed for saying that vets and others had a vested interest in keeping this disease going.  That is what is being said.  We have laws to try to curtail the movement of cattle and so on, but I am afraid they are not being enforced.  How often do we see lorries at marts that have not been washed or cleaned or disinfected?  How often have we seen cattle being moved at home from one farm to the other without having been tested?  The blind eye seems to be turned to such incidents.  The situation should not be allowed to continue because it is too serious.  It is very serioius in the national interest and also for any unfortunate farmer who has the hard luck of having his herd closed as a result of an outbreak of TB.  His livelihood is taken away.  He has to wait for a certain period of time before he can have his cattle tested and retested.  He cannot sell during that time and in many cases great hardship has been imposed on the individual farmer.  A few years ago we had the hardship fund, which gave some help to people who found themselves in situations like this.  Unfortunately, that scheme is gone also.  I ask the Minister, now that he is seeking this increase in fees, although the increase will bring in only something like £5 million in 1984, to think of those unfortunate farmers who have had the problem of having a breakdown in disease eradication, who have their herds closed, who cannot sell and <Col N="1056" /> who are looking forward to this fund to try to give them some relief.</P>
    <P>We could go on talking but I think there is not any need.  We all realise the importance of the scheme we are talking about.  If I thought for one minute that the increase in those fees would lead to our coming to grips with the problems in relation to disease eradication, I would be only too happy to support the Minister in his plea, but I am afraid that is not the situation.  We are only scratching at the surface and, as I said, I cannot understand why all our experts have not come to grips with the problem before now, why they have not been able to find out whether it is the wrong vaccine we are using or whether we have the wrong system of testing our cattle.  We are long enough at it now to have found all the answers to those questions.  We have spent enough money on it and I would appeal to the Minister to press forward, for the sake of the industry, with the eradication of this terrible disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support fully the introduction of the proposed levy for disease eradication.  It is very essential that we tackle this problem as never before.  We have been engaged in the process of disease eradication for almost 30 years, since 1954, and, as has been stated by the Minister, we have had varying degrees of success; but, regrettably, in the last couple of years we seem to be sliding seriously backwards.  In west Cork there is now an incidence of 7 per cent.  By that I mean there is 7 per cent of herds locked up in west Cork, there is a figure of 6 per cent in other counties and lower percentages in others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is extremely serious in so far as we are talking about, in many cases, perhaps one animal in a herd that restricts the entire remaining number of animals, be they 100 cattle or 50 cattle.  This is where the real hardship comes upon the farmer.  When he has a reactor animal that animal, of course, ought to be disposed of very rapidly to a factory.  But then he has to wait for two periods of 60 days in each case, assuming success in his tests from there on, before he can sell his cattle on the open market.  The farmer <Col N="1057" /> who is found to have a reactor and whose herd consists of small cattle that he cannot sell on the open market place, and which are unfit to sell to a factory, is very hard hit.  He is in need of money.  He does not have the fodder to keep these animals and he has no outlet for them.  Something very imaginative must be thought up whereby clean animals, as one would describe animals not affected by TB, could perhaps be bought through some Departmental scheme, brought to a central area and kept there and brought to the fattening stage.  At the moment it is only those who are affected by a restriction situation, a locked-up herd situation, who realise the very great hardship a reactor animal, as a result of TB or brucellosis, can present.</P>
    <P>It is good to know and realise that we have been making good progress with regard to brucellosis.  With regard to bovine TB, it is alarming that herds that have been free of the disease for 16 years and longer can suddenly have a reactor. The farmer is then back on the slippery slope and placed in a category where he might remain for up to five years during which time his animals are locked up and he cannot sell them.  It presents, in practical terms, a very serious position.</P>
    <P>I strongly advocate to the Minister, and the Department of Agriculture, that there be a comprehensive research programme established with a back-up service on this question of disease eradication. We have spent £750 million on this over 30 years but we have not devoted sufficient moneys to ascertain why TB breaks out in herds, sometimes suddenly and after long dormant periods. There is an urgency to establish research and back-up programmes for the whole testing operation to try to identify the causes of TB.  We have done some sporadic work on wildlife, badger-testing and so on &mdash; I know of areas where goats were tested for TB &mdash; but we have not been able to come forward with any positive information with regard to what is the cause of TB.</P>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning is the absolute accuracy of the test.  Perhaps further investigation of this might be appropriate but I do not think it is as <Col N="1058" /> necessary as back-up and research services.  On the accuracy of the test, I should like to mention to the Minister that figures reveal that 26 per cent of all reactors show lesions at the factory. However, the converse of that is that in a number of cases where animals passed through two or three tests and were absolutely clean as far as the clinical testing was concerned they also showed lesions at the factory.  I appreciate also, before a reply comes my way, that disease can get to a chronic stage in an animal where it will not react, but I am not so sure that this answers the question.  I must stress the urgent need to prepare research and back-up programmes to ascertain the cause of TB.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we must again have a look at the absolute accuracy of this test.  This is extremely important to the individual farmer if he is presented with one single reactor.  It is not the reactor animal that causes the loss or the hardship to the farmer, it is all the other animals he is prevented from disposing of in an orderly sales way.</P>
    <P>I should like to support fully the Minister in this regulation.  We must couple that levy with a serious effort to eradicate disease.  We are a long time at this and our progress, unfortunately, has not been great.  The root cause must be dug out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not had anything but bad news for the farmers today.  He has just done with another £5 million in 1984 in disease levies.  We all know that these levies will be used in the eradication of disease but the whole disease programme must be looked at seriously. The disease eradication programme started, as Senator Hourigan said, about 25 or 30 years ago with the green painted tag.  I remember as a child seeing the vet doing TB testing.  When we see that we are still in a serious disease position we realise that many questions have to be answered.  The imposition of this £1.90 fee per head is possibly the Minister's way of trying to get farmers to pay a contribution on their livestock sales.  The introduction of a levy of 0.3p per gallon on milk for disease eradication <Col N="1059" /> is a way of getting more money from the hard-pressed farmers.</P>
      <P>When I look at the whole problem of disease I wonder if there are not a number of new approaches the veterinary officials in the Department might adopt with regard to disease eradication.  Senator Hourigan mentioned one of my pet subjects, farmers with herds locked up with TB or brucellosis who have got quite young and unsaleable cattle.  Could the Department devise a scheme to allow those cattle which are healthy and disease-free but are part of a locked-up herd to be exported from here live?  I know that third countries are prepared to accept certificates of origin that the animals have been tested within the previous 30 to 60 days.  The Minister should devise a scheme under which such animals may be taken from the farm to the point of export.  As far as farmers, the Department and the third countries are concerned, those cattle would be disease-free because they would have had a test within the prescribed number of days.</P>
      <P>That is one way that we could alleviate the fear of testing which many farmers have.  Our biggest problem arises where farmers are not presenting all their stock for testing at herd tests.  This is a well known fact.  It is also a fact that animals which pass the TB test may not necessarily be 100 per cent clear.  Indeed, there is also the opposite case where animals which fail the test are found afterwards in factories to be free of disease. That leaves a question mark over the vaccines being used by the Department in carrying out these tests.  The Department should examine the vaccines that are available throughout the world for TB testing and introduce the vaccine that is giving the highest percentage of reactor detection.  There is no sense in prolonging this any more.  We heard that £750 million has been spent on disease eradication and we can say it was badly spent.  That is a sad fact and we have not got the desired results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Greater progress has been made in regard to brucellosis than was made in regard to TB.  Senator de Brún mentioned earlier that a large portion of the <Col N="1060" /> country under EEC regulations is entitled to FOB status.  If that status was introduced it would have a significant bearing on the value of female cattle in the areas concerned.  The present regulations forbid the export for slaughter of female stock with more than two permanent teeth and my suggestion would mean that even those can be exported for immediate slaughter.  It would mean that those animals, as well as pregnant heifers and cows, could be exported from that area to Northern Ireland and England. The Minister should investigate that fully.  I know from my own investigations that a large area of the north-west comes within that status.  If we had that status generally it would mean that such cattle would be suitable for export and would bring greater competition to the market place.  As I said at the beginning, this is a subtle way to take money from the Irish farmers.  This action, combined with the new regulations which the Minister is bringing in today, will mean that a farmer will now pay in excess of £5 per animal slaughtered.  The increases will mean that a farmer will pay £5.15, £1.90 disease levy, and if you add £3.25&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a subject very dear to my heart.  I have been associated with it for longer than anybody in the House. Father Hayes originally started the tuberculosis eradication scheme in my native parish of Bansha in the late forties as a pilot scheme.  He realised that if farmers did not achieve a certain level of disease <Col N="1061" /> free animals they would have no markets open to them.  Almost 30 years later we are still acting on derogation from an EEC directive to bring our livestock up to a disease-free level, but we have not achieved it despite the expenditure of colossal amounts of taxpayers' money. The Minister has given the figure of £750 million to date without taking into account the cost of administration of the scheme.  Out of that amount farmers have got relatively little by way of compensation for the animals they lost.  Quite a lot of money has gone on veterinary and other such items, which are hidden.</P>
      <P>The very large amount involved in disease eradication puts a great responsibility on everybody involved to pay the closest possible attention to the status of our herds <i>vis-à-vis</i> our European partners. We have had an Animal Health Council for a number of years.  They have done invaluable work.  I was a member for a number of years and I am asking the Minister to call the council together again in the near future.  He has got nominations from various concerned bodies throughout the country for the composition of the new council.  The task of such a council would seem to increase rather than diminish daily with the increase in tuberculosis, particularly in parts of the country.</P>
      <P>We cannot look at a disease like tuberculosis without considering how virulent it is and how easily transmitted it is from farm to farm, whether by lateral spread, weather conditions, the movement of animals or the switching of tags, which we know has gone on for a number of years by middlemen in the cattle trade. Because of all of that, vast amounts of money have been spent on movement of diseased animals, movement from farm to factory and from farm to farm in spite of regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has created tremendous administrative problems for DVOs throughout the country.  Senator Hussey spoke about the mode of transport used for the conveyance of cattle.  There is no doubt that because animals excrete quite a lot between farm and factory the level of contamination is extremely high when cattle are entering other farms on the way <Col N="1062" /> to the factory and conveying a commodity which spreads the disease.  It is an incubating disease and if animals are moved at a particular time of the year the risk of infection is much greater than at other times of the year, because of weather conditions.  At the end of a year bad results can be had because the tubercles live in certain temperatures of muck and dirt and can cause a tremendous spread, of which nobody is aware.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has put heavy emphasis on the checking of the causes of the spread of the disease.  Much money has been invested on epidemiology. Unless we can ensure through our laboratory tests that we can isolate the spread of the disease we will never make progress even though we invest millions of pounds in our testing programme. Testing animals does not give you the cause of the disease; it just identifies reactors.  It does not identify reactors recently infected.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point made by Senator Hourigan that animals which react to tests in factories did not show lesions.  Such animals had been recently infected and the lesions had not had time to grow so that they could be identified visibly by the veterinary inspector.  The continuous use of tuberculin &mdash; Senator Ellis referred to &ldquo;vaccine&rdquo; when he should have referred to tuberculin which is not a vaccine &mdash; has shown clear evidence of much more positive results in the testing of animals for tuberculosis. The fact that animals do not show lesions in factories is not an indication that the animals are free from tuberculosis. Anybody who thinks that animals without lesions are not reactors is fooling himself.</P>
    <P>I should like particularly to see an end to the tag switching that goes on by jobbers in the trade.  We still have tags that can be switched and it has been proved that cards and tags for animals leaving farms to go to factories appear somehow on other animals in other parts of the country.  That is frightening.  It should be stopped by the full rigours of the law. Otherwise we will not be showing responsibility to the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession have a bounden <Col N="1063" /> duty to ensure that testing procedures will be followed strictly as laid down by the Department.  The Department will know the number of animals that veterinary surgeons declare as being tested on a particular day.  If it were physically possible to check all the animals that were declared on the first day, I would be satisfied.  It is important to research how these tests are carried out and read.  You are paid on the number of animals you inject on the first day and the number of tags you write down.  You should get paid on the number of animals read and correctly interpreted on the second day.</P>
    <P>The new Animal Health Council will have to address themselves to this, in conjunction with the veterinary representatives there, the Veterinary Union and the Veterinary Association.  I have very close working relationships with them.  I know exactly how they feel about this matter.  People now feel that animals are not even presented on the reading day. The veterinary surgeon should be able to prove conclusively that the animal injected on the initial day was read on the second day.  If a farmer, through fear or otherwise or through knowledge of what rises in the skin measurements can mean, is afraid to present them on the reading day and the proper checks are not carried out on the tags on that reading day, then a whole lot of possibly suspect animals may not even be presented for reading on the second day.  I say that with all due respect to everybody involved in the scheme, but I say it in the knowledge that it is in areas like this that diseased animals seem to escape the net of the testing procedure.</P>
    <P>I have the gravest reservations about testing.  Testing on its own is insufficient, because all it can do is at best identify the animals.  It does not identify the cause of disease and it certainly is no help in trying to eliminate what is a scourge on the farmer.  A previous Minister, to whom the Animal Health Council made an interim submission to try to take people out of the dilemma they were in because of the losses they had suffered under this scheme, completely ignored the recommendations <Col N="1064" /> of the Animal Health Council.  It is on the record of by-election campaigns and otherwise that that happened. I want to congratulate the Minister for including in the last budget a sum of £3 million additional compensation for farmers, because they lose money and animals as a result of this disease.</P>
    <P>Although the national average of locked-up animals is possibly two per herd normally, because it is only in isolated areas that you get the destruction of a whole herd, it is not those two but those the farmer is left with that he is unable to dispose of.</P>
    <P>From a disease eradication point of view I would have reservations about allowing any animals out of a herd without testing which have been in contact with reactors.  Otherwise you will never be able to pinpoint the disease or the farm responsible for the disease.  Just because an animal is clear one day is no guarantee that that animal will be still free within the incubation period.  We should be extremely careful about how we go about this national responsibility we have.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment all those involved in the brucellosis scheme because here for the first time we have made real progress in the eradication of a disease, simply because the farmer was able physically to see the losses involved in his herd because of brucellosis.  He saw his cows aborting their calves, there was a loss of milk and a loss of the calf.  In tuberculosis that loss is not visible to the actual livestock owner because he is still looking at what looks like healthy animals walking around his farm and fit to go to a factory.  We have made more progress in brucellosis because the rampages of that disease were more obvious to the herd owner.  He has a major responsibility in this to ensure that the transport which comes into his farm to remove animals to the factory is as clean when it leaves as when it arrives.  That is his responsibility.  It he does not do that he is asking for trouble and no vet, no Department or no Minister can take him out of that trouble.  With this kind of virulent disease that incubates and is transmitted very easily there is a major <Col N="1065" /> responsibility on everybody concerned to ensure that this scheme is brought to fruition within the derrogation period being allowed by the European Community. If it does not, if the Commission's proposals for the super-levy come into force and if we are wiped out of the trade for meat, live or otherwise, of the European Community, agriculture faces a very gloomy future &mdash; unless we really get on with the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add a few words, without repeating what has been said already.  I am glad the Minister told us that he is having a review of the whole scheme after the present round of testing finishes at the end of January.  I welcome this because I come from a county where the incidence of bovine tuberculosis has gone up.  Ten years ago we were clear of the disease, but now we are back in the situation where it has re-established itself. Not alone that, but our incidence is a good deal higher, I think, than the national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this review of the scheme I would ask the Minister to be particularly mindful, if he can, within the regulations one has to observe when one is trying to get rid of disease &mdash; the regulations one observes naturally have to be restrictive &mdash; of the plight of small farmers for whom, by and large, I have to speak in this House.  When they meet this great misfortune of having their herds loused up because of disease, it is almost as bad as being locked up yourself.  It has already been said by Senator Hourigan that those are the farmers who suffer most when animals are taken out because by and large their animals are smaller.  They are not animals suitable for slaughter in factories. They have to take a price that is way below the economic price.  On top of that, because their normal means of disposal of their animals is through the livestock marts, this locking-up regulation prohibits them from showing their animals in any public place for sale.  If you have animals that are fit for slaughter in a factory, you can get them under permit to a factory; but for the category I am speaking of now that option is not open. I would ask the Minister to take a very <Col N="1066" /> serious look at this particular hardship and to see how we can ameliorate the situation affecting small farmers caught in this way.</P>
    <P>We might say something about the way disease eradication is approached on the ground.  It has often occurred to me that in the area of the country where I live, where we are by and large dry stock farmers, the time for testing of most animals should be when herds are at their most static, that is during the summertime. You get an enormous amount of movement of animals in the dry stock areas during the months of September to March.  That is the normal peak selling period.  During the summer months herds are, by and large, static.  The number of animals presented for sale in public places like marts or for slaughter is very small.  I would suggest to the Minister that the preponderance of testing be done during this period because we would be hitting more of the animals on the farm and getting them before a lot of them are moved.  I honestly believe a lot of our problems are rooted in the movement of our animals from place to place.  Animals are moved from one place to another by dealers and so on, and within the 30 days of their test they may find themselves in six different locations or six different farms.  That kind of thing cannot be very good when you are dealing with something as virulent as the present strain of tuberculosis appears to be.</P>
    <P>The whole area of research into this disease should also be looked at.  I believe that we are now dealing with a strain of disease that is much more infectious and disease should also be looked at.  I believe more money, more resources and indeed more attention should be given to that area.  It would appear, regrettably, that only two people are working in Abbotstown on this area of disease eradication. I ask that this be kept in mind when the review comes up.</P>
    <P>Each DVO organises its testing on a county basis.  It appears that within each county a number of DEDs are taken together and the order will go from the DVO that the testing should be done in that area.  The problem is that very often <Col N="1067" /> veterinary practitioners will operate in any number of DEDs and we cannot get all our practitioners operating together as is necessary in an area designated for testing.  As a result of this a tideline arises between the times a practitioner can visit and test a farm and another practitioner can come to an adjoining farm.  Lapses of months may arise and such a situation is not very satisfactory in disease situations where disease on one farm is likely to spread to another.  I ask the Minister to have a close look at that.</P>
    <P>It is naturally very worrying that we have now something like 6,600 herds locked up with TB.  That is very serious from the point of view that we are Europe's major exporter of beef.  We are under orders from the EEC to get rid of disease and it is a great pity that in the last three or maybe five years we have made no progress at all in this, notwithstanding the fact that we have spent £750 million in the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>I hope that nothing I have said here today about perhaps relaxing regulations for farmers who are particularly hard hit will in any way operate against the general thrust of getting rid of disease.  It should not.  A close look must be taken at that section of small farmers who are particularly hard hit.  They suffer the greatest economic loss because of disease eradication.  They take the smallest price and so on.  I hope above all that in their review the Department will look very closely at this category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephLennon" hpid="Mr. Lennon Mr. Lennon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lennon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because it appears that nearly everything to be said on this matter has been said.  One matter very often mentioned at meetings is compensation for loss of cows and young cattle.  People sought a change in the method of buying cows.  Not so long ago the cows were bought by the AO who went to the farm and hammered out some type of deal with the owner.  It seems that the IFA made a mistake, as they admit freely now, by seeking the change which they got, whereby they could take the animal to the factory and get £X in compensation. This does not compensate the farmer adequately because the liveliest <Col N="1068" /> or leanest cow on a farm could well be a reactor and when that animal goes to the factory it fetches little or no money.  The good milking cow does not normally carry very much beef and for that reason fetches a very small price in the factory. There have been many requests to revert to the old system.  Every dairyman has his record of the yield of each of his cows and he might like to be paid on the basis of the milk yield of a cow.  I think that is a reasonable request and I would like to see us reverting to that system.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on increasing the compensation last year.  I would like him to take another look at the question of compensation in respect of smaller animals, the younger stock.  I do not know the number of young stock that are reactors; perhaps it is on record somewhere.  The factory does not want young stock because they are of no use to them.  I am referring to stock between six and 12 months old which if they were not reactors would realise the highest price per cwt at a sale yard.  For that reason their owners are being fleeced.  A farmer may have bought a calf, paying perhaps up to £200 for it, and might not get even half that amount if the animal has to be killed in a factory. I ask the Minister to look at that again. I do not know if there is any money in the hardship fund.  If compensation in respect of cows and younger animals was increased and if some money could be provided for the hardship fund, herd owners would not be reluctant to come forward and have all their animals of whatever age tested because they would be working in the knowledge that they would get full compensation for all of them.  Senator Ferris said that some of these people are not producing all of their animals for testing.  Perhaps they are withholding their young animals from fear that reactors might be among them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ferris referred to the accuracy of the test.  Some people, indeed neighbours of mine, were very concerned, when their animals went to the factories, about what the test would show.  There were no visible lesions and nothing showed up in the further laboratory test. Because the animal proves to be a reactor <Col N="1069" /> they believe that lesions should show up in the factory or in the test which follows. They do not necessarily hear the result but they are usually in the factory when the animal is killed and they can find out what the result is then.  It might be better if they did not hear it.  Many of them have expressed the view to me that the whole thing is bunkum, that there was nothing wrong with the animal.  Many farmers have expressed doubts to me about the whole thing.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been mentioned here today is outbreak in a herd which might have been clear for ten or 15 years and perhaps no cattle at all have been bought into that herd.  The farmer might have been rearing all of his own stock.  That is a mystery to many people and the DVOs I have spoken to cannot explain it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider what I have referred to.  Senator Hourigan suggested the possibility of having a centre somewhere where small cattle could be fattened.  Perhaps this was mentioned previously and the powers-that-be did not think it a wise suggestion.  It might be a wise idea now.  Again I thank the Minister for increasing the compensation amounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who spoke in this very constructive debate.  I say what I have said previously, that I am not happy with the progress of the disease eradication programme.  As I stated in my opening address, it has cost the taxpayers £750 million in present-day money values over the past 20 years.  That is a very considerable amount and far too excessive for an operation which has not been fully successful. Since testing began in 1954 the incidence of disease among cattle has decreased from 17 per cent to 0.2 per cent.  Last week I heard a radio commentator questioning that figure of 0.2 per cent but those are the statistics available to me from experts in my Department. That figure can be confused with the incidence of disease among herds which is a matter that is causing most concern. In 1983 the figure in question was estimated <Col N="1070" /> at 2.37 per cent.  That is a decrease as compared with 1982 when the figure was 2.76 per cent but it is an increase as compared with 1981 when the figure was 2.11 per cent.  The worrying aspect is that in the past two years there has been an increase in the number of herds affected as compared with the 1981 figure.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that no mercy will be shown to anyone who is seen to contravene the disease eradication scheme.  Repeatedly I have representations from members of the public or from public representatives on their behalf who have lost grants as a result of contravening the scheme.  I want to make it clear that if a person contravenes the rules of the scheme he will not be entitled to payment of any grant in connection with reactors in his herd.  If such a person is found guilty of moving reactors from the herd he will not get a grant and will be liable to the full rigours of the law.  He will not get any compensation whatever. If a person contravenes the regulations and thinks that by approaching a politician he can evade his responsibility and qualify for a grant he can forget about it. There will be no exceptions in any circumstances. We have to make that quite clear if we are to succeed in eliminating disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opening address I said eliminating residues of the disease has proved to be extremely difficult in all countries. Where only a tiny percentage is affected, much less than 1 per cent of the total herd, it has proved extremely difficult to get rid of such residues.  Every country in the EEC has a problem but our percentage is 2.37 and this is much too high.  We will have to look again at the whole situation. As I stated, I am reviewing the entire disease eradication programme because I am not happy it will succeed as constituted at present.  I am most interested in having research carried out to identify the sources of infection and we will go to considerable lengths to set up a programme to identify such sources. We have research facilities, considerably more than was stated in the debate today. I must pay tribute to the Animal Health Council who have done wonderful work in this area.  Senator Ferris is a member <Col N="1071" /> of that council and his knowledge of the situation is most extensive, as he has shown in his contribution.  He asked when the council would be reconvened to examine further the problem of disease eradication.  I am awaiting nominations from one of the farming bodies and when they are received we will be in a position to reconvene the council.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that sharp practice is involved in the disease eradication programme and it is much more prevalent than any of us would wish.  Rackets and rings are operating in the country for disposing of cattle from locked-up herds. There is tag-switching which is illegal. We must ensure that this sharp practice is eliminated and if that necessitates the formation of a task force to identify the sources it will be done.  I am considering that matter at the moment.  We do not just want to identify the people who are engaged in such rackets and who, as a result, are defeating the purpose of the scheme but we must also have an intensive programme to identify the source of disease in a herd, to trace back the animal to the original herd and thus identify the reason for the outbreak.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions have been put forward with regard to the cause of bovine TB.  Senator Ellis wondered if we were using the right vaccine.  Last week in the Dáil his constituency colleague, Deputy Leyden, said that the serum we were using was not the correct one.  I believe it is not referred to either as a vaccine or a serum &mdash; I think the proper technical name is tuberculin, as used in testing for TB.  It has also been suggested that badgers, foxes or goats may be responsible for transmitting the disease but this has not been proved definitely to be correct.  They are all possible sources for the transmission of the disease.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis maintained that we should be able to export infected animals but that is not acceptable.  It would be most unfair to countries to whom we export live animals to give them handpicked infected animals from our herds. It could ruin our export trade and I could not agree at all with the statement of the Senator.  We must be very careful about <Col N="1072" /> this matter.  As other Senators and I have pointed out already, our export beef trade is worth £800 million and we should not do anything to jeopardise it.  To risk losing that trade by deliberately exporting diseased animals would be most ill-advised.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey and Senator Ellis were critical of the introduction of the levies in connection with disease.  The correct word would be &ldquo;reintroduction&rdquo; because they were introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1979.  They were introduced at a rate double that which we are now bringing back.  The rate then was £3 a head for cattle and .5p per gallon of milk.  Taking inflation into account you can see that the effects of the levies at that time were considerably greater than those which we are introducing today.  I also wish to point out that farming was in the throes of a dreadful depression during the years 1979, 1980 and 1981.  Therefore, I do not see why any member of the Opposition can complain about a much less severe levy.</P>
    <P>Senator Ellis referred to it as a subtle way of taking money from farmers.  There is nothing subtle about it, it is straightforward and we are not making any excuses for doing so.  The disease eradication programme is costing this country £20 million per year, we have decreased expenditure on this programme from £30 million per year.  We are looking for £5 million to offset the cost of the scheme because it is unfair that the taxpayer should have to bear the whole burden.</P>
    <P>Several Senators mentioned the illegal movement of cattle and the proliferation of dirty lorries which are used for transporting them.  Such incidents should be reported immediately to the local district veterinary office.  Every citizen has a duty to do so, there is no point in passing the buck.  This disease will only be eradicated by wholehearted co-operation from all members of the public.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor repeated much of what Senator Ferris said in requesting further research facilities which would establish the cause of the disease.  The present research facilities at Abbotstown are considerable and we have plans to provide further facilities at that centre.  A <Col N="1073" /> number of Senators complained about the levels of compensation, in particular for small cattle.  That is a real problem to which I have no ready answer.  We did provide an extra £3 million in the current year to help increase the price paid for reactors.  That sum represented increases ranging from 41 per cent to 75 per cent on the previous prices paid for reactors. We have made considerable funds available in a very difficult financial climate and it has not been easy to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Hussey and a number of other Senators asked that the hardship fund should be replenished.  They will be glad to know that whereas in 1983 we provided £350,000 for that fund the Book of Estimates published last week provides £1 million for 1984.  We hope to be able to deal with any outstanding cases which are left over from 1983 in the first weeks of January.  Senator Hussey was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture for two and a half years and he has an appreciation of the problems that confront us regarding the eradication of disease. All are unanimous in their view that he was a courteous and hard-working Minister during his term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Seanad will be aware, the purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the merger of the Department of Transport and the residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs in a new Department of Communications.</P>
      <P>After the vesting date of An Bord Poist and of An Bord Telecom, only a certain number of residual functions will be left with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. It is these functions which it is proposed to amalgamate with those of the Minister for Transport in a new Department of Communications.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the Taoiseach announced the Government's intention of establishing this new Department when he made a formal statement in Dáil Éireann on 27 October last.  Senators, of course, will remember that on 11 December 1979 the then newly elected Taoiseach also signalled his intention of creating such a Department.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not in any way concerned with substantive policy matters on communications but I believe that this merging of existing departmental functions in a single new Department underlines the importance of communications.  Likewise this merger emphasises, in a practical way, the rational co-ordination, under the aegis of one Department, of all those functions relating to communications.</P>
      <P>This of course has also been highlighted in recent years by the very fact that in all Governments since 1979 the Transport and Posts and Telegraphs portfolios have been held by the same Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The residual functions of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs relate to the particular and specific areas covered by the various Telegraph Acts, the Telecommunications Capital Acts (1924-1981), the Betting Act of 1931 and the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.  They also include the functions <Col N="1075" /> provided for under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1972 and the Broadcasting Acts, 1960 to 1979.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provision for all the normal, technical and consequential changes arising out of the abolition of two Departments and the creation of a single new Department in their place.  It provides, for example, for the continuing legal validity of all outstanding contracts, bonds and securities following the abolition of the office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and likewise with the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>Section 13 enables the new Minister for Communications to spend and account for the moneys which, under the procedures of the Oireachtas, have to be provided in the name of the Ministers for Transport and Posts and Telegraphs.  In effect this section ensures that four-fifths of the sums appropriated in respect of the Departments of Transport and the Posts and Telegraphs in the financial year 1983 may be issued to, and spent and accounted for by the Minister for Communications during 1984.  Thus on the day that the office of the Minister for Communications is created it can spend moneys provided for the two abolished Departments until an Estimate for Communications is formally put through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Department of Transport is a comparative youngster and has a reputation for efficiency.  So have many other Departments but this Department more than others.  I have no doubt that the high standard of dedication and efficiency of the officials will be maintained in the new Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as being the logical <Col N="1076" /> consequence of the hard work put in by the officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in particular.  I do not want to name any of the officers, particularly some who bore very heavy burdens and some who retired in the meantime. I pay them a particular tribute, anonymously, according to the tradition of the House.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives us hope for an exciting future.  The children of the new Department have expressed their hopes for the future and we hope that the vision, the dream, will be realised because there is no doubt about the dedication of the chairman and the respective executives already appointed.</P>

      <P>The Appropriation Bill is brought before the Oireachtas each year to give statutory effect to the individual 1983 Estimates for the supply services, both non-capital and capital, including Supplementaries.</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill appropriates to the various services set out in the Schedule the sum of £5,682 million comprising the original Estimates totalling £5,605 milland and Supplementary Estimates of £77 million; it also authorises the use of certain departmental receipts as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This year's Appropriation Bill is the last to include major expenditures in respect of the day-to-day running costs of the postal and telecommunication services.  Next year with the vesting of these services in An Bord Telecom and An Post, which will, in effect, be new State-sponsored bodies, most of the expenditure formerly incurred by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will be transferred to the new bodies, and will not be reflected in the Exchequer accounts.  There will also, of course, be a reduction in Exchequer revenues with the income arising from the provision of postal, telecommunications and related services accruing directly to the new bodies rather than to the Exchequer, as at present.</P>

      <P>It is extremely important that the House be aware of the implications of these developments for the budgetary arithmetic &mdash; major changes in the Exchequer aggregates and budgetary balances will result.</P>
      <P>The effect of the changes on Exchequer finances for 1984 are best understood by adjusting the actual 1983 outturn to show the position which would have applied had vesting of the new bodies concerned gone ahead from the beginning of this year.  These adjustments show that the position would have been that the 1983 current budget deficit would have been increased by some £130 million and the Exchequer borrowing requirement by over £100 million.  As I indicated in the Dáil, the changes will be of an accounting nature only.  The public finances, overall, will be no better or worse.  Total public borrowing will not be increased by the change, only its distribution between the Exchequer and non-Exchequer bodies.</P>
      <P>The documentation for the 1984 budget will include data on what the 1983 outturn would have been if the new bodies had been vested at the start of this year.  This will facilitate a meaningful comparison of budgetary figures for 1983 and 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1983 expenditure on the supply services will be very close to the original budget targets.  A number of factors would have pushed the outturn significantly ahead of the budget provision.  The new public service pay agreement, payment of the double week to certain social welfare pensioners at Christmas and other additional social welfare costs falling on the Exchequer, including a shortfall in PRSI receipts, would between <Col N="1079" /> them have added over £100 million to the Government's target for the non-capital supply services.  But because of the action taken by the Government in July, the budget target for supply services expenditure will not be exceeded.  Clearly, the days when public expenditure was out of control are now past.  The Government are determined that expenditure will stay under control and that massive over-runs of the sort which occurred in 1980 and 1981 will not be repeated.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has a number of objectives, firstly, to raise the limit on the borrowing powers of Fóir Teoranta &mdash; the State rescue agency; secondly, to raise, in parallel, the limit on Exchequer advances to Fóir; thirdly, to increase the maximum number of directors of Fóir from seven to nine to enable direct ministerial representation on the board; fourthly, to discharge the company from the liability to repay about £10 million in Exchequer advances in respect of assistance given to companies which is now deemed to be irrecoverable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an enormous increase in Fóir's spending in recent years.  In 1981 Fóir spent £4.8 million.  In 1982 spending had grown to £14.1 million; this year's <Col N="1080" /> outturn is likely to be as high as £23 million; and £27 million has been allocated in the 1984 Public Capital Programme. All of this is a reflection of the recession which has had such a severe impact on our manufacturing sector over the past few years.  The legislation which fixed the present limits of £70 million on Fóir's borrowing powers and on Exchequer advances to Fóir was brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas two years ago.  At that time it was expected that the increased limits would suffice for four or five years.  Yet, in the period since then, Fóir's spending has accelerated to such an extent that the present statutory limits will very shortly be reached.  The primary purpose of this Bill is accordingly to increase these limits to enable Fóir's operations to continue without interruption.</P>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta were established in 1972 to provide finance for industrial concerns which might be in danger of going out of business because of inability to obtain their financial requirements from the normal commercial sources.  The criteria for Fóir's interventions are laid down in the 1972 Fóir Teoranta Act.  The employment content and the capital employed in companies seeking assistance must be significant either nationally or locally, and the owners must have made a reasonable contribution to the total capital. Furthermore, the company must demonstrate that their failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions at national or local level. Finally, and of greatest importance, the concern must have reasonable prospects of returning to profitability on a permanent basis.  To date, Fóir have assisted about 450 concerns, almost half of them on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>The period since the enactment of the last Fóir legislation in early 1982 has seen some major developments for the company. Upon their establishment, Fóir made an agreement with the Industrial Credit Company under which the ICC provided management services, including staff.  This agreement was terminated by mutual consent earlier this year.  The decision to terminate the agreement was taken by Fóir's board of directors in the <Col N="1081" /> context of a general reorganisation and expansion of the company to meet the increased demand for their services.  Fóir now have separate divisions dealing with new clients and with the monitoring of existing clients.  Their management executive unit has also been doubled in size. This is an especially significant development since management problems are generally regarded as a major cause of difficulties experienced by industrial concerns. Fóir, through their expanded management unit, are now much better equipped to probe management weaknesses in concerns requesting assistance, to advise on organisational and management changes required as a precondition to a financial rescue package, and to work closely with the concerns in carrying through these changes.</P>
    <P>Another important development has been Fóir's decision to discontinue publishing the names of their clients so as to enable their relationship with their clients to be on the same footing as that of other financial institutions.  The board of Fóir have emphasised the importance of this change in policy on several occasions both to me and to my predecessor.  They are satisfied that this decision has already had a beneficial effect in that it has made firms less reluctant to approach the company, thereby enabling Fóir to help them before their positions have become irretrievable. I am aware that there has been some adverse comment about the nondisclosure of the names of companies receiving financial assistance but if, as Fóir say, its effect has been to encourage more firms to seek assistance before it is too late, thereby saving badly-needed jobs, then I believe it will be seen as a positive development.</P>
    <P>There has always been close co-operation between Fóir and the Industrial Development Authority in rescue activity. Both agencies are conscious of the need at all times to strengthen and formalise this co-operation.  The chairmen and chief executives of both organisations meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of overall policy.  Earlier this year Fóir and the IDA negotiated liaison arrangements.  In general, Fóir take the lead where financial or other restructuring <Col N="1082" /> of an existing business concern is required, while the IDA are primarily responsible for takeover, joint venture and similar cases.  Over time, this agreement should increase the effectiveness of State assistance to industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will understand that, because of the nature of the company's operations and objectives, Fóir have a particularly difficult task.  We can all be satisfied, however, that Fóir carry out their functions conscientiously and that they consider applications for assistance thoroughly and with a full understanding of all the implications of their decisions.  I would like to pay a personal tribute to the board and staff of Fóir for the way in which they have carried out their task.  In 1982 alone, the board of Fóir approved assistance amounting to almost £23 million for 84 concerns employing almost 8,000 workers.  There was an even higher level of activity in 1983.  This clearly demonstrates the need for an agency of this kind particularly in today's difficult economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>Fóir's operations inevitably give rise to a cost to the Exchequer and to the taxpayer. At the end of 1982, Fóir had a cumulative deficit of almost £20 million. The costs of Fóir's operations are reflected in one of the provisions of this Bill which relieves the company of the liability to repay more than £10 million in Exchequer advances.  Similar provisions will arise in future Fóir legislation. The House will appreciate that this situation is an inevitable result of Fóir's role as a lender of last resort.  The cost would be higher but for Fóir's diligence in holding to its statutory criterion of helping only potentially viable firms.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for an increase in the maximum number of directors of Fóir from seven to nine.  The purpose of this proposal is to enable representatives of the Departments of Finance and of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to be appointed to the board.  The nature of Fóir's activities is such as to require close on-going contact with these Departments.  This close relationship is reflected already in the administrative arrangement, introduced <Col N="1083" /> on Fóir's establishment, under which the prior approval of the Ministers for Finance and for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is required before Fóir can provide assistance above a certain limit.  Because of Fóir's increased importance to industry and the resultant implications for both the Exchequer and industrial policy, it is now opportune to strengthen these contacts by placing Departmental representatives on the Fóir board.  I am confident that this provision will contribute further to the better co-ordination of assistance from public resources.</P>
    <P>It would be possible to accommodate Departmental representatives by reducing the number of directors from the business world.  Such a move would, however, deprive the board of some of the expertise of such directors whose practical experience has been invaluable to the company.  For that reason I consider that the alternative of increasing the size of the board is preferable.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this section, I would like to emphasise that this provision is not intended to &mdash; nor will it &mdash; reduce in any way the independence of Fóir's board.  Neither will there be any diminution of the board's capacity to deal quickly and effectively with the issues and cases coming before it &mdash; rather the reverse.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill, as I have said, is to raise the existing statutory limits of £70 million on Fóir's borrowings and on Exchequer advances to Fóir. These advances are Fóir's only source of borrowings.  Fóir's borrowings from the Exchequer now amount to more than £63 million.  Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide respectively that these limits be increased to £150 million.  For convenience, a technical change is being made in relation to the limits which has the effect of bringing the outstanding borrowings of £6.3 million which Fóir took over from their predecessor, Taiscí Stáit, within the overall borrowings and Exchequer advances ceilings for the first time.  It is relevant also to mention that section 5 of the Bill discharges the company from the liability to repay £10.24 million in <Col N="1084" /> Exchequer advances in respect of amounts which Fóir have formally written off in their accounts up to end-1982 and certain amounts which, although not formally written off, are now regarded as irrecoverable.  Taking account of these various provisions, the net effect of this Bill is to increase Fóir's borrowing capacity by about £84 million. This should be sufficient to meet the company's requirements for the next 3-4 years, particularly as the beneficial effects of the emerging improvement in the world economic situation are felt in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 are intended to make certain of Fóir's remuneration and superannuation arrangements subject to the approval of the Ministers for Finance and the Public Service.  The provisions are those generally applicable to commercial State bodies.  It is opportune to introduce these provisions for Fóir at this stage in view of the reorganisation of the company to which I have already referred. These provisions essentially put into a legislative framework powers which the Minister for Finance already has under Fóir's memorandum and articles of association.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, there is an administrative limit above which Fóir requires prior Ministerial approval before making funds available.  This limit was increased from £250,000 to £1 million following the enactment of the last Fóir legislation early in 1982.  I do not propose to increase this limit for the present.</P>
    <P>In summary, the purpose of this Bill is to enable Fóir Teoranta to continue their operations and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill and wish it a speedy passage.  My contribution will, therefore, be brief.  As the Minister has outlined, Fóir Teoranta are the State financial agency for industry and are the lender of last resort.  They have played an important role since their foundation but particularly in the past few years because the recession has been more severe and more prolonged than anybody anticipated.  The Bill is a reflection <Col N="1085" /> of the rapidly increasing demand for Fóir's services.</P>
      <P>I should like to spend a moment or two outlining the benefits that accrue to firms supported by Fóir.  The aided firms are assisted in the following way: the aid helps to preserve jobs; it saves money in redundancy payments; it saves money in social welfare payments; it contributes towards the balance of payments and it supports jobs in other sectors which supply the assisted firms with goods and services.  Given that Fóir Teoranta make a very thorough assessment of those companies which they propose to assist, it seems that the benefits which accrue following aid by Fóir Teoranta are viable on the cost-effectiveness criterion alone, leaving aside the important economic and social benefit of helping to preserve jobs.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to improved liaison arrangements between Fóir and the IDA.  There is always room for more and better co-ordination among State agencies, especially in a rescue operation.  It strikes me that there is room for improvement in the total State approach to co-ordination or rationalisation. On the one hand we may have Fóir Teoranta and the IDA closely liaising to help a company in temporary difficulty and on the other hand there may be very considerable pressure on the company from the Revenue Commissioners to pay arrears of taxes.</P>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta obviously perform a very valuable function, especially in periods of economic recession.  Their efforts, however, for some years have been hampered by the very short notice they receive from companies in difficulty. I was a member of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies which examined the affairs of Fóir Teoranta in 1981 and in their evidence executives of Fóir Teoranta underlined the endless efforts that managements make to conceal the fact that they are in difficulty.  I welcome the discontinuation of the publication of the names of companies which are being aided.  The problem of the late notice given to Fóir Teoranta is a continuing and worrying one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past Fóir Teoranta have had occasion to criticise severely the poor <Col N="1086" /> calibre of management and the bad industrial relations that obtained in firms seeking aid.  In the first instance there must be a commitment by the management of these firms to improve their management knowledge and their skills.  The educational and training institutions in the management field have an important role in remedying deficiencies in Irish management generally.  As a staff member of the UCD Business School I am glad to say that we have made a positive contribution to improving the knowledge, skills and attitudes of Irish managers through our under-graduate courses and, in particular, through our post-graduate courses.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to certain of Fóir's remuneration and superannuation arrangements being subject not only to the approval of the Minister for Finance but also the approval of the Minister for the Public Service.  I follow the logic of this development.  I am very glad to note the expansion in staff numbers in Fóir Teoranta to meet the greatly increased demands on their services.  In the same context, I must express serious concern about the recruitment embargo in the public service which is being continued for another 12 months.  This blanket embargo is a crude instrument.  Only a week ago when the House was discussing another Bill I had occasion to comment on the staffing level in CTT who at present are working 10 per cent under their official staff level.  This is so because of the one-in-three formula, whereby only one vacancy in three can be filled.  Would the Minister agree that the application of this formula in a blanket fashion is very rigid and inappropriate for certain employments?  Surely some form of priority should be devised whereby staffing arrangements, where justified, could be liberated from the blanket public service embargo.  I commend the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise for the large books in front of me.  This is because they are only available in that size.  They bear no relationship to the length of my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a source of some concern that the <Col N="1087" /> Fóir Teoranta (Amendment) Bill should be before us so soon after the 1982 legislation to which the Minister referred. As the Minister has said, it is a reflection of the difficult economic climate in which we find ourselves.  There are a number of other provisions in the Bill to which I would also refer.  First of all, the expansion of the number of ministerial representatives on State-sponsored bodies continues apace.  As I said before in this House, I am against that.  The Government are making a mistake in doing it and every time they bring before us legislation to increase the number of directors so as to allow for direct ministerial representation, I shall express my dissatisfaction. Direct ministerial representation is not a good idea.  It will inevitably destroy the independence of State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I well recognise that there has been and continues to be a problem of communication between State-sponsored bodies and the Department to which they owe their responsibility or allegience. That problem, in my opinion, is not properly met or dealt with by the appointment as directors of ministerial nominees who are civil servants.  There will be the inevitable consequence of that policy that these ministerial nominees will exercise a power of veto over the actions of the State-sponsored bodies.  I was a director of a State-sponsored body which had as directors excellent representatives of the Minister &mdash; that was the National Building Agency.  However, the directors of the National Building Agency who were civil servants had an exalted idea of their own importance relative to the remaining directors.  The executive of the agency paid more attention to what they said and over a period they acquired a quasi-veto over the operations of the National Building Agency because they were able to suggest &mdash; even in the most minor matters &mdash; that it was the wish of the Minister that certain things should be done.  That is all right because, of course, the civil servants appointed would be excellent people, but if anything goes wrong in those State-sponsored bodies the responsibility instead of resting as <Col N="1088" /> now with independent people who can be dismissed or changed by the Minister will rest with the civil servants and, through them, with the Minister.  The more control the Minister exercises over State-sponsored bodies, the more responsibility will be his if, at any time in the future, the wrong decision is taken.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the Minister would, in this and in other cases, re-examine the policy.  I will not be proposing an amendment to this Bill tonight but the policy as it applies to all State boards needs re-examination.  From my personal experience the ministerial representatives who are civil servants will acquire a position of dominance on those boards. In due course that position of dominance, even if it is never abused, will mean that the responsibility for any incorrect decision which the State-sponsored body might take, will rest with the Minister.  It may well be that, from time to time, civil servants are the best people to be appointed to an individual board and there is no reason why they should not be appointed.  However, the idea of direct ministerial appointment of civil servants within his Department or that of another Minister, by reason of the fact that they are civil servants within that Department, goes counter to the independence which is an essential part of our State-sponsored body structure.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is that during the course of the Second Stage debate on the Fóir Teoranta (Amendment) Bill, as it was in 1981, which was passed on 19 January 1982, I made a contribution at column 12, Volume 97 of the Official Report.  I stand over everything that I said then, but there is one aspect to which I would like to bring the attention of the House again. The Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies investigated Fóir Teoranta and reported in their 17th Report, which has already been referred to by Senator Hillery. This report was most valuable because it laid down and discussed criteria. During the course of the investigations and cross-examination which took place, Deputy Liam Lawlor inquired &mdash; beneficially in my opinion &mdash; as to the policy of the company concerning the <Col N="1089" /> taking up of share capital in Cerebos.  He got from the representatives of Fóir Teoranta the information that approximately 10 per cent of the advances which they were making were by way of share capital and that 90 per cent were by way of interest-free loans.  Any policy which is based on providing 90 per cent of the money which a company needs from a lender of last resort on an interest-bearing basis is bound to fail.</P>
    <P>Consider the position of a company which go to Fóir Teoranta.  Very often they are in an extremely serious position. They have of course to meet the criteria set down, including, for example, that failure to help them would have serious repercussions, either locally or nationally, and that, having been helped, they would have reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis.  But very often the capital base of these companies has been eroded completely by the time help is given by Fóir Teoranta and there is no shareholders' equity left at that stage.  Therefore, typically the company seeking assistance has gone through a few bad years and effectively has no shareholders' funds invested.  It is, therefore, in the same position financially as if it was starting afresh.</P>
    <P>What company can be considered viable if all its share capital is to bear interest? That is what is being done.  This company is being refinanced from a situation in which its shareholders' equity has been eroded.  Rather than, as would be the norm in a company of that size, insisting that a substantial portion of the initial investment would be by way of shareholdings and non-interest-bearing investment, in this case one is insisting that a company, in a similar position to one starting up, should be financed totally by interest-bearing capital.  By definition it cannot be viable.  By definition the situation is that that company has been trading for some time and there is none of the shareholders' equity left.  If money was invested in the normal proportions, of giving a debt equity ratio of 50:50, in those circumstances, there might be a good prospect of the success of that company. But what company can be prosperous <Col N="1090" /> when its capital base is made up totally of borrowed money?  In those circumstances very few companies can be viable.</P>
    <P>So that the House may understand, I might reiterate what is the position.  Very often in the case of such companies substantial money would have been invested in them by their promoters and substantial additional money may be invested by their promoters.  But very often, at the stage at which they get help from Fóir Teoranta, there is no shareholders' equity left.  Even if they put in more money it may be only to reduce the adverse balance there is in respect of the erosion of shareholders' funds.  Therefore, one is asking a company which has been trading for some time to continue to trade and service totally its financial requirements by way of interest-bearing loans.  That is not practicable.  When one says that a company must be viable, that does not really solve the problem.  A company may be viable if it gets a certain amount of money by way of non-interest-bearing capital and the remainder by way of interest-bearing loans.  But exactly the same company doing exactly the same job but being forced to take all of its finance from an interest-bearing source will not be viable at all.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the necessity is for a lot more of the money of Fóir Teoranta to be invested by way of shareholdings and a lot less by way of loans.  That gives rise to the situation in which, unfortunately, the State, indirectly, will be acquiring shareholdings in private companies to a greater and greater extent.  Unfortunately also that is one of the consequences of the type of society in which we live.  From time to time we may be able to divest these companies, as they prosper, of the State's proportion of their holding.  We should not be afraid to do that either.  But we should recognise that in countries such as France and, say, Italy &mdash; where such rescue operations have taken place &mdash; a substantial portion of such companies' industrial base is owned by holding companies which are themselves State-owned.  We should not be afraid of that; we should welcome it.  We should understand that it is a practicality <Col N="1091" /> in this day and age that this sort of thing should come about.</P>
    <P>I said on the last occasion, and I reiterate now in greater detail, that it is vital that the amount of investment by way of non-interest bearing shareholding which Fóir Teoranta would give to its applicants would increase dramatically from the 10 per cent it was on the occasion of the last debate we had on this matter in this House.  That is the second point I would bring to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to a company in which Fóir Teoranta were involved in Scarriff.  I made a similar reference on the last occasion, but it is a good example.  Fóir Teoranta got involved in the management of Scarriff some years ago and the company did not prosper.  I am not talking about the present situation because that matter has been discussed in the House already on a Matter on the Adjournment.  But it is true to say that the company did not prosper.  Probably also it is true to say that, given the type of processing equipment the company possessed, it would have been very difficult to make it prosper, and that investment in new machinery would have been an absolute prerequisite for a successful operation of a company like that in Scarriff in the future, which I sincerely hope will take place.  But Fóir Teoranta got involved in the management of that company and it was not successful.</P>
    <P>Imagine the pressure the Minister will be under in the future if a situation like that arises in which he has direct Ministerial representation on the board.  At the end of the day Fóir Teoranta around 1981 were able to extricate themselves from the situation in which they were managing the Scarriff company and handed on to another company which has since got into difficulty.  But at least there was some prospect of Fóir Teoranta getting out of that difficult situation in which they had been placed through force of circumstances.  I would emphasise to the Minister that that was possible at least partly by reason of the fact that there was a clear distinction drawn between Fóir <Col N="1092" /> Teoranta and the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the fact that our timber processing industry has been helped dramatically by Fóir Teoranta over the years, without any great degree of success, indeed without any success at all because successively, Clondalkin, Munster Chipboard, Scarriff and Irish Board Mills in Athy have all closed even though each had been helped by Fóir Teoranta.  Part of the reason they closed was occasioned by the problem of their paying interest on all the money they borrowed from Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>There is necessity for a re-examination of the use we make of our natural recources, like timber, to recognise that private individuals will be unable to run timber-processing plants when the State owns the forests.  In most other countries the private individuals own the forests and the State the processing plants.  For instance, that is what happens in Sweden &mdash; which we might regard as a very socialist country &mdash; where the private individuals own the vast majority of the forests and the State, directly or indirectly, owns the processing companies.  That is where our problem has arisen, in that we own the forests, the profitable end, and we expect private industry to look after the processing which it is physically incapable of doing.  In the United States of America, in North America in general, the same companies own the processing plants and forests, and one subsidises the other.  Always the forests must subsidise the processing end.  That has been the reality of producing the timber-based products in Ireland over the years.</P>
    <P>The decision to raise the amount of money under this Bill which the company may borrow from £70 million to £150 million has the full support of this side of the House.  The Bill in general has our full support, subject to the various problems I have mentioned and to which I hope the Minister will refer in replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief on this very important Bill.  As has been said by others a similar Bill was before the House almost two years ago which received the full support of the <Col N="1093" /> House.  This Bill has my support and that of my party.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that we have had a Bill like this so soon after the 1981 Bill, for the obvious reason that we are going through very difficult economic times, times when companies are finding life extremely difficult.  It is totally understandable that they should seek rescue at this point.  Many of them would have gone long ago but for the concern and the diligence of Fóir Teoranta.  I congratulate them on the very good work they are performing.  At the same time, I wonder about the possibility of an extension of the activities of Fóir Teoranta.  The taxpayers are paying for a plethora of agencies for the training of young people and middle-aged people for short-term jobs and for long-term jobs, jobs that I regret very much are just not available. In other words, there is ample training but no jobs at the end of the day.  I am sure taxpayers would not mind contributing to an extension of the activities of Fóir Teoranta.  I am certain they would not mind an extra 1 or 2 per cent deduction from pay in order to help ailing industries, not just the manufacturing kind but the building and catering industries.</P>
      <P>We have the example of the recent case of the PMPA insurance group whose customers and the customers of every other insurance company in the country, whether they be motor, fire or public liability insurance, are contributing 2 per cent on their premiums for a fund to help out the PMPA.  Perhaps we could ask the people to contribute towards an extension of the activities of Fóir Teoranta, to enable them to rescue all ailing industries. In the absence of a strategy for jobs for our young people I am confident that the people would rally to save jobs in a magnificent way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the section dealing with the increase in the number of board members from seven to nine, I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Leary. The existing board members, who we have all said are doing a good job, might feel that in some way their powers were being taken from them, that there was a lack of confidence in them and that <Col N="1094" /> people were being put in to watch them. I have nothing against the extension of the board from seven to nine but I would prefer that it would consist of people who have been tried and trusted, people who have been in the business community all their lives and who understand the problems of that area.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the passage of this legislation any longer.  It has my support but it is very regrettable that we should be coming back looking for this increase in borrowing for Fóir Teoranta. My hope would be that the Minister, if he could see his way to extending the powers of the operations of Fóir Teoranta, would do so.  Fóir Teoranta will continue to be an important organisation in the life of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>In accepting that Fóir Teoranta are doing an excellent job in this difficult time, when firms are getting into difficulties, I want to deal with one specific part of their business which arises from a case I know of in Carlow.  Keenans of Bagenalstown who were a very important firm have gone out of business.  They were in farming machinery and structural steel.  Fóir Teoranta carried out an investigation into this firm and decided they merited a loan of £450,000, that that amount would make them viable and bring them into a position where they could carry on until times were better. For some strange reason, and I am going only on what I hear from workers and from other people in Bagenalstown, the banks decided that when they had Fóir Teoranta money they would change their system of financing the firm.  As a result, the workers who had worked their normal week and gone in and cashed their cheques found that the people who cashed them were without money because the bank did not honour the cheques.  Their week's work was gone and the business people in the town were short of the money they had given out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it a contradiction that Fóir Teoranta can go into a firm, do an assessment on them, obviously know what arrangement they have with the banks, and then it appears that the bank can do its own Houdini-type act, bail itself out, <Col N="1095" /> even though in this case they did not use the £450,000 that was given by Fóir Teoranta &mdash; £250,000 was the amount used.  It is a cause of concern that public money that is paid by taxpayers can be pumped into a company while all it is really doing is not to keep the company going, not to help the workers, but to save a bank from fulfilling their commitments. This is something that is causing a lot of unease.  I should like to know if banks are in that position, if they do that and if they can, should Fóir Teoranta not see to it that they cannot be left high and dry?  Instead of making a company viable this action just causes further debts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill and to welcome the Minister.  There is one small point which I came across recently where a small private company were hit with two or three bad debts to its unit to the extent of £24,000.  At that stage they reached the limit of their facilities with the bank and their lending agents closed on them.  There is a lower limit inside the company and a volume that the Fóir Teoranta company support but perhaps it would be possible for the Minister, in co-operation with the IDA, to facilitate companies that are viable and are working well but due to bad debts are being forced out of the market through depriving them of liquidity.  There should be some way of coming to their rescue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much appreciate the fact that it would be unreasonable to expect the rescue company, Fóir Teoranta, to be in a position to start processing applications from every small operator in the country. We do not expect that.  I have great faith in the IDA.  They service the small industrialist to a tremendous degree.  It is through that medium that we are going to pick up the extra jobs in every parish that are needed to turn around the economy.  In hard luck cases where the hard work of the individual industrialist is without question, where his business has been viable and where he is hit by external factors like that, I would ask the Minister to look sympathetically at the legislation and see, in co-operation with the IDA, if they could come to the rescue <Col N="1096" /> of people in such unfortunate circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Members of the House for the generally positive attitude they have taken in regard to this Bill.  There has been a wide recognition of the necessity for the main provisions of the Bill which are designed to ensure that Fóir Teoranta can keep their operations going and continue to perform the valuable function which they have done for quite a number of years.  The benefits of Fóir's operations are evident to all of us, not least to those who work in firms now being assisted by Fóir and firms who have turned the corner as a result of the operations of Fóir.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with some points relating to specific sections of the Bill.  The first, mentioned by Senator Hillery, is the problem of the short notice often given to Fóir in applications made by firms. This is, obviously, a very difficult problem. The later it is left &mdash; I agree with Senator Hillery on this &mdash; the more difficult it is for Fóir Teoranta to put together a package of assistance within the kind of time scale that is required in order to face up to the difficulties of the firm.  One suspects, although it is always difficult to prove, that there are a number of cases of firms that have gone into receivership or liquidation that could have been saved had they made an earlier approach to Fóir Teoranta As stated by Senator Hillery, the discontinuation of the publication of clients' names should help in that respect.  We have all heard of instances of where the management of firms in difficulty began to think in terms of approaching Fóir Teoranta and somehow the word got out to another lending agency.  The management then found to its disappointment and regret that the other lending agency once it heard of an approach to Fóir would immediately begin to close down and call in its loans. That should not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of suggestions have been made in other respects that are intended to help to bring firms with difficulties to Fóir at an earlier stage.  Some of these suggestions seem to be impractical.  For example, it has been suggested that we <Col N="1097" /> should consider having some procedure under which the Revenue Commissioners, who are in a position to know fairly often when a firm is heading for difficulties, should alert either the firm or its lending agency that there is trouble ahead.  I do not think, and Members of the House will agree, that that is a practical option.  The Revenue Commissioners have to maintain absolute confidentiality in their dealings with taxpayers, whether they are firms or private individuals.  It would be improper for the Revenue Commissioners to give notice to other concerned agencies that a problem is arising.  We should look at that procedure the other way round and urge people in business who are beginning to have problems meeting their commitments in relation to payment of taxes, remittances of PAYE, PRSI and VAT to immediately begin to think at that stage of what corrective measures can be taken.  That is without prejudice to the position of the Revenue Commissioners. If a firm finds its cashflow under strain to the point when difficulties are appearing on the tax side, then surely it is time to begin thinking about what is needed in order to overcome that problem.  There is a great deal that management of firms could do in order to have cases considered by Fóir at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Hillery also raised the question of reference in the Bill to certain conditions relating to remuneration and superannuation now being brought forward statutorily for approval by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service.  He used that to embark on a wider discourse on the general embargo in the public service.  I do not intend to follow Senator Hillery all the way down that road but I wish to make the point that we did provide earlier this year, when Fóir Teoranta and the ICC parted amicably, for the extra staff that Fóir Teoranta needed in order to carry out their operations as fully and efficiently as possible.  Fóir are well in on the process of taking on the extra staff that were provided for on that occasion. Indeed, the staffing was necessary in order to enable Fóir as an independent body to carry out the job we wished them <Col N="1098" /> to do and which Members of this House have congratulated them for doing.  The recruitment embargo in the public service is not, as Senator Hillery seems to think, rigid and it does not produce inappropriate situations in many cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a point to the Senator.  I know he is impatient to make a more blanket point than that.  In the recent past we have taken measures to ensure that we increase the amount of staffing available in the Revenue Commissioners and in the Department of Social Welfare, to name only two cases. We made provisions to make extra staff available in those areas because we believed it was more important to apply staff and staff resources in those areas than in certain other areas of the Civil Service.  Senator Hillery can take comfort from the knowledge that the consequences of that necessary embargo in relation to public service numbers are not absolute inappropriate rigidity in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary raised his opposition to the appointment of Ministerial representatives on State-sponsored bodies.  At the moment there are already Departmental representatives on the boards of seven of the 22 commercial State bodies and 24 of the 36 major non-commercial State bodies.  Many of them existed before Senator O'Leary would have dreamed of objecting.  The point he makes is a valid concern but, on the other hand, there is another concern to which we must pay some attention.  Much of Senator O'Leary's concern may arise from the fear of what might happen if something goes wrong.  He stated this clearly.  He said that in the event of the wrong decision being taken, the Minister can be held to be responsible for that decision.  On the other hand, there is the positive side to look at.  We have to make sure that the wrong decision is not taken. To the extent that an extra input from a Departmental or Ministerial side can round off the consideration by the board of the particular problems with which it <Col N="1099" /> has to deal, we can try to insure that the wrong decision is not made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We will never know until we find out.  In the time at our disposal we will probably have to conduct some of this discussion on the basis of contention and assertion as the House has so kindly chosen to do rather than a more analytical argument.  In the specific case of Fóir Teoranta there is a situation where the amount of funding being channelled through Fóir has expanded very substantially in recent years.  There is an obvious Exchequer interest in ensuring that funds are being applied for the purposes for which the Act makes them available and are being applied in a way that gets the maximum benefit for the people who are being assisted with the greatest degree of efficiency from the Exchequer point of view.  This proposal is perfectly in keeping with other provisions of the existing legislation which require, for example, that where the assistance proposed to be given by Fóir exceeds a certain level the decision would require the prior sanction of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Finance.  I am not saying that there is no foundation for Senator O'Leary's fear.  I appreciate that there is another point of view, and on balance my considered opinion is that the proposal we have in the Bill is the more appropriate way to go about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it very clear that in making this proposal it is not my concern, as Senator Fallon seems to think, in any way to reduce the powers of existing board members or to give them the impression that they are being watched, or to reduce their idependence or to give them a feeling of insecurity.  It is quite the contrary.  I want to ensure that the board members, when making decisions, can be even more assured than they are now that all elements relevant to decisions will be brought to their attention so that they can be more confident about <Col N="1100" /> their decisions.  That is why I have chosen to bring about this representation by additions to the board rather than by replacing any of those now on the board who have given such sterling service to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary made some remarks about the way in which assistance is made available by Fóir to companies in difficulties. In illustrating his point he took the extreme case which, I suggest, is an expository device frequently used by the Senator.  The 1972 Act allows for a degree of latitude in deciding which is the appropriate way to make assistance available. The particular categories are put together by Fóir, case by case, as seems most appropriate to the case in question. When Fóir make loans to companies, frequently a moratorium on interest payments is part of the package.  The general intention in cases like that is that once a company return to profitability they begin to make interest payments.</P>
    <P>Fóir have power under the 1972 Act to take out shareholdings and those shareholdings are in the form of redeemable preference shares, something which corresponds to the concern voiced by Senator O'Leary.  In quite a number of cases Fóir have chosen this road &mdash; there are individual examples that could be given but I do not think this is the proper place to give them.  At the end of 1982 preference shareholdings amounted to about 20 per cent of the outstanding balance of Fóir's assistance to firms at that time.  It is a road open to Fóir Teoranta, and it is taken by them in cases in which it seems to be the more appropriate way to go about assisting firms in difficulties.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon asked about the possibility of widening Fóir's remit to include other sectors.  The first point I would make on that is that Fóir already have quite enough to do in regard to the remit they now have under statute.  I refer Senator Fallon to the figures I have given to the expansion of the level of Fóir's activities in recent years.  To add sectors of a different kind necessarily would complicate that, although that in itself would not be a sufficient argument for not doing it.</P>
    <P>Some of the other sectors to which he <Col N="1101" /> referred are ones in which there would be difficulties in applying the kind of criteria which Fóir apply in their present activities, that is, the return to profitability, the development of viability in a firm, and there are some sectors in which it would be very difficult to compose a kind of package that would be parallel to the kind of packages that Fóir now put together.  In spite of the expansion in staff that we provided this year for Fóir, they would not now have the capacity to widen their remit.  The staff expansion this year was designed deliberately on the basis of Fóir's existing remit.  We have given them the staff necessary, as far as we have been able, to carry that out.  They have concentrated, obviously, on the industrial sector, and a further expansion in their activities would require us to go to look for people with experience of or insight into the other sectors involved.  I do not think that is a road we should follow, particularly because there are other measures that have been taken in relation to other sectors to alleviate the difficulties they have had.</P>
    <P>Finally I would refer to a remark by Senator Browne.  I think he will understand that I would not now wish to discuss particular or individual cases.  I should like to tell Senator MacDonald that, in the kind of circumstances he described, the problems of small firms in difficulties, firms who are being forced out of business by bad debts, that is outside the remit of Fóir, but we can look at other mechanisms for assisting firms who are having such difficulties.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is more a job for the credit institutions in the first instance than for any State agency, and it would depend on the kind of commercial judgments that credit institutions are able to make in regard to any likelihood of getting debtors to pay up and the likelihood of the firms in question being able to stay in business until such time as the debtors pay.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their positive approach to the Bill.  I joint with them in expressing regret for having this kind of measure in the first place.</P>

      <P>This also applies to subsection (2) &mdash; I have been referring to subsection (1).  Is the Minister happy that subsection (1) as drafted achieves that? Section 4 of the 1973 Act, as I understand it, does not wipe out the debt &mdash; it just provides that the company shall be liable to repay advances made by the Minister. Does the provision still remain as an advance by the Minister, even though the company are not liable to repay it? Between 1973 and the present time, how has the £1.142 million which the company had the duty to repay been taken into account?  Is it now noted as a non-repayable advance from the Minister or is it written off?  How is it dealt with in the accounts of Fóir Teoranta?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand now.  I have no difficulty with the actual drafting of the subsection.  If the £1,142 million has disappeared from the accounts, obviously the £2,160 million will be an additional £2,160 million, but it appears to me that that is not what the subsection says or, indeed, what section 4 in the 1973 Act said.  It did not say that.  It did not say they shall be written off.  It merely said that the company shall be liable to repay.  That does not mean that it should disappear.  The company could have got from the Minister money which they had no responsibility to repay, but would still have to be shown in their accounts.  In other words, there is no indication that the money should be written off.  I am concerned, in respect of both of these amounts, that if they are taken out of the accounts of the company that that is not strictly in accordance with what the decision of the Oireachtas was, which appeared merely that they would not have to be repaid to the Minister, not that they should be written off.  I am making no suggestion of an amendment to the legislation but bringing it to the attention of the Minister for his consideration.</P>

Under the provisions of that legislation those advances were repayable.

I do not want the Minister to answer it specifically because I understand the case of one company.

Of course, Fóir Teoranta have no control over what the subsequent conduct of other creditors will be.</P>
