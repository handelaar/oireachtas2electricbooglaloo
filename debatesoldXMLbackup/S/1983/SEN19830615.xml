      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take items Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 9, in that order, and, if necessary, to interrupt the business at 5 p.m. to take No. 9 if it has not been reached earlier.  I might say for the benefit of Members that it is not proposed to meet tomorrow but it is proposed to meet next Wednesday in order to take the Bills not dealt with today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we reach item No. 7?  This matter has been raised on two occasions.  There are many very urgent matters going through the EEC at present and because we have not yet got the Joint Committee on EEC Secondary Legislation established this seems to be the only forum where we can discuss the matters which are going through the European Parliament.  Unfortunately, we do not seem to be getting any nearer reaching that item which is of great importance to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Lanigan in his request that we would as quickly as possible establish this Joint Committee.  As a former member of that Joint Committee, I can say that not only does the difficulty refer to work piling up but there is the further problem that derives from that of finding a space in the Oireachtas schedule to discuss the reports of the committee.  I wholeheartedly share the Senator's concern that we establish the committee as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join Senators Lanigan and Higgins in pressing that this Joint Committee be established as quickly as possible.  I am an ex-member <Col N="4" /> of this Joint Committee and there is no doubt that the work to be done by it is of vital importance because this kind of secondary legislation from Europe does affect us very greatly in all aspects of our social and economic lives.  It seems very much to be regretted that we have not got any mechanism to deal with it at all in the Oireachtas at the moment, whether by discussing the reports or through the Joint Committee.  I suggest that item No. 7 should be taken quickly but also that we press ahead immediately to set up the Joint Committee.  I feel sure that the Leader of the House agrees with me in this but perhaps he would put it across even more strongly to the Government that this is something that needs to be done as a first priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House tell us when item No. 14 will be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to item No. 7. the question of the discussion in the House of matters relating to the European Economic Community.  There are two questions here.  Firstly, the formation of the Joint Committee on secondary legislation, its reporting to the House and a debate in the House on its report.  Secondly, the discussion of the two six-monthly reports submitted to the House by the Government which have not yet been debated in the House.  In regard to the first item, the House has done all it can do.  The expediency motion has been passed here and until we have a motion passed in another place carrying the stage a step further we will not act. As soon as this returns to us from that other place we will establish this Joint Committee.  I might say that it is not in this House that there have been delays in regard to the establishment of the Joint Committee and it is not due to any action or inaction on the part of the Government. The delays in establishing the committee system have come from elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of debating item No. 7, I am delighted that this should have come up.  The Leader of the House is usually criticised because he is, in fact, giving preference to Government <Col N="5" /> business over Private Members' business. The reason that No. 7 is not being discussed today is because my proposal for business today gives preference to Private Members' business.  I proposed that we take item No. 9.  There has not yet been in this session of the Seanad a motion in Private Members' time moved on behalf of the Independent group.  We are now proposing to do that today.  It is a matter for the House and, if the House wishes this motion to be put down in place of Private Members' business next Wednesday, I will endeavour to see if either the Minister, or the Minister of State, will be available to attend.</P>
    <P>In regard to item No. 14, I have been asked when will this be taken.  I have to give the answer in regard to this that I gave before in regard to similar requests for information.  It will be taken, firstly, when the turn of the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad comes in Private Members' time and when the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad decide that this is their priority motion.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1983  [  Certified Money Bill ]:   Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to raise the statutory ceiling on total issues from the Local Loans Fund from its present level of £2,500 million to a new level of £3,500 million.  Total issues to date are £2,300 million, leaving only £200 million available within the margin. At the present rate of issue this margin may be exhausted by late summer or early autumn of this year.  It has therefore become necessary to raise the limit so as to make provision for future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Raising the limit on loan issues does not of itself have any implications for the size of allocations for the various services financed by the Local Loans Fund.  These allocations are fixed annually by Government decision in the context of the Public Capital Programme.  The Local Loans Fund merely provides a channel through <Col N="6" /> which the approved allocations may be transmitted to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Local Loans Fund was established in 1935 as a facility for providing loan capital to local authorities.  The main services it finances are local authority housing and sanitary schemes.  It also makes funds available for house purchase loans.  The fund is also the channel for the Exchequer contribution to fire services, swimming pools, and itinerant settlement, as well as courthouses and harbour works.  Until recent years loans were also provided from the fund for capital works at second level vocational schools and for certain categories of hospital. These services are now financed fully by direct grant through the Votes for Post-Primary Education and Health respectively.</P>
    <P>Of the advances made annually from the fund, by far the biggest share goes to local authority housing and sanitary services.  In 1982 total advances amounted to £386 million.  Of this total £186 million was allocated to local authority housing and £82 million to water and sewerage schemes.  The corresponding allocations in 1983 are £208 million and £97 million respectively, out of estimated total issues of £377 million.</P>
    <P>Loans from the fund are repayable on an annuity basis.  The normal repayment period is between 25 and 35 years, varying from service to service.  In practice the Exchequer meets a very large proportion of the loan charges, principal and interest, on advances from the fund. Repayments on local authority housing loans are fully subsidised by the Exchequer and sanitary services loans attract subsidies of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent.  In 1983 the subsidies for housing and sanitary service loan repayments amount to £128 million and £29 million respectively.  Certain minor services are also subsidised fully or partially.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will have noted that total estimated issues from the fund in 1983 are slightly down on the 1982 aggregate.  This reduction is due to a shift in the relative weights of SDA loans and Housing Finance Agency loans in the State's mortgage finance programme and does not represent a reduction in State <Col N="7" /> support for the services involved.  House purchase loans &mdash; that is the SDA loans &mdash; are financed mainly from the Local Loans Fund, while the HFA obtains its funds directly from its own bond issues. The allocation for SDA loans and supplementary grants in the current year is £64 million, to be supplemented by an additional £16 million from local authorities' internal revenue, mainly from the sale of local authority houses.  This represents a reduction on the £93.3 million provided in 1982, but this reduction is more than offset by the increase in the level of mortgage finance being provided by the Housing Finance Agency.  The HFA made £15.6 million available last year, whereas this year's estimate stands at £50 million.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Bill is simply an enabling measure providing the statutory machinery for channelling loan capital allocations to local authorities. The Local Loans Fund does not itself specify allocations for services.  The limit on issues is raised from time to time as required.  When the fund was established in 1935 the limit was fixed at £5 million. Over the years it has been increased 16 times.  The last occasion was in 1980 when it was set at its present level of £2,500 million.  I would expect that the new limit of £3,500 million should meet requirements over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Finance back again.  I will be putting some questions that relate to his Department in connection with housing loans and the limitation on them.  I am glad the Minister is present because it is from his Department will spring all the finances necessary for the servicing of SDA loans and, indeed, other loans.  I have no doubt that the Minister will answer some of the questions I will be putting later.  There has been a considerable drop in the number of people being approved for loans over the last three years.  Indeed, there is a necessity now to examine the income ceiling under which a married couple can qualify for an SDA <Col N="8" /> loan.  The limit is £7,000 and has been that figure for many years.  We have heard of all the legislation that will be coming through to meet the requirements of the day and I suggest to the Minister that the £7,000 limit which is the aggregate for a man and his wife to qualify for an SDA loan is much out-dated.  It behoves the Minister to raise that ceiling or ensure that the Minister for the Environment does so.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance should provide the money for the servicing of applicants who are denied a loan because of that ceiling of £7,000.  The number of loans approved in the year 1980 was in the region of 10,381.  That dropped in 1981 to 8,971 and there was a further drop in 1982 to 7,595.  That continuous drop in the number of people approved is because of the low income ceiling.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that criticism which is running high in all local authorities at present.  With the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance should look at that with a view to increasing that ceiling to at least £10,000 or £12,000.  That would bring in a number of people who wish to choose their own type of house, look after their own financing and build their own home. The Minister is debarring people from doing that with the income ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard talk about the £14,000 loan.  That also is out of date because the value of houses has increased considerably between 1980 and 1982.  The value of houses serviced by the SDA loans was £20,903 in 1980 and that rose to £26,300 in 1982.  That has widened the gap as between the SDA loan of £14,000 and the amount required to finance the building of one's home.  A considerable gap has occurred as a result of inflation and the rise in the cost of housing.  We now require something in the region of £12,300 to bridge that gap between £14,000 and £26,300.  That also is out-dated and an additional increase in SDA loans is necessary so that people can build their houses.  The bridging loan they have to get from a bank is at a very high premium.  In some cases the building of a house can take between 12 and 18 months depending on the type of contractor <Col N="9" /> and on the family who choose to build their own house.  There is a long time span from the date of application until the time one gets the £14,000 loan and it is necessary to get a bridging loan to continue the building or all will come to a standstill.  The Minister should look at that area of increasing the loan.  I know his answer will be that there is a Housing Finance Agency loan and people can receive up to £22,000 while selected local government applicants can get in the region of £26,000.  I have read a document from the Housing Finance Agency and it appalled me.  Over a period of years children of those who avail of loans from that agency will have paid something in the region of £250,000 on a £26,000 loan.  I referred to that in the Seanad and I was not contradicted.  The appalling document from the Housing Finance Agency tries to justify the use of a loan from that agency.  In County Mayo the number approved about a month ago was just five.  I have tried to discourage people from applying for this loan because I do not think it is attractive.</P>
    <P>The document submitted by the Housing Finance Agency is to try to encourage people to apply for these loans.  In the twenty-fifth year of a £20,000 loan one will be paying in the region of £915 per month according to their figures.  That is a disgraceful situation.  In the first year of the loan the monthly payment is £112 but there is a continuous rise from that amount to £915 in the twenty-fifth year.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of that loan which I do not agree with.  They are not realistic.  It is a loan designed for a man who is trying to move out as fast as he can get his house built and leave somebody else to carry the can in the future. I appeal to the Minister to increase the SDA loan, a very attractive and popular loan.  I welcome the Bill in that it is an enabling piece of legislation to provide additional moneys for local authorities but the income ceiling of £7,000 and the amount of loan that can be obtained, £14,000, are not adequate to meet the requirements of the day.  They are out-dated and anything the Minister can do to increase the income ceiling and increase the amount of the loans would <Col N="10" /> be welcome.  Young couples intending to get married today and anxious to avail of this loan would be delighted with this news.  The Minister, when replying, should deal with the income ceiling and the loan of £14,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an enabling one to allow the continued operation of the Local Loans Fund when its present limit of £2,500 million has been exceeded during the course of this financial year.  It is because of that and the underlying support which we have pleasure in giving the policies being pursued by the Government that I am glad to support the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult type of Bill to deal with on Second Stage.  That difficulty is shared by the Minister and the Fianna Fáil spokesman because of the detail into which one can go in regard to the actual details of the use to which the money is put.  It is very difficult to say what function the Department of Finance have in that area and what function the Department of the Environment have in raising the various limits.  I have considerable sympathy with many of the points made by the Fianna Fáil spokesman in this regard.  There are appropriate times to consider some of the more general issues involved rather than just the particular issues.  A number of them have been referred to by the Opposition spokesman and it is fair that they should be responded to and that one or two thoughts of our own should be added so that the Minister gets a flavour of the views of the House with regard to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the most popular scheme operated by any Government was the SDA loan scheme.  Of course, there is a good reason for that, it is great value for money.  By and large over the years those people who have borrowed under the SDA scheme have got great value for money.  That is true in respect of people who were fortunate enough to borrow under the SDA scheme, through the auspices of the Local Loans Fund, at times when interest rates were low.  It is because of the fixed nature of the commitment being entered into by those who <Col N="11" /> take up the SDA loans that they are fortunate in that regard.  There are many people who are fortunate enough to have money at 3 per cent, 4 per cent or 5 per cent.  It is obvious that the fixed nature of the commitment which people enter into is very attractive.  When interest rates are high and, in particular, should the SDA interest rate reflect the real rate of interest being paid by the Government, then loans under that scheme would be considerably less attractive.  There lies the problem.  The expansion of the scheme, and the absorption of a greater percentage of the mortgage market by the Government, must inevitably mean dearer loans for those who are borrowing under that scheme.  The attractions of the SDA scheme would be considerably reduced particularly when one bears in mind that borrowings made now at a fixed rate of interest, at a relatively high rate of interest, will not reduce in years to come when and if inflation reduces and interest rates reduce accordingly.  Those borrowing large amounts of money now at the present rates of interest might find themselves at a relative disadvantage in years to come if inflation and, consequently, interest rates fall.</P>
    <P>I confidently expect that not only in Ireland but throughout the western world interest rates will fall dramatically over the next few years.  Inflation rates have already fallen in most countries.  They are falling very rapidly here at the moment. In the United Kingdom, for instance, where statistics are produced on a monthly basis, they have shown the result of their internal policies but, more importantly, of the international monetary situation. Inflation has dropped dramatically, but interest rates have not dropped as dramatically.  As a result of that a very severe interest rate is payable in respect of borrowings in low inflation countries.</P>
    <P>As we move progressively from a relatively high inflation rate to a lower inflation rate we will find a situation where those who have borrowed at a fixed interest rate will be very severely dealt with.  If there was no inflation rate here over the next three or four years, or only inflation <Col N="12" /> of 3, 4 or 5 per cent, those who borrowed money at 12 per cent will be paying a very substantial rate of real interest.  That is where the problem arises with regard to expansion of the SDA loan scheme.  The Housing Finance Agency being promoted by the Government, as a result of their last and present terms of office, as Senator O'Toole said, has been largely misunderstood.  If there is no inflation there is no reason why repayments under the Housing Finance Agency should increase.</P>
    <P>It is only because inflation has been a permanent feature of our economy over the last few decades that the problems arise whereby an increase is to be expected in respect of repayments people will make under a Housing Finance Agency loan in years to come.  It is unnecessarily frightening to tell people that they will be paying a certain substantial sum of money in 25 years time unless one takes into account the inflation that has taken place in the meantime.  Nobody minds paying a substantial amount of money if, as a result of inflation or as a result of progress to increase income, the average level of income has been increased substantially.  A simple pointing out of what one would pay to the Housing Finance Agency after a period of 20 years does not tell the full story. The attractions of this kind of a loan for people who otherwise are not in a position at all to buy their own property are considerable.</P>
    <P>The Local Loans Fund, of course, does more than provide money for house loans.  A substantial portion of the money goes towards the provision of sanitary services throughout the country.  It is fair to say that the amount of money which has been devoted to the increased provision of sanitary services in the Dublin area is not attractive to those coming from my part of the country and those from outside the greater Dublin area.  We do not find the growth of population of Dublin attractive.  It is economically over-balancing the country towards the eastern seaboard and towards the greater Dublin area, in particular.</P>
    <P>Many of the services provided in the Dublin area are as a result of a strategic <Col N="13" /> policy which is not to have any policy at all.  Strategic planning has been to provide the services not where we think they should be provided but where a demand arises because of some short-term local whim.  The problem that has arisen with regard to that in Dublin is that too much of the resources of the country have gone into providing sanitary accommodation for the expansion of the Dublin area at its periphery.</P>
    <P>Too little of our attention and strategic thought have been devoted to the solution of the problem of what is being done to the inner heart of that city and indeed the inner heart of the city of Cork where I come from.  Much of our strategic thought on the amount of money for sanitation accommodation and where it should be spent needs to follow on a fundamental re-examination of where we want the people to live in years to come.</P>
    <P>Our policy should be directed towards a prosperous Dublin and a stable society within the greater Dublin area but not towards a situation where the young people, the most intelligent and the most articulate people, are being drawn from the countryside to the greater Dublin area.  That is a bad thing and something which we should minimise.  We will never eliminate it because the way of the modern world is that people are drawn towards the metropolitan areas.  The Local Loans Fund is an appropriate instrument and the Minister for Finance is the appropriate person to take the strategic decisions which are necessary to ensure the balanced growth of the country through the allocation of sanitary service funds in a fashion which will lead to a balanced and healthy society.  The physical planning aspect of the allocation of money to local authorities has not received the proper attention not only from the Minister for Finance but from the Government as a whole.  It should be understood that such a fundamental reappraisal of where we are going in this country is an essential part of the job of Government over the next few years. Accepting that nothing is ever exactly as one wants it to be the proposal to raise the level from £2,500 million to £3,500 million should have our support.  It has <Col N="14" /> the support of the Fine Gael Members on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill.  The only regret I have is that while we seem to keep on increasing the amount of money which can be diverted, in this instance to the local authorities, the actual outturn in terms of housing development and in terms of sanitary facilities as referred to by Senator O'Leary is that these schemes, in effect, are slowing down quite considerably.  I am worried that in making provision for financial contributions of this order in some way we are not able to get the benefit for the total community that, in fact, we should.</P>
      <P>Most of the points in relation to the housing area have already been amplified. However, I would like to re-emphasise one or two of those points.  It is quite clear that the Government thinking is to move away from the concept of the SDA loan in favour of the Housing Finance Agency.  I want to make it clear that I am not against the Housing Finance Agency because, for a great number of couples, although not an ideal solution, it certainly is a way which enables them to provide homes for themselves.  I shudder at the thought that for the next few years we would develop that agency at the expense of what traditionally has been the bulwark of private housing development in most of our counties as far as many young couples in the middle to lower income groups were concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Leary makes the point that this scheme will be a very worthwhile scheme if we have no inflation.  Even he, at his most optimistic best, could not be too convincing that we were certain to have that kind of situation.  Therefore, in the initial stages there is the attraction to young couples to move towards the Housing Finance Agency scheme for the provision of loans.  When people are beginning to build a house and when they look at the overall costs obviously these considerations come into their heads. Building houses will always be a difficult job.  Families will always be stretched to the last in trying to provide for their needs <Col N="15" /> and for the additional needs that accrue when they are trying to build a house.</P>
    <P>There is no soft option, regardless of who is in power or regardless of what scheme is in existence.  In general terms, to shift the finance which would normally be provided for SDA loans into this scheme on a large scale &mdash; I want to emphasise that it is important that we have that particular scheme for certain types of situations &mdash; and to unduly weigh the contributions towards it at the expense of the traditional scheme would be a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the points made by Senator O'Toole and ask the Minister for Finance to see if it would be possible in the near future to increase the income limits and the ceiling of the loans to enable the many couples, who would normally benefit under the scheme and who are now deprived of it, to proceed.  As he is probably well aware, the drop in the interest in that scheme is in the order of one-third over the past couple of years. That is quite substantial.  In most cases in the past it has probably taken about two or three years before the limits were increased.  I remember between 1974 and 1977, and again between 1978 and 1981, roughly a three-year period elapsed before the limits were increased.  The time is now ripe to do it.</P>
    <P>We would welcome any indication from the Minister about the Government's thinking in this area.  If that will not be the position will he confirm that the shift away from that scheme and the emphasis on the Housing Finance Agency is to be, more or less, the pillar of their housing programme in the private development area?  Should that be so we would like to have the opportunity to debate ways and means of ensuring that that scheme could be improved.  Many couples are unaware of the difficulties that can arise if they want to dispose of their houses on the open market subsequent to loans being provided under that scheme.  There are many other difficulties on the legal side in relation to deed of charge and other detailed matters and if the Government are proposing to proceed on those lines in general terms we <Col N="16" /> certainly would like to have some input into the organisation of a more favourable scheme and one which would eliminate some of the present difficulties that can evolve and certainly will evolve over the years.  With these few comments I would like to welcome the Bill.  It will have the support of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Senators, I welcome the Bill.  I have just a few comments in regard to the SDA loans and the Housing Finance Agency.  Like Senator O'Toole, I feel certain questions must be asked &mdash; whether we are doing enough and are we considering enough the people who are looking for SDA loans?  I am aware that the amount of money that has been allocated to local authority housing is £186 million this year.  Do we put enough emphasis on whether we should be doing more with that money?</P>
      <P>I mentioned before in the Seanad that people who are on the local authority housing lists throughout the country for more than 12 months, and have a family of three, are in fact entitled to £18,000 with the SDA loans.  Senator O'Toole is right.  You will not get accommodation for that.  How do we bring about a situation where we do not have to say to these people that we will give them a home costing in the region of £30,000, between land purchase, and all services as well as building when it is going to cost the local authority in the region of £30,000 to provide that home?  I feel we should bring about a situation in which people who are on housing lists with an SDA loan or, indeed, a Housing Finance Agency loan, could be financed to do the rest with some form of grant.  I appreciate that there is a £3,000 grant over five years given to first time buyers but I do not think we are doing enough about pushing people into doing something for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the local authority in Cork spent something in the region of £10.6 million last year to provide homes, we would build something like 300 homes for that and we would accommodate something in the region of 400 families.  To provide that accordingly it is something like £24,000 to £26,000 per family for 300 <Col N="17" /> houses.  I appreciate that there are many people looking for local authority accommodation who would not be able to accommodate themselves but we are all aware that there are some people who could accommodate themselves with a little bit of help but I do not think that help is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why we should not be seen to be doing it.  If, for instance, £2 million of the £10.8 million that was spent in Cork last year was given to the local authority for the allocation of grants to people who are on the housing list this would help them to provide homes themselves. If we said we were prepared to give them £4,000 or £5,000 per head and not give them local authority housing, and with the Housing Finance Agency, would it not be a much better idea?  The facts are that these people cannot provide accommodation for themselves, not because of £18,000 or £20,000 but because of £3,000 or £4,000 extra that they cannot provide themselves.  We should direct our attention to how this can be done.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why this should not be done.  More consideration should be given to the concept of local authorities considering for themselves the applicants they have on their lists.  If they feel that with some bit of help these people can do it for themselves then the help should be given.</P>
    <P>I do not see any reason why we should be giving somebody a house worth £30,000 at least in the Cork area when with a grant of £3,000, £4,000 or even £5,000 the State would save £25,000 and the person would have his own loan. Unfortunately the impression I get is that if you mention these things either at local level or at national level people are not prepared to take too much notice because it interferes with their system or their business formula.</P>
    <P>More emphasis should be put on this. I do not understand why it is not being done especially when we want to get more for our money.  I do not want to give the impression that I am talking about people who cannot accommodate themselves.  For example, on the housing list in my local authority there are people <Col N="18" /> with one or two children who are earning in the region of £8,000 to £9,000 a year, yet they must be considered for accommodation because they have a family.  I do not see any reason why we should not provide them with a hand-out in order to eliminate them from our housing list.  I am not saying that every Tom, Dick and Harry should be considered but I do not see any reason why we should not consider such a move.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that, unfortunately, there are people who are looking for the Housing Finance Agency loan and, like Senator O'Toole, I feel certain questions can be asked.  I am glad to say that in our local authority area a lot of people seem to be looking for loans.  The pay back on these loans is 18 per cent of the gross earnings all the time.  If you are not earning you will not be paying.  If you earn £300 a week in ten years time &mdash; I hope inflation will slow down during that period &mdash; you will still only be paying 18 per cent of your gross earnings.  Nobody is being stifled.  For far too long people, and indeed building societies, have brought about situations in our society where young couples were in such a state paying back mortgage loans that they found it very hard to live.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been brought to my notice a number of times, particularly in regard to people who have tried to get housing loans, is that 90 per cent of the agency loan is available only to the person applying.  It is not like the SDA loan where you get 98 per cent of it.  It is unfortunate that we should not be seen to be changing that.  Representations about this have been made to the board. There are certain rules and I appreciate that.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to consider if it is at all possible to provide the 98 per cent to assist people to provide houses for themselves.  If you are looking for a loan of £22,000 and you only get £20,000, that £2,000 can stop you from doing something for yourself.  That is the area where people are being smothered. Every assistance should be given and we are not doing that.  In these recessionary times people have been brought into a situation where they cannot pay back <Col N="19" /> their building society loans.  There are many people, unfortunately, in this area who are finding it very tough and are in a situation where the building society are now bringing them to court because of non-payment of loans, as they are too high.  The agency is not prepared to assist in this area.  These people will be coming back again to local authorities looking for housing costing in the region of £30,000 per family.</P>
    <P>Is it not possible to broaden the agency to assist these people?  That is not so at the moment.  They are not prepared to consider this area.  This is unfortunate because we have unfortunate people who have just been caught up in building societies, for whom I have no respect.  I make no apologies for saying this.  Building societies should be considering a scheme like that of the HFA for such people.  I am sure they would give it some consideration.  Indeed I know they are well able to provide the same scheme with the money they are collecting.  I do not see any reason why they should not do it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  I would like to finish by saying that the SDA loan of £14,000 is a little bit low for the ordinary person applying for it.  The agency loan covers it.  It is only right and proper that we should push more for the agency loan because of the situation with the SDA loans at this particular time.  I welcome the Bill and I am glad to see that the Minister is prepared to broaden out a little bit and indeed is explaining in the Bill certain things that we were not really aware of.  I hope that consideration will be given to the diversification of more <Col N="20" /> money to people to do something for themselves.  I do not think enough has been done in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, first of all, like to say that the concern expressed by Members of the House about policy in general and about the particular problems of SDA loans and the Housing Finance Agency are ones which are fairly widely shared. While they are not strictly relevant to the provisions of this Bill, I would, nevertheless, say that the concerns that have been expressed are ones that require examination within the framework of our overall housing policy.</P>
      <P>It is easy to make the point &mdash; I know we have all made it individually with ordinary people who are looking for loans and in other fora &mdash; that it is difficult for a number of people who would like to provide their own houses for themselves actually to do so because there must necessarily be a limit on the kind of schemes that are in operation and there must unfortunately and equally necessarily be a limit on the total amount of funding available.  It has been suggested that we should give consideration to increasing the income limit and the overall loan limit for SDA loans, the £7,000 income limit that is there and the £14,000 limit on the loans, which is, as has been pointed out, £18,000 in particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some other considerations that need to be taken into account.  The main one in my view is the capacity of the people involved to make the repayments. We have two different types of cases in the SDA loan and the Housing Finance Agency loan.  It is always one of my concerns, when people approach me about a discussion on their application for an SDA loan, to make sure to put forward to them just what is involved in making the repayments.  I am sure Senator O'Toole will agree with me that there are many cases in which it would be downright mischevious to encourage people to go forward with an application because they would not be able to meet the kind of repayments that would be required given their family circumstances. <Col N="21" /> Obviously there is a great difference between the situation of a married couple with no children and an income of £7,000 applying for an SDA loan and the position of a married couple with an income of £7,000 and four or five children making an application for the same kind of loan. We will not necessarily solve all the problems by raising limits all round and making access to money easier because the people who borrow the money will have to repay it under whatever scheme they opt for.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations would, of course, apply globally to the Housing Finance Agency loan although there is specific provision in the scheme which is designed to alleviate the burden of interest repayments generally in the early years of the loan and to put that back to the later years.  That scheme was devised for a particular purpose.  It meets a particular need of a group of people who find themselves in the situation where they are just over the limit of eligibility for an SDA loan and who, before the Housing Finance Agency scheme came into operation, really had no option that they could take up if they were still anxious to provide themselves with houses.</P>
    <P>Those are considerations we will have to bear in mind when looking at the conditions that apply to the schemes generally. Without wishing to avoid a discussion I would say that a more detailed examination of those issues would be more appropriate perhaps to the debate on the Environment Estimate.  Indeed, there are other occasions when a discussion of that kind can take place.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the provision of finance for housing we should not discuss these matters as if the total allocation for SDA loans and the total available for Housing Finance Agency loans were the only sources of finance, or indeed were the only sources of finance for individuals who are building their houses.  We have the mortgage interest subsidy and the new house grants which apply also.  On an occasion when we do have a detailed discussion of policy in relation to these areas we should tie all of those elements together and see whether the particular combination of <Col N="22" /> measures we have is really the best adapted package we can think of for the needs of the people about whom we are talking.</P>
    <P>Members are aware that there are numbers of local authorities who encourage people who apply for local authority rented accommodation to consider whether or not they would be able, with the assistance of SDA loans or HFA loans, to buy their own houses.  I know, from my own experience and from that of colleagues all around the country, that there are, in every case, numbers of people who when the question is put to them in that way and think about it find they can afford to buy their own houses even given the strictures now in existence in relation to the total availability of finance.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should go any further than that on these issues, except to say that I would welcome the opportunity of having a more detailed debate on these issues and of assuring Senators that the points raised are ones which will be taken into consideration.  They will be particularly pertinent points when we come to drawing up the Public Capital Programme for 1984.  I am sure that the points that have been made will be brought forward and fully considered in that connection.</P>
    <P>As far as the Bill itself is concerned, I do not think any specific points were made in relation to its provisions which would require a particular reply.  I would express my appreciation to Senators for their understanding and their readiness to support the provisions of this Bill which is an enabling one and which, of itself, will not have any direct influence on the shape of the schemes it is designed to finance.</P>

      <P>Seeing that the atmosphere is so lovely here at present I should say that I am delighted that the Minister has suggested that we should talk about all housing right across the board.  Perhaps another Minister might tell him that that was not his business but seeing that he is the Minister in charge of money, I suppose it is his business.  All of us in local authorities find that there is a group <Col N="23" /> of people who require houses and whom we try to encourage to stay off the local authority housing lists.  They may not have the necessary finance to buy a posh house up the road.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's attitude that we might discuss this again.  All of us serving in local government encourage people to come off the housing lists which are endless.  I say this in support of my colleague, Senator Cregan from Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and the House, for being late in arriving.  The reason was that the monitor did not show that the previous Bill was <Col N="24" /> going on to Committee and Report Stages.  Therefore I thought that Bill was still on Second Stage.  I extend my apologies.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to increase the limit to which the Minister for Industry and Energy, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may guarantee borrowings by Irish Steel Ltd. from £75 million to £100 million.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel Ltd. are a wholly State-owned company with fully paid up shares amounting to £30 million held by the Minister for Finance.  The principal activity of the company is the manufacture of steel from scrap.  Their main products are reinforcing bars, merchant bars and sections in a range of sizes principally for the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel's new plant came into commercial production in July 1981 and has a rated capacity of 333,000 tonnes of finished product per year, which is more than double that of the old plant.  This increase in capacity, at a time when over-capacity already existed in Europe, was necessary in order to achieve the economies of scale required for competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The cost of the development project is only one of the costs incurred by Irish Steel.  In addition, the company have incurred losses since 1974 due, firstly, to the obsolescence of the old plant, secondly, because it was necessary to suspend production during the installation of the major items of plant and, finally, since July 1981 in commissioning products, re-entering old markets and breaking into new export markets.  The combined effects of the project cost and the losses have resulted in borrowings amounting to £75 million at the end of May 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company's accumulated losses at 30 June 1982 amounted to almost £23 million and their anticipated losses for the year to 30 June 1983 are of the order of £21 million.  For the information of the House I should add that the company were in receipt of a grant in 1982 to the value of £25 million, which reduces their accumulated losses by that amount.  Further losses are expected to be incurred in the following years, even if substantial <Col N="25" /> additional equity, to which I will refer, is provided.  It is not possible to be precise about the extent of future losses, which would depend on the achievements of the company in relation to sales, costs and prices.</P>
    <P>The world steel market continues to be very depressed, with the European market in a particularly bad situation.  Production of crude steel in the EEC fell by 12 per cent in 1982, while domestic demand for steel in the Community decreased by 6 per cent.  Recent forecasts, which revise downwards earlier projections, indicate that world steel consumption in 1983 is now expected to be only 1 per cent above the 1982 level, while that for the Community is expected to fall by over 1 per cent.  The level of over-capacity in steel production in the Community at present is estimated at 40 million tonnes per year and demand for steel is now at an even lower level than in 1982.</P>
    <P>The excess of supply over demand, which pushed up costs and caused prices to drop below the break-even point in many companies, and the cut-throat competition on export markets have seriously eroded the financial viability of the European steel industry.  As a result the European Commission has had to take a number of measures designed to prevent the situation deteriorating into a state of chaos and to set in place the mechanisms required to adapt the structure of the industry to the new situation.  Among the measures currently being operated by the Commission are restrictions on investment in steel production, restrictions on State aid to steel producers, restrictions on steel production, measures to raise prices, aids for redundancy, short-time working and early retirement, loans to industries which can help to replace employment lost through steel plant closures and loans to help steel undertakings to carry out restructuring plans which involve a reduction in capacity.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that, in July 1982, the Minister for Industry and Energy and the European Commission jointly appointed consultants to assess the viability of Irish Steel.  The consultants report which became available in <Col N="26" /> September 1982 concluded that the company's production costs were not competitive due to the high price they pay for their energy supplies.  However, on the bases of certain assumptions in relation to prices, reduction in production costs, growth in sales and revenue, and the provision of additional State funds of up to £89 million, the company could, in the consultants' opinion, be viable in the long-term and should be allowed to continue in operation.  The consultants warned, nevertheless, that if it were decided to keep the company in operation and to provide the additional funds, there was the risk of failure due to the difficulty of adequately breaking into the export markets.</P>
    <P>As far as energy costs are concerned, discussions are taking place between the company and their suppliers in a manner consistent with normal commercial practice in an effort to improve the company's position.  In addition, I have recently taken action to have a review of the costs and prices of the ESB carried out, because of the major impact which the board's prices have on the economy in general.  I should add that Irish Steel are the ESB's largest consumer of electricity.</P>
    <P>I should stress that no financial aid, and that includes equity investment and the guaranteeing of borrowings, may be provided by a member state to a steel producer without the prior approval of the European Commission and aid for the continued operation of a steel undertaking may not be paid after 1984.  I emphasise that the Government have not taken a decision in relation to aid to Irish Steel in respect of any period after 1983. Their decision, in due course, will be influenced by the viability prospects having regard to the company's performance up to the end of this year.</P>
    <P>A notification of the maximum level of aid which the Government might contemplate was sent to the Commission in September 1982 to meet the deadline set by the Commission for the receipt of such notifications.  The maximum aid envisaged in the notification was the guaranteeing of further borrowings of £25 million, to be replaced by share capital, and the provision of share capital of up to £89 <Col N="27" /> million.  The Commission is required to give a final decision on all aid notifications by 1 July 1983.  The Commission will not approve aid unless the basic viability of companies is established.</P>
    <P>The Commission approved a Government grant of £25 million to Irish Steel in 1982 and the investment, earlier this year, of a further £5 million in the share capital of the company.  In addition, the Commission has approved the drawdown by the company of a further £7 million in guaranteed borrowings which will be sufficient to meet the company's requirements pending a final decision by the Commission on our aid notification.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel have recently negotiated a loan facility for £3 million and will need a further £17 million in loans to enable them to operate up to early 1984.  Their ability to obtain this finance is dependent on the enactment of legislation to enable the Minister for Industry and Energy to guarantee further loans.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to comment on the system of production quotas which the Commission operates for the purpose of matching supply with demand.  The quotas for each company are based on their historical production, with some adjustment for companies which have brought new capacity on stream.  The present quota system is due to expire on 30 June 1983.  The Commission has made a proposal for the extension of the system for a further period of 2½ years and for the inclusion, for the first time, of plate and heavy sections in the mandatory quota system.  The House will appreciate that Irish Steel's historical production was extremely low.  The company need a higher capacity utilisation rate than that which would be available under the Commission's proposal if they are to have a viable future.  In discussions on this proposal our aim has been, and will be, to ensure that Irish Steel, which carried out their restructuring plan with Commission approval, should not be made unviable by the application of the quota system.  I am hopeful that a satisfactory arrangement can be worked out which will take account of Irish Steel's position.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel now have a very modern <Col N="28" /> and versatile plant whose production efficiency compares favourably with the best in western Europe.  The company have made considerable progress in the past year with the result that their volume of sales, in the year to 30 June 1983, is expected to be more than double that achieved in the previous year.  This aspect of the company's performance is encouraging but much more has still to be accomplished in relation to costs, prices and further increases in sales if the company are to succeed as a viable and competitive producer.</P>
    <P>The difficulties facing Irish Steel are considerable and it would be misleading of me to understate them.  The company must achieve an increasing level of sales at a time when the international steel market is anything but encouraging and at a time when established producers are being forced to reduce their production capacity because of the imbalance between supply and demand.  It is clear that the future of Irish Steel will depend on the way in which the markets for their products develop and on the costs and efficiency of the company's operations.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I would hope that, in spite of the many difficulties now facing Irish Steel, the essential performance required to safeguard the future of the company can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which increases the limit on borrowings by Irish Steel from £75 million to £100 million.  It is, perhaps, a holding operation in this company's business coming as it does in the wake of the number of closures there have been in the Cork region and the tottering situation obtaining with regard to a number of other industries &mdash; Verolme, Dunlop and NET, to mention but a few.  The Cork position with regard to unemployment is by any stretch of the imagination very serious.  While we have an overall unemployment problem it is quite clear that, as far as the Cork region is concerned, it is very acute.  Therefore we welcome this provision in that it at least holds out some hope for Irish Steel <Col N="29" /> who are obviously in quite a difficult situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that he was anxious to see sales improved and productivity enhanced but all of this, unless the world climate with regard to prices for steel improves, may not be sufficient to guarantee the viability of this company. Already the capacity of the company to make repayments on existing borrowings is in question.  I wish to ask the Minister to indicate in the course of his reply to the House the prospects of the company in this regard.  Also, I would like to ask him to give a summary of the overrun on the cost of the development of the new plant which, as he indicated, is very versatile and one of the most modern in Europe.  I do not want to condemn the company in this regard because there have been many other situations as far as State organisations are concerned where we have had very substantial overrun on anticipated capital investment.  In this case it is approaching nearly double the estimate for the provision of this plant.</P>
      <P>In an effort to try to cut back on borrowing for current expenditure and overall expenditure, to try to get some semblance of viability into what we do in relation to State organisations and to give the public a better return on investments, we would like to hear why it is that estimates given on the basis of all available information at the time should end up so low in comparison to the total expenditure at the end of the day.  Many private companies &mdash; and one must regard the State in the long run as a private company in the sense that at some stage it must be in a position to pay its way &mdash; could not tolerate this level.  I am reluctant to call it waste but it seems to me having regard to the overall capacity of the company that it leaves a lot to be desired.  Any reforms that we can suggest here in relattion to the organisation of Irish Steel and other State bodies in terms of expenditure of this kind should be made.  This aspect needs to be monitored in a much more detailed and comprehensive way to ensure that we do not have this overrun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This plant produces only about 0.2 per <Col N="30" /> cent of the European requirement in the steel area.  From the point of view of the versatility of the plant, the employment that it provides in Cork and its importance to the economy as a whole, it is necessary that we ensure that it gets every possible opportunity to develop management, marketing, sales and all the possibilities that would make it viable in the next few years.  As far as this side of the House is concerned, we are prepared to support the Minister in his efforts in this regard.  We look forward with some anticipation to developments in the next few months, and particularly in the next couple of years, to the longer-term viability of Irish Steel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Bill, the Minister of State has set out the problems faced by the steel industry on a worldwide basis and in a European context and has placed Irish Steel in proper perspective in this regard.  This Bill has the enthusiastic support of the Fine Gael Party and we are very pleased that the Minister of State is here to move the Bill. It is a particular privilege for me to speak on this Bill, coming as I do from the Cork region and anxious as I am to ensure that the industrial infrastructural development of the Cork region would continue to make the significant progress over the next few years that it has made in the past ten to 12 years under all administrations. Irish Steel are a very significant kingpin in that industrial infrastructure and I recommend to the Minister that every effort be made to ensure that Irish Steel not only continue at their present level of capacity but to the limit of that capacity.  I suppose it is a bit unrealistic to talk about increased capacity in the present climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Steel are a substantial employer of skilled and semi-skilled male labour in the Cork area and it is important that this should be maintained.  We share the Minister's view that there is no way in which Irish Steel can be given a blank cheque for the future but I am quite sure that the investments being made are properly managed.  If the proper response is available from the work force and if proper management is there &mdash; and there is no <Col N="31" /> evidence to suggest that it is not &mdash; then we should have a prosperous steel industry in the Cork region for the benefit of the country as a whole.  This is a good example of State enterprise over the years.  Those who established the State and those who followed closely on them, even though by and large they were themselves conservative in philosophy were not afraid for ideological reasons of the implications of State enterprise.  We should put that on record and express our support for that general viewpoint.</P>
    <P>State enterprise is as good as the particular project under consideration.  In the case of Irish Steel and many of the other enterprises, it has been very good for this country and for the region in which it is my privilege to live.  No ideological hang-up should get in the way of support for an industry of this kind.  The steel manufacturing industry is State-owned or State-aided to such an extent that it is impossible to imagine what that industry would be on a worldwide basis if it did not have the support and encouragement, if not the open encouragement certainly the covert support and encouragement, of Governments, even Governments as disinclined to involve themselves in the economic process as the United States of America.  Such Governments support the steel industry in one way or another.  They may do it through defence projects and other methods but they support their steel industry. This kind of very heavy industrial enterprise deserves our support.  However, no support is open-ended and it is important to recognise this.  If any industry, and I am not suggesting that Irish Steel come into this category, goes too far and the expense of running it is too much, obviously it must be questioned to ensure that on balance it is making a proper contribution to the industrial life of the country.</P>
    <P>One of the most important points raised here was raised by Senator Smith. The Minister should be encouraged to give to the House an indication of the cost overrun which was involved in the installation of new equipment in Irish Steel.  If that cost overrun is substantial, <Col N="32" /> as I suspect it is, I think the Minister should be further encouraged to indicate to us who was responsible for that cost overrun.  There is no point in saying just because the cost overrun was substantial that we should automatically blame the management, the workers or any other group.  It might have been the Government's fault, it might have been totally the fault of people outside this country altogether.  It might have been outside our control completely.  With regard to other matters which come before us here I said the acceptance by those who are involved in State enterprises of the responsibility for their actions is a cornerstone in the expansion of that section. Those of us who do not have an ideological hang-up on the question of increased State enterprise can only support that if the existing industries are seen to live up to their responsibilities and to accept the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>This should not automatically be seen as an indictment of any of the workers in that industry.  Very often, particularly with regard to capital projects, the responsibility could not possibly lie with the workers.  The responsibility very often either lies in circumstances totally outside the control of the company or on the management and board of directors of the particular State company.  I am very anxious that the Minister would share with us his assessment of who bears the responsibility for any cost overrun, if such a cost overrun existed, and in what way that particular group are being held responsible for their actions.  I will have to wait until the Minister replies but if it was the responsibility of management they should be held to be responsible and logical consequences should follow as a result of that situation.  If it was the board of directors, they should accept the responsibility and logical consequences should follow from that situation.</P>
    <P>The future viability of projects like Irish Steel has been in the past and is now seriously jeopardised by reason of investment decisions which were far too expensive to implement compared to the original projection.  It is not reasonable that in the future management, workers or the State in general should accept without <Col N="33" /> question and without satisfactory explanation the results of unwise investment decisions or investment decisions which were not properly implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also emphasised and touched upon one very important aspect of Irish Steel's future, and that is the question of energy costs.  There is no aspect of Irish industrial life which is more important at present than energy costs.  We had a discussion recently on the question of wood processing and in that discussion it emerged that the energy cost involved in this was a vital factor in the reduced employment in the company in question over years past.</P>
    <P>We see in the case of Irish Steel that the whole question of energy costs, and ESB costs in particular, are a vital ingredient in the future prosperity of this company and because they are so vital for this company they are a vital ingredient in the industrial prosperity of the country as a whole.  For those whose responsibility it is to control the organisations that determine the levels of these costs it is important that they would be made aware of their responsibilities not only with regard to their own individual enterprises but their responsibilities for the future prosperity of companies like Irish Steel where a substantial portion of their costs are outside their own control.  If I take from the Minister's introductory speech a view that he considers the problems of Irish Steel to be part of an overall problem with regard to the question of competitiveness, and specifically an important ingredient in that element of competitiveness is the cost of our energy costs, he is on the right lines and should continue to pursue to their logical conclusion efforts to reduce energy costs for this and for other companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill in so far as it seeks to extend the power to guarantee to £100 million instead of £75 million the guarantees which the Minister may give in respect of Irish Steel is welcome.  We look forward on this side of the House to the maintenance of substantial beneficial employment in Irish Steel in the Cork area.  This is the long-term interests not only of the Cork area but of the country <Col N="34" /> as a whole.  For that reason this Bill has our enthusiastic support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyConway" hpid="Mr. Conway Mr. Conway">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conway</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Bill as it extends the guaranteed borrowings of Irish Steel Limited from £75 million to £100 million.  It is, as Senator Smith said, a holding operation but Irish Steel in their performance to date have been quite an unfortunate company. From 1978 to 1982 &mdash; and we have just been given the figures for 1983 &mdash; the figures indicate that sales have held at £13 million.  We have been told by the Minister that sales have doubled to June 1983.  In 1978 the company lost £1.6 million and continued throughout the period from 1978 to 1982 with losses of £1.6 million, £2.9 million, £6.6 million, £12.9 million and £21.7 million last year.  If we look at the interest rates and the interest charged on the accounts, we find that from 1978 to 1980 the interest rates were in the region of £580,000 to £700,000. The interest rate for 1982 was about £11 million which shows that part of the reason for the loss is due to the massive interest rate.  The Government gave a grant in 1982 of £25 million.  I look back at the employment situation in Irish Steel and find that in 1979 there were 770 workers in Irish Steel and in 1980 there were 630.  That has remained static ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company, through a massive asset reorganisation has placed itself as the Minister said, in the forefront of steel production in Europe.  It is catering at present for 70 per cent of sales on the export market and 30 per cent of sales on the home market.  As the Minister said in his statement, over-production in Europe is 40 million tonnes in excess production per year.  This has the effect of lowering the prices and giving the company a very hard run as far as the export market is concerned.  The Minister should reduce the cost of gas and power to the company. I understand the charges to Irish Steel have been higher than the charges to other commercial companies.  If the price of gas is reduced that will reduce the profits of Bord Gáis and it will give Irish Steel a better chance to recover.  Unfortunately the problem is not due to charges <Col N="35" /> for power; it is because of the over-production in the European market and the small prices the company get for their exports.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel have been unfortunate. When the company were nationalised they were left with very old plant and, therefore, their production costs were massive.  Once they were equipped with modern plant, as far as steel was concerned, they found they were cut off because of the over-supply in Europe.  It was unfortunate that Governments did not see fit to look at Irish Steel before and inject the kind of capital needed in the late sixties and early seventies to take advantage of the economic situation in Europe at that time.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel need to be restructured financially.  With interest rate charges at £11 million it is not possible to examine the affairs of the company in any great detail.  The profits are exaggerated because of the capital programme.  The purpose of the Bill is to raise borrowing from £75 million to £100 million, giving guarantees from the Government.  A total amount of £125 million has been provided for Irish Steel, of which £75 million has been by way of guaranteed borrowings.  I would have liked to have been in a position to examine the consultants' report in greater detail and not to read it from the Minister's speech. That report would seem to indicate that a reduction in production costs was the first step and, secondly, growth in sales. A growth in sales is not enough: they must be at a proper price.  The report said there would have to be a proper financial package for the company amounting to £89 million to make them viable.  We are involved in a holding operation today.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Leary and Senator Smith said, we cannot act in isolation.  It is a strategic operation.  The repercussions of the company's closure on the whole Cork area would be enormous.  The region was once the heartland of the textile industry in the country but that is now gone.  Irish Steel have one of the most up-to-date and efficient production units in Europe. If the recession declines they have a chance to take advantage of that.  We <Col N="36" /> cannot turn away the great tradition that there is in Cork.  We have spent many years training people in that company to work in a modernised and efficient plant. Not only the 630 jobs directly involved in Irish Steel but about 300 ancillary jobs are involved.  I urge the Minister to look at the selling techniques and to improve and strengthen the marketing side.  We are all here today speaking about the production side.  We agree that is first-class, but there is the other side of the coin, namely, the marketing side.  We must be able to explore markets in which we can get better prices.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and the Minister for Industry and Energy on their meeting with semi-State bodies. That was an unique occurrence.  I agree with the Minister's philosophy about setting up the bodies on a more commercial basis and drawing up plans in respect of their activities for the next five years.  The Minister should have available to him at all times information on sales performance, capital expenditure, manning and the amount of jobs involved in each of the semi-State companies.  He should have this information on a monthly basis. There seems to be some contradiction between what the Minister is now saying about sales to 30 June this year and what was actually said before.  Because it is such a massive operation the figures should be presented on a monthly basis. In all companies in the commercial field they have monthly accounts and I do not see why the Minister should not have very simple monthly accounts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the monitoring of State bodies by the Government.  I should like to suggest that the Minister would have a consultancy unit in the Department of Industry and Energy which would be directly responsible to him and would be manned by a management consultant, an economist and management accountants, to examine the performance of companies like Irish Steel and other companies. They would report directly to the Minister and they would be involved with the civil service and with the companies themselves.  This would be a step forward in the Minister's control of the semi-State bodies.  There is such a consultancy unit <Col N="37" /> in the National Prices Commission and it did good work as far as the control of companies was concerned.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on setting down guidelines for the planning and control of public expenditure to ensure that future projects are professionally assessed.  I welcome his fresh approach and that of the Minister of State in this matter and I wish them well in their deliberations. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Bill.  As a representative of the Cork area I am concerned about the lower harbour area generally and in particular Irish Steel.  I appreciate what the Minister has said.  It is unfortunate that the public are unaware that one of the major problems of Irish Steel is energy costs.  The ESB's biggest consumer is Irish Steel but I think people are not aware of that.  The greater proportion of energy that we produce today is being used, costing 20 per cent more than to anybody else it certainly must put Irish Steel costs out of all proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rationalisation that has gone on in Irish Steel over the years is very encouraging. No objections have been made by people within the trade union movement to rationalisation; indeed, they are very attentive to bringing about rationalisation. It is unfortunate that this area is seen to be one of the lame ducks of semi-State bodies.  I am conscious, like Senator Conway, that questions must be asked as to whether Irish Steel themselves are doing enough as regards marketing their products.  We are in a bad recession now and the Minister in his statement said that steel sales are down. I appreciate that, but in view of the amount of money that has gone into rationalising and improving the plant &mdash; it is one of the most updated plants in Europe today &mdash; I cannot understand why more emphasis is not being put by the company on trying to sell their product. Questions should be asked about that. We should never give the impression that semi-State bodies should be allowed to do what they want when they want to do it.  I, like Senator Conway and others, am encouraged by the meeting of semi-State <Col N="38" /> bodies with both Ministers over last weekend.  I do not want to give any impression that Irish Steel is under serious question from central Government, although questions must be asked, but I am confident that given the right time and the right market situation they will compete.</P>
    <P>However, nobody should be allowed to bring about a situation in which they are not allowed to compete because of costs, and here I refer to the ESB.  It has been said that 20 per cent of Irish Steel costs per year are accounted for by energy and Bord Gáis.  I do not think Bord Gáis costs them a great amount or that they are one of the highest paying customers of Bord Gáis, but I would like to be corrected there if I am wrong. With the amount of energy that we are producing and the number of people employed by the ESB &mdash; who have increased their staff over the years yet their costs are higher than anywhere else in Western Europe &mdash; consideration could be given to supplying power to Irish Steel even at a loss.  That would be better than allowing power to drift into the air. We put so much money into our Department of Industry and Energy and the ESB and they are making no move between them to assist each other.  That is very serious.  The people are paying for this.  When the people are asked to pay more then more consideration should be given to it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not want the impression to go out that Irish Steel do not want to get on with their work.  The opposite is the truth.  It is unfortunate that people within both Houses should not be seen to be investigating and touring these areas to see how they are working.  It would open anybody's eyes to see the plant now working in Irish Steel and indications for the future are only for the better.  I appreciate what the Minister is saying, and I am confident that in the future, given normal times, Irish Steel will prove beneficial for us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to talk too much from a position of local interest though obviously I have a considerable local interest in the existence of Irish <Col N="39" /> Steel.  Irish Steel is a case in point and the other semi-State company whose activities are referred to in the Minister's speech is another case in point, where we seem to be pursuing the national objective of blaming absolutely everybody and everything except those who are ultimately responsible for investment decisions, the board of directors of a company who are answerable to the shareholders who are the State in both cases.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel were set up for very important strategic reasons during the Second World War.  They pursued a downward course from then on, perhaps inevitably because of the introduction of free trade. We seem to issue warnings to all and sundry that Irish Steel cannot be continued indefinitely.  It is important to remember yet again who will be the victims if Irish Steel close down.  It will not be the State who are the shareholders because the State will simply avoid a loss-making enterprise; it will not be the senior management because their friends in the Irish private sector &mdash; who prefer to see companies like Irish Steel close down in the first case and who make a major campaign item of that &mdash; will obviously look after the senior management in terms of jobs within the private sector.  We can have no doubts about that.  It will be the ordinary work force of Irish Steel who will suffer, yet they are the ones who have the least control or impact over the sort of decisions that are necessary in the case of Irish Steel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You can get yourself involved, as unfortunately the Minister appears to have done, in self-fulfilling prophecies and in trying to extend important comparisons into areas where they do not necessarily apply.  We have, for instance, a considerable emphasis in this country on our decline in cost competitiveness and the Minister comes up with the extraordinary statement, to which I can see some point but it is far too bald, that excessive supply over demand pushed up costs and caused prices to drop below the break-even point.  If he is talking about the fact that in a major capital-intensive industry you reduce production therefore the cost per unit of production will go up, <Col N="40" /> perhaps we have a point, but I suspect that that was the sort of thing that was slipped in because everywhere in this country it is apparently almost ideologically necessary to point out yet again that we have a problem about our cost competitiveness. I wish this sort of thing would not be thrown around too readily.</P>
    <P>A central problem in the question of Irish Steel's viability is the cost of energy being supplied to them.  One must judge the ESB by proper commercial criteria. A major State enterprise which generates electricity ought to be able to do it realistically and profitably.  What is very necessary to realise in the ESB &mdash; and the business people in this House even more than myself ought to understand this &mdash; is that the ESB have had to undertake a massive expansion in a very short period because of the relatively short period of our industrial development.  We are in the process of real industrial development for only about 20 years and, therefore, the huge capital investment in extra generating equipment had to be done in a short period of time.  It must, presumably, increase the capital charges and therefore it must increase unit costs as an inevitable consequence of the massive investment that the ESB had to do to plan and to meet the increased electricity demand resulting from the development of this country.  Other countries who had a reasonably slow but more long-term development of industrial production will not have these problems.  The CEGB in Britain, for instance, will be developing electricity capacity over 40 or 50 years and, therefore, their capital provisions will be more evenly distributed and will not become a charge on one era in society which is one of the problems with the ESB.  Another problem with them is the extraordinarily high interest rates which is not their fault and yet another is the problem with our currency which is not their fault.  They are not responsible for currency charges.  A fourth problem with the ESB is the cost of energy in this country.</P>
    <P>Speaking as somebody somewhat qualified to speak in this area, I remind people again that the real cost of oil is far more dependent on the cost of transporting it <Col N="41" /> than on the cost at the well-head.  Since transport costs internationally into this country are recognised to be very high, it is inevitable that the cost of oil to any public corporation like the ESB will be enormously high.  Therefore, that cannot be laid at the ESB's door.  The final criticism that is used against the ESB is the implication that they are over-manned. Anybody who has a confidential discussion with executives in the ESB will know that the reason they are overmanned is that politicians from all sides of this House and the other House spend their time pressuring them to take on people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and pressuring them to open up uneconomic generating stations to meet various political needs in various parts of the country.  That is the experience of the ESB for the last 20 years and it is a pity that it is only I who can stand up and say it.  I know that.  I remember discussing it ten years ago with an executive of the ESB and he spoke about the way they would develop and he said everything would be grand unless there was a by-election in a critical area in which case they would have to build another power station.</P>
      <P>There is no point now, when costs become impossible and difficult and demanding, in suddenly turning around, washing your hands and saying that it is all the board's fault.  The ESB have an international reputation in the area of electricity generation.  They are regarded as a major competitor consultancy-wise internationally.  That is not the record internationally of a poor organisation.  If we are to have implications and aspersions cast towards the ESB in the Minister's speech they are entitled to be defended and that is what I have just done.  The ESB are an efficient, competitive organisation, competitive internationally and competitive nationally, and they deserve better than the sort of abuse they have got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Irish Steel, I do not know if they have a long-term or short-term future.  What I know is the way we are wont to lecture shareholders and <Col N="42" /> directors in private companies about their responsibilities to their employees. All of us in this House have a capacity to point out the irresponsibility of shareholders in certain companies and of boards of directors of limited companies. Just as private individuals have those responsibilities the State as the major shareholder in Irish Steel has an obligation to the employees of that company also.  Therefore, irrespective of the long-term or short-term future of Irish Steel &mdash; I cannot judge the long-term commercial viability of a corporation like that &mdash; the State as the major shareholder has a responsibility to its employees which cannot be fobbed off by talking about it being an autonomous semi-State corporation.  The State is the shareholder; the State is, therefore, ultimately responsible for the welfare of the labour force and cannot suddenly discover a way of backing off that responsibility.  The State set that up to meet a national emergency and it cannot now walk off from it and say it is somebody else's problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChristyKirwan" hpid="Mr. Kirwan Mr. Kirwan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirwan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it can be argued that in a storm any port constitutes a haven and any Bill that comes before this House which provides in some shape or form the wherewithal to continue the operations of the major industrial element in a viable way is to be applauded and recommended.  However, I do not want the Minister to think that he has reached Nirvana.  All I have heard so far are compliments being thrown in his direction. I want to break the mould a little and say that this measure does not go far enough.  If one reads the Minister's speech one cannot help but conclude that a substantial portion of the difficulty in the financial sense being experienced by Irish Steel was the decision to renew the plant.  That decision was taken in the cold, hard light of day and against the background of over-production in the steel market throughout the world.  The Minister said that it was necessary in order to achieve economies of the scale required for competitiveness.  For gobbledegook that beats even what I hear in the trade union movement from time to time.  What he really meant and what I <Col N="43" /> want to make clear is that when we were dealing with the only steel plant that we have, any attempt to reduce its effectiveness by reducing its labour force &mdash; that is what we are talking about here &mdash; raises the whole question of the concept of import substitution.</P>
      <P>We have been hearing now for months, indeed for years, that the only oil refinery we have should be closed down.  People have been talking about dispensing with the only cross-channel shipping operation that we have both in Dublin and in Cork.  We may well end up as a small nation, an offshore island off an offshore island off the mainland, depending on everybody's product in order to survive. There the dream of the late Seán Lemass suddenly vaporises and disappears because there is no doubt that social economic factors are involved when the State is an employer.  I do not want to go into the field of repetition, and many Senators have already commented on this, but the reason for establishing the edifice of State and semi-State industrial enterprise related to an inherent desire on the part of the administrations of those days to at least be our own masters and not to be subservient to people who have no contact with us, no regard for us and certainly no regard for our welfare or our future. There is nothing wrong with the ideological concept of the State maintaining an interest in its manufacturing, industrial or trading infrastructure.  We have a fairly proud record in this small nation in that in proportion to the population we serve we probably have more socialised industries than any country on this side of the Iron Curtain.  That appears to be under general attack now and the popular thing seems to be to revert to the Victorian ethic of Lord Salisbury who said that governments have no responsibility for the provision of employment.  This worries me when I see Irish Steel being the microcosm of this developing concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour force in Irish Steel made a very substantial contribution to the attempt to make the plant viable through the rationalisation procedures already described very succinctly by Senator Cregan. They did so in recognition of the fact <Col N="44" /> that the difficulties of the steel industry were clearly apparent and there was a genuine desire on the part of the people employed in the enterprise to maintain that enterprise as a living, viable entity in order to provide them with continuing employment.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that we welcome the Bill in the sense that it provides additional money to enable Irish Steel to balance themselves precariously on the razor edge of viability.  That is not the happiest situation to put any enterprise in.  Somebody must say to them that we have sufficient faith in them and in the labour force to salvage the only steel plant in operation that we have and to try to ensure that at least we can meet our own requirements from time to time without going abroad.  Let us hope that the recent meeting with the semi-State companies by the appropriate Minister is in some way a recognition of the difficulties that face these bodies.  I sincerely hope that there is a recognition here too of the socio-economic factors involved and that there is a crying need to strain every sinew and exercise every endeavour to maintain an element of employment consistent with human dignity.  We recently witnessed an altercation on the northeast coast when some potatoes came in from the Low Countries.  When I read it I was staggered.  One cannot describe the potato as having been invented, but at least we have the distinction of having the first potato being planted somewhere near the Irish Steel foundry, not too far from it anyway.</P>
    <P>If we have reached a stage where we are now eating potatoes originally derived from Aran Banners and exported some 50 years ago to places like Malta, Italy and Cyprus, let us hope that we can continue to maintain our building construction industry with steel produced within our native shores.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to commend the Bill.  I do not think there are any political points to be made in supporting this Bill because Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party would not wish to see any damage inflicted upon Irish Steel. It is important from the public's point of <Col N="45" /> view to understand that Irish Steel are usually discussed in the context of lame ducks.  They possibly were a lame duck but the lameness has been cured substantially and we now have an extremely modern plant.  As Senator Kirwan said a minute ago, they have a work force which in recent years has commended itself for its flexibility in trying to meet the management's dictates <i>vis-a-vis</i> manning levels, production levels etc.  I think a magnificent job was done on that.</P>
      <P>It is quite common to knock trade unions and trade unionists at times, but sometimes they do something at great sacrifice to themselves.  They have shed a number of bodies and it is not in anybody's long-term interest to continue to decrease employment in such industry, but they have made those sacrifices.  As Senator Kirwan said, they have accepted completely new manning and shift procedures. We now have a very modern steel-making plant with a capacity of something like a half million tonnes of steel a year.</P>
      <P>It is the setting of the Bill in the European context that disturbs me so much because with all my connections and visits to Europe, I do not see too much of the Common Market or the common spirit but I see the French, Germans and British being extremely nationalistic in their approach.  At all of the discussions around the table with our flags behind us and the European symbols and all the rest of it, they are in there defending absolutely their own national interests.  It does not matter a damn whether Ireland, which was referred to as the offshore island off an offshore island, gets its fair share.  It is ludicrous, to say the least, that the Commission sets the output for steel based on the historical production of European steel mills and having assisted us to make massive investments in Irish steel and to increase production then says, &ldquo;Now that you have increased it, we will ensure that your quota remains at the stage it was when your plant was antiquated and when the production methods belonged to the early part of the century rather than the start of the eighties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the European context we must <Col N="46" /> adopt a methodology more akin to the French than to the Irish approach to the Common Market.  The French have devious means and methods of securing France's interest on almost every occasion. Think of the beautiful situation of the import of videos into France.  They made it almost impossible because they built the clearing station in one of the most inaccessible regions of the country and every single video had to be checked by an official and stamped.  The Japanese gave up sending them in because their trucks were tied up for weeks trying to get out from under French bureaucracy. In this country we are concerned about building good roads from the ferry, and that is not for exports: it is to expedite in large measure imports into the country that we become hyper-efficient.  We must adopt some of the French tactics because we are fighting for our lives here.</P>
    <P>I note in the context of the British steel industry that Mr. McGregor, is talking about building new steel-making capacity in Britain to tie up with the Americans to control the European steel market.  We have a long way to go in terms of protecting our interests in Europe.  I have no doubt whatever that the nationalism abroad in Europe is very strong indeed. National interest comes first, last and always.  Ireland will have to fight extremely hard for fair play.  Allowing us to modernise a plant which can give us extra production and then ensuring that under the rules and regulations there is no possible way we can sell that production seems to be a classic case of Catch 22.  We must highlight that as often as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>In respect of Irish Steel's marketing operation, I had a discussion some time ago with a person who is engaged in an Irish semi-State company and whose work takes him abroad almost continuously. He made a point which should be seriously looked at because we need the best possible people to go abroad and sell our products and we need to give the best possible financial back-up.  The gentleman to whom I was speaking made the remark that after you have been to Nigeria once or twice, you do not really want to go back there any more because <Col N="47" /> as soon as you finish talking to your potential buyer you are sitting in a hotel room; you do not have any friends; you do not understand what is on television because of the different language and so on.  Basically, he was saying that the glamour of foreign travel quickly fades away and that the financial inducements were not great.</P>
    <P>If we want people to go out there and sell Irish products &mdash; I am talking particularly about the State companies &mdash; we should adopt a more commercial dynamic in our approach to sales.  We must look at our people abroad trying to push Irish products and ask ourselves if we are rewarding them sufficiently for the sort of work they do.  I took the point when he said that if you are out of your own home and out of your country for something like eight or nine months a year it is quite a strain, not just on a person himself but on marriage.  If we could direct more incentives to that area, we might get better results.  After all, it is our first ringers we want out there selling and not the second best people.  I am sure the competition, be it Americans, Japanese, French or whatever have absolutely their best people out there trying to sell their products.</P>
    <P>Finally, there was, as Senator Brendan Ryan said, a strategic objective behind the initial foundation of Irish Steel.  I believe that strategic objective still remains.  If in coming years we concentrate on building and modern infrastructure we will need steel and steel-making capacity to do that sort of work.  Otherwise, we will be talking about massive imports.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill for increasing the borrowing limits of the company.  Proper recognition should be given to the trade unions for their cooperation in the entire matter.</P>
    <P>Thirdly &mdash; I am not talking about this Government alone, I am talking also about previous Governments &mdash; we are not approaching our partners in the Common Market in a fashion determined enough when they try to put us into this Catch 22 situation of allowing us to modernise <Col N="48" /> a plant and then putting in a quota which means that the whole operation is not viable.</P>

      <P>My time for reply is, therefore, constrained.  I thank the Senators for welcoming the Bill and I would like to point out that the future of Irish Steel and employment prospects there are important to the Government.  Reference was made to apparent cost overruns.  The project was conceived in the middle seventies.  The period during which it was built, leading up to 1981, was one of heavy inflation. This, combined with design changes and certain delays in currency problems, led to what has been described as a cost overrun.  The Government are concerned with regard to cost overruns in the public sector in general.  It was for that purpose that the Minister for Industry and Energy and I met the semi-State bodies under our aegis.  Part of the reason for the meeting was to ensure that the State companies adopt a plan that is visible and understandable and, therefore, that there would be some planning mechanism visible to the Minister and the Department so as to avoid in the future what are described as cost overruns.  I should like to thank Members for their contributions. I would be grateful if the Seanad dealt with all Stages now.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the increasing social problems caused by marital breakdown and calls on the Government to introduce legislation <Col N="49" /> to enable the deletion of Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution which prohibits divorce.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion I should start by removing one misconception which there may be about the movers of this motion. There is no intention on our part to encourage the dissolution of marriage. The motivation behind it is not that in any sense at all.  We have no wish to destroy, or to facilitate, or encourage the dissolution of marriage here.  We support to a certain extent the wording in the amendment about the protection of marriage in the Constitution and have no objection to that.  All parties in this House, and probably all the independent Members agree about the first part of the motion which notes with concern the increasing social problems caused by marital breakdown.  That is undoubtedly a problem which is growing here at a very alarming rate.  What we disagree about, and it is apparent from the two motions we have down about it, is the urgency of the problem and the methods we should use to tackle it.  It is very difficult in approaching this problem to get any figures about the extent of marital breakdown here.  One of the difficulties is because it has never been recorded in the census but we know from the figures about deserted wives, and the allowance they are claiming, that in 1980 the figure was 10,000 and by 1982 that figure had crept up to 15,000, an increase of 50 per cent in two years.  That does not take into account the exceptions, the deserted wives who cannot claim the deserted wife's allowance and that includes women under 40 with no children and those receiving £38 per week or more.  That figure does not include many informal separation agreements, many formal separation agreements and many cases of marital breakdown which are not cases purely of deserted wives.</P>
    <P>In talking about this problem we do not have any specific cast-iron figures. What we do know is that the problem now has reached chronic proportions and that must be recognised.  I welcome the decision of the Government to include a figure for separated couples in the next <Col N="50" /> census in 1986.  All one has to do is ask any of the Deputies, certainly in urban areas, whether this problem is bad or chronic in their constituencies and I believe the answer will be a unanimous &lsquo;yes&rsquo; although they cannot put an actual figure on it.  The figure quoted by the Divorce Action Group recently was that there are approximately 70,000 people affected one way or another by marital breakdown.  That figure does not include children.</P>
    <P>Why then do we bring in a topic like divorce to the Seanad?  It is a somewhat unwelcome topic and it is extraordinary how seldom this topic has been debated in this House or in the other House.  What we must do today is recognise the fact that it is a problem which is a matter of great urgency.  It is a fact of life that written into our Constitution is a clause which states that no marriage can under any circumstances be dissolved.  There is no recognition, as a result, of irretrievable breakdown of a marriage here. There is no recognition that such an intolerable situation can exist for both or for either party to a marriage or for the children of a marriage, no recognition that the marriage should be dissolved and that those who are involved in that marriage should get a chance to remarry.  I do not want to go into any very specific, long or detailed cases.  They have been quoted so often, but I believe natural justice requires that in certain situations a marriage should be dissolved.</P>
    <P>We have heard too often of the problems of the battered wife, the alcoholic husband and the mental cruelty which exists in a marriage.  I would like to ask whether it is the belief of Members that those who are sufferers, of both sexes, in situations like this should as a result of one mistake which may be the fault of one party or another, which may be a young and very adolescent mistake, be condemned to a permanent status as a result of this mistake?  It defies all the laws of natural justice.</P>
    <P>I came across one case the other day of a deserted husband whose wife left him eight years ago one week after they were married and he has not heard from or seen her since.  It seems that that sort <Col N="51" /> of a case defies natural justice.  It seems wrong that this man should not be able to change his status in any way although his marriage is to all intents and purposes dead and irretrievably broken.  Is it right that where children are suffering intolerable psychological and physical neglect, which is certainly the case in many parts of this country, especially in urban areas or even where they are suffering from tense, unstable marriages, they should be condemned to that state rather than have one stable parent?  That sort of suffering is intolerable and ought to be ended.  It is a massive social problem which extends through all levels and all strata of our society.  The constitutional ban on divorce is a hindrance and a bar to the solution of this problem.</P>
    <P>Divorce, which this motion was intended to be about, is undoubtedly a taboo word in our society.  One has to look at what happened in the other House when this issue was raised by three Members recently.  Only three Members stood up to debate it and to allow a Bill to go forward on a referendum to remove the Article in the Constitution which prohibits divorce.  That is an example of political cowardice by the party politicians who decided not to debate the subject.</P>
    <P>One has only to look, regrettably, today at what has happened in the Seanad where an attempt to specifically debate divorce, as well as the problems of marital breakdown, has again been avoided by the tabling of an amendment which obviously avoids the subject of dissolution of marriage or of divorce itself. Apparently, that word is still one which the political parties on all sides prefer to avoid.</P>
    <P>Why was it necessary to amend my motion?  I do not know why it was felt necessary to strike out the reference to the deletion of Article 4.3.2º of the Constitution which prohibits divorce.  The reason, obviously, is that it is still a taboo word.  There are two key phrases in the amendment which in principle I would support but in practice I am going to have to oppose.  They are &ldquo;supports the proposal of the Government&rdquo; and &ldquo;which will <Col N="52" /> make recommendations on the protection of marriage under modern conditions and on marriage breakdown&rdquo;.  That is all it is, a proposal of the Government.</P>
    <P>We have already seen the difficulties that this proposal has encountered in the last six months.  It is part of Government policy, undoubtedly, to set up an all-party committee.  This proposal has been in existence for six months and we still do not have the all-party committee which the proposal was meant to set up.</P>
    <P>It is of great interest after what happened yesterday in the Dáil when a Member asked the Taoiseach what was happening to the all-party committee.  He replied that it has not yet been set up and he was waiting for talks with the Leader of the Opposition who wanted clarification on the terms of reference of the committee.  When those talks will take place I do not know.  How long they will take I do not know but we are heading for a situation where the all-party committee is already bogged down, where there may be disagreement on the terms of reference and where the weaknesses of all-party committees on this subject becomes very apparent.  Even if an all-party committee is set up what we will see is that it will make recommendations. That is all it will do.  The whole thrust of action which is needed on marital breakdown is being blunted by the proposal to set up an all-party committee because an all-party committee may not get off the ground; it will only make recommendations, if it ever reports, recommendations which the Government are under no obligation whatsoever to accept.</P>
    <P>Originally the timetable for this all-party committee was that it should be set up in April 1983 and that it should report by the end of December 1983.  Since yesterday that has apparently been put back. There is now an unspecified delay on the report of that all-party committee.  In this morning's newspapers one of the more progressive members of Fianna Fáil on this issue stated that it was her view that this committee should take at least three or four years.</P>
    <P>It is totally unacceptable that the problem of marital breakdown here should be delayed for three or four years.  If an <Col N="53" /> all-party committee is to be set up at all on this issue it should have a deadline and make recommendations immediately. An all-party committee has traditionally been a device for ducking, for burying and avoiding issues of this sort. I see no reason why the setting up of this all-party committee with no deadline on reporting, no guarantee of any report or guarantee of agreement, will not bury the subject of divorce.  Indeed, I believe that this is the intention.</P>
    <P>I should point out here that there was an all-party committee on the Constitution which reported in 1967.  We are lucky to have in this House two Members of that all-party committee, Senators Dooge and Eoin Ryan.  That all-party committee reported and recommended a change in Article 41.3.2º, a contorted change, but, for its time a somewhat enlightened one.  I would like to ask what happened to that recommendation? What happened to the recommendation of that all-party committee on other constitutional changes such as the substitution of Article 3 by something else?  The answer is, of course, nothing.  That points to exactly what I am trying to say, that all-party committees of this sort or on this issue are a recipe for no action whatsoever but salve the conscience of a Government on problems which they find too difficult to tackle.  What I would look for, and what should be looked for from the Government on this is action, a commitment.  One would think that the problem of divorce had not existed here since the foundation of the State.  One would think from their attitude on this that they had not examined this problem already.  Either they have, and they have a view of it, or they have not in which case it is a disgrace that they have not examined the problem of marital breakdown and divorce.  Every Government should have a view on a situation like this.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask, has consideration been given to the problems of marital breakdown here since 1980?  Has consideration been given to the issue of divorce?  It is quite obvious to me that the Labour Party have a commitment to support the proposal for a referendum specifically <Col N="54" /> in their manifesto.  They have a duty today not to take the easy way out and refer this problem to an all-party committee which does not even mention the subject of dissolution of marriage, but to support the original motion which we have.  It is straightforward Fine Gael policy &mdash; as far as I know &mdash; to refer this, for their own good reasons, to an all-party committee, although Young Fine Gael are totally in favour of a referendum. I would like to see a commitment from the Government to hold a referendum. The best possible timing for such a referendum would be May 1984 for two reasons.  One would be that we have the European and local elections at that time. That would ensure a fairly heavy vote and it would be good for administrative reasons.  It would also give the Government time to consider the implications of marriage breakdown between now and then.  I accept that if they have not thought about this problem already they will need time to do it but that does not stop them giving a commitment to this House, and the people, to hold a referendum in that time and place before the people their specific proposals on the consequent legislation.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why there should not be a simultaneous family proceedings Bill to deal with the situation in the intervening period.  There is absolutely no contradiction between a committee on marital breakdown and a commitment to holding a referendum on divorce and making a recommendation on it as well. That will give the time for the preparation.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the House to consider what the situation would be if it was the other way around.  We have had a recent and very divisive debate on another topic to amend the Constitution. What would be the attitude of the Government, or the Opposition, or of any party, if they were attempting to write into the Constitution a clause of this sort which prohibits the dissolution of marriage?  We would find it to be even more divisive than the debate on the amendment to the Constitution which we have just so painfully gone through.  If that is the case &mdash; I do not believe anybody <Col N="55" /> in this House will stand up and say at this point in the 20th century that we must put into the Constitution a clause which prohibits divorce &mdash; then there is obviously no defence for keeping it there any longer.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the last debate we had in the House, and the enormous problems which are still unsolved on it and whatever the arguments were about it, this stands out even more as a denominational clause in our Constitution.  It is undoubtedly one which preaches the doctrine of one Church against the doctrine of all the others.  Whatever the arguments about the amendment to the Constitution about abortion, and the possible denominational implications there, this is a straightforward insertion into the Constitution of the beliefs of members of one Church and not the other.  No Protestant Churches have any objection to the deletion of this Article, nor do the Jewish Churches.  Indeed, many members of minority religions regard divorce when marriage has irretrievably broken down as a civil right and one of the tenets of natural justice which they enjoy.</P>
    <P>Where, I wonder, does this Article leave our pluralist society to which so much lip service has been paid recently? Where does it leave the constitutional crusade?  I would have thought that this was the one Article which sticks out a mile as being a case for the constitutional crusade.  This is the one truly and indisputably denominational Article in our Constitution.  It is uncomfortable of course but it is more ammunition for the majority in Northern Ireland if we refuse to tackle this problem.  If we duck it today, as it appears we are attempting to do, it is more ammunition for the majority in Northern Ireland to say: &ldquo;Look, there you are, they will not even tackle the problem of divorce; Protestants in the South are discriminated against, not just by law, but actually in the Constitution.&rdquo; That is an argument which it is very difficult to answer.  If we do not get moving on this, the most obvious denominational aspect in the Constitution, the crusade which has already been put in cold storage for a while will become a <Col N="56" /> total fiasco.  We have certainly had a step back from that crusade with the amendment. Now it appears it is going to die because divorce will not even be tackled here.</P>
    <P>Party politicians are perhaps a little bit naive on this subject because it is a very thorny one for them.  They believe that public opinion may not, and cannot, stomach us taking on this subject, that it will be politically difficult for them to promote such a referendum.  This is another case &mdash; it may still be the case with the amendment &mdash; where party politicians have possibly got it wrong again, that they are once again leading public opinion from behind.  Public opinion, in fact, is moving in favour of the deletion of Article 41 of the Constitution.  The opinion polls I saw recently which were taken by totally reputable opinion poll organisations showed that public opinion has moved dramatically on the issue of divorce in the last few years.  The latest one showed that 53 per cent of those polled were in favour of divorce under some circumstances and 31 per cent were against it under any circumstances.  They also showed a very significant factor, that the vast majority of young people here were in favour of the introduction of divorce in some circumstances.  That is a dramatic move and a move and a mood which party politicians should ignore at their peril.  It is a difficult subject but they are out of touch if they are frightened of this subject and if they want to keep kicking it under the carpet.</P>
    <P>Why, we must ask ourselves, are we the only country in the EEC that does not allow divorce under some circumstances? Why are we the only country in Europe, except Malta which has a very small population, which does not allow it and that includes the Eastern bloc countries? Why are we so far behind and sticking out on a limb?  It is no good to say: we are a Roman Catholic country with a Roman Catholic ethos.  Similar countries, Spain, Italy and Poland who have a similar Roman Catholic ethos allow divorce under certain circumstances. The prohibition has gone there and we are the only one left with that prohibition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> I do not underestimate the great problems which will arise after the deletion of such an Article.  Of course there will have to be very important legislation to follow. There will have to be a family proceedings Bill.  There will have to be great care taken to protect marriage.  Nobody wants quick divorces under any circumstances when a couple just have a row.  There will have to be counselling.  There will have to be an onus on legal advisers to let parties in difficulties realise the counselling services that exist.  There will have to be mediation services.  There will certainly have to be continuous encouragement to keep couples together and discouragement of divorce.  There will also have to be a recognition that there are some cases where marriage has irretrievably broken down and where it is totally unfair for couples to be forced to stay together.  There will have to be family courts and there will have to be definitions decided by the family courts about when marriage has irretrievably broken down.  An enormous amount of work will have to be done on what happens to the children and the welfare of the children. There should, obviously, be no dissolution of a marriage until the welfare, custody and maintenance of the children is looked after.  There is an enormous amount of hypocrisy talked by those opponents of divorce who say that it is unfair on the children to have a divorce. There is conflicting evidence about that as there is on most matters of child psychology. In many cases it is beneficial to the child that their parents should separate and be divorced rather than they should live in a very tense and psychologically damaging atmosphere.  There will have to be legislation on property and the rights of property of spouses in this situation. That still does not prevent the Government setting up the committee, doing their research and making a declaration at the same time that they are in favour of a referendum.  We are not asking for any more in this motion.  We are asking for a referendum on the dissolution of marriage.  We are asking the Government to do it, not immediately, but to set a date in 1984 to give them the time to prepare the way to introduce the <Col N="58" /> legislation and let the public know what legislation is to follow.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that an all-party committee will ever take divorce to the stage of legislation or referendum but that it would become bogged down.  I do not believe a delay on this is any longer defensible.  We have no timetable.  We do not know when we are going to get recommendations; we do not know what they are going to be and we do not know whether they are going to be acted upon in any way.  I would like to see in this for once a sense of reality from the Government and a recognition of the problem. I do not believe that a prohibition on divorce is a matter for the Constitution of a pluralist liberal state which most of us aspire to.</P>

      <P>In rising to second Senator Ross's motion I would like to say something about the back-drop to my thinking on the subject of marital breakdown and divorce.  It is quite likely that in this short session on a very large, wide-ranging topic we might lose sight of the fundamental significance of taking a vow, and a sacred vow at that, at an altar before God which is central to the feelings of people in Ireland.</P>
      <P>What I have to say should not be interpreted in any way as an endeavour to belittle the sanctity of the vow or the meaning of it.  I wonder if in Ireland we have paid enough attention to the difficulty that confronts people when, for various reasons, there has been a breakdown in their own lives and where there has been some break between themselves and the social <i>mores</i> with which they are associated.</P>

      <P>I hope and pray that perhaps the Chair may put his stop watch back to zero.  I was trying, briefly before starting into the main meat of what I would like to say, to suggest that in any country we have separate and complementary functions for the holy men on the one hand and the politicians on the other.  We who proposed the original <Col N="59" /> motion did not do so at all lightly.  In doing so we were challenging both Church and State and suggesting that their functions should be both separate and complementary.  The holy men, be they Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or Islamic, will wish, and quite rightly in my view, to hold aloft the ideals of their faith and to invite people to become whole, to reintegrate them in wholeness and to keep society as far as possible integrated as a whole.  On the other hand, the State will have to, and should, acknowledge that we are less than whole.  This is the conflict.  Society is far from perfect and it is necessary for us to have the machinery to deal with our limitations as well as our differences.  Therefore I will maintain throughout what I have to say that an absolute ban on divorce exposes weaknesses in the attitudes of the institutions of the State as well as in the inabilities of the Church.  On one hand, we are denying the consequences of irretrievability in the breakdown of marriage as a fact of life. On the other hand, we are denying the possibility of reintegrating persons whose bonds have been broken and whose integration in the social milieu in which they mix has become fragmented.  That is the challenge I pose to both Church and State.  In doing so, I note that in the original Constituion of 1932 of the newly formed Irish Free State, Article 8 guaranteed, subject to public order and morality, freedom of conscience and restriction on the imposition of any disability on account of religious beliefs or religious status.  At that time there were no divorce courts in Ireland.  Irish residents who wished to appeal a divorce had to do so by way of a Private Bill in the Westminister Parliament.  Following the establishment of the new State three such Private Bills were presented to it.  Mr. Cosgrave, the Prime Minister at the time, reacted to this in an extremely sharp and perhaps totally predictable manner.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the whole fabric of our social organisation is based upon the sanctity of the marriage bond and that anything that tends to weaken the <Col N="60" /> binding efficiency of that bond strikes at the root of our social life.</P>
    <P>However, he did not question that the bond might be already irreparably weakened by the time the divorce was sought, nor did he ask what about the factors both in the home and outside of the home that might be associated with its weakening.</P>
    <P>In the debate in this House in June 1925 on the subject of divorce legislation W.B. Yeats spoke as follows:</P>
    <P>You are going to have indissoluble marriage but you are going to permit separation.  You cannot help yourself there.  You are going to permit young people who cannot live together, because of some intolerable wrong to separate.  You are going to invite men and women in the prime of life to accept for the rest of their existence the law of the cloisters.  Do you think you are going to succeed in what the entire of Europe has failed to do for the last 2,000 years?  Are you going to impose the law of the cloisters on those young people?  If not, you are not going to raise the morality of this country by indissoluble marriage.  A great English judge speaking out of the immensity of his experience said that there is no cause of irregular sexual relations so potent as separation without the possibility of re-marriage.</P>
    <P>Twelve years on in 1937 the divorce issue was again raised during the debate on the new Constitution.  It is interesting to reflect that in discussing the matter contained in Article 41 the debate had to be stopped on no less than two occasions because there was not a quorum of 20 Deputies in the House.  It is also interesting to reflect that the 1937 Constitution that contained Article 41.3.2º which we are debating today was eventually ratified in a referendum by approximately 685,000 votes in favour but there were also over 525,000 votes against &mdash; hardly an overwhelming result.  In the same Constitution, as we all know to our cost, were the controversial Articles 2 and 3 that imply a claim to Northern Ireland. We should ask ourselves what might have <Col N="61" /> happened had it been possible to canvass the Northern vote to which these Articles lay claim.  Would the Constitution have been ratified?  Would there be a ban on divorce today?  If there was not a ban on divorce, would we, as Senator Ross asked, be proposing to put one into the Constitution?</P>
    <P>In respect of Northern Ireland, it seems relevant again to quote further from that speech by Yeats when he said:</P>
    <P>It is perhaps the deepest political passion with this nation that North and South be united into one nation.  If it ever comes that North and South should unite, the North will not give up any liberty which she already possesses under her constitution.  You will then have to grant to another people what you refuse to grant to those within your borders....  You will not get the North if you impose on the minority (here) what the minority consider to be oppressive legislation.</P>
    <P>Whenever unity in marriage cannot be achieved or sustained what do the Irish couple in the Irish Republic have recourse to?  They can live out an unhappy life of controlled frustration. They can live out an unhappy life of uncontrolled frustration expressed in violence and illicit affairs.  They can separate through agreement with or without legal enforcement, such as that provided by High Court order on the grounds of adultery or cruelty.  They can obtain barring orders, as I understand it, in the District Court or the High Court. They can seek annulment on the grounds of some defect which existed at the time of the marriage or preceding it.  Finally, and perhaps most germane to the Ireland of today, they can seek divorce elsewhere &mdash; another English solution to an Irish problem.</P>
    <P>Separation by law in Ireland does, at least, recognise that the marriage is dead. In the metaphysical view of the Church such marriage may well be indissoluble. In the eyes of the State it is to all intents and purposes irretrievably broken.  By 1967, as the report on the Committee of the Constitution shows, the problem at least could be ventilated openly and constructively <Col N="62" /> in a less emotive climate than formerly.  The existentialism of the sixties combined with the upsurge in anti-authoritarianism in the latter part of the sixties by western European youth, together with the effects of advancing technology, had produced enormous changes in social attitudes.  Penetration by the media had been significant and the effect on the Second Vatican Council was remarkable.</P>
    <P>There were even those who held the view &mdash; I hasten to add it is not mine &mdash; now much less fashionable than a decade ago, that the marriage institution itself was dated.  In doing so, such people did not look at the spiritual and political challenges of a new era which were making marriage unstable, not only in Christian but also in many other societies too.  It is in that area that I would certainly say that I welcome the idea of setting up an all-party committee, although as I hope to conclude, it is totally inadequate in relation to the original proposal which Senator Ross and I were making.</P>
    <P>In advocating a more liberal attitude to marriage breakdown we should not seek to belittle the central sanctity of marriage bonding as the core and kernel for care, love, warmth and development in the social fabric.  Therefore, we must challenge, not only our politicians, but also our philosophers, theologians, sociologists and all concerned people in this country to promote with urgency a fresh analysis of the forces and trends in society, and Irish society in particular, that has led to such an increase in acknowledged marriage breakdowns.</P>
    <P>As long ago as 1967 the report of the Committee on the Constitution was drawn up and constructive recommendations were made with regard to Article 41.  We must now ask along with Senator Ross, why so little has happened since that report was published?  In the report that emerged 16 years ago criticism of retaining Article 41.3.2º was made and a modest proposal was put forward to see how it might be changed.  The report notes, among other things, firstly, that the Article in question takes no heed of the wishes of a minority in the Irish Republic whose religion does not prohibit <Col N="63" /> divorce.  It also notes that absolute prohibitions in the Constitution appear even more rigid than the regulations imposed on Catholics as a result of the more liberal attitude following the Second Vatican Council, yet that original clause, 41.3.2º, was put in the Constitution as a reflection of Catholic morality on this issue.  It stated:</P>
    <P>There are several circumstances in which the Catholic will grant dissolutions of valid marriages or will issue declarations of nullity.</P>
    <P>Thus it is that as long ago as 1967 it was acknowledged that you could be married to a second partner in accordance with the teaching of the Catholic Church, yet be in a state of bigamy before the Irish Constitution.  In section 126 of that report it goes on, in relation to the ban on divorce, to state:</P>
    <P>It is unnecessarily harsh and rigid and could, in our view, be regarded as being at variance with the accepted principles of religious liberty as declared at the Vatican Council and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Further, it was acknowledged that something had to be done to regularise the position whereby those with money, know-how and nerve could leave the country to obtain what more modest people were being denied.  In this respect it is salutary to look at the implications of Article 42.3.3º which leads to some confusion in relation to succession rights with regard to divorces that take place outside of the Irish Republic.</P>
    <P>The report suggests that the best course would be to delete this section altogether and use private international law as a means of coping with foreign divorce, adverting to Article 29.3. which specifically accepts the principle of international law.  In acknowledging that you might go somewhere else for a valid divorce the report could be accused of implying that it is not divorce but divorce in Ireland that is wrong.  Furthermore, it is not banned throughout the whole of Ireland.  The people of Northern Ireland <Col N="64" /> would like, just as you would, to live in a society without the strains and pressures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But they need to be reassured by this House that, in the event of us moving closer, that will not create a situation in which people will be obliged to face the future in the loneliness of isolation as the only alternative to bonding illicitly, with no legal protection, on the grounds that failure is final and a second chance is not to be tolerated.</P>
      <P>I hope Senators will realise, while acknowledging the benefits of the all-party committee, that it is absolutely nonsensical that in this State in the twentieth century, with the problems that face the people of Ireland, with the vast numbers that are involved in marital breakdown, with the children that are involved, with the involvement of second partners, with the children of second partners, we have an absolute ban on divorce.  In my opinion it is a disgrace that that should pertain. Furthermore it is a particular reflection on us that it pertains here in Ireland while people can go to England to obtain their divorces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;and&rdquo; and insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;supports the proposal of the Government to establish an Oireachtas Committee which will make recommendations on the protection of marriage under modern conditions and on marriage breakdown and on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If this amendment is accepted the amended motion would read</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann notes with concern the increasing social problems <Col N="65" /> caused by marital breakdown and supports the proposal of the Government to establish an Oireachtas Committee which will make recommendations on the protection of marriage under modern conditions and on marriage breakdown and on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required.</P>
    <P>I am happy indeed that since the amendment was put down there has been agreement in regard to this Oireachtas Committee and I express the hope that there will be no further delay with regard to starting its work or indeed concluding its work.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross, in moving the original motion, indicated that all there appeared to be between the original motion and the amendment was a question of difference in regard to the question of urgency. I do not think that is the main difference. The important thing in regard to this extremely difficult question is not for us to get an answer quickly but for us to get an answer which will be right and to get an answer which can be implemented. We have to realise when dealing with a problem such as this, a problem which is concerned with questions of human rights and questions of human morality, that we have to recognise the various stages.  We can recognise four stages in the way in which any political community tackles such a problem.  Firstly, there must be a clear recognition of the existence of that problem and of the nature of the problem. This is followed by discussion of the problem in all its aspects before we can reach the third stage which is an agreement, broad enough with regard to a solution, which will ensure the fourth stage which is the implementation of that broadly-agreed decision.</P>
    <P>In tackling the very real problem that we face, this is the way in which we have to tackle it.  If anyone asked me what is my personal opinion about the constitutional prohibition on divorce he has only to look at the report of 1967 to find that Senator Eoin Ryan and myself have already declared our position in regard to this.  But it is not sufficient merely for individual Senators, individual citizens, individual Deputies, to give an opinion. <Col N="66" /> If we are going to be able to carry this viewpoint into effect there must be a sufficiently broad agreement.</P>
    <P>There is now in this country a sufficient recognition of the great extent of our problem.  If one compares the way in which this is debated now and the way in which it was debated in 1967 &mdash; when the all-party committee were discussing it &mdash; it will be found that there is a clearer recognition in seeing it now as a social problem whereas then there was a tendency to see it more as a legal problem with social implications.  It is clearly a social problem, one that interacts with many other of our social problems which we must also tackle.  There is a clearer recognition by all of the extent to which there is marital strain, of the conditions under which marital strain, which, of course, is present to some degree in all marriages, ultimately reaches a stage at which a threshold is passed and it becomes a question of marital breakdown. In marital breakdown itself, before we come to the stage where divorce becomes for some an imperative, we have to pass through another threshold to irretrievable breakdown.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must do is look on this problem as a social problem.  It is a problem in which the individuals affected by it have reacted in many ways.  In one sense we have had in this country down through the years altogether too much divorce &mdash; divorce by desertion, which has reached alarming proportions; we have had separations by barring orders. These are reactions which have occurred to this situation and which are completely and utterly unsatisfactory.  We have an apparatus in regard to barring orders, in regard to separations, in regard to nullity. All of them could do with improvement, but this is beside the point.  There is need of improvement to get rid of the ridiculous situation in regard to the lack of concordance on nullity between Church law and civil law.  There is a need to improve the position in regard to questions of desertion, questions of violence in the home.  There is, of course, a need to do something about the ridiculous situation in regard to the non-recognition of foreign divorces.  But these are all <Col N="67" /> minor compared with the need to tackle the central problem.</P>
    <P>The central problem is that we have a major social problem on our hands and it must be faced frankly.  How are we to face this problem?  There are a number of ways that we could go about it.  Frankly I believe, given the situation that we have in this country at present, the only realistic thing to do is to try to seek as broad agreement in regard to this matter as can possibly be obtained.  My hope is that we could obtain this through an all-party committee which would sit but not I hope for years.  It may not be possible at this stage for such a committee to report at the end of the year.  But neither should there be any necessity for that committee to spend an unduly long time on their work.  There is a need for such a committee to clarify some aspects of the problem for us but we certainly have no need of anything approaching a commission of inquiry.  The solution which such a committee would bring forward would have a number of facets.  Its solution might well involve some phased plan of action.</P>
    <P>Above all, what we want to avoid either in our discussions or in the report of such a committee is any attempt to bring forward simplistic solutions.  In that regard I should like to place on record now that the proposal to which the all-party committee agreed in 1967 is not a solution to the problem.  Quite frankly, I want to say now that the important thing which the committee did in 1967 was to agree unanimously that the prohibition must go.  That was the essential thing at that time.  It was an unexpected outcome for many outside the committee.  The actual proposal which was made is not one that would solve the problem and, as a member of that committee I make that statement now quite freely.  What is needed is a solution that will go to the heart of this problem with its many ramifications. We have a need to explore the problem thoroughly.  We have a need for the cross-party support that will be essential if recommendations are to be carried into effect because what we have to deal with first is the question of the constitutional prohibition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> It is for these reasons that I moved this amendment.  I join with Senator Ross in hoping that, when such a committee does report, we will get some action as a result. I agree with him thoroughly that if action had been taken in regard to the recommendations of the 1967 committee on this, as on many other points on which they were unanimous, we could have avoided many subsequent problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment standing in the names of Senators Dooge and Ferris.  I do so for a number of reasons, principally because the amendment specifies in a very clear way a positive and constructive response to the problem which exists.  The amendment and the amended motion, if adopted by this House, will provide us with the opportunity and framework within which the problem of marital breakdowns can be treated in a very satisfactory way.</P>
      <P>Without being critical of the motion before the House, one might contrast the amendment with the motion on that basis.  The motion, as it stands is very restrictive and negative in that if it were adopted it would simply have the effect of bringing us back to the situation which existed prior to 1937, the situation mentioned earlier by Senator Robb.  On the other hand, if the amendment as proposed is accepted it will give us the opportunity of considering all aspects of this problem and ultimately of suggesting solutions.  One should bear in mind carefully the wording: &ldquo;...which will make recommendations ... on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required.&rdquo;  That illustrates the constructiveness and the positiveness of this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is important also that we realise we are discussing a matter which is of tremendous importance to this country.  I do not agree with Senator Ross when he said there was an attempt to shy away from this issue, that there was a taboo on the issue of divorce or that it was an issue about which people were afraid or unwilling to talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we discuss the issue of marital breakdown in its widest sense and that we see divorce, as such, as simply <Col N="69" /> one aspect of the resolution of this problem.  The problem of marital breakdown gives rise to many distinct problems. Divorce is one way only in which possibly that can be resolved.</P>
    <P>It is important also that in our consideration of the issues unanimity be achieved.  As Senator Dooge said, one of the important aspects of the 1976 committee recommendations was that unanimous agreement was reached to change from the existing prohibition contained in the Constitution.  It is very important that there should not be any division on this issue.  That was one of the problems which existed in this House in 1925 when the divorce controversy broke out.  If anybody refers to Donal O'Sullivan's work on the Irish Free State and its Senate in the chapter dealing with that problem one will see he made specific mention of the fact that the debate in this House at that time had the effect of poisoning the entire attitude to divorce in this country. Bearing in mind recent debates we have had in both Houses of the Oireachtas, and the recent debates we have had in the country on various issues, it is important that we be aware of the danger of introducing divisiveness into this issue. It is important that we recognise the fact also that in this country in the past 20 years we have seen very substantial changes, changes in our attitudes to all kinds of problems.  One has only to refer back to debates which took place in both Houses of the Oireachtas dealing with such matters as the Succession Bill in the early sixties, dealing with the question of maintenance in the seventies to see how attitudes have changed so radically in such a very short period.</P>
    <P>We must accept also that Vatican Council II, the rise of the feminist movement, the developing theology of the Catholic Church and various other things have had the effect of changing our attitudes. It is important that we do something which will give our legislators an opportunity of considering these changes and their effect on Irish society, and a framework within which to produce an ultimate solution.</P>
    <P>One must accept that there are a considerable number of problems which can <Col N="70" /> be fruitfully considered by an all-party committee.  One must first examine the question of marital breakdown as such. One must examine the reasons for the increasing incidence of marriage breakdown in this country.  One must consider changes which have affected marriage in this country, the rapid change from a rural to an urban society, the effect which rising unemployment is going to have on marriages here and the effect which the Northern difficulties are going to have on marriage in this country.  These are the difficulties which are having an effect on marriage in the Irish context.  Stresses are being placed on the institution of marriage of a kind which did not exist 15 years ago.  These are things which must be considered.</P>
    <P>We must also consider, as has been mentioned earlier, the entire question of nullity.  We must consider the difficulties and the anomalous situations which arise whereby people may obtain a declaration of nullity from an ecclesiastical court in this country and find that they cannot then get married in this country unless they get a divorce outside the jurisdiction of the Irish courts which may be recognised there.  There are many instances of people living in a criminal situation, a situation of bigamy, by virtue of a second marriage having taken place.  They do so purely on the basis of having obtained a declaration of nullity from an ecclesiastical court.  There is also the question of the children of such marriages, the question of succession rights and these are things we must consider.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the whole role of our counselling services.  There has been much development in this country in recent years in the whole area of counselling services for people with marital problems.  We have to consider the issue of the privilege, if any such privilege exists, for counsellors involved in such work.  That is something which is causing problems and is also something we should consider in setting up any all-party committee. We must consider property rights and the whole amalgam of jurisdictions available to the courts at present, from the District Court to the High Court.  We have to consider the whole possible evolution <Col N="71" /> of family courts.  We have to consider the existing court structure and its operation in so far as that impinges on problems of marital breakdown.  It is a disgraceful situation that people faced with the stresses and problems of marital breakdown frequently must go into dingy courthouses and frequently wait &mdash; certainly in the District Courts in rural areas &mdash; until ordinary criminal and civil cases have been disposed of.  They must wait there until their marital cases are finally dealt with.  That is an unacceptable situation and about which something should be done in an attempt to resolve it.  This amendment gives both Houses the opportunity of dealing in a constructive way with all of the problems which exist. Above all it will afford us an opportunity at the end of the day of doing something which will constructively resolve these problems in a legislative or constitutional way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case for a review of the law of marriage is a very strong one. The case for divorce is usually introduced by referring to irreparable breakdown of marriages, to the misery and hardships created, and so on.  There is no doubt whatever that there are irreparable breakdowns that do result in hardship, misery and so on.  For that reason the case can be made for considering the present situation.  But it must be recognised that that is one side of the story only.</P>
      <P>To suggest that divorce will necessarily solve this problem is not true.  Not only will it not solve the problem in many cases but, very often, it brings its own problems, hardships and tragedies.  Anyone who is familar with the position in countries where divorce is available almost on demand will know that the end result is far from idyllic.  Consequently, we should not approach this problem on the basis that all we need to do is wave a magic wand, permit divorce and the tragedies that are talked about will solve themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the troubles about divorce &mdash; even if one accepts the necessity for it &mdash; is that, once introduced, it seems to be impossible to keep it within any kind <Col N="72" /> of reasonable control.  The arguments made for divorce always talk about special cases, about cases of irreparable breakdown and so on.  They give the impression that these are unusual and that consequently divorce should be introduced to deal with these special deserving cases.  The trouble is that that is not what happens in many countries where divorce is easily available.  Once divorce becomes the norm to deal with any case where there are marital difficulties, then it seems to become the norm for almost any case where there are even the most minor marital difficulties.  Consequently there can be no doubt that in other countries divorce is sought and availed of in cases where it is not really necessary at all, in cases where, in similar marriages in this country &mdash; where divorce is not available &mdash; in 99 cases out of 100 the marriage survives and, in the end, is shown to be a marriage which should survive and which turns out to be quite successful.  One reason why we should approach this question of divorce with the greatest of hesitation and thought is that almost inevitably, if divorce is introduced, it will become widespread and get out of control with results which will prove to be far worse than what pertains at present.</P>
    <P>The position in this country is complicated by the fact that we are a Christian country that all the Churches here disapprove of divorce with various degrees of emphasis.  It should be realised that the Churches disapprove of divorce not because of some obscure doctrinal reasons but because the experience of these Churches over the centuries has convinced them of the importance of the sanctity of marriage and of its importance for the welfare of the family and society generally.  Because they realise that, they realise that if marriage is undermined, the whole fabric of society will be adversely affected.  For this reason I would like to emphasise the fact that a person of no religious persuasion might well argue against divorce, not because of any religious reason, but because he realises how important marriage is in society.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb seemed to make the <Col N="73" /> case that the Churches argue against divorce, that they were quite entitled to do that for moral reasons and because they had a rather high opinion of the individual but that politicians have to look at that in a different way.  I would reject that argument.  I do not think politicians must necessarily look at it in a different way.  The importance of society, of the welfare of society, should be just as much the concern of a politician as it is of the Churches.  If a politician believes that divorce will have a serious effect on society then he should argue against it in much the same way as perhaps the Church would from another point of view.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that divorce is not just a matter for the individual.  It is not just a question between two people; it does affect the whole of society.  Consequently politicians must look at it from the point of view of the effect it will have on society and not merely the effect it will have on individuals.  In approaching this question we must give very serious consideration to the way in which we would approach any change in the present situation and the way in which any change would affect society generally.</P>
    <P>The position in this country is further complicated &mdash; as has been referred to by other speakers &mdash; by the fact that annulment is permitted by the Roman Catholic Church, that this permits new marriages and leaves former wives and/or children in an impossible situation socially and legally.  This situation results, amongst other things, in bigamy, perhaps not widespread but certainly quite frequent nowadays.  This is a problem we have in this country which does not obtain in other countries.  Certainly it is something which needs to be examined and some attempt made to regularise this position.</P>
    <P>The motion talks about the social problems. I agree that certainly the present situation presents very serious social problems which undoubtedly need to be examined.  The Oireachtas Committee is that most appropriate method of examining the problem.  It is not merely a matter of examining the problem but of deciding what can be done to solve it, to examine the ramifications of taking any <Col N="74" /> particular action and to weigh up the good and bad results.  Such a committee would help in arriving at proposals and recommendations which would take into consideration all aspects of this situation. I hope this committee will be set up and that in due course it will make proposals that will be acceptable as far as possible to all those concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make perfectly clear is the position of the Labour Party in policy terms.  In the mid-seventies the Labour Party, not capriciously but after a great deal of consideration decided overwhelmingly at their conference that they were in favour of the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce.  That is the position of the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>I remember very well the circumstances that prevailed when that discussion was taking place and I can see a shadow of it here again this evening.  For example, there was an attempt to confuse a number of things.  The people who were in favour of the removal of the constitutional prohibition on divorce were not saying that the removal of this constitutional provision was an answer to all of the problems of marital breakdown. What they were saying was that the removal of this constitutional prohibition was something which would enable a discussion to take place and enable the options to be put forward and it is quite dishonest to suggest that it was more or less than what it was.</P>
      <P>The argument put forward &mdash; and I was chairman of the party at that time &mdash; was that on the grounds of pluralism, on social grounds and in response to the real conditions of a social kind which existed it simply was unhelpful to have a constitutional prohibition on divorce. The argument was not that this would automatically lead to a solution of problems to which other remedies were obviously appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I listened to the people speaking in favour of the motion and the amendment I had several different inclinations.  My political instincts are entirely to support the motion and the more straightforward speeches that have been made in that <Col N="75" /> regard.  On the other hand, I did not want to be accused of taking such actions as would impede any new form of consensus that might emerge.  I think we should speak directly here this evening.  It was very hard this week to hear about a new consensus that might emerge concerning marriage breakdown when we have had such competitions in opportunism in relation to the previous amendment we were discussing in this House.  It is very difficult for me to sit here and listen to, for example, the law of the four stages through which a case for a constitutional amendment should go.  You debate the existence of a problem &mdash; with the greatest of respect to my colleague Senator Dooge &mdash; then you examine all its aspects, see if you can get agreement and then you look forward to how you can implement this basis of consensus or agreement.  Certainly, this law of the four stages did not apply when an unrepresentative group of people came in to meet the leaders of the two parties and produced an appallingly hyprocritical formulation which is now going to cost the people money, and which, interestingly, the people do not want.  That is another fact we want to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to argue that polls should indicate the need for a referendum or not but in the case of the referendum which the basic motion suggests, all the evidence is that the people want that referendum.  Furthermore, they are willing to support it and that support grows every year.  The evidence is that they do not want the other referendum but they are going to get that one even if they do not want it and even if the support for it is decreasing every day.  It seems to me to be rather extraordinary that you can impose conditions on the case for a referendum that people want and that you are willing to abandon all of these completely when you are anxious &mdash; let us be clear &mdash; to say yes to a group of people, mostly on the basis of fear and political opportunism.  Perhaps the fear and political opportunism define their own laws and their own laws of different stages.  Perhaps there is only one stage to moral capitulation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> There are other arguments that have been made that I think should be replied to because they are very important.  As I listened to the speeches of those who were arguing striking positions against divorce I was not very convinced.  After all, I am a sociologist and I find myself almost cringing when I hear the certainty with which people make statements about the impact of divorce on society. Many of us have studied this for decades and we know that it is factually untrue to link the fact of divorce with many social indicators that have never been proved to be derived entirely and exclusively from the availability of divorce in different forms.  I have not time this evening to go through that argument.  What we do know is that there are 70,000 adults who will be affected by our attitude in insisting on removing the constitutional prohibition on divorce.</P>
    <P>I want to look at one usual piece of prejudiced moralising, for example, that divorce has an irrevocable effect on the family.  I repeat, the case for that has not been made, that it has an irrevocable effect on children.  I could produce dozens of reports to show that some of the most severe damage has been done to children where people have fought in front of each other and have insisted on sticking together.  All the evidence on violence in the home shows that it is transmitted generationally from families from all classes who have seen it as a regular response to differences between couples.  In fact, I would love to see evidence to show what comparisons might be made between the impact on children of parents who regularly argue and who cannot live together, and children of adults who make the mature decision that their union has irretrievably broken down and that they they must live apart. It would be very useful to see that evidence and I hope that it is provided for the committee.</P>
    <P>To make a political point, I worry about people who are saying that they are waiting for a consensus.  I hope the Minister of State will convince me in this regard when she comes to reply.  What evidence is there that we want to have a consensus that would be based on an <Col N="77" /> honest approach to this problem?  I believe that has been eroded every day since 1967.  What we saw recently was the very worst kind of moralising, rather than a moral position, people striking and affecting a high moral tone about what they believe to be the necessary ingredients of Irish society.</P>
    <P>I think that Irish society has many defects.  One of them is its flair for dishonesty and its willingness to put public poses in matters such as marital relationships before any genuine compassion or any adequate legislative response to complicated social problems.  These are the questions I would ask before I make up my mind what to do.  What will be the terms of reference of the new committee? When will it report?  Will the Seanad be represented on it?  What sections of the Seanad will be represented on it?  Will Senator Robb of the Independent group be represented on it and so on?  We need to know these details before we decide whether or not to support the amendment. Certainly, Senator Robb, having proposed this motion, is entitled to that knowledge and it is something that I hope will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the dilemma that has been posed by the concept of nullity.  I was a Member of the Seanad from 1973 to 1977 when the nullity ghost arrived.  If you want to be really dishonest, you suggest that there is a parallel in the principles of jurisprudence from which the nullity procedures operate and the civil law operates.  They are different; they cannot be regarded as parallel and it is simply evasive, wrong and dishonest to suggest that the civil law can mirror existing nullity matters.  Let us think of the philosophical background to such a suggestion.  It is often now proposed by a rather repetitive small lobby that you should simply make the civil law fit with the procedures of the Roman Catholic Church.  If that is not sectarian, what is?  But that is not my principal objection to it.  The legal people who sit in this House know better than I do that the procedures in civil law cannot be accommodated to neatly handle the procedures in relation to nullity.</P>
    <P>Senator Robb mentioned how you can <Col N="78" /> secretly get a divorce in Ireland.  You can be rich enough to go and live abroad for a while and then come home with your foreign divorce &mdash; and I will use the phrase he did not get to use &mdash; to the &ldquo;divorce-free zone&rdquo;, and you can park your foreign divorce in the divorce free zone and be the envy of all the miserable people who are forced to live in celibacy because we want to keep insisting that this is a country that will have a Constitution that will always preclude the option of divorce.  It is time that this dishonesty was called what it is &mdash; dishonesty and political cowardice.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the rubbish which has been put into the newspapers about the impact on children.  I am the longest serving lecturer in the university system on the sociology of law, delinquency and crime and I want to place it on record that everything we know about delinquency and children in crime does not support automatically any connection with conditions of divorce.  We could show that, for example, the children in trouble come really from poor homes that had been put under enormous pressure from unemployment and the absence of social provision, from families that stuck together in their misery and in their poverty often without assistance from the State, with little compassion, often being offered, for example, valium instead of adequate housing or a regular job.</P>
    <P>I find it quite interesting to hear people striking poses like, for example, the notion that once you start introducing divorce it is almost uncontrollable.  People are speaking about matters like the constitutional ban on divorce as if they were speaking about ivy in a garden.  The only thing that is missing from the debate so far is the connection between divorce, euthanasia, abortion, homosexuality and so on &mdash; all one great part of a great slide which the Irish nation is about to rush down at any time.</P>
    <P>It is now 1983.  I have to remind myself quite regularly that we are living in this decade.  I find it quite incredible to have people introducing bogus statements with a high moralising tone to them rather than any facts in relation to the implications of divorce.  We have a major <Col N="79" /> social problem on our hands and we must face up to it.  We have wasted weeks on something that no representative group wanted and we have spent decades neglecting the problems of women, children and families.  We are now going to frankly face up to our problems by rejecting the case for the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce.  Those who have dealt with couples who can no longer live together will tell you that it is not divorce that breaks up marriages. After marriages have been broken up and people have gone through the pain and the disappointment of a love that did not work out, or perhaps injudicious unions and so on, are they to be condemned to live separated from each other?  In Ireland we say &ldquo;no&rdquo;: they can live in deceit and in hypocrisy.  Perhaps they will have enough money to go to the Pope himself and he will declare it never happened.  The marriage never existed and the children are figments of the parents' imagination.  They can walk around the place but meanwhile back in Ireland the Constitution will say we are a country that will never allow divorce.</P>
    <P>All the tones have been struck about, for example, the Church alone is not concerned about the moral state of Ireland.  Of course it is not exclusively concerned.  We should be rightly concerned about social morality but it is surely part of social morality that you behave with compassion and that you address your problems and not ignore them.  It is very wrong to pretend that the people who support the motion are not interested in the other options that are available for marital breakdown.  I have every sympathy with Senator Ross's position in which he makes the point that once we pass this motion and commit ourselves to removing the constitutional ban we can at the same time go on with the work of the committee.  I do not think that it is exclusive.  I am willing to allow the committee to come into existence but, equally, I find it necessary personally to declare my deep distrust of the people who have come to the committee late. Who knows why they held up the committee? Perhaps they were themselves <Col N="80" /> coming to some far-reaching proposal of which I have not heard yet.  It is important that a time limit be put on this committee and that the committee not be used as an excuse for not holding an urgent constitutional reform.</P>
    <P>It was said that our position is complicated by the fact that we are a Christian nation.  I found the phrase interesting because it is almost like a revealing Freudian slip.  I think it is time that we regarded our Christianity, if we have it, as a little bit more than a complication. The people who have been dealing with couples to counsel them would tell you that none of them have lightly experienced what they have experienced. I have every sympathy with patient people who represent over 70,000 people &mdash; the Divorce Action Group &mdash; who have sent documentation to all of us. They have waited patiently for something which appeared to be coming in 1967, that was put in a Constitution in 1937 in a denominational atmosphere.  The atmosphere of the thirties was one of denominationalism and now in the 1980s they want simply a prohibition removed so that all the other things that we mentioned can go on.  What should happen is that if the committee does not come up with adequate proposals and if it seeks for example to put the red herring of annulment at the top of the agenda so as to block divorce being discussed then at that time the motion should re-enter the Seanad Order Paper and it should be supported.  My personal view, and I will place it on the record, is that I think it was a disastrous inclusion in the Constitution in the first place and it is long overdue that it should be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate.  It is a good thing that we have started discussing marital breakdown in the Dáil and the Seanad.  Before I address myself to this subject I would like to deal first of all with a couple of points raised by Senator Ross.  He was uncomfortable with two words in the amendment, &ldquo;proposal&rdquo; and &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo;.  I would suggest that it is more than a proposal at the moment. <Col N="81" /> There is agreement in principle and the proposal is not bogged down.  Talks have already commenced and are going somewhere. The Senator was worried about the recommendations.  Recommendations are all that any Oireachtas committee can make.  I would remind the Senator that changes in the law are a matter for the Dáil and the Seanad.  Further, consensus and agreement have a much greater chance of success than the proposals in the motion.  Senator Higgins has made, as usual, a compassionate and caring contribution.  I would ask him to be more positive and more hopeful about the proposed committee.  It will not be treated in an off-hand manner and as far as I am concerned it will be given the urgency it deserves.</P>
      <P>While I can understand and appreciate the sentiments behind the motion, I believe that the Government approach, as represented in the amendment supporting the setting up of the Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown, is by far the most sensible course to adopt at this stage, and I ask the House to approve it.  Consensus is vitally important on issues such as this and, quite apart from any other consideration, the setting up of a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas will allow the Seanad to play its proper role in forming public policy.</P>
      <P>It may perhaps not be generally appreciated that marriage has become a less popular institution in the past ten years. The number of marriages contracted in 1971 was 22,014 as compared with only 20,550 marriages in 1981, despite a corresponding increase in the order of 30 per cent in population between the ages of 15 and 44.  The answer obviously lies partly in the financial burdens faced by couples getting married and setting up a home together, but it is also clear that many couples are viewing with severe scepticism the rigidity and the inflexibility of marriage in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Marriage as an institution may be undergoing a major historical change. The traditional role of the father as the authoritative figure and breadwinner with the mother playing a subservient role in the home looking after the children is rapidly changing.  The increasing <Col N="82" /> equality of the sexes both inside and outside the home has created its own momentum.  The emphasis is now on the sharing of responsibilities and on companionship in marriage.  This had led to increasing pressures and increasing conflict &mdash; it has also generated a movement towards change which we must face up too.  Quite simply, couples are much more reluctant to enter into life-long commitments or to put up indefinitely with the types of difficulties which they would have readily accepted years ago. They look to more liberal arrangements abroad and they cannot understand why our laws should differ so much.</P>
    <P>Most marriages are, of course, stable, loving and good relationships.  They are satisfying to the partners involved and they provide a secure and happy environment for the children.  On the other side of the coin the reality is &mdash; and we must be prepared to face up to it &mdash; that many marriages break down, some of them irretrievably, and this frequently happens without any malicious intent or ill-will on the part of the people involved.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdown can be represented in terms of tens of thousands of men, women and children with all the resulting misery and desolation that that implies.  It is a matter for the private domain, but it is also of very serious concern to the State because, at the end of the day, it is the State which picks up the cost &mdash; through social welfare payments, legal aid and coping with children at risk.  Of greater real importance in my opinion is the ongoing human misery which is incalculable.</P>
    <P>There are few matters of more immediate public concern than marriage breakdown and it is entirely proper that the situation should be considered by a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas. There is, correctly, emphasis in the Government approach on the need to protect marriage and this should lead us to consider how the resources of the State, along with the caring help of voluntary organisations, can be mobilised in support of marriage.  We need to define the role the State might play in preparing people for marriage relationships.  We need to look at our counselling provisions <Col N="83" /> and consider the question of conciliation in the event of marriage breakdown and, above all, we need to consider how the laws of the State should deal in a humane way with marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has already indicated in the Dáil that the constitutional ban on divorce should be considered by an Oireachtas committee.  It is perhaps worth noting here the work of an earlier committee.  The 1967 committee was not an Oireachtas committee: it was an informal committee and, therefore, it had less status.  Many people believe that the 1967 Committee on the Constitution recommended the abolition of the constitutional prohibition on divorce but this is not entirely so; what the committee did was to consider inserting an alternative to the existing provisions at Article 41.3.2. of the Constitution which would read &ldquo;in the case of a person who was married in accordance with the rites of a religion, no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of that marriage on the grounds other than those acceptable to that religion&rdquo;.  This was a very well-meaning and well-intentioned recommendation in 1967, but I believe that a solution on these lines would not find general favour in the circumstances of 1983.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of our marriage laws which need to be looked at. Pre-eminently the question of nullity of marriage must be considered in the context of the rules applied by the Catholic Church which have resulted in many people living in what is regarded by the civil law as a bigamous situation.  Even legal separation, or to use, perhaps, its outdated term &ldquo;divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>&rdquo; can be granted in the State only on the basis of adultery, cruelty or unnatural practices.  Without anticipating the work of the committee in too much detail, it is quite clear that the whole approach to marriage law in this country needs to be looked at critically by people who are in touch with society and who know and appreciate the day-to-day problems that arise.  The issues involved are very complex and at times potentially divisive but they will not go away and, while the <Col N="84" /> Oireachtas committee will not provide the answer to all the problems, it will, hopefully, focus in depth public and political attention on this human problem.</P>
    <P>Above all, we need a measure of political agreement and consensus.  I have made clear, both inside and outside the Oireachtas, my view that no party can claim a moral prerogative which would enable them to ignore this issue, and that no party can claim a monopoly of virtue. The people who elect us are entitled to expect that we will at least have the courage to look at the contemporary difficulties of society.  For those reasons, I am very glad that the Fianna Fáil Party have now agreed in principle to take part in the proceedings of the committee.  I know that the Seanad will be able to make a special contribution to the work of the committee, given the interest and expertise of Members.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to tell Senators that the setting up of the Oireachtas committee will in no way diminish the Government's commitment to bringing forward reforms in those areas of family law which are already in hand.  The Minister for Justice recently announced proposals for reform in the laws on matrimonial property which will recognise the joint interest of the spouse in the family home.  This is a very welcome and worthwhile addition to the family home protection legislation which was initially introduced by Deputy Cooney as Minister for Justice.  For my part.  I am involved with the reform of the law on illegitimacy and I hope it will be possible to bring this matter to Government very shortly. These are very definite indications of the Government's determination to press forward with family law reform, and the setting up of the Oireachtas committee is the next logical step in that process.  I ask the House to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am never sure whether there is a certain mystical aura about this House which enables us to avoid reality with a capacity for obliviousness which exceeds anything in any other area of society.  Contrary to the long-fingering of this issue, and the public posturing of <Col N="85" /> Members of this and the other House, it is recognised in private, as one very senior member of Fianna Fáil in the other House said to me, that martial breakdown is the biggest social problem in Irish society today.  The party's attitude to the problem would not suggest that the view was shared by his colleagues, though I suspect it is.  Who can be more aware of the scale of marital breakdown, of marital violence, of marital silence which is probably nearly as painful as marital violence, than the average Member of the Oireachtas who is dealing with hundreds if not thousands of constituents per month, many of whom bring up this problem over and over again?  There is no point in pretending that the problem does not exist.  I do not want to argue about the scale of the problem.  People inside and outside this House are aware that it is an extensive and increasing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could argue about what causes this problem but we are not sociologists. There is only one professional sociologist here and he is more than capable of expounding the sociological view of these issues without my amateurish dabblings in that area.  What is a fact is that marital breakdown is widespread and very real. Neither is it so new.  I remember an eminent Dominican priest at least ten if not 15 years ago on a television programme dealing with what he described at the great silence, in other words, the absolute lack of verbal communication &mdash; I am not talking about the more profound concepts of communication but the actual exchange of words &mdash; between partners in marriage.  He estimated that in 25 per cent of marriages there was total silence between the partners.  This was his estimate.  He is not given to sensational pronouncements.  He is a very compassionate, caring man who I am sure accepts his own Church's teaching in the area of the indissolubility of marriage. That was some ten years ago.  I suspect that if we did have, but we never will have, the resources to do so, we would find that silence, pain, misery of one kind or another have been parts of a large number of Irish marriages for a long time. There was such an extraordinary severe social stigma attached to the idea that a <Col N="86" /> marriage was not working that we managed to convey to ourselves the illusion that all, or almost all, Irish marriages were blissfully happy with few or no problems and that it is only this new liberal and dangerously permissive younger generation who got this notion about marital breakdown.  Unhappy marriages have probably been a fact of Irish life for generation upon generation.  We just did not get around to recognising it, as with many other things.  For instance, sexual problems have been ignored for generations.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, divorce is not a solution to the causes of marital breakdown or to any of the problems that exist in marriage. I would go further.  There is a tendency in present day society to advocate almost entire and total predominance of the happiness of an individual in terms of defining what is socially acceptable even if that produces consequences for other people which are more or less severe.  In some cases the idea of the acceptability of divorce seems to be that nobody can be expected to live within an unhappy marriage since a person has only one life.  I do not accept that view.  If you take on the commitment of marriage &mdash; and children are a consequence of taking on that commitment &mdash; then it is simply not enough to say, &ldquo;My marriage is a miserable experience.&rdquo;  Nobody, not even Senator Higgins, has convinced me yet that children are necessarily worse off in an unsatisfactory marriage than they would be in the consequences of a marital division or a marital dissolution.  There is considerable evidence in the United States that children, asked their view, say that given a choice they would prefer their often warring parents to stay together rather than to separate.  Central to all of this is the responsibility to children of adults who bring those children into the world, and the welfare of the children cannot be ignored and must be considered.  Just to say that a marriage is a failure is not of itself to justify divorce as a solution to that problem because the children cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>In terms of the moral self-righteousness about divorce that this country reeks <Col N="87" /> of we ignore the consequences of our ideas on divorce and their impact on women in particular.  We have an idealised notion in this country of the happy housewife at home minding the children very much exemplified by Ibsen's <i>A Doll's House</i> wife who was compared to a doll to be fondled by her husband on occasions and to perform in the way he expected her to perform.  This is the kind of idealised notion of womanhood and woman in marriage that is fostered in our Constitution but which, as women begin to discover themselves as distinct from being influenced by anybody else, is becoming less and less satisfactory as a model of living for women.  Therefore, our attitudes to divorce expounded mostly by a male Oireachtas and by male dominated Churches cannot really include understanding of the impact on women of this over-simplified model of marriage and its indissolubility.</P>
    <P>In that process we have managed to ignore for generations the problem of violence in marriage.  Violence in marriage has always existed.  It took women to expose the problem of violence in marriage, although many others in society knew about the problem.  Male politicians must have known about it.  Male clergy of all denominations must have known, but it was eventually women who acknowledged and brought into the open the appalling and frightening extent of violence within marriage.  The extraordinary presumption of subordination of woman within marriage is still contained even in our law and men assume and presume about it.  As I have said previously here, this House often presumes about it in its total ignoring of family commitments and the way it orders its business and its Members and deals with its membership.  We all assume that our wives and families at home are subordinate to the great interests of this House. We are not above criticism ourselves in our own assumption about the subordination of our female spouses.  There are only a small number of married women in this House.  We assume that they are subordinate and their welfare and their needs are subordinate to the great affairs <Col N="88" /> of State.  What we do for our great affairs every other male-dominated institution will do for their equally perceived great affairs.</P>
    <P>We are treated regularly to lectures about discouragement of divorce, usually in quotes and capital letters, and particular emphasis is put on the worries and needs of children as a consequence of any introduction of divorce.  Politicians preach on the one hand about the scourge of divorce in society, the sanctity of the family and the need to uphold the family and to preserve and look after the welfare of children in a society which has been as neglectful as ours has been, for instance, of family support.  We still have no statutory counselling services for families. We have left that entirely to the Churches, perhaps because we were afraid to do it because the Churches might object, but also, I suspect, because we are happy not to do it when somebody else will do it for nothing and therefore we avoid the consequences of the State becoming involved in that area.  If the State were to be involved in that area we would begin to become officially aware of the scale and extent of family problems and then we would have less excuse for ignoring them.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of the ISPCC in Wexford who set up a family centre which was closed down by the State even though it was doing the sort of job that the State had signally failed to do for generations, in other words provide an environment in which families could learn to work out their own problems together.</P>
    <P>We have scandalously neglected our services to children notwithstanding the amount of hand-wringing and bemoaning of the threat to children of introducing divorce.  Where children are already at risk and threatened we have inadequate if not non-existent services in so many areas that I could not start to list them. I am reminded of a Minister of State in a previous Government who gave a lecture on the fact that the adoption laws could not be rewritten or amended because the voluntary organisations involved in adoption had not got around to drafting legislation, and how could he be expected to do it when the voluntary <Col N="89" /> organisations did not do it?  That is an interesting reversal of the roles of people outside this House and inside.  We have not had any commitment to our children and we do not really do much to protect our children other than to define them as the property of their parents and subordinate them to the rights of their parents.</P>
    <P>A woman has no rights or very limited legal rights to the income of her husband as long as he is living in the home, irrespective of the way he treats his wife and we put up various fatuous arguments as to what we might do if we have to deal with something like that.  Relatively recently we allowed women the right to children's allowances.  We still have not given them a legal right to a substantial part of the wage earner's salary.  I do not know why but I suppose it has something to do with us all being men and being worried about the consequences for our virility of not having control over our income.  We have insisted that deserted wives are not deserted if they leave the home because of violence.  A wife is not a deserted wife unless the husband leaves, extraordinarily enough irrespective of the consequences.  We have the law on domicile.  It would appear self-evident that for a family to succeed they need a home and they must be able to afford a home and the major element in the cost of a home is the price of building land.  We have ignored that problem for 25 years because of a constitutional provision which protects the interests of the minority irrespective of the damage that that can do to large numbers of families and we cut back on our housing allocation at the first sign of a financial crisis.</P>
    <P>Looming behind all of this is the role of the major Church in our society and I do not think that it performs a role any different from what any other Church would perform if it were in a majority position.  I do not think the Catholic Church is unique in this, but it seems ironic to insist on the need for civil law to enforce the law of God when one considers St. Paul's references to the glory of the freedom of the children of God and at the same time the Church apparently needs recourse to the laws of man because it is worried that it cannot <Col N="90" /> through faith persuade people to observe the laws of God.  On one hand that Church feels the need and expresses the desire to hear the people's view in a referendum on one issue but apparently is not equally eager to hear their view on another issue where perhaps the outcome is not so certain.  It does not want to hear people's view on divorce.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, there are a number of circumstances in which it is quite clear that we will not do anything about the problem as it stands.  All of those have to do with children.  I refer to the questions of deserted wives, absolute marital breakdown and real, serious family violence. Solutions might be available to us which would not involve divorce in a different kind of society with different values.  I have no hope that our society as constructed and organised at present could inculcate the sort of values which would bring that about.  Therefore it is necessary that the first step in order to legislate to meet those problems must be the deletion of an article in the Constitution which prohibits any form of legislative solution and therefore I support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to see this motion on the Order Paper and also the Government amendment which I support. I hope that the people of this country who are quite well aware that marital breakdown is a major social problem and who look to this House and the other House of the Oireachtas for relevance will see in our debate today that not a Member in this House is unaware of the situation and is not prepared to seek for solutions.  Following Senator Brendan Ryan for someone like me who is a feminist is a little daunting because he is making his mark in this House in a tendency to make some of the finest feminist speeches any of us have ever heard and I am sorry he is not supporting the amendment.  I like much of what he said, particularly about the changing role of women in marriage and how this is having an effect on marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly welcome the setting up of the all-party Oireachtas committee on marriage. I am pleased that the hesitancy, <Col N="91" /> doubt, fear and suspicion that seemed to bedevil them have evaporated and I hope that their terms of reference will soon be made known to us and that they will be set up shortly and get to work.  I would like to think that they would have a time limit within which to bring their recommendations and findings to both Houses of the Oireachtas because this is a major social problem fraught with danger for those involved in it.  The sooner we bring forward solutions the sooner we will be in the business of reform, and I like to think that in a time of great fiscal lack we in this Government are in the business of reform, because there is much that we would like to do but which cannot be done when the purse is not full.  However, in a situation like this when reform is needed and energy, enthusiasm and commitment are required, we will not fail.</P>
    <P>The task of this committee &mdash; in talking about them one merely wishes to encourage them and cannot pre-empt their findings &mdash; will be to assemble relevant data and to seek the opinions of experts in the field of marital breakdown. I see the people in the areas of law, psychology, sociology, theology and other disciplines which relate to marriage being consulted and their considered opinion brought to bear on the area of marital breakdown and on marriage in modern conditions.  The members of this committee will have a very onerous but worthwhile task ahead of them.  Their findings will be awaited with much interest not only by those people whom I have mentioned who are personally affected by marital disharmony but by all who have an interest in the welfare of Irish society and its future.  I wish this committee well in their deliberations.  So many of our people look to Parliament to give a lead in what is becoming an increasingly complex world and they are so often disappointed because they fail to see that lead emerging.  Let us hope that in making their recommendations and analysing the causes of marital breakdown this committee will show compassion, insight and sensitivity but above all courage.  They need to have courage to bring forward possible solutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Having listened to all the speakers who contributed to this debate to date I have a feeling that this committee will not skirt around the question of divorce.  I am confident that, while they will not see it as a first solution, they will certainly bring it forward as a possibility which we must face.  The motion shows a very narrow concentration on divorce and the necessity of allowing it.  Though I understand the frustration and irritation felt by those who bring forward the motion, I think that in narrowly concentrating on divorce and the prohibition of it being removed from the Constitution there is a tendency to obscure the problems caused by marital failure.  There could be a tendency to impede search for constructive and effective remedies.  We must tackle the problem at source by developing new ways of dealing with difficult marriages, by insisting on proper preparation for marriage by ensuring that the first recourse when a crisis occurs is not a lawyer trained in advocacy and pitched battle techniques which so often militate against reconciliation. These are some the things we ought to be doing if we are really concerned to stop the rot setting into the entire institution of marriage and in addition we should have a facility for severing the bounds when there is no hope of the parties ever making a success of their marriage, a facility which is and should be a last rather than a first resort.</P>
    <P>The committee could have an input in the area of preparation for marriage.  As a public representative and a member of a local authority I have occasion to deal with large numbers of people, many of them young married couples, coming to me on the matter of housing.  It is daunting and somewhat depressing if not horrifying to recognise that so many have been so inadequately prepared for marriage. Their values seem to be drawn from <i>Dynasty</i> and other television soapbox operas and they have an expectation of marriage and a rosy future the fulfilment of which is out of the question.  It is sad when the disillusion and the rot set in and the despair is evident and they expect the State and the social services to prop up the dream and the reality, to provide a house, to provide all that they dreamt <Col N="93" /> they would need and want and which they feel society owes them.  They just have not been prepared for marriage or the reality of living and sharing and making a future.  The committee could have some impact in bringing forward solutions and certainly in bringing into our education system some realistic preparation for marriage which is still a goal which most human beings aspire to.  I believe in love and in loving and being loved.  Hetrosexual love is the most rewarding and fulfilling feeling that any human being can experience.</P>
    <P>Without loving and being loved the human spirit can shrivel and die.  But love cannot carry all the demands of life which is what so many young people expect it to do.  Intelligence, awareness, information and competence must be added into the mixture.  We are at the beginning or well into the evolution of man and the human spirit.  Probably never before have so many people been discouraged and dissatisfied with the state of the human condition as now.  Everywhere large pockets of people are crying out for change.  The main cry seems to be for greater feelings of individual self-esteem and loving-nurturing contexts that go with it.  Old, traditional, entrenched human attitudes die hard.  It is a question of whether the old attitudes will die and new ones be born or civilisation as we know it will die.</P>
    <P>In the area of marriage we must have a breakthrough, certainly in the context of this country where our laws because of our Constitution deny a basic reality that so many people know is a reality but which we are refusing to recognise.  I work in politics on the side of keeping civilisation going with new values about human beings.  I want to see constructive change and I hope that when this committee make their recommendations on marriage we will see the awareness of the stresses and strains which modern conditions have imposed on marriage.  An examination of marriage in modern conditions, an examination of contemporary marriage is a response to the tragedy of the breakdown in marriage which all thinking, aware adults recognise is getting out of hand.  I support the setting up <Col N="94" /> of the committee.  I recognise marital breakdown as a reality and a great tragedy which we must address ourselves to. I feel that the proposers of the motion are adopting an unduly pessimistic attitude towards the committee.  After all, no all-party Oireachtas committees have really got off the ground yet.  An exception is not being made of this one committee. I am confident that its members will be realistic, compassionate and caring and that they will bring forward recommendations. I am prepared, when these recommendations come forward, to be extremely critical if they do not consider all the options which I feel must be considered and if they do not grasp nettles firmly which need to be grasped. For the moment I feel that the area is so complex, that so many people need to be invited to make submissions, that we must allow this committee to proceed with their work and bring forward their recommendations.  I look forward to this.</P>
    <P>I have spoken in the past about wanting to see a pluralist society, about wanting to see our Constitution reflect the aims and aspirations of all Irish people and I hope the committee will have something to say about that when they make their recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very impressed by Senator Bulbulia's contribution.  Senator Higgins took exception to some Members who spoke with certainty and I want to confess that I do not speak with any certainty.  I hope I speak sincerely, and I share the concern and compassion of Senator Higgins.  I welcome the all-party committee on marital breakdown. They have a major task before them.  I wish them well and I hope that they will get through the work in as short a time as possible.  I believe that in their deliberations divorce must be considered.  It is hard to believe that a solution will be found which does not include divorce in some instances.  I realise that divorce would, in its own way, introduce other problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The religious aspect has been referred to on a few occasions.  It is an important aspect.  In a previous contribution here I stated that I found difficulty in isolating <Col N="95" /> the definitive Protestant view, and I did not say that with any criticism.  With regard to the Roman Catholic Church I also have a problem.  While in the main I do not have difficulty in understanding what the official view of the Church is, I am not too sure that the behaviour of the members of that Church in their lives reflect in totality at least the views of that Church.  I believe that the teaching of the Church &ldquo;Whom God hath joined together let no man put assunder,&rdquo; and the vows at marriage &ldquo;until death do us part&rdquo; should be the norm that Senator Eoin Ryan spoke about and will continue to be the norm.  Everybody agrees that marital breakdown is a major social problem and a growing problem.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a document which all Members of the Oireachtas received from the Divorce Action Group in relation to the extent of marital breakdown. It states that it occurs in this country under the followings headings: desertion, divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>&mdash; which is judicial separation &mdash; separation agreements, civil annulment, Church annulment, barring orders and custody of children actions.  It states on page 5:</P>
    <P>There are no accurate statistics whatever readily available on a comprehensive total for these various groupings.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>One indicator of the growth in marital breakdown is the number of applications for deserted wives' allowance and benefit.  This has risen from a total of around 10,000 in 1980 to a total of almost 15,000 to date.  The average number of applications for deserted wives' allowance in the first ten years of operation up to 1980 was about 1,000 per year and the current average appear to be 2,000 per year.  These are applications only and the number in receipt of deserted wives' allowance and benefit is far less presumably as women under 40 with no children and without benefit and those in receipt of £38 per week or more do not benefit either.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="96" /> Further down it continues:</P>
    <P>(k) By assuming that marital breakdown was not a significant feature of Irish life before 1960 and by calculating on the basis of a gradually increasing rate of marital breakdown Divorce Action Group concludes that there are 70,000 adults involved in marital breakdown at present.  All indications are that the rate of breakdown is increasing.  A crude test question is to ask an Irish person if he knows of a marital breakdown in his personal knowledge.  The answer almost invariably is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>According to a table in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 22 May 1983 the Dublin metropolitan and county District Court applications for maintenance orders in 1977 were 653; in 1978, 1,109 and in 1979, 1,363.  The number of barring orders sought in 1976 was 180; in 1977, 257; in 1978, 403 and in 1979, 633.  The number of High Court actions for maintenance in 1977 was 148; in 1978, 196, and in 1979, 263.  The number of child custody cases in 1977 was 182; in 1978, 211; in 1979, 295.  The number of applications for Catholic Church annulments was in 1979, 623; in 1980, 694 and in 1981, 687.  I want to make the point in passing that it is the general belief, rightly or wrongly, that finance is a factor in getting annulments through with some speed.</P>
    <P>There are many causes of marital breakdowns and it is not easy to deal with them.  I will list some of them, affluence, education, liberation of women, working wives, the traditional role changed, technology and progress, authority and religion and the shift in sexual morality.  I am not sure how they should be dealt with. On affluence can we turn back the clock in any way?  What can we do about education, liberation of women or working wives?  Everybody I am sure is agreed that wives who want to work, and have something to contribute professionally, should be encouraged and be given every help to do so.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the traditional role of the family.  I do not advocate divorce.  One of the consequences of the problem, as mentioned in the Minister's <Col N="97" /> speech is that experimentation takes place where couples are living together without being married.  I do not condone or condemn that but it is something to be concerned about.  Like Senator Higgins, I do not believe that provision for divorce will be an evil influence or that it will become the norm.  With regard to legislating for divorce, that is covered fully and sympathetically in the Divorce Action Group literature, which Members received.  One of the topics they suggest should be dealt with in a Bill is counselling and conciliation and that is dealt with in detail in the document which shows great sympathy and understanding. Other headings suggested for a Bill are, separation, proceedings relating to the status of marriage and the dissolution of marriage.  The document states that the grounds for dissolution of marriage should be that marriage has broken down irreconcilably on the following basis:</P>
    <P>(x) years separation in accordance with the Bill; A recognised separation order or agreement in force for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The welfare of children is taken into consideration as is maintenance and property, and the influence which divorce would have on children.  I must agree with Senator Higgins in that respect because in a situation where cruelty is a problem in a marriage and children are involved divorce would solve that.  That is covered very well in the literature we got.  We were also briefed on the Law Reform Commission Report on Illegitimacy and that must be a major consideration. Divorce is dealt with fully and sympathetically in the document circulated to all Members of the Oireachtas. I understand that opinion polls in recent years have shown sympathy towards the question of divorce.  All the implications will have to be considered and we have the experience of other countries to help us.</P>
    <P>Divorce is a last resort.  There are very few human beings in a marriage situation who would not admit that every marriage has some strain.  Divorce will only be considered as part of this enormous task which is facing the all-party committee <Col N="98" /> on marital breakdown.  I was impressed by Senator Robb who spoke of the sanctity of marriage and said that the problems in this area were not alone problems for politicians but involved philosophers, theologians and sociologists.  I was impressed by Senator Dooge who said it was important to get an answer which would be right and one which can be implemented.  I look forward to a solution in the report of the all-party committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to a maximum of ten minutes and that will leave some time for others.  This is an issue which I welcome the opportunity to debate in the Seanad because I have participated, as other Senators have, in so many meetings and public debates on this issue outside the Oireachtas.  It is a matter which has been discussed widely and publicly over the last few years.  Frequently, particularly towards the end of public meetings when all the arguments had been gone into and many of the issues discussed this afternoon had been raised by speakers from the platform and, sometimes more graphically and more touchingly, by members of the audience, again and again &mdash; and I am sure other public representatives &mdash; have been asked why it is that we cannot progress on this issue when the arguments are so irrefutable? Perhaps we have to have a joint committee to bring all those arguments together but once they are brought together I can <Col N="99" /> assure the House that the case is unanswerable for reform in a broad based way but also for the removal of the prohibition on divorce.  That cannot be lost sight of.  Once we seriously apply ourselves and conscientiously examine the matter then the legal case is unanswerable.  The present law in this area is a disgrace.  As legislators we can only be ashamed of our lack of attention to this issue.  The law in the broad sense, our family law, because of the absence of proper procedures and mechanisms, proper supports and preventive measures and also the absence of a legal remedy for a breakdown of marriage which enables parties to enter into a second stable relationship, is indefensible, discriminatory and oppressive.  It daily oppresses a very large number of couples and their children here.  We can only reflect with sadness and a sense of shame &mdash; this is not the first time I have used that word in the House recently &mdash; on the fact that we have not been able to make substantial progress.</P>
      <P>In a way, having spoken on the issue so often in other contexts, it is difficult to know on what part to focus in trying to ensure that the debate moves along a little.  I am certainly helped in that regard by agreeing so substantially with a number of the contributions and points made, particularly the contribution of my colleague Senator Higgins, and those of Senators Ryan, Bulbulia and, indeed, with a number of the points made by Senator Fitzsimons who referred to the memorandum prepared by the Divorce Action Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the Divorce Action Group who, in a remarkable way over the past number of years, have gathered together whatever statistical information that is there and it is very inadequate for the social problems that are involved.  They have gone about in the most democratic and proper way the business of trying to persuade and lobby for what they believe to be a desirable and necessary objective.  Indeed, they are a shining model of what a group can do who apply themselves with an emphasis on the democratic process, on discussion and information and on persuasion <Col N="100" /> rather than blackmail, bullying or hidden tactics of seeking to exercise some undue pressure or leverage on public representatives.  Therefore, it was sad at times at public meetings to see the extent to which those active in the Divorce Action Group, and ordinary prople who attended those meetings, became depressed at the lack of progress.</P>
    <P>The main thing we should focus on for the remainder of this debate is how do we ensure that progress will now be made in a structured and systematic way on this issue.  In that regard I obviously welcome the presence in the House for this debate of the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs.  I welcome her contribution in referring to the immediate establishment of an Oireachtas Committee on marital breakdown and the fact that the Taoiseach has indicated that the issue of divorce will be referred to that committee.  I have to say that I was disappointed with other aspects of her contribution. I am disappointed that as the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs she is not taking more of a lead in relation to the approach which the committee and which she, as Minister with responsibility for women's affairs, would like to see adopted.  Perhaps she feels it is possible to achieve a consensus by not revealing any views or any commitments in the matter herself.  I do not agree with that.  The way to achieve a genuine movement leading to a political consensus for reform in the matter is to take a lead, to give a focus and direction both to the committee and to how they will approach and consider their work. For example, it is not clear what the time scale of the joint committee will be.  It is not clear what the time scale will be for setting the committee up.  We are about to go into the summer recess now.  Will they sit during the summer months as the Forum on proposals for a new Ireland intends doing?  Is it possible that they will sit during July, September and October when the Dáil is not sitting?  Will there be a sub-committee, for example, on the divorce issue so that this issue may be advanced in the context of what is in fact a very broad area of subject matter?  For anybody who is involved in trying to deal <Col N="101" /> with the legal and social problems arising out of marriage breakdown to remit all of that <i>en bloc</i> to a parliamentary committee of all things could be a way of shelving the problem for anything up to five years.  It is possible for a committee, depending on their own sense of pace, how often they meet and go about their business, to sit and stew on the matter for the lifetime of this Government and one may have different views on how long that might be.</P>
    <P>There is a necessity for more evidence of focus and urgency in the establishment and the priorities of this committee.  For example, this committee should bring in a number of interim reports.  They should not so overload themselves with the very general area of the problems that in fact they can take nothing on board and cannot for a long period come back with specific proposals to both Houses and, in particular, with the reinforcement of the Government's intention to bring in reform in this area.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister referred to the fact that there would be Seanad participation. There has been a commitment in the joint programme to have a Joint Committee of both Houses.  There has been some rumour or indication that the committee might have a small membership. That would be quite inadequate.  It is obvious from the contributions already made in this House that there is both an expertise on the issue of marital breakdown and a very genuine commitment in a broad way among the Members of the House.</P>
    <P>When an Oireachtas Committee is being established it would be more appropriate to try to broaden the membership to encompass Members who have an interest in and a willingness to participate and work on that committee and not to confine it so narrowly that it only consists of a small number of representatives, perhaps confined to the political parties and not including Independent Members, or only including a small proportion of those who would be willing to serve.  I say that not only as a general proposition to enable Members of both Houses who wish to have an opportunity of participating, working on this committee <Col N="102" /> and devoting their time and efforts to ensuring that it will do the work which it will be allotted and come back at an early date with proposals for reform, but also because my experience of serving on the EEC Joint Committee on secondary legislation has been that even in a committee of 26 members, there is a small catchment core group who do most of the work.  It needs a relatively broad membership to ensure that there will be a regular core of Deputies and Senators prepared to attend committee meetings which may mean that they will have to leave some other public forum, whether it is a House of the Oireachtas or some other arena, to do work quietly and methodically in committee or in private.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting if the Minister of State had indicated the extent to which this Joint Committee will have hearings in public.  Is it intended that the committee will make themselves available to the voluntary bodies who know so much at first hand about the nature of the problem and are able to provide very clear evidence of how serious both as a social problem and as a legal morass &mdash; that is the politest word I can use &mdash; our whole area of matrimonial law is at the moment?</P>
    <P>It has been said, and it is true, that our family law, including our matrimonial law, has now become the most complex in the world because we do not have any straightforward legal remedy to terminate a marriage relationship which has totally broken down.  We have very complex partial remedies and links between relationships and remedies which try to meet the complexity of human relations. It is only lawyers, social welfare officers, judges and people involved in the front-line who realise how complex ordinary people's relationships can be and how oppressive it is when on top of a considerable degree of human pain and suffering one adds the oppression of stupid, inflexible, rigid, uncaring, unfeeling and out-of-date laws.  This is something which has been a blight on our legal system for a number of years, the absence of any concerted attempt to reform our basic marriage law.  The basic law in relation to a legal separation dates from 1870, it is 113 <Col N="103" /> years old.  It is a totally inadequate response to the problem of marriage breakdown and so are all the other remedies that have been referred to.</P>
    <P>In that regard the case does not only need to be made out but requires that the pattern the Minister is referring to of the increasing evidence of the unpopularity of marriage, must be taken into account and regarded with the gravest seriousness and urgency.  It is remarkable to see the figures in relation to marriage in Ireland, given the demographic structure, the youth and the increasing size of the population. We must appreciate that it is very largely the oppression of the laws and their inadequacy which are a deterrent to people in making the lasting commitment of a marriage.</P>
    <P>I warn the Minister of State that if the present proposals for co-ownership of the matrimonial home are put forward by the Government in the absence of urgent consideration of these measures of reform for marital breakdown, specifically the removal of the ban on divorce, they will be a further deterrent to people getting married and making the commitment to the marriage relationship.  As a measure, it is obviously a progressive measure of social reform.  In the Irish context now it is a further burden on an institution that is overburdened by oppressive and inflexible laws which are creating in themselves a very serious social problem.  We have not got the luxury either of time or of a public that is going to be patient with us as politicians. I welcome the opportunity that we have had to discuss the issue of divorce.</P>
    <P>I affirm &mdash; as I have done for more than a decade &mdash; my own commitment to seeing the ban on divorce removed and our law reflecting the reality and helping people who are caught in a very difficult situation of marital breakdown for whom it is the appropriate remedy in their circumstances, and for the many stable couples in second relationships, or possibly in a third relationship, who are unable to regularise their relationships. We do have very real discriminations in Ireland between what we regard as the model, the married family, and the very <Col N="104" /> many people in stable loving relationships not based on marriage.  Just as the Minister is examining the position of illegitimate children, I urge her to examine the position of the partners in a stable relationship not based on marriage: the fact that they have not got protection under the Family Home Protection Act, no protection in relation to maintenance, no protection in relation to violence and the inadequacies of our laws in this area. They too, are a matter for very serious concern.  In the interest of enabling others to participate in this debate I will conclude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best.  I would like to start by thanking Senator Robinson for cutting her own points short in order to allow me to contribute.</P>
      <P>I say that the marriage between the defendant and myself has irretrievably broken down and I therefore pray this honourable court for orders in the terms of the special summons herein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the final paragraph of a matrimonial affidavit of the type which goes through our courts every day all the year round.  It states that a marriage has irretrievably broken down in a way that our courts already accept to be true.  The courts will act accordingly, except in so far as they cannot dissolve the marriage. They will do everything else they possibly can to deal with this situation but they cannot dissolve the marriage.  It is very important for the public and Members of this House to realise that our courts accept that marriages irretrievably break down and that irretrievable breakdown is pleaded again and again before our <Col N="105" /> judges now.  It is not something that is threatened if we bring in divorce; it is something that is happening already.  We are already surrounded by dead marriages to which we will not give a decent burial.  We simply let them lie around as rotting corpses.</P>
    <P>As regards this motion, like other Senators I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of divorce but I would also press that the motion as originally worded puts the actual hard question, are we willing to move ahead to have a referendum on this issue?  Why are we going to be so coy about this issue and leap instantly into the protection of a select committee where with the other issue that was before us a few weeks ago the party leaders rushed into a commitment to say that they would amend the Constitution without the slightest murmur of a select committee?  Those of us who tried to amend the proposal in order to provide for a select committee to look for all the difficulties inherent in the other amendment of the Constitution were told that our amendments were out of order and could not be discussed.  I find a very strange contrast between the two approaches to these two different things although I would have said that the necessity for this amendment to the Constitution was much more logically, reasonably and publicly proved than the necessity for the previous amendment.  However, given that it is necessary to set up a committee to look into this I hope the committee will do their work properly, but I would prefer if it was included in the terms of reference of the committee, as set out in the amendment, that they had an actual commitment to deal with this specific problem, not just vaguely any legislative or constitutional action that may be required.  The Minister said the committee would hopefully focus in depth public and political attention on this human problem but much as I admire the Minister and her contributions to Irish life, may I say that that is not enough, nor half enough.</P>
    <P>Already the Divorce Action Group, and many other people, including my colleagues in the House and myself, have focused public and political attention <Col N="106" /> on this human problem.  Indeed, so has the Minister and organisations with which the Minister has been closely associated in the past.  There is no problem about focussing attention on it.  There is plenty of attention.  It is doing something about it that we are so shy of.  I go along with Senator Ross in suggesting that we should have a commitment that we do something about this specific area as well as looking into the whole matrimonial law area.  We should do it by May 1984 and not allow the thing to drag on into the convenient obscurity of a committee that goes on and on forever.  Those of us who are involved in the law regarding children know what happened to the task force.  We do not want another matrimonial task force, thank you.  We want something done and done in the short term.  A lot of the research has already been done, and many of the problems have already been identified.</P>
    <P>As far as the committee's work is concerned there are at least two other areas they should deal with besides the constitutional prohibition on divorce.  First of all they should deal with the incredible jungle of legal formalities about the setting up of marriage, a technical problem which I do not have time to go into now, but in which a different set of laws applies to virtually every religious group in the country and which is probably constitutionally discriminatory.  Secondly, there is the area of matrimonial property.  I would most enthusiastically second Senator Robinson who said that the proposal to give the partners 50-50 ownership of the matrimonial home, well meaning though that is, cannot be considered out of the context of the general reform of matrimonial law.  Otherwise, it may create more problems than it hopes to solve.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the idea of a constitutional ban on divorce is that it should protect marriage and the family.  The statistics on marital breakdown here and the amount of our court time that is taken up with such cases indicate that it is one of the most frequent kinds of litigation, probably second only to car accidents.  We do not hear about that because the cases are held in camera but they are nevertheless there.  The courts are crippled with the <Col N="107" /> number of matrimonial cases.  The vast majority of the work of the legal aid board law centres is in the matrimonial field.  We have this problem.  It is clear that the ban on divorce is not preventing marital breakdown.  Therefore, it is time to see what kind of solutions we need. There is no use having a legal morass, as Senator Ross has said, where a couple can emerge with all the ancillary orders that normally go with divorce, custody, access, maintenance, division of the matrimonial property and yet be unable to remarry.  It is so ironic that this kind of irretrievable breakdown is accepted and that these orders are made, that the whole atmosphere is that the marriage is dead and yet a decent burial cannot be given to it.</P>
    <P>There are the legal difficulties created by these continuing dead marriages with regard to succession and the rights of second stable relationships. There are the psychological and emotional difficulties and the unending bitterness of the continuing dead relationship.  There is no question that nullity in the civil law could possibly be a realistic alternative because nullity can only apply in relatively few cases.</P>
    <P>One other area I would like to mention is the position of children which has been dealt with extensively by other people.  I believe in some cases marital breakdown undoubtedly damages children whereas in other cases perhaps things are so bad that the children are better off with the parents separated.  The point is not whether it damages or whether it does not damage the children; it is the breakdown of the parents' marriage that does this to the children.  It is not whether you call it nullity, divorce, divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i> or whether you call it an action under the Guardianship of Infants Act. It is the actual break up of the marriage. This is what is happening.  By giving divorce we are only recognising what has already happened.  We are not damaging the children by calling it divorce.  We are just recognising that this thing has already happened.  This is important.</P>
    <P>The international aspect is important. It is becoming increasingly complex in <Col N="108" /> the field of legal relationships and the status of people in this country with the increased movement from one country to another that we have, where people are in limping marriages, where they are married in one country and not married in another country, where children are legitimate in one country and not legitimate in another country.  Any lawyer working in this area will tell you that an increasingly large volume of what they are doing is opinion work on the status of children, on the status of people who are supposedly married or supposedly not married.  This is becoming a very severe problem.</P>
    <P>I will end by contrasting the slowness with which we, as Houses of Parliament, have dealt with this problem.  We are beginning to deal with it now and we, hopefully, will deal with it quickly.  The slowness with which it has been dealt with, despite the fact that it is such a real and active social problem contrasts with the incredible speed with which the abortion amendment was dashed in front of us and we were pressurised into saying that this must be enacted immediately; we must have a referendum immediately and so on.  Surely we can see that this problem is one that affects human beings, if anything much more than the previous one, and demands not just that we set up a committee but that we set up a committee which is committed to deal with this specific issue of divorce and is committed to end its deliberations at a foreseeable date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not keep the House very long as I realise that we are overrunning our time.  This was meant to be a tough topic and has proved to be so.  I find a great deal of disappointment with this debate.  It has been basically a bogus debate from the Government side.  It has been full of camouflage and it has been unrealistic.  None of the questions which I asked in my initial speech has been answered.  I asked would we be putting this clause in the Constitution if it were not there already?  The answer may be self-evident but nobody appears to acknowledge it because it is a matter of embarrassment to them.  I asked why the <Col N="109" /> 1967 Constitutional Committee's recommendations had been ignored?  Nobody has been able to explain that to me.</P>
      <P>Nobody has been able to assure me if such a committee as this one is set up that those recommendations will not be ignored.  The Minister said that these recommendations have a better chance of success than the motion before this House.  I am not satisfied that the all-party committee will make recommendations which will have a better chance of success.  We need something concrete.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was full of platitudes, goodwill, good wishes and good intentions.  She said that significant talks have already begun with the Opposition party.  That is not good enough.  We do not know where these talks are going; we do not know how long they will last. Those talks, apparently &mdash; there is conflict about this &mdash; have been going on for six months.  We do not know if they will end before the end of this session.  If they do not they will be through to October and presumably then the all-party committee will not be set up until 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the demand from the Government side for consensus.  I have never understood what the word &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; means.  As far as I can see it means unanimity. There is no possibility of unanimity on this issue.  The Government should be leading on the issue.  As Senator Dooge said, quite inadequately as far as I am concerned, we need an all-party agreement on a subject such as this.  This is saying: &ldquo;We are handing the veto to Fianna Fáil on this issue and abdicating our responsibility as a Government&rdquo;. That is not good enough.  This is a nettle which I would have expected the Government to grasp.  They are refusing to do so in a cowardly way.  I have not heard one <Col N="110" /> speaker say what the attitude of the Fine Gael Party or individuals of the Fine Gael Party is to divorce.  The Minister mentioned divorce once and that was the crux of the motion.  The party in Government should have the courage to tackle this problem.  They have singularly failed to do that here today.</P>
    <P>The speech by Senator Eoin Ryan was totally unrealistic.  You would think that we were producing a motion to introduce divorce on demand.  It must be remembered that all this motion is asking for is the deletion of an Article in the Constitution which prohibits it.  That is all, no more and no less.  Senator Ryan spoke about situations in other countries where there is divorce on demand.  Nobody is asking for that and it is dishonest to suggest that they are.  They are simply and solely asking for the deletion of a particular Article which prohibits the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>We have had no answers to the questions about the all-party committee.  We have had no answer on the time limit. We have had no answer on the terms of reference.  We have had no answer on what the composition of this committee will be.  I find this whole debate unsatisfactory. We have had no answers to the questions which we put originally and I cannot escape from the fact that I believe that this all-party committee is a device which the Government find convenient. It is handing over responsibility which they do not want to take.  I am not convinced at all that this will not go the same way as the 1967 Committee on the Constitution. I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter.  I thank the Minister for coming in to us.  It is my first time seeing the Minister in this House in this capacity and I am glad to see her.  I hope she will be glad to see me by the time I have finished saying what I have to say.  It is not intended in any way to be offensive. The debate arises from a proposal contained in the revised Estimates for Public Expenditure which I have never seen actually formally quantified in the sense of the global figure and the precise percentages being quantified but which is intended to bring RTC fees into line with university fees for reasons which to some extent are argued in Government documentation on public expenditure.</P>
      <P>As one who has spent all his professional career working in a regional technical college the sort of sweeping assumption that there is a direct comparison between RTCs and universities is, to say the least, mind-boggling.  I am sure, from the figures that are available to me, that the proposal contained in the Estimate for Education will result in many RTCs, and in the RTC of which I am a staff member and a member of the board of management, being required to produce 100 per cent more from their own revenue this year than was required in the previous 12 month period, an increase in the requirement to raise from £300,000 last year to about £600,000 this year in the amount of money to be generated from fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before talking about that proposal I want to put it into some perspective. When the Investment in Education Report was published in 1965 it stated that technical education as such is largely absent from the country's higher education and in planning future development of higher education in the vocational education system the aim should be to provide alternatives to courses in the universities, or courses specifically designed to meet the requirement of professional bodies, but to design courses to meet specific needs of the country.  In other words, a sector was envisaged which would be flexible, pragmatic, functional <Col N="113" /> and related to needs as perceived in the country.  That was the objective.</P>
    <P>When the Steering Committee on Regional Technical Colleges reported in 1967 they stated:</P>
    <P>Irish people generally have not had the opportunity to become technically skilled and the academic bias in the educational system has not helped. This leaves a serious gap in the stock of knowledge and skill necessary for the development of productive enterprise.</P>
    <P>They summarised their views on the matter as follows.  This is not a complete quotation.  It is a section from it.  They make one very interesting statement in that summary of views:</P>
    <P>The availability of increased technical knowledge and skill at all levels is a necessary but not sufficient condition for further economic growth and the promotion of innovation and enterprise amongst the people.</P>
    <P>They emphasised the promotion of innovation and enterprise.</P>
    <P>The steering committee envisaged quite a startling development in this area of regional technical colleges and, of course, at the same time other colleges of technology and, in particular, what is now called the Dublin Institute of Technology, were envisaged to be developing. The steering committee envisaged that somewhere in the order of 15,500 students would be attending regional technical colleges in 1972 and somewhere close to 20,000 would be attending regional technical colleges in 1975.  Nothing like those figures has even yet been achieved.</P>
    <P>The figures that the steering committee envisaged eight years ago as being necessary to produce the levels of skilled manpower that this country would require as a necessary condition for economic development have still not been reached in 1983.  That has resulted in an enormous increase in demand for places. For example, in my own college in Cork there were 3,000 applicants for 600 places a couple of years ago.  The numbers would be somewhat different now.  They <Col N="114" /> are the most reliable figures that I have to hand.  That is a success rate of 20 per cent, which is considerably less than that for students applying to the Central Applications Office for the universities where the success rate is of the order of 38 per cent.  Statistically &mdash; and I would not like to push this too far &mdash; it is possibly more difficult to get into an RTC, in some cases, than it is to get into your choice of course in university.  Statistics can be abused and I do not want to do that.  The point is generally applicable that it is extremely difficult to get into an RTC, that the demand for places is now well in excess of the supply and that we have not, at this stage, come anywhere near the numbers that were envisaged by the steering committee in order to produce the supply of skilled manpower necessary to give us a proper base for economic development.</P>
    <P>What has happened is that the transfer ratio between second and third level education has actually dropped.  The figure in 1967 stood at 14 per cent.  Today it is 12 per cent.  What has happened is that the proportion of our young people transferring from second to third level education has actually dropped.  At the same time we have developed a philosophy of third-level education which is entirely out of phase with the closest model available, which is in Britain.  For instance, the relative positions of RTCs and universities in this country compare most unfavourably at least with Britain. For instance, in Britain, 25 per cent of students go to universities and 60 per cent attended the non-university third level sector. In this country the figures are exactly opposite: 60 per cent of second level students go to universities, 13 per cent to RTCs and a further 12.7 per cent to other technological universities.  This again is an indicator of the need for growth and development in the whole area of non-university technological education.  It is a sign or a symbol of its lack of development that, however we describe this sector, we end up talking about it in negative terms by comparison with the university sector.  It is a negative comparison; it is the non-university sector or something <Col N="115" /> like that.  That is usually how we end up talking about it.</P>
    <P>Yet, I have to say that, with 10 years of working in an RTC and therefore with the experience, because of transfers of students from other RTCs and of various contracts through my union and other ways, the RTCs have been enormously successful.  There is no question about it. They have developed, virtually from scratch, courses in a huge variety of specialist technologies.  They have done it very often in spite of a lack of planning, in the sense that the planning that was done in terms of provision of staff refresher courses, staff facilities, planning of equipment purchase, planning of extensions and so on was &mdash; at least at the level at which I was involved &mdash; virtually non-existent.  They have succeeded in spite of extraordinary restrictions, in terms particularly of the expenditure of money where, for instance, you pay somebody £14,000, £15,000 or £16,000 a year which is the salary of a lecturer in an RTC at present.  Yet it needs the signatures of about four people for that individual to be allowed to spend £25 or £30.  If we pay people that sort of salary we ought at least give him a responsibility comparable to that of somebody on that salary in the private sector instead of tangling ourselves up in enormous bureaucratic knots when very often the expense involved in controlling that expenditure is far greater than the actual cost itself.  What we end up doing is wasting the time &mdash; which is the major commodity &mdash; the very expensive time of individuals involved in third-level education who are being paid quite large salaries, although my colleagues in the RTCs will not thank me for saying that. I hope the Minister will not quote me in the wrong place for saying it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the RTCs have been poorly financed, particularly in recent developments in the degree area which has been run on what can only be described as a veritable shoestring but which, in spite of that, have been more or less successful.  I do not want to get involved in that area.  The Minister is aware of some of the problems there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> Along came these proposals.  Education cutbacks can be looked at in various ways.  First of all, in this case, we have already produced the evidence that the actual commitment by the State to the technological sector, the RTCs and other areas is already inadequate.  It is inadequate in terms of the plans that were drawn up initially.  It is inadequate in terms of the expected need and of comparisons with other developed economies. Therefore to cut back in expenditure in an area where expenditure is already seriously and severely inadequate is wrong.</P>
    <P>Secondly, to cut back on education in a country which has a higher proportion of its population in the younger age group than any other country in western Europe is unfair and wrong.  It is unjust &mdash; which is a social argument &mdash; it is also economic madness if we are ever to provide proper employment for those in that age group. We cannot do it if they are not educated. There will not be any future employment for people who do not possess a high level of technical and technological education.</P>
    <P>On the other side of it &mdash; and here I take issue with a range of economists who see education as social and therefore almost implicitly non-productive expenditure &mdash; by any rational criterion, if productive investment is investment which is calculated to produce a real return in terms of the creation of wealth to the State, then investment in education is a productive investment.  It is only a narrow mechanistic view of productive investment which could say otherwise.  Investment in education provides a real return in terms of a skilled manpower which is more efficient, more productive and therefore calculated to provide an increase in the wealth of the community. It is therefore a productive investment. Therefore, cutbacks on education are effectively a cutback, not in an area of current expenditure or of loss-making expenditure but in productive expenditure.</P>
    <P>The precise implications of the fee area for the RTCs have never been teased out entirely in public.  I know, in the case of one large regional college, if a 100 per cent fee increase were to be implemented <Col N="117" />&mdash; and that is the clear implication of the budget being proposed to that college by the Department of Education &mdash; then the proportion of the college's running expenses being generated by fees would be of the order of 17 per cent.  There is a university close by that particular college and the proportion of the university's income being generated by fees would be only 13 per cent.  We would then have the ludicrous position when a publicly-owned educational establishment was generating more of its income by 40 per cent from fees than a privately-owned educational establishment in the same town. To my mind, that is a total and fundamental contradiction of the whole idea of publicly-owned education.  I suspect that it was not the intention.  I suspect rather that there was a lack of analysis of the realities of fees in the third-level sector.</P>
    <P>All the while there are rules, practices and procedures which inhibit real initiative at local level in this whole technological area.  For instance RTCs are major centres of resources in the area of skilled technical manpower and in the areas of technical facilities.  There is a large concentration of people with high levels of technological skills in those areas.  Those skills could be saleable in the way that many universities are now generating substantial revenue by setting-up consultancy practices as part of the universities' operations in the market place.  Yet, if an RTC were to do such an extraordinary thing as to set up a consultancy, if it were to generate an income of, say, £100,000 a year from that, the consequences for that RTC would be that, in the following financial year, the financial provision made available by the Department of Education would be reduced by precisely that extra £100,000.  In other words, the consequence for any college of generating extra income itself is to have its grant from central funds reduced which, of course, is calculated to ensure that no such use of resources will ever be made.</P>
    <P>Apart from the financial consequences of that, that necessarily results in a waste of resources, in the non-availability of a specialist service which should be adding to our development of productive investment. If we are going to have cutbacks, <Col N="118" /> then it does not necessarily mean that we must have increased fees; there could be all sorts of possibilities of generation of revenue.  Perhaps the private sector consultants who have acquired almost a monopoly at present &mdash; with the level of fees that would astonish the rest of society &mdash; would not be too happy with this sort of competition.  Perhaps, therefore, we are not inclined to encourage it, as we often have been disinclined to encourage it.  That is one major source of fees and it is only bureaucratic restriction which prevents it.  There is no need to increase fees.  In fact, fees, as they used to be in RTCs, were not a substantial part of revenue but they have jumped at an alarming rate in recent years.</P>
    <P>Even though the decision to increase fees is both economically and socially almost impossible to comprehend, and while it may not be logical it is consistent, for instance, with the decision in the area of the European social funding of some students in RTCs, whereby a saving of £85,000 to this State will result in a reduction of £95,000 in EEC aid.  Therefore, the net effect is to reduce the income to the State by the order of £10,000 or £15,000.  That does not make sense to me.  It was done; I do not understand why it was done with the consequences of the enormous human problems that would be generated by that decision: for the sake of £85,000, I do not understand why it was done.  I am totally mystified by it.  Why we propose to save money in a way which will just reduce our aid from the EEC, I do not know.</P>
    <P>There are other important aspects of technological education.  For instance, there is the interesting fact produced in the &ldquo;Clancy Report&rdquo; which indicates that there is a substantially higher level of participation in third level education in those counties where RTCs exist.  I would not try to claim that this evidence is conclusive, but it is the only evidence available and, therefore, it is the best evidence we have.  And the best evidence suggests that there is a substantially higher level of participation in third-level education where an RTC exists.  The proposal of the Minister and of the Department to reduce substantially the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, I will conclude in a minute then.  I know what Senator Higgins is going to say and he can complement what I have said.  What I have said is that the fee increase is illogical, counter-productive and could well result in the same number of RTC staff having either to teach smaller numbers &mdash; because people will not be able to afford to go &mdash; or in teaching the same numbers of less-qualified people because they will come more on the basis of income and less on the basis of ability.  In the light of the economic and social needs of the country and of the relatively small sum of money involved I would appeal to the Minister, fundamentally, to revise this provision so that we can have a proper development of the technological and technical sector of education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my gratitude to Senator Brendan Ryan for allowing me two minutes to speak on this important topic.  I can assure him I will be delighted to reciprocate when education is being discussed again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to begin immediately at the point which he was developing before his time ran out.  The most important point about the impact of fee increases is their implication for social class participation in third level education.  I would urge the Minister &mdash; who I know is familiar with the problems of education at third level in particular &mdash; to think very seriously about the implication of the increases for participation.  Senator Ryan correctly referred to the evidence that the &ldquo;Clancy Report&rdquo;, the national report in December 1982, made available to us.  I want to <Col N="120" /> put it another way.  As I read the &ldquo;Clancy Report&rdquo; I began doing other kinds of statistics in my head and what emerged was that, as one went down below the professional classes, the ratio meant that one had an eight times better chance of participation in any third-level education institution once one went over the barrier to the professional classes.  I would calculate it another way: if one went down through the lower socio-economic groups &mdash; if one took other statistics say on mental hospital admissions &mdash; one could suggest that the children of working-class couples had four to six times a better opportunity of ending up in a mental hospital than they had of ending up in a third-level institution.  There is clear evidence now available, particularly from the work of Damien Hannan, that participation in education in itself can be a form of structured inequality.  If you do not give the resources disproportionately to the people in the lower socio-economic groups you are in fact assisting inequality. I have no doubt whatsoever that increasing fees in the vocational sector will have the effect of exacerbating inequality.  The report by Patrick Clancy and Ciaran Benson in October 1979 on the needs of the greater Dublin area put dramatically, and anticipated in a way, what were to be later national findings in the &ldquo;Clancy Report&rdquo;.  They showed the participation rate.  Just one fact alone: it was suggested in the summary on page 30 of that report &mdash;<i>Higher Education in Dublin: A study of some emerging needs,</i> in 1979 that:</P>
    <P>It is felt that the most striking finding concerns the social background of these entrants.  Seventy-two per cent of the entrants came from the four higher socio-economic groups, (Higher Professional, Lower Professional, Employers and Managers and Salaried Employees), although these social groups constitute less than 21 per cent of the total population of Co. Dublin. At the other end of the social scale the gross under-representation of the children of Semi-Skilled and Unskilled Manual Workers was revealed.</P>
    <P>Apparently this had declined.  So, if we are to arrest the decline in participation <Col N="121" /> in the intermediate manual group and in the lower socio-economic groups, we should be assisting their participation.  I believe that higher fees will make it radically more difficult for them to participate.</P>
    <P>The point Senator Ryan was making was terribly important concerning the relationship between education and development and education and employment or unemployment.  I believe more and more that education for unemployment will involve transition between different kinds of occupation and activity. Education in the sector mentioned by Senator Ryan will involve the capacity to effect a transition from one scale level to another.  Equally the colleges to which he refers have been the colleges primarily which have offered an opportunity of recurrent education and second-chance education.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister most strongly, as he has done, to think very carefully about the difference between the case against cuts and the now particular case against cuts that will have the effect of reducing participation.  In the end of the day the whole case in defence of educational expenditure must be on the basis of egalitarianism.</P>
    <P>It is stated that we have 12,500 million people unemployed in the European Community at present.  At this rate we will have 50 million people unemployed in Europe by 1995.  These will be people who will be making new balances between work, the world of leisure and the world of education.  Anything that affects the base of education in the vocational sector will do irrevocable damage; instead of arresting a bad trend it will exacerbate a bad trend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. G. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their contributions and to thank Senator Brendan Ryan in particular for his remarks of welcome to me to this House. It is my second occasion here as Minister for Education but our paths did not cross on the first occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This discussion has been more wide-ranging than the terms of the initial motion put down for this Adjournment <Col N="122" /> would have suggested.  I found it very useful and look forward to having time to reflect on the remarks made by both Senators in the debate.  However, I might use the time available to me to touch on some points which are very relevant to this debate.</P>
    <P>We should put some things into perspective. The total allocation this year, by way of State grants, to the six Dublin Colleges of Technology, the nine Regional Technical Colleges, the Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology and the Cork Schools of Art and Music is close to £48 million.  In addition to the State grant, the colleges have income from receipts of various kinds, mainly fees.  Last year this income amounted to £3.4 million, of which £2.7 million was from fees.  At present fee levels, therefore, less than 6 per cent of the cost of running the colleges comes from student fees.  That puts the matter in some perspective.  It is fair to say that students, or their parents, are not being asked to shoulder anything like a substantial part of the cost of providing the courses from which the students will acquire valuable qualifications.</P>
    <P>A significant consideration here lies in the comparison of some of the higher level courses in the colleges with the fees for similar courses in the universities. Fees for degree level courses in the colleges, during the present year, have ranged from a low of just over £100 a year to £315 a year.  Yet the fees, for example, in University College, Dublin for Arts or Commerce are above £500, in the current year, while those for Science and Engineering are £700 plus.  The 25 per cent increase in university fees agreed for the coming year, in some of these faculties, will be greater than the total existing fee levels in degree courses in some of the colleges.  There is, therefore, a very wide divergence between fees for degree courses in both kinds of institutions. When we turn to the courses for technicians and higher technicians in the colleges, we find that some of these may be followed for as little, by way of course fee, as £80 a year at present while the highest such fee is £160 a year only.  It is worth recalling that the National Council <Col N="123" /> for Educational Awards, in its survey in December 1981, of those who qualified from courses validated by the council in institutes and colleges in the technological sector showed that 54 per cent of the students had obtained employment with a further 32 per cent proceeding to further studies.</P>
    <P>It is necessary also to remind Senators that a Minister for Education is never happy to have to announce increases in fee levels.  But the position has to be faced that technical and technological colleges are expensive places to run even when all due effort is made to have them operate as economically as possible.  The burden on the taxpayer is very onerous and the proportion of the total cost being paid by the students is such as to warrant an appropriate increase in current fee levels.  If the students, because of their attendance at courses and the acquisition of qualifications as a result, are very well placed to secure well paid employment it is reasonable that they should shoulder some share of the total cost.  As I have pointed out, the colleges' fees are quite low in comparison with fees in other institutions of third level education.  At the level specified in the relevant circular letter from my Department, they are substantially less than the fees for similar university courses.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan, in particular, might like to know that the bulk of capital investment in recent years has been in the RTCs, colleges of technology and the NIHE area and the great growth of student numbers has also been in that area.  It has not been unknown for interests in other third level areas to express disquiet about what they consider to be a disproportionate share of available capital resources going into that area.  I am acutely conscious, as we all are, of the difficulty in meeting the demand for third level places.  At the moment my Department have before them projects estimated to cost over £200 million in order to meet the sort of demand we are expecting for third level places.</P>
    <P>A review of all third level projects is currently being undertaken and decisions from the Government will be required in <Col N="124" /> regard to availability of funds and what particular projects are to be accorded priority in the allocation of whatever capital funds are available.  At the same time, Senator Ryan should not forget that there is a very significant technological element in the universities also.  At present there are about 14,000 full-time students and about 13,000 apprentices on day and block release in these colleges.  Taking part-time courses into account, this gives a total equivalent whole-time number of the order of 20,000.</P>
    <P>We should also discuss the very important point that was raised, the question of assistance which is available to students directly.  Senator Higgins mentioned specifically the question of the socio-economic groupings in third level education.  In the report <i>Participation in Higher Education &mdash; a National Survey</i>, by Patrick Clancy, which was published last year by the Higher Education Authority, it was seen that although the less affluent groups in our society comprise over half the population, entrants in 1980 to higher education generally from these groups was only a little over one-fifth of the total entrants, and entrants to the technological sector only somewhat over one-quarter.  This shows that while the less well-off students are found in slightly larger numbers percentage-wise in these colleges, it is by no means the case, whatever the original intention may have been, that these colleges are at present functioning to provide in a particular way for young people from the less well-off sectors of our community.</P>
    <P>A disappointing participation rate from the lower socio-economic groups is not a feature peculiar to educational provisions in this country.  It seems to be a general experience throughout the western world, that despite all the efforts in the various countries to equalise educational opportunity the lower socio-economic groups continue to be under-represented in terms of educational participation and achievement.  I believe this indicates that the factors involved are much more complex than educational planners anywhere had anticipated.  The issue is much more than one of providing <Col N="125" /> cheap or free educational services.  It is certainly not only that, it is much more than that.</P>

      <P>I believe that the whole question of encouraging participation in education at all levels from the lower socio-economic groups must begin much lower down in the educational system and must be composed of a series of positive incentives at all levels of the educational system.  There is also, of course, a very important role for other social agencies as well as the Department of Education in this whole question.</P>
      <P>In the planning process, which is under way in my Department in terms of education for the next four years, I have specifically directed that we give particular attention to how we can organise a series of positive incentives for the lower socio-economic groups to participate in all levels of education, but particularly in this very difficult and worrying area of third level education.</P>

    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of these particular fee increases and how they affect the situation of the less well-off. The first point I would like to make relates to the assistance which is available to students directly.  As a result of the substantial improvement in the scholarship scheme operated by vocational education committees, which is an improvement introduced under the previous Coalition Government, when my colleague Deputy John Boland was Minister for Education, the quota restriction on the number of scholarships which a committee could award was abolished. This led to a very great increase in the number of these scholarships, the great bulk of which are held by students in the technical and technological colleges. These scholarships include payment of fees so that their holders will not be at any loss in the new situation.  The fact that the scholarships operate under a means test implies that it is the less well-off students who benefit from them. While the European Social Fund grants, on the other hand, are not subject to a <Col N="126" /> means test, they are nevertheless available also to the less well-off students and in their case as well course fees are paid for the student or trainee.  Between the two schemes, the scholarships and the European Social Fund grants, close to two out of three students in the colleges have their fees paid.  Thus, as one might expect, there is a very considerable cushioning of the effect of the fees increases and one which operates to the benefit of the less well-off students.</P>

      <P>I understand the matter under discussion is the question of fee increases in third level colleges.  I have endeavoured to point out that I believe the fee increases themselves, which I would have to justify on the basis of economic grounds, will not carry the implication in them of discriminating against the less well-off.  I also believe that we have in this country a very serious problem of creating a situation where the less well-off will participate much more fully in third level education, a problem which goes right through the educational and social systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying that Senator Ryan touched on the very important question of the general investment in education in this country.  I believe that the figure stands at £900 million of investment in education this year in Ireland, as a percentage of GNP, compares very favourably with our EEC partners, and as a percentage of GNP has gone up considerably this year compared to the two previous years.  This is not to say that we are investing enough in education to meet the situation in Ireland of an increase in student numbers, which is almost unique in the whole of the developed world and certainly unique in our partners in the EEC.  Therefore, we have a challenge in the next four years as a society to work out an education plan which will make it possible for us to use in the very best method the available <Col N="127" /> resources and to make available as many resources as possible.</P>
