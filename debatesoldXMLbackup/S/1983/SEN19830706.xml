      <P>I have notice from Senator Brendan Ryan that on a motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The continuing delay on the part of the Government in fulfilling their commitment to set up an agency to combat poverty.</P>
      <P>I rule that this matter is not admissible for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds that it involves the introduction of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank the Members of the Seanad on both sides for facilitating me and enabling me to introduce this amendment to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982.  We are initiating this legislation in this House. This is a practice I would like to see developed over the next four years as far as my own Department are concerned, not by way of flattering Senators but in full and wholesome recognition of the positive contribution Members can make to the legislative process in the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is in effect an amendment to the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982.  This Act, which came into operation on 26 July 1982 provided tenants of dwellings which were formerly controlled under the Rent Restrictions Acts with security of tenure and set up a mechanism for determining rents by means of the District Court.  It also gave power to the Minister to make regulations regarding the registration of standards and rent books for private rented dwellings.  It is with regard to the mechanism <Col N="683" /> for determining rents in cases of dispute that this Bill is concerned and in other matters the terms of the 1982 Act remain as they were.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Oireachtas has been called upon to deal with amending legislation less than one year after the 1982 Act was passed should not be too surprising to anyone who listened to or read the debates on the 1982 Act.  I think it was recognised by all parties at that time that the District Courts were not the ideal forum for resolving disputes under the Act.  This was not a criticism of the District Courts but a recognition that the experience of attending court would be likely to be seriously upsetting for many of those obliged to attend it under the Act.  There was also a recognition that the kind of issues likely to be involved were appropriate for determination by a specialist body.</P>
    <P>During the debates last summer, concern was expressed on all sides that the landlords and tenants of formerly controlled dwellings, many of them elderly and poorly off, would find the court proceedings unduly formal and intimidating and might indeed see themselves almost as criminals in the dock, guilty of some wrongdoing.  I think &mdash; and I think I speak for all Members based on our constituency experience &mdash; that the experience of the operation of the 1982 Act has confirmed the fears of Deputies and Senators in this regard, although district justices to the best of my knowledge have done their utmost to treat elderly landlords and tenants with every consideration.</P>
    <P>The second point that must be remembered is that the issues arising under the 1982 Act for the most part hinge on technical questions relating to the valuation of property.  The district justice is required to arbitrate on the competing claims of a series of technical witnesses. I would not, of course, query the competence of the courts to deal with complex questions of a technical nature, but I consider that most reasonable people would agree that, in the particular circumstances of the cases with which the Bill is concerned, this kind of task is <Col N="684" /> particularly suited to a specialist body with relevant expertise.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the present Bill is to set up a tribunal which would replace the District Court in determining the terms of the tenancies of formerly controlled dwellings.  It is hoped that this tribunal will meet the objectives of providing an informal and expert service for settling disputes between landlords and tenants. The tribunal will set its own procedures which, I would expect, would have the aim among other things, of minimising the strain on persons coming before it. The criteria which the tribunal will use in setting rents will be exactly the same as those used by the District Courts although the tribunal will be able to carry out its own inspections of premises and have expert advice directly available to it in settling rents.</P>
    <P>The details of the Bill will be examined on Committee Stage.  At this point I would only wish to highlight a few issues. The Bill provides that either the landlord or tenant may apply to the tribunal to set the terms of the tenancy.  The tribunal will be drawn from a panel of persons made up of barristers or solicitors, valuers and lay persons.  They will work on a part-time basis and hold hearings throughout the country as the volume of cases demands.  I hope to be in a position to set up the tribunal and have it working before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provisions to allow the Minister for the Environment to set up an alternative system under which landlords or tenants would apply to housing authorities to have their rents fixed by rent officers who would be officials of the housing authority.  In such circumstances the tribunal would then act as an appeals body.  Before deciding to take such a step, it would be my intention to wait for a period to see how the rent tribunal operates on its own.  If it is considered, having regard to the volume of business the tribunal has to cope with, that there is a need for rent officers, I will set up such a service in consultation with the local authorities and the public service unions.</P>
    <P>In legislating in this area we must be especially careful to ensure that we are <Col N="685" /> not creating problems <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Constitution. Having regard to the recent history of such legislation, argument might be legitimately advanced that changes need to be made to the Constitution itself, but this is not a matter which I can pursue now: my views on the need for this change are known.  Our work today is bound by the terms of the Constitution and in particular the Supreme Court's interpretation of it as seen in its judgments in relation to earlier legislation in this field.</P>
    <P>In preparing the legislation, following representation from various groups, consideration was given to the possibility of automatically transferring cases before the District Court at the coming into operation of this Bill to the tribunal and to allowing the tribunal to review cases previously determined by the District Court.  On both counts, despite our desire to go down that road following representation from various groups, we received advice from the Attorney General to the effect that such provisions would be unconstitutional.  We would prefer it to be otherwise, but find ourselves constrained by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As a consequence the Bill provides that where a case is before the District Court but not yet heard, it may be withdrawn by the applicant, with the consent of the other party, and transferred to the tribunal. It is hoped that the fact that the cost of appearing before the tribunal will be substantially less than that of appearing before the District Court will encourage a transfer of cases to the tribunal, but this is something that must be left to the parties concerned.  A second area where the question of constitutionality arises is in relation to the criteria which must be taken into account in fixing a rent.  In line with the Supreme Court judgment, the overriding consideration is that the rent fixed must be the just and proper one.</P>
    <P>The additional factors taken into account, in accordance with section 13 of the 1982 Act, include the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord and the amount paid by him or her for it, <Col N="686" /> the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.</P>
    <P>No change is being made to the criteria set out above.  This is because they are considered to be adequate and satisfactory, if fully taken into account in a balanced manner, in the fixing of a just and proper rent.  In addition, the opinion of the senior counsel on the 1981 Bill indicated that only this formula would be likely to be deemed to be constitutional. The tribunal will be bound by it in the same manner as the District Court.  A declaratory statement, however, has, been inserted to the effect that the actual means of the tenant should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt to remove some confusion that has existed as to whether the likelihood of the tenant receiving rent allowances should be taken into account in fixing the rent.  This is not an amendment to the 1982 Act but a statement for the purpose of removing any ambiguity under the Act.  Apart from this, it must be emphasised that it is outside the powers of the Government or of any Minister to direct that section 13 of the 1982 Act should be interpreted in any particular way.</P>
    <P>I think there is a substantial measure of agreement on all sides on the need for the present legislation.  I do not expect, and I want to underline this, that the Bill will be a panacea for all the problems related to the relationships between landlords and tenants but I think it should present a fair balance between the legitimate rights of one group of citizens and those of another.  On this basis I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, but with slight reservations.  I do not know who is to blame for the Bill which was introduced in July 1982 &mdash; whether it was Fianna Fáil, the Coalition, the draftsman or the civil servants &mdash; but it was a sad reflection on the legislation passing through this House.  That Bill had been awaited for a number of years. Now, one year later, it is deemed to be <Col N="687" /> unworkable, unconstitutional and does not meet the needs of the people.</P>
      <P>We are going through a decade of legal confrontation.  Every legal man, whether he be a junior or senior barrister, is trying to find a section in a Bill going through both Houses of the Oireachtas which is unconstitutional.  These legal people want to be considered judicial experts. They hope to achieve this aim by finding loopholes in the legislation that we, the elected representatives are legitimately trying to enact to meet the needs of the people.  When preparing such legislation, we should have at our disposal the most expert legal opinion.  This is an example of how legislation is sliding through this House.  There were good intentions on both sides when the Minister introduced the legislation.  We will be told that the Government parties inherited this Bill from the Opposition.  Regardless of whose Bill it was, it is now found to be unworkable and unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>More emphasis must be placed on the examination of Bills to ensure their suitability. We must ensure that when a Bill goes through this House it will be operative for at least a decade, and that is a very short period.  This is a much needed Bill to deal with a long outstanding problem &mdash; the tenant versus the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see why the rents restriction court did not work.  It was humiliating, frightening and frustrating for defenceless old people to be brought, probably for the first time in their lives and through no fault of their own, before a court, shivering in front of a barrage of legal experts and local government administrators.  It is no wonder that Act did not work.  I welcome this Bill because we have eliminated that court and officers of the local authorities will now be in a position to examine the case and suggest a fair rent. In the event of any disagreement at that point, either the landlord or the tenant will have the opportunity to have his case brought before the tribunal.  The tribunal will be the last resort.  Most of these rents will be fixed in a cool atmosphere between the tenant, the landlord and the local authority official.  I do not think there will be any hassle.  These old people <Col N="688" /> will not be frustrated waiting for 4 July or 5 July to attend a rent restrictions court and preparing for weeks for it.  This Bill will eliminate that and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I will quote two cases of people who came before the court.  One person had the rent increased from £1.21 to £30 and another person from £2.15 to £32.  These people were over 80 years of age and unable to pay this increase.  I know a prosperous licensed premises in my own area that housed two families, one paying rent of 92 pence a week and the other 75 pence a week.  Under the present system the landlord is unable to get any increase in the rent.  There is an imbalance here. I want justice for both sides.  I did not have time to examine the Bill in depth. If a person has to pay the increased charge fixed, and he or she is not able to do so, does that person have to move out, or will he or she be evicted?  What period of time elapses before a review takes place when a rent has been fixed? I would like the Minister to give me some details so that we can discuss this in more depth on Committee Stage.  I fear that the poor people, unable to pay the increased rents, will be asked to leave and that no alternative accommodation will be provided for them.</P>
    <P>There will be repercussions.  This area has been neglected for a very long time and we are trying to legislate for everyone, landlord and tenant.  I hope there is enough flexibility in the Bill to deal with these problems because they will be cropping up every day.  The local authorities will be dealing with each individual case in a humane way.  As a result there may not be the same horrifying results which emerged from the rent restrictions courts over a short period.  I will have more to say on that at a later date.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how we are going to set up this tribunal.  Soon I will be discussing planning boards.  If the Minister decides the previous legislation dealing with the selection of a planning board was not suitable, how can he tell the House that he will select this new board and this new tribunal?  When replying, could he tell me how he will differentiate between the two types of boards?  How can he say one <Col N="689" /> planning board is wrong and the one, which he is going to set up, is right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only trying to relate the two.  I am sure the Minister knows what I am talking about.  However, I will leave my remarks until we discuss the Planning Bill.  I have told the Minister the reservations I have.  How will he relate one board to the other?  I am sure he will have an answer for that. I will have more to say on this on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisJGFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. FitzGerald Mr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill.  When we pass legislation in these Houses and the President signs the Bill, it would seem logical that the Bills would not come back before either House within a period of ten years.  Recently we have been updating legislation passed 40 or 50 years ago, not to mention last year. The misery that has been a feature of the 1982 Act, and the way it operated in the District Court, demand that something of a positive nature be done to clear up the mess.  I am very dissatisfied with the way these courts have been operating. Section 13 of the 1982 Act asked that the additional factors to be taken into account in fixing a rent would be &mdash; the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord, the amount paid by him or her for it, the length of the tenant's occupancy of the dwelling and the number and ages of the tenant's family residing in the dwelling.  I know from experience, and I have a certain expertise and knowledge in this area, that almost all those categories have been outside the normal handling of rent cases before the District Court.  The only issue the District Court benches have been interested in since the 1982 Act passed has been the market rent of the dwelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with many old people who were living in dwellings before 1967. The experience of one tenant after another has been that the court was only <Col N="690" /> interested in the market rent.  The tenant's level of income was treated as being of trifling importance.  When that point was raised by those representing the tenant's interests, whether a barrister or a valuer, it was ignored.  This issue did not interest the District Court Bench.  That is a scandalous situation.  To have a bench operate in that way under an Act passed by the Oireachtas last year, and which included a whole range of areas that should be considered when fixing a rent, is intolerable.</P>
    <P>One point disturbs me.  I understand why the Minister is not able to deal with it further than he has, when he put it in a short few words, but in relation to the review or appeal of cases that has taken place within the last year the advice given by the Attorney General was to the effect that such provisions would be unconstitutional. That is a great pity and it is going to disturb many people who faced the courts and were hoping the new rents tribunal would review the cases where there was a very high level of dissatisfaction on the part of the landlord or the tenant.</P>
    <P>Rents fixed by the District Court in the last year have been applied for a five year period.  That makes a farce of the 1982 Act.  It is a pity that the constitutionality of dealing with appeals under the 1982 Act has been questioned.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with this legislation piecemeal.  This is a feature of the way the Oireachtas has been behaving in the recent past.  I hope that Senators and Deputies on all sides will be prepared to face issues and that this Bill will not lead to a situation similar to that which brought this matter before these Houses, that is, a case taken about two years ago on the unconstitutionality of the Rent Restrictions Act.  It would have been far preferable if people in public life had faced these issues long before that stage had been reached.  All over the towns of Ireland there are to be seen, not just dwellings falling into disrepair and abandonment because of the operation of the old Rent Restrictions Act but because neither landlord nor tenant was able to deal with the upkeep and standards of maintenance, because the landlord was <Col N="691" /> not getting the rent and the tenant was not sure of his or her position in the future.  The housing stock was being badly damaged by the operation of that Act.</P>
    <P>If you look over shop premises throughout Ireland, and certainly in this city, you will see floors after floors unoccupied because people do not know that the Rent Restrictions Act is no longer in operation.  Great damage has been done by that Act remaining on the Statute Book for so long and by the way in which this Oireachtas delayed in bringing in updated legislation.  Both Governments had to do it at the behest of a constitutional action in the courts.  This makes me and everybody else in this House think in relation to other areas with which we may have to deal in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned elderly people.  I had the experience recently of dealing with a lady on the verge of her nineties, who lived with a certain other lady for quite a considerable time in a rent-controlled dwelling in Rathgar. There was an extraordinary build-up in relation to this lady's appearance in the District Court and she spent a month in the Meath Hospital following a black-out on the day after the court case.  There was a question as to whether or not there might be a rent subsidy, or some tax relief for her under the 1982 Finance Act.  She is still in a very upset condition, unsure of where she stands.  One feature of the Rents Tribunal Bill was the area of subsidy under the Department of Social Welfare, which is a totally separate exercise. In the District Court there can be a backlog of six months and then you face another four, five or six months waiting for your rent subsidy to go through all the stages within that vast conglomerate Department of Social Welfare and you do not know for as long as a year where you stand.  I cannot see why elderly people are put through the additional misery of having to deal with the rent subsidy as a completely different exercise, following the fixing of their new rents.  Being upset at the whole change in <Col N="692" /> their circumstances with the case being brought to court they then have to continue into another trauma of waiting to know where they stand with that rent subsidy.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to include within the operation of the rents tribunal some method of handling at the same sitting the subsidy as applied by the Department of Social Welfare and that there be some attempt made to resolve within a reasonable period of time the question of the rent subsidy.  I do not understand why that is not part of the present legislation.  What has been included in this Bill will certainly minimise the strain, as the Minister said earlier, in relation to these cases because I assume that many of these cases will be dealt with by agreement outside the tribunal and the rent officer will fix the rent in many cases where there is no axe to grind and where landlords and tenants want to get together to sort out the situation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider introducing an amendment in relation to this if it is at all possible to do so, to include somewhere in the operations of the rent officer or the rents tribunal the operations of the rent subsidy as applied by the Department of Social Welfare.  If we do not do that, we will continue the strain and misery that have been a feature of the 1982 Act.  We must assist the majority of elderly people who need the assistance of the State and the State must get itself organised to give them as much support as does not harm their way of life and give them an understanding that we are sensitive to their position and that we will do our best for them.  Very many of the people who have had to face the District Courts in the last year with regard to their rents are not used to claiming social welfare benefits.  The exercise is a whole new dimension facing them in their eighties or nineties.  We should try to get it into a one day sitting.  I hope it will be resolved in a much more sensitive way in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this Bill is before us.  I am still far from happy about this whole area but one of the best <Col N="693" /> speeches on the amended legislation was made by the Minister when he was in this House.  I have no need to impress on him the enormous implications of that Supreme Court decision in terms of human pain and misery.  The result in recent times of a succession of decisions by our courts has been the effective beatification of the market economy through the Constitution to the extent that market value of property is now probably one of the few absolutes in the whole area of Irish law and legislation and courts.  The one right which is untouchable and apparently unqualified is the right of the owner of property to receive the market rent or value of the property and the market value is determined in a way which is entirely beneficial to the owner of that property.  The questions of the contribution of the community to the increase in the value of the property and of the lack of contribution of the individual to it apparently are peripheral matters.</P>
      <P>At the centre of what is being discussed here is the problem of our Constitution. I am glad that the Minister faced it frankly in saying that the solution to all these problems lies in a constitutional amendment &mdash; in this case a very useful and important constitutional amendment, one which I suspect we will be awaiting for a long time, even though there are 30,000 vulnerable people whose lives and whole peace of mind are threatened by the consequences of our present Constitution. Perhaps when the church finally gives the nod some of my conservative colleagues will come around to agreeing that that constitutional clause can be amended also, but they will probably have to wait a long time for that nod because the church itself might be made a victim of that change in terms of its own property holding.  We hope and we wait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I have heard from Senator O'Toole and Senator FitzGerald, people who do clinic work in constituencies, they are aware of the enormous personal suffering and upset caused to many old people by the whole court procedure. Court procedures are intimidating. Anybody who has ever been in court, even for a parking fine, can testify to the <Col N="694" /> sense of being on the outside.  Everybody else is on one side, effectively - solictors and the Judiciary, and the individual who is outside the court system is on the other. Senator FitzGerald put his finger on it.  I was not aware and could not be aware of the details of how the courts assess matters. It is indeed extremely distressing that they would take such a narrow view of their role in determining what is a fair rent.</P>
    <P>There are 30,000 people involved. They are, by and large, frightened, vulnerable people.  I have heard most horrific accounts from people working in voluntary social work in Cork of the extraordinary suffering of old people. People who perhaps have not travelled beyond the church around the corner and the next-door shop for 10 years because they are into their nineties suddenly have to make this extraordinary expedition across the city to the courthouse to pursue a change in their conditions of life that they do not understand &mdash; all, I hasten to add, in the interests of the market economy.</P>
    <P>There has been a kind of lobby of landlords in recent times which would tend to put a halo around them in the sense that they are the innocent victims of first world war legislation simply seeking to achieve their rights.  The fascinating thing is that I understand &mdash; and I will produce specific evidence in a moment &mdash; it is not entirely landlords who have owned property for a long time who are at the centre of this lobby.  I know for instance that one of the best known property speculators in Cork &mdash; he calls himself a property developer but the other term is better &mdash; instructed his auctioneer to buy up every rent-controlled property in Cork that came on the market years before the Supreme Court decision was taken.  It must have been obvious to anybody in the legal profession from years back that whenever or if ever the old rent control legislation got to the Supreme Court it had no hope of surviving because it was clearly in contradiction of the basic principle, well enunciated even years ago by the Supreme Court, that people were entitled to the market value of their property.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> Quite obviously then, a lot of the tear jerking and hand wringing by landlords is hypocritical bunkum.  They bought up property for buttons knowing that it was effectively going to be a gold mine.  Now they are seeking their maximum redress. At the centre of all of this the tribunal, of course, will make progress and be an improvement.  There is no simple solution to this problem because the other story is that if people paid market rents, then landlords would be encouraged to look after and develop their property, paint it and look after the garden.</P>
    <P>Anybody who drives through the bleak flatland of Dublin where rent contol is non-existent and you pay the market rent will testify to the fact that there is no sign of any sense of concern on the part of the large number of landlords who own large tracts of property in Rathmines, Rathgar and areas like that in Dublin.  You could identify the rented properties by looking at the outside.  They are unpainted, neglected and never looked after.  There are very few of these beneficial, benevolent, socially conscious landlords around waiting for a market rent to be offered to them so that they can do their duty.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of a very old sin called greed involved in all of this.  It is greed of a particularly objectionable kind because, in many cases, it is the vulnerable, the elderly, the frightened and the poor who are the victims of that greed. That is not to dismiss the minority of cases and there has been a minority of cases of landlords badly treated.  I would take a good deal of persuading that it was concern for those unfortunate people that motivated the whole campaign to have this legislation ruled unconstitutional. I cannot believe it and the pronouncements and the outbursts of the individuals and organisations involved do not give me any reason to believe differently.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome and I am very glad it is being introduced: It is an attempt to humanise a difficult and dreadful position. I only regret that since it is an amendment to another Bill it will only apply to the formerly rent controlled properties and that we are still left with <Col N="696" /> a huge area of furnished rent uncontrolled accommodation in which live a great many of our society, our young people in their early stages at work, students or unemployed single people and indeed families who cannot afford either to buy their own house or who are not eligible for local authority housing.  There is a whole area of abuse and exploitation, of shoddy housing, or breaches of the Planning Act, of the fire regulations and indeed probably of the tax code as well which needs to be identified and tackled. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that some work is being done on that area.</P>
    <P>This area of the formerly rent controlled dwellings presents a very serious problem because of the age and poverty of the individuals concerned.  It is only the worst part of a huge area of social neglect &mdash; that of private rented accommodation generally &mdash; which badly needs new regulations, at least the requirement of standards to be met, at least the requirement of enforceable registrations.</P>
    <P>I know there are theoretical registers of landlords.  I would love to know what is being done to enforce this.</P>
    <P>With that said, I welcome the Bill.  The only thing that worries me is that, since apparently nobody can be forced to wait for this tribunal or to change from the courts to the tribunal, all the greedy hordes of landlords that I have talked about who purchased large tracts of property in the years prior to the Supreme Court decision or indeed subsequent to it will, obviously, head for the District Court with the maximum possible haste to make sure that they can be heard in what they would obviously regard as a more favourable environment to themselves and their interests than the tribunal.  I suspect again, because of the constitutional position that there is nothing we can do about it which, of course, is appalling.  There is no way we can prevent every single landlord currently owning rent-controlled property from getting his claim on the books of the District Courts before this tribunal becomes law. There is no way in which we can force them to wait or to change.  The market economy, the price of property, is the <Col N="697" /> one sacrosanct value in Irish society which nobody, not even the Legislature, can threaten.</P>

      <P>I want to make a short contribution on the Bill, first of all to welcome it.  Those of us who were involved in the previous legislation almost predicted that this development was inevitable.  It is not making a party-political point to say that it has been Labour Party policy since the bringing in of this environmental legislation, that a rents tribunal was an essential part of any legislation dealing with this problem and was inevitable.  The Minister is on record in this House and in our party as having held that belief for a long time.  In fairness to my colleague, Senator Robinson, when the Bill was going through she even tabled an amendment at that time suggesting that a rents tribunal should be the determining factor, but then decided to withdraw that amendment on the basis that she would wait and see how the District Courts matched up to the challenge that the Private Dwellings Act, 1982 gave them in this area.  It is because of what has happened in the meantime that it has now become inevitable that the Minister would write in this necessary amendment setting up a rents tribunal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all heard about the plight of old people.  This is particularly relevant in the cities, Cork and Dublin.  In the country it has not been so widespread. People were petrified so to speak at being summoned to court, to have their rents re-determined under this Act.  It literally frightened the lives out of old people who had never before had recourse to that kind of formality.  As Senator FitzGerald pointed out, there were cases where the health of the people involved was put at risk by this whole process which we have been constitutionally forced to take account of.  In trying to ensure a measure of fair play for people on both sides involved in these disputes, the unfortunate old person in the middle who has been in a special category in the social field and would be unable to meet a large rent that might be settled by the court, found this whole process most upsetting. <Col N="698" /> I will not question some of the decisions that were made, but certainly many of them would raise anybody's eyebrows, although I realise they were working within certain constraints.  I am glad that the Minister in his opening remarks, set some sort of norm by which cognisance should be taken of a person's ability to pay.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald has raised a very important point on this and I would like to hear the Minister's reply.  Perhaps there are constitutional problems in this. The Minister said that the tribunal will still act under the same constitutional restraints as the District Courts have had to act.  He further says that the tribunal will be bound by these same constitutional debarments but that declaratory statements have been inserted to the effect that the actual means of the tenant would be taken into account and that this was an attempt to remove some of the confusion that has existed as to whether the likelihood of the tenant receiving a rent allowance should be taken into account in the fixing of the rent.  That was not an amendment to the Bill, but a statement for the purpose of removing any ambiguity under the Act.</P>
    <P>There are ambiguities under the Act in this particular area because there is a time lag between the setting of the rents and the tenants discovering whether or not they qualify for any subsidy from the other Department.  The less time lag, the better, especially for old people and people on fixed incomes, particularly those on small pensions of a fixed nature who are extremely worried because, for the first time, they are faced with astronomical rents in comparison with what they have been paying.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that in this Bill there is provision for appropriate officers in the county council to assist, particularly as the county council is supposed to be recognised &mdash; by all of us who are members of it &mdash; as being specialists in the area of housing and housing rents and have been such for a long time.  I remind the Minister that many rate collectors at county council level are idle and available since the court decision on rates has been found again to be unconstitutional.  They <Col N="699" /> are on terms of contract of employment and probably cannot have their employment terminated.  Here is an area which would not involve any additional expense and I would ask the Minister to take this into account in his consultations with the local authorities and the public service unions on the possibility of employing rate collectors in this field of assistance. The Minister said that he would be calling on them at some future date but not immediately because he now wants to see how the tribunal will work.  Last year we waited to see how the courts would work. Now we find we have to initiate the tribunal and I do not think we should wait too long before bringing in assistance from the Department of the Environment at local authority levels.  The manpower is there, the expertise is there and it could make a very useful contribution in ensuring that people's cases are heard quickly and that decisions which are restrained by constitutional debarments are arrived at in a fair manner.  This legislation tries to ensure that ordinary poor people will not be frightened out of their wits by the courts' procedure, and this tribunal will be a more humanitarian way of dealing with problems at that level.  I welcome the Bill, as will everybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in generally welcoming the provisions of this Bill.  As the Minister has said, it is an attempt to balance the legitimate interests of both tenant and landlord.  It removes a legislative vacuum created by a recent court decision.  In spite of their best efforts the District Courts were not the most satisfactory way of dealing with this matter.  The establishing of the tribunal should, and I hope will be an immense improvement on the existing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the fourth or fifth piece of legislation that we have had in this rather complicated and complex area.  There is a long history dating back from the earlier part of this century when rents were fixed.  The economic climate was then far different from today's.  In spite of what Senator Brendan Ryan says it is not all a problem for one particular side of the <Col N="700" /> community.  In fairness to what he has said, the vast bulk of those people who are affected &mdash; and badly affected &mdash; by the recent court decision are relatively poor, on pensions and have no means of being able to pay substantially increased rents.  Equally, there is a minority of situations of relatively poor landlords and relatively wealthy tenants, and that is in need of remedy also.</P>
    <P>This situation has developed over recent times and Senator O'Toole referred to the Supreme Court's decision that certain Acts which have formed part and parcel of our legal system for many years are unconstitutional.  I am not trying to say that the Supreme Court was wrong in that decision.  There is a delicate relationship.  The independence of the courts must always be recognised.  However, it seems that the decisions reached sometimes do not appear to be for what I would call the &ldquo;common good&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The rights of private property and the manner in which this matter is enshrined in our Constitution obviously leave the Supreme Court on a tight-rope.  As times change, social pressures and economic situations change.  We must have a more enlightened approach, which would try to take into account the balanced needs of all the sectors in our community.  There are people who will never own their own houses.  Their interests have to be protected. We have had recent examples where old people are frightened by the trauma of going into court, many having lived their whole lives without ever having been involved with the law.  They have tried to face up to that experience and the cost of valuers, auctioneers, estate agents, legal advisers and matters of this kind but are financially incapable of coping.  Nevertheless, we can get a Supreme Court decision which would appear, at least &mdash; and I know the constitutional constraints that are there &mdash; to be incapable of taking these considerations into account.  I hope the tribunal will be less formal than a court and less costly.  I welcome the establishment of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that the hearings will be held throughout the country as the volume of <Col N="701" /> cases demands.  Regarding the Minister's statement establishing an alternative system under which landlords or tenants would apply to housing authorities to have the rents fixed by rents officers who would be officials of the local authority, are we talking about further appointments in the local authorities or are we talking about using the existing facilities to cope with the situation?</P>
    <P>In relation to the advice given to the Minister by the Attorney General that we cannot cater under this tribunal for those cases which were decided last year and which caused much upset, has his Department given any consideration to some measure to alleviate the undoubted hardship which has been created for many old people where their rents have been substantially increased?  I know it can be argued that some of the rents paid relative to the property were very small. The fact is that old people on fairly static incomes found themselves moving from a rent of a couple of pounds a month to, perhaps, £25 a week or £25 a month.  It is the kind of increase which they should not be asked to cope with.  I ask the Minister, when replying, to state if any consideration has been given to any measure which would alleviate this hardship.</P>
    <P>Problems experienced in the District Court were referred to earlier.  How do we decide on a fair rent to the landlord and tenant where we have to take into account the financial position of both parties? How does one know that the full financial position particularly of fairly wealthy landlords will be placed before the court?  Is it necessary for them to produce evidence of their income?</P>
    <P>I recognise that it is a complex problem &mdash; but it will be impossible to handle unless one has reasonable access to information of this kind.  With those reservations and the questions I put to the Minister, which I hope he will deal with in his reply, I welcome the Bill.  I hope that it will deal with the problems which have arisen from recent Supreme Court decisions and that it will allay the fears and traumas which many old people have experienced in recent times.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see another amendment <Col N="702" /> in this area for some years.  I am mindful of the independence of the courts and the fact that they have served this country well.  There is room, without changing the Constitution, for debate on certain areas which have changed over the years in the light of changing social situations.  A more enlightened social view should be taken in matters of this kind.  We should not present the Legislature on such consistent basis with decisions which seem to lean over in favour of one sector against another.  I am reluctant to go into this area because it could be easily misinterpreted as condemning our courts.  It is not meant to do that but to convey the impression that many of us hold that the courts can be out of touch with reality and with the changing situation developing in our country.  We should move towards the situation where there is greater flexibility and account taken of pressures which can be caused on individual sectors of the community by decisions which lean so heavily in favour of one group against another.  It is impossible to quantify the effect of those and the trauma they have created.  If there is any mechanism by which the views expressed here could be strongly indicated to the Judiciary, perhaps there would be some scope for the elimination of the kind of decisions I have referred to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Senators in welcoming the Bill.  The Bill gives effect to the commitment by the Government in the Joint Programme for Government to set up a fair rents tribunal.  However people must understand what the Bill does.  The Bill simply transfers from the District Court to the proposed tribunal or to a rent officer the power to determine the terms of the tenancy of a dwelling which formerly was restricted and which is subject to the terms of the 1982 Act.  In doing so, it is important that we realise it is simply a change of scene from the District Court on the one hand to a tribunal on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many comments have been made in recent times in the press on the distress and unpleasantness which many people experience when they come before the <Col N="703" /> District Court in relation to matters of this nature.  I appreciate that.  It is reasonable and fair comment that people experience such feelings.  I would like to be assured, however, that when a tenant or landlord comes before the new tribunal the same feelings will not be experienced.  In so far as the Bill effects a change, it is in one sense an administrative change.  A tenant or landlord who has no experience of going beyond the end of his street, who may be an elderly or disabled person, will instead of having to go to the drafty, dreary, cold, miserable courthouse have to go to wherever the tribunal sits.  That is unless the situation will develop whereby rent officers will actually travel out and meet people <i>in locus.</i>  If that happened, a different situation would arise.</P>
    <P>Many people, in particular old people, experience difficulty in dealing with administration whether that administration be in the form of a court or tribunal. The Bill brings to life the difficulty we are experiencing in society, that the legal system is gradually collapsing and increasingly, due to the inadequacies of the court system, we are transferring to tribunals and like bodies various functions which more properly could be exercised by the courts.  We see the effect of various decisions under labour legislation.</P>
    <P>We have a whole plethora of tribunals sitting around the country.  If we had a properly constituted court system and a commitment by Government to adequately fund the court system&mdash;that is something which is of concern to the Minister because the maintenance of courthouses is a matter for local authorities &mdash; and if we had a system at District Court level of travelling justices who could specialise in various areas, then perhaps the need for this Bill might not arise.  It might be possible to have one or two experienced justices dealing with landlord and tenant matters who would travel on a constant circuit throughout the country and would have an opportunity of dealing with cases arising under the 1982 Act at various venues.</P>
    <P>This Bill does nothing to change or alter the principles on which the terms of <Col N="704" /> the tenancy will be fixed.  It simply changes the administration.  That is the point that must be grasped.  There are one or two aspects of the Bill which may be more appropriate to Committee Stage but I will mention them briefly at this stage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with rent officers.  Subsection (4) of that section provides that housing authorities may make arrangements for the joint discharge of the functions of rent officers.  I do not know if that function should be more properly exercised by the Minister.  Perhaps the Minister could comment on that.</P>
    <P>I am a little confused about section 14 which deals with the declaration of interest. Having read through that very lengthy section it seems to me that there is a basic principle of natural justice that nobody can be a judge in his own court. Here we are in section 14, by and large, legislating for that situation.  I accept that anybody with a declarable interest should not be involved in the determination of any matter under this Bill but I wonder if it is absolutely necessary to legislate specifically for that.  It is already covered by our natural law.</P>
    <P>Other than that, I welcome the Bill.  It may provide an easing for tenants and landlords and for people who would normally have to go before the courts.  I welcome it on the basis that at the moment there are not sufficient funds available to provide for proper facilities within our court structure.  Speaking beyond this Bill, it is regrettable that we are setting up so many subsidiary quasi-judicial bodies to deal with many aspects of administration in the State which could be better dealt with by a properly funded District Court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOLeary" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is like a long-playing record.  During the short period I was in the Seanad on the last occasion there were two different measures introduced by two different Governments. There was a Bill introduced in 1981 which was referred to the Supreme Court by the President and was found not to be in conformity with the terms of the Constitution.  There was the one which was ultimately passed into law, Housing <Col N="705" /> (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, which was not referred to the President and the constitutional validity of which has yet to be tested in the court.  It will be.  There is a very good reason why it has not been tested so far.  I will deal with that later.</P>
      <P>As I and many other Senators said on the passing of the 1982 Act it has a doubtful legal basis.  It is a doubtful interpretation of the Supreme Court judgment which dealt with the striking down of the original legislation, which was the Blake v. Madigan judgment and the judgment which related to the referral of the earlier Bill passed in December 1981.  As a result of that, the Minister of the day, acting on advice, arrived at the conclusion that the overriding consideration was that the rent must be a just and proper one.  As was argued extensively and at great length in this House on the last occasion, in the opinion of some people who were Members of the House at that time that was an improper extract from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the two relevant cases.  There is no doubt that the Supreme Court, at that time, referred to the question of the just and proper nature of the transaction but it was in a different context.  I will not repeat in great detail what has already been said in the Seanad on 16 April 1982, at Column 651 of the Official Report which dealt specifically with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the passing of that legislation, suggestions were made by a number of people that it was possible that the legislation would be unconstitutional for precisely the same reasons that the earlier legislation has been unconstitutional. That legislation has not been challenged by any litigant.  There is a good reason for that.  It is that the series of challenges to this legislation, which culminated in the Blake v. Madigan judgment, were landlord-financed.  They were financed by people who felt &mdash; it was shown afterwards properly felt &mdash; that they were being unfairly treated by the previous legislation.  The possibility of a tenant having the kind of finance necessary to mount a challenge to the constitutionality of any Act, particularly somebody who is living in a controlled <Col N="706" /> dwelling, is very remote.  Therefore, I have always felt, and I expressed the view at the time, that the challenge to the Act which now stands would come from the landlord side.  Of course, landlords being rational people would only challenge something which was not working in their own interest.</P>
    <P>We should not let this occasion pass without placing on record the unsatisfactory interpretation given to the Act by a number of district justices.</P>
    <P>The Act, which is referred to in the Bill before us, was referred to in the Minister's introductory speech when he said that the terms of the tenancy were to be taken into account, the character and location of the dwelling, the means of the landlord and tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling by the landlord, the amount paid for it, the length of time for which he owned it and the length of time for which the tenant occupied it.  What has happened is that when a rent has been fixed in respect of a particular dwelling, that rent has applied to all similar dwellings in a particular terrace, for example, irrespective of the means of the individual or of the landlord.  The very worst fears of those of us who were afraid that the mechanism of the District Court was not suitable for the examination of this case have been realised.  For that reason above all this Bill is to be welcomed. However, we should not let the occasion pass without expressing our disappointment that in the interim period the matter does not appear to have been dealt with in accordance with the criteria set down by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I, as a Member of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas on that occasion, did not agree that this should be the case but it was decided.  Being the true democrat that I am, I accepted it and I would have expected everyone else to accept it also. It appears to me that there was reluctance by the District Court to enter into the minute examination which was called for by the Act which we passed in 1982.</P>
    <P>In considering whether District Courts are suitable tribunals for the examination of these kinds of civil matters, due note should be taken of their apparent failure to meet the challenge which was presented to them by this legislation.  I readily <Col N="707" /> accept that they would have found themselves in difficulty anyway because if they had examined the various criteria laid down by section 13 of the 1982 Act, they would have found themselves constrained by time.  I agree that we would in any case have needed the tribunal even if they had gone into the matter in the detail which they should have done.</P>
    <P>In the consideration of any further legislation which comes before this House of the Oireachtas, we should take due note of the apparent failure of the District Courts to administer satisfactorily the Act which we are now proposing to amend.  That is one of the reasons why I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points I wish to make before dealing with the Bill. I notice that the Bill includes a declaration that the actual means of the tenant should be taken into account.  Those who draft legislation and the Ministers who are responsible for legislation should recognise that points made in this House should be taken seriously.  The point was made quite forcibly in the House, not by me but by other Members, that there was some confusion as to whether the district justice would be entitled to take the means of the tenant as inflated by an allowance given by the Department of Social Welfare.  That matter was not satisfactorily dealt with in the hurry to get legislation through.  As a result of that, we now have this further declaration as to what the real meaning of the Act is.  I agree with it but it should not be necessary. The small points which are made on a non-political basis by Members on all sides of the House should be taken seriously by Ministers because they are not made in order to get maximum publicity. I can assure you, you will not get any publicity for a contribution like that.  It is not made for that reason.  It is made so as that there would be an improvement in the legislation.  That is so whether it comes from the Opposition or the Government side of the House. One of the advantages of having legislation such as we have before us today is that because it is initiated in this House we might have greater opportunities of persuading the Minister to accept amendments <Col N="708" /> to it, recognising as I do the necessity to enact this legisaltion before the Houses of the Oireachtas go into the summer recess.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister sees the rent officers as an alternative system which he does not propose to introduce initially.  I am in favour of a rent tribunal but I am also in favour of a filtering system.  I am not in favour of the rent tribunal being burdened with a large number of cases.  If we had rent officers, their recommendations, subject to the appeal to the tribunal, would be accepted by both the landlord and the tenant in the vast majority of cases.  Therefore, the rent tribunal would have more time to examine in detail the cases referred to it. The tribunal will become bogged down in a large number of cases because we will not have this filtering process.  I would recommend to the Minister that he appoint rent officers, not necessarily in every local authority.  If it is required to change the legislation so that different criteria can apply in different parts of the country that should be done.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for rent officers in Dublin.  There might be no need for rent officers in other parts of the country. I suspect there is a clear need for them in Cork.  In other parts of the country where there might be only 20 or 30 controlled dwellings in a county or 100 controlled dwellings &mdash; some of which may not be the subject of an application &mdash; the use of the tribunal might be quite justified. The Minister should not be too worried about the necessity for the same system to apply everywhere.</P>
    <P>If the Minister divided the country into regions or introduced a local authority structure into it, he could bring section 6 into operation in respect of Dublin and Cork only until it was shown that a demand existed in the rest of the country. It is very important that we should respond to that demand in a reasonable way so that we do not overburden the rent tribunal with repetitious and unnecessary cases.  The activities of a rent officer would be a considerable benefit in getting the landlord and tenant to arrive at an agreement at an early stage or to <Col N="709" /> accept the first rung of the quasi-judicial process.</P>
    <P>There is another reason that I am in favour of rent officers.  Whether we like it or not the question of determining the level of rents does not begin and end with controlled dwellings.  There is a need for a tribunal or a system of rent evaluation in respect of properties which are not controlled dwellings.  Some of the sections of the 1982 Act applied to all properties, for example, the registration provisions. This is obviously a precursor to the extension of various controls to the area not presently covered by section 13 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act.</P>
    <P>Dwellings not covered by this would, by and large, be dwellings that were built after May 1941 or dwellings which had a multiple use, apartments and so on.  It is important, while retaining as the norm the capacity of the landlord and tenant to arrive at their own agreement, to recognise that in certain circumstances vulnerable people need the support of a system. I am talking about vulnerable landlords and vulnerable tenants.  They both need the support of a system.  That system should not be a tribunal system initially. It should be a rent officer system backed up by a tribunal system.  I am very much in favour of the use of rent officers in the initial stages.  It is consistent with the way in which the general development of our housing policy should go.  That is why I am in favour of the utilisation of the rent officers at an early stage to assess in respect of this limited number of cases how they actually perform and whether they reach the degree of satisfaction to landlord and tenant which I expect they will.  Very often between the landlord and tenant there is a kind of love-hate relationship and it only requires the introduction of a sympathetic third party to allow both sides to arrive at a satisfactory conslusion to the problems which for them are very personal problems but which probably are very like other problems which have been considered from time to time by either a tribunal or a rent officer.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I welcome the Bill.  I would like to hear the Minister <Col N="710" /> speak about the possibility of introducing the rent officers at an early stage, particularly of introducing the rent officers in respect of some local authority areas only.  If that could be done not only would it be, as the Minister says, a short-term measure to overcome a particular problem but it would be laying the basis for the longer-term solution to a longer-term problem which will require additional legislation in years to come.  If we have a firm base on which to build and if we have firm experience based on the operation of rent officers in some local authority areas then the consideration of that serious problem will be a far less daunting task than it would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Bill should be passed into law quickly.  I am not happy, as others have also said, with the position that the applications already before the District Court shall by necessity have to remain before the District Court because I am not confident that the very complicated criteria which we have laid down are receiving as full consideration as I expected they would receive under the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982.  Other than that, I think the Bill is a step forward and the Minister will have our enthusiastic support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for the way in which they have responded to this legislation. Part of the response from all sides is based upon the fact, as a number of Senators have already indicated, that we are not coming to this particular matter <i>de novo.</i>  The House has had two separate occasions on which to debate the broad issue of landlord and tenant relations. Everybody's view at the time was that the District Courts should not be used and that some form of rents tribunal would be a preferable system to the utilisation of the District Courts in their present state, in deference to what Senator Durcan accurately described in many cases throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pressures of time during the previous administration required that the legislation be enacted in the first instance and that we would come back as Government <Col N="711" /> of the day to the establishment of the rents tribunal.  That is what we are now doing.  Therefore, this Bill has to be seen, as Senator O'Leary rightly pointed out, in the context of the main Act of 1982.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole in his opening remarks questioned why such an amendment was necessary so soon after the legislation.  In what I have just said I have given the indication as to why that was the case.  Deputy Ray Burke, in the Government of the day, indicated to the House that other things being equal he would have liked to have been in a position to introduce the rents tribunal, but because the constitutional action had left the courts, so to speak, exposed, there was a need to introduce legislation immediately and to come back on the rents tribunals.</P>
    <P>On the question of the appointment of the members of the tribunal and the analogy or comparison made with An Bord Pleanála, which the House will have ample time to discuss next week, it is not really fair to compare the two because in An Bord Pleanála's case we are setting up the unique procedure for appointment which the Minister for the Environment has frequently indicated would not apply to other boards or indeed to other operations. In this instance it is envisaged that the tribunal will have a chairperson appointed and then there will be a panel of people drawn from the skills that I referred to earlier and whose time will be called on as the need arises.  Therefore, they would not, as in the case of An Bord Pleanála, be highly-paid, full-time people.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald about the fears that many of us had in relation to the operation of the District Court is very true.  He referred to a particular case in Rathgar &mdash; and we share the same constituency &mdash; and I do not think he exaggerated.  His description by way of example could be repeated by many people, not just in the city of Dublin but also in Cork where I have had some direct experience.  Indeed, I think I recognise the terrace to which Senator O'Leary was referring on another matter. He raised two other points.  One was <Col N="712" /> the tear that many of us had &mdash; and indeed Senator O'Leary underlined it &mdash; that despite the clear intention and best desire of Members of this House and, indeed, Members of the other House, that the market rent should not prevail and that in the fixing of a just and proper rent the District Court should have regard to the eight factors that are set out clearly in section 13, it appears that many district justices &mdash; not all of them, I want to be very clear about this &mdash; did not appear to take account of this in the manner that we wanted them to.</P>
    <P>That raises the delicate question of the balance between the Legislature and the courts.  It is something that in a democracy we have to be very careful about.  I want to underline and stress my support for the commitment to the courts system. Perhaps if we were to invest more time and energy into the operation of the system of courts we would get a better performance in the manner that Senator Durcan was outlining earlier on.  In so far as this House on two separate occasions clearly talked about factors that would be other than market factors exclusively, then it is proper that we very clearly restate them and I welcome very much the points that have been made by a number of Senators in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald raised two other major points.  The first point was the ability to transfer mandatorily the 900-odd cases that are currently listed for hearing with the District Court to the tribunal. That may be a very desirable objective but it is not, according to the best legal advice that is open to us, available to us. On a personal note of regret, we are constrained and that is the situation. However, there are two positive incentives that may induce the landlord side to begin with for themselves, with the consent of their tenants, to transfer to the tribunal.  The legal costs involved, it is anticipated, will be far less in the tribunal and also the time.  There will be no loss of income; if the landlord has applied to have a case with the District Court the date from which its application has been made will be the starting date for any determination.  Secondly, in all probability, subject to the establishment of the <Col N="713" /> tribunal, having regard to the fact that 900 cases are listed with the District Courts, his or her case will be taken up much sooner.  I would hope that the message would go out loud and clear from the Seanad to landlords in this position, that in all probability it is in their better interests, with the agreement of their tenants, to transfer to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The other point was the streamlining of the procedure in relation to social welfare allowances.  We have initiated some discussion with my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, with a view to seeing how we can remove some of the gaps and lumps that are there at present to achieve the objectives that Senator FitzGerald is looking for.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan, in his contribution which I welcomed, in his general support for the Bill talked in terms of the broader application of this legislation to the whole area of the private rental sector. In relation to the interpretation of the Constitution Senator Smith in his subsequent contribution echoed him, not using the strength of phrase that Senator Brendan Ryan used; I am referring to the beatification of the market economy within our Constitution which is a view that I share with him on a personal basis. Senator Smith very clearly indicated that there is a need within the delicacy of the relationship between the Oireachtas and the Supreme Court in regard to the democratically expressed desires and wishes of all Members of this House &mdash; there appears now to be unanimity coming from all of the parties in relation to this &mdash; for the court in its full and total independence to have regard to the social objectives and indeed to the change in social context within which legislation and economic forces have to operate.</P>
    <P>On the extension of the legislation and on the application to it &mdash; indeed Senator O'Leary referred to it also: an effective system of rent evaluation was the phrase he used &mdash; the position here is that we need to move with agreement and with consensus on both sides.  It is essential that fairness in every sense of the word, not market fairness, not some kind of bureaucratic fairness, but fairness with <Col N="714" /> all factors properly balanced is what should operate.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in relation to the private rental sector is that we lack accurate statistics.  Senator Ryan uses the figure of approximately 30,000 people being affected by this private rented dwellings legislation.  That is an approximate figure. The fact that it is frequently repeated does not give it any greater accuracy.  Its accuracy is highly questionable.  The real answer is we simply do not know.  We have a guesstimate.  It is a guesstimate of a guesstimate at the very best.  In relation to the total extent of the private rental sector it is somewhere in the region of 90,000 dwellings but our census data is not as accurate and not as precise as this and is not as frequently monitored but many houses which were built as private rented dwellings and many advertised as being for rent in the newspapers of our major cities are in fact houses which would otherwise be categorised in the statistics available to us now as privately owned dwellings.</P>
    <P>I would share the view of Senator O'Leary and Senator Ryan, and indeed others, that there is a need to move into this area to find an effective system of evaluation that provides the correct balance between the legitimate interests of both sides.  In doing that, and I want to be very clear about this, we should learn from the mistakes of the past with particular reference, and I say this as Minister of State with overall responsibility in the Department of the Environment for urban conservation and urban renewal, to what fixed rents did to the housing stock throughout our towns and cities, as Senator FitzGerald rightly pointed out.</P>
    <P>Senator Ferris, my colleague, in welcoming the Bill indicated that it was an addition to the 1982 legislation and I think rightly focussed on the necessity to deal with the problem of the social welfare payments and in particular the rent allowances.  The question of the declaratory statement that he raised &mdash; and he was followed by Senator O'Leary &mdash; is an important one.  The legislative point made by Senator O'Leary is something that I personally take on board very much.  Nobody has a monopoly of wisdom <Col N="715" /> in relation to the drafting of legislation. The teasing out process that both Houses of the Oireachtas can provide is an essential legislative filter that should not be avoided.  In so far as I have any personal say in these matters, I would certainly welcome and respond to the spirit of what Senator O'Leary was saying.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is quite clear what we are trying to say in this instance, that it is the factual means of the tenant that are the means and only those means are to be taken into account when the fixing or assessment of a rent is being contemplated by the tribunal or by the rents officers.  There is no way that the anticipated rent allowance that the tenant would be legally entitled to should be added to his or her means and a quasimarket rent subsequently fixed.  That defeats the entire purpose of the measure and it is contrary to what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>Senator Smith in his substantial contribution covered some of the points that I have already referred to, the relationship between the Supreme Court and the powers of the tribunal under the parent legislation, so to speak.  It is clearly our intention, subject to proper consultation with the local authorities and the public service unions, that there would be no net additional increase in staff.  From my own personal knowledge I am quite confident that housing authorities throughout the country not only have the expertise and the desire to participate in this area but that they also have the available personnel.  I think it was Senator Ferris who referred to that as well.  Obviously, these are matters of an administrative kind that need to be discussed in consultation with the various other parties involved but the points that the Senators have made in relation to the utilisation of existing resources will be taken into account when we go to move in that area.</P>
    <P>Another point that Senator Smith raised was that of the relationship between social welfare, the rent allowances and the actual means.  I have dealt with that already.  The Senator rightly referred to the implicit element of decentralisation <Col N="716" /> in the principle of this legislation. This is not going to be another Dublin based body.  I am sure, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, you will welcome the spirit of that sentiment even from a jackeen like myself.  For too long we have tended to concentrate effective decision making in either Dublin or Cork without recognising that in addition to having to go through the process of availing of rights in a tribunal there is the extra difficulty of travelling to Cork or to Dublin. We are availing within this legislation if operated in full of both the filter system that Senator O'Leary talks about for every local authority or where two or three local authorities can come together and appoint a rents officer.  Not every housing authority will have to have a rent officer.  There is provision in the subsections of the relevant section to enable the local authorities, in Connacht for example, to decide to appoint a rent officer who will adjudicate for Galway, Mayo and Roscommon and so on, if the need arises.  We are building that flexibility into the legislation because of the statistical poverty we have in relation to this whole area.  If we had a clearer statistical picture our legislation could be more finely honed and tuned in.  We have not.  Therefore, we want, without coming back to the House again, to give ourselves that flexibility.  That flexibility is only there for that particular purpose.</P>
    <P>One of the phrases that caught my attention in Senator Smith's description of the court procedures was the need to allay the fears and remove the trauma that people frequently experience in the court process.  As Senator Ryan said in his own description &mdash; this may offend the lawyers among us &mdash; there is an implicit suggestion of criminality for anybody who is summoned to go to court. The procedure, the paraphernalia, the ritual surrounding the courts and the archaic language that is frequently used &mdash; which certainly offends my particular Republican sentiments &mdash; all go to distance the person from the procedures directly at hand and to make them somewhat uneasy and therefore produce the fear and the trauma that the Senator so accurately described.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> One of the main objectives behind the tribunal &mdash; and you cannot write this into legislation but you can certainly move to try to achieve it &mdash; is to decriminalise, in a psychological sense, the entire procedure of effective rent evaluation and to respond to the difficulties of people, particularly elderly people who have lived all their lives in a particular house are now forced somehow or other to justify their tenancy of it.  From what I have heard from the Senators today we will be able to move to achieve that with good, positive co-operation from all sides.</P>
    <P>Senator Durcan made a very good case which I hope the Minister for Justice will pick up in relation to the need to restructure and support the whole judicial system and the courts system including such Minister's responsibility for maintaining the courthouses and not having them falling upon the backs of local authorities.  In saying that, he did make the fair point that it applies to a broader area of interest than the particular operation of this legislation. He also correctly pointed out that this is a commitment of the present Fine Gael-Labour administration in relation to the Joint Programme for Government.  In saying that, I want to acknowledge that we would not be able to honour that commitment if it had not been for the co-operation of the Fianna Fáil Party in this regard.</P>
    <P>Two minor points which he raised related to the operation of sections 6 and 14.  On Committee Stage I will come back to the question of section 6 (4).  On the question of section 14, whether it was really necessary to include what would otherwise be a factor of natural justice, I have no legal expertise so I cannot comment very learnedly on it.  Our desire in setting out such an extensive section in section 14 was not only to cover the natural law point but also to set down clearly the procedures in relation to how it should operate in this legislation and to remove any ambiguity that might arise accordingly.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Leary began rightly by setting the context in which the legislation was first initiated and talked about the possibility of future Supreme Court <Col N="718" /> action.  There was a suggestion at one stage that the 1982 Act would be subject to a constitutional challenge and I understand that some preliminary proceedings did start in that area.</P>
    <P>He rightly pointed out that the landlords are rational people in so far as they pursue their economic interest as landlords and that therefore if the system is seen to operate in their interest they will not proceed to challenge it.  He pointed out that the previous actions had been initiated by landlords.  I would like to think that within the context of obtaining an effective system of rent evaluation whatever procedures we introduce in our society would be seen to be both in the interests of tenants and landlords and that what I would regard as the basic human right to shelter that our society should extend to everybody, should be something that should be extended to individuals in their personal capacity and the necessary relation between the capital cost of the building and its rent in order to maintain it and to cover its cost and so on should not be confused.</P>
    <P>If people, through no fault of their own, are unable economically to house themselves adequately then we as a society should give them assistance but that assistance should in no way, as we have learned in the past, interfere with the provision of net additional housing or indeed the maintenance of the existing housing stock involving dire consequences as we have seen from parts of our older urban areas.  Therefore, and I should like to emphasise this to landlords who may read this legislative debate, it is our clear intention to provide a fair and effective system which will, with all due respects to Senator Durcan and other legal colleagues, be a more effective and less expensive system of rent evaluation than is currently available to them.</P>
    <P>The final point that Senator O'Leary made related to the utilisation of rent officers and the tribunal.  I am concerned, as indeed all of the politicians in both Houses are concerned, that we should move to have this tribunal established as quickly as possible.  It may be that there is a need, and I agree with this personally, in the Dublin and Cork areas in particular <Col N="719" /> for the filter system of a rent officer and a tribunal.  We are not really sure; a lot depends on how many of the already listed 900 cases opt to transfer to this tribunal.  I have already referred to the fact that, as he indicated himself, around the remainder of the country there will not necessarily be need for a rent officer in every local authority and we have made provision for the pooling of resources in that area.  But we will be in a position, following the enactment of this legislation, to move quickly and decisively to establish the tribunal and in concert with that, depending on the way things move &mdash; and in all probability it will be necessary at some stage in the near future &mdash; to avail of the provisions in relation to rent officers having regard to the consultative process that I have described.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered all the points raised by the various Senators; those that I have not we can take up on Committee Stage.  I commend Second Stage to the House and thank Senators for their support.</P>

      <P>I do not like the precedent of initiating a Bill in the Seanad and then asking us on this side of the House for a quick conclusion.  Furthermore, while I am dealing with that, may I say that it is not easy to put down amendments in the time available. Indeed, the Leader of the House has now <Col N="720" /> indicated that we should adjourn in order to get time to put down amendments. There is no time at this stage because you cannot rush out, get amendments and try to get them in, have your lunch and be back here to debate them.  This is why I feel that it is a wrong precedent to initiate a Bill and then ask for its conclusion on the same day.  I know it is not a guillotine operation at this time.  As the Minister has rightly said, the tribunal should be set up as quickly as possible and with the Summer Recess in the offing if we put this back for another week it might not get under way until the end of the Recess and the next sitting and then it might be into 1984 before it would become law. For that reason we on this side of the House are not going to hold up this Bill but I would like that in the formation of the Riar na hOibre our views should be considered.  On the Order Paper, we have coming after this Bill a Committee Stage Bill which will also involve the Minister. There should be some recognition for spokesmen on this side of the House and people dealing with the environment. The criminal justice item could have been made item No. 3 on this occasion and so give the Minister an opportunity to have a break and give the people on this side who will be contributing to item No. 3 a break also.  I hope that the Leader of the House will keep this in mind for the future.  We do not intend to hold up the Bill in any way and if he wishes to take the next Stage now or adjourn for lunch we are in a position to agree to that.</P>

I do appreciate the difficulty in that we have this Bill which is urgent and also another local government Bill at an advanced stage.  If it would help the Senators in regard to the preparation for the Committee Stage of this Bill we could pass on to the next item on the agenda and return to this at 4 o'clock or even 5 o'clock.  This, indeed, was an alternative I had in mind and in view of what Senator O'Toole has said, he might find that more convenient though, as he says, he may well be involved in the measures that will be brought in in the meantime.</P>

It does not matter whether we take the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill in Committee Stage today.  This Bill does matter; so, if we come back at 2 o'clock we are making a declaration that there will be no restriction on the Committee Stage of this Bill and I think that is perhaps a better attitude to take.  I certainly will keep in mind the question of business items coming one after the other and I am sure Senator Eoin Ryan, who has occupied the position of Leader of the House, will realise that there is a principle that once you catch a Minister it is just as well to keep him because sometimes if he gets away you do not get him back again.</P>

      <P>Section 2 deals with the establishment of a tribunal.  A chairman is to be appointed by the Minister and also a number of vice-chairmen.  How many vice-chairmen does the Minister consider necessary and what type of person has he in mind?  Under subsection (4) of this section, the Minister with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service from time to time may appoint from among his officers persons to assist the tribunal.  Is he talking about appointing officers to the board, or is he talking about appointing officers from the Department of the Public Service to assist the tribunal?</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator O'Toole has raised this question. The volume of work the tribunal will have to do is not clear.  We propose to err on the safe side by appointing a number of people, including vice-chairmen or vice-chairpersons, to enable the tribunal to sit simultaneously in Dublin, Cork, Galway and on Shannonside.  What is envisaged at the moment is a tribunal of three people including a vice-chairman and two other ordinary members.  All things being equal the person will be a judicial person of one kind, a lawyer of one kind as an ordinary member, a valuer as an ordinary member, and then someone with administrative experience or judicial experience who will act as a sort of referee between the other two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea of nominating people to the position of vice-chairman would enable the tribunal to sit simultaneously in a number of locations.  The model we are looking at in relation to this&mdash;the comparative model, although I do not want a direct comparison to be made with it&mdash;is the Employment Appeals Tribunal <Col N="723" /> which operates in the Labour Court.  In that context it is an adversary situation which we are not attempting to repeat but, in terms of flexibility, in terms of the way in which they will be appointed and their operating costs, we see it as being similar to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. I do not know if that answers all the questions.</P>

      <P>Because we do not know the volume of work it is not easy to assess how many will be required. Senator O'Leary said we might not require any rent officers outside Dublin or Cork, and he also spoke about filtering cases before they come to the tribunal.  I see one of his suggestions contradicting the other.  If you want filtering you will get it done by the rent officers in the field. I can see rent officers being appointed in counties like the bigger counties of Mayo, Galway and Cork.  They would do most of the assessments and filtering.  The tribunal would then sit at different locations throughout the country to deal with the cases that could not be dealt with prior to that.  Will the rent officers be local authority officers with some knowledge and will they be full-time officers or part-time officers?</P>

I warn the Minister that it might run counter to principles of natural justice unless he gives people an opportunity to present their case and have the case on the other side equally well presented. This is where the difficulty comes in.  Under which particular section is the Minister making arrangements to do this?  I do not see it in any specific section. <Col N="724" /> I raise it here because this is the section which actually creates the tribunal.  Will the Minister explain that to us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2, the Minister has given us an idea of the kind of people who should be members of the tribunal.  In his opening speech he said they will probably be a solicitor, a barrister, a valuer, and so on, but, on the other hand, the Bill provides no precise definition in regard to this matter.  This seems most extraordinary having regard to the line which the Government have been taking during the past week on another Bill.  They criticised appointments because the people appointed did not have specific qualifications.  By implication they criticised any body of this kind because the qualifications for members of the boards were not laid down in the Bill. In the Planning Bill the Government have gone to immense lengths, a very complicated, very devious, almost Heath Robinson kind of procedure, to say who the members of the board shall be, and how they shall be selected.  In this Bill it is quite open.  The Minister can appoint anybody.</P>
      <P>Of course the Minister has told us what he intends to do and what he thinks should be done.  That is all very well, but it leaves the position completely open. We could have people appointed to this tribunal in the future who would have no qualifications or no suitability whatsoever. I might not have commented on this were it not for the fact that this question has been very much at issue in the past week.  It seems to be a characteristic of the Coalition that their right hand does not seem to know what their left hand is doing.  I say that without any ideological content.  This is an extraordinary manifestation of the tendency on the part of the Government to do two entirely inconsistent things at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not necessarily in favour of spelling out in a Bill of this kind exactly what qualifications members of a board or a tribunal should have.  By and large, Governments in the past have been responsible about the kind of people they appointed.  Of course, for some boards it <Col N="725" /> would be impossible to lay down qualifications because obviously there would be people who would have a general view or a general experience of business and it would not be possible to lay down qualifications. This is an area very similar in many respects to the position under the Planning Acts and nevertheless, the question of ensuring that suitable people, qualified people, are appointed is blithely ignored, as though that kind of consideration was something the present Government did not believe in, or thought was of no importance whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I am not dedicated to the idea of stating exactly in a Bill of this kind what qualifications a person should have but, at the same time, I have to comment on the total inconsistency of the Government who introduce this Bill today and introduced another very similar Bill yesterday in which their total concern seems to be the necessity of saying what qualifications people should have and to ensure that unsuitable people cannot be appointed. It is quite clear that under this Bill unsuitable people could be appointed.  Whatever the good intentions of the Minister may be there is no doubt that that is possible in the future.  I cannot understand how one point of view in another Bill can be reconciled with the way in which this Bill has been drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>To take Senator O'Leary's points first, the procedures to be adopted will be set out by way of regulation.  It is our clear intention to replace the current adversary system which the District Courts have tended to produce with a non-adversary system.  However, Senator O'Leary is correct in saying that people's natural rights and entitlements are such that they should be allowed to present their case and, if they so choose, to have people to assist them in the presentation of their case.  The procedures will be set out by regulation which will come before the House in the normal manner.  That is set out in section 15 of the Bill.  We are looking for a certain degree of flexibility to enable us to move from one foot to the other should the need arise.  I would be the first to accept <Col N="726" /> as a legislator, as distinct from an office holder, that that is not a very satisfactory way in principle to approach legislation, but we are impoverished by the available statistics in this regard to a certain extent. Senator Ryan's argument has a compelling logic to it.  All I can say is that in this instance we will appoint to the tribunal people who, as I said in my Second Stage speech, represent the interests and the skills I believe and the Government believe are required.  They will be people with experience of valuations, people with legal experience, and people with a general view.  What is lost sight of frequently in all of these boards and groups is the general view to which he referred.  He is pointing to an apparent contradiction, from his point of view, between one piece of legislation and another.  I will be back in this House on another occasion talking about An Bord Pleanála, and in so far as it is relevant to this point, I do not think one can compare the two for the reason that An Bord Pleanála has become the subject of a considerable degree of comment.

      <P>This section disqualifies the holders of certain elected offices from membership of the tribunal.  I wonder whether elected members of Údarás na Gaeltachta should not be included, and if there is any reason why they have been excluded.  Members of the Údarás are elected within the Gaeltacht areas on the usual electoral basis.  I cannot see why they are not excluded under this section.</P>

      <P>In the past we have appointments from political areas to the Judiciary, such as lay commissioners in the Land Commission.  I want the Minister of State to say why he is eliminating the prospect of any assistance from people in the political field in this area. <Col N="727" /> In the tuberculosis eradication programme there is the view that if you eliminate the disease completely you run a greater risk of an outbreak.  I am afraid that in their desire to follow opinion at the moment and eliminate politicians from so many areas, the Government are running the risk of eliminating politicians and the cure could be worse than the disease.  There could be an outbreak of problems.  In the past we were able to appoint people as lay commissioners in the Land Commission.  Dealing with land is a very emotive problem.  We were able to draw from these sources for appointments and from the Judiciary.  Politicians will not be eligible for this tribunal.  I have no wish however to qualify personally.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister something I asked on another Bill yesterday. Apart from the extraordinary exclusion of politicians from every State agency set up since I came into this House, the reason for excluding people immediately they become candidates still escapes me.  It seems to inhibit people's ability to participate in anything.  A person nominated either as a Member of Seanad Éireann or for election to either House of the Oireachtas shall thereupon cease to be a member of the tribunal. There might be logic in something like this where there could be conflicts of interest.  I do not altogether see it.  I can see no logic in excluding people automatically if they become candidates.  I mentioned yesterday a distinguished member of the Higher Education Authority who had to resign because he became a candidate for Seanad Éireann, not even when he was elected but when he became a candidate.  I still do not understand it.  The Minister will probably tell me that is standard practice.  Standard practice can be wrong as easily as it can be right.  I should like to know is there a reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo that sentiment.  It has often happened that people have been out of work as a result of allowing their names to go forward in the democratic <Col N="728" /> process, despite the fact that they were not elected.  They were then without a job which is rather unfair.  Many well-known people come to mind immediately, even in my own party.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the exclusion of members of local authorities.  I accept that there is some justification in this case for a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas because, no matter how badly we are paid, at least we are paid and we would be considered to have a vested interest in this area.  The day he is elected a member of a local authority has to declare his interest in the council chamber and cannot and does not take part in planning decisions in the council because of this declaration of interest.  He is an unpaid politician at local level.  Anything he does is on a voluntary basis and he is subject to criticism from many people.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister of State why he felt it necessary to exclude voluntary politicians.  Perhaps they could have a major input into a tribunal and they would know the people in this area.  The people would have confidence that local councillors would handle their cases better than they are being handled in the district courts.  They would be seeing somebody with whom they could associate and identify themselves, as they do in claims under the Social Welfare Acts.  Although their powers are limited, local social welfare committees are most acceptable to people who tend to give of their best in front of local councillors because they know them and trust them and know that they understand their problems.  I resent this on behalf of members of local authorities.</P>

      <P>We had this yesterday in another area.  This happens in drafting Bills.  This section is just put in.  There is no recognition of the expertise of members of local authorities who would be excellent people to sit on a tribunal such as this one.  They would know all the relevant aspects social and otherwise of housing and so on.  Must you have a legal mind to sit on this tribunal?  A valuer or an auctioneer would have a wide range of assessment qualities in the auctioneering field.  What would a legal mind have <Col N="729" /> to offer in fixing a proper rent?  This is where we fell down with the District Courts system.  They sat there, as Senator FitzGerald said, on the bench.  People before them and their lawyers were unable to get through to them.  They probably fixed rents without a proper examination of the facts.  An independent person sitting on a tribunal such as this, with years of experience of local government administration would make a very good member.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot change the Bill now.  It is almost standard practice to insert this section about Members of the Oireachtas and public representatives. They are not wanted on boards because they may have political pull in decision making.  Local authority representatives throughout this nation are doing a very worthwhile job with no remuneration whatever, and doing a very impartial job for the people.  They would be ideal people to sit on a tribunal such as this one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As some Senators have already indicated, this is a standard provision that goes into nearly all legislation establishing a board.  The thinking behind it is pretty fair.  It is not denigratory of politicians.  It is for the House at some stage in the future to discuss it in principle. The thinking behind it is that it is designed to try to protect politicans from influence or from pressures in their individual capacity and to ensure that our interminable pursuit of votes during most of our working lives as politicians does not get in the way of making clear and balanced decisions.  Not everybody has the luxury of a quota on the first count. Most of us have to struggle through second, third and fourth preferences to arrive at elected office and frequently we do not even achieve that.  The thinking behind it is to protect politicians from the conflict of having to make quasi-judicial judgments in some instances, or judgments on behalf of the common good and, at the same time, needing to seek votes.  That is the thinking behind it.  I am not necessarily saying that I agree with it. I tend to be of two minds and I would prefer a longer time to debate it because <Col N="730" /> if we were to change this provision we should change it right across the board in relation to a lot of other legislation.</P>
      <P>However, I would draw the House's attention to the fact that if you combine the number of candidates for general election, 166 Dáil seats plus 60 Seanad seats, and 1,000-odd local authority seats, and multiply the seats by a factor of 2 or 3 in terms of competing candidates, there probably are not many more than about 5,000 people who have opted for the pursuit of elected office.  Whether those people should be automatically excluded from consideration for these boards is an issue wider than the context of this legislation.  All I am saying in defending this section is that it is harmonising this legislation with other legislation. I gather from what Senator O'Toole said that Senator Honan referred to this in the context of the Posts and Telegraphs Bill.  That would be my view.  Until such time as we change the system generally, I do not think it would be necessarily appropriate to change it in relation to this legislation, although I recognise the arguments that have been put forward.</P>

      <P>On the question of Údarás na Gaeltachta raised by Senator Durcan, there is some ambiguity here.  Some of the members are elected directly, others are appointed by the Minister.  They are not a directly political or elected board in the sense that we commonly know it.  For that reason Údarás were excluded.

      <P>There is one point I want to make arising out of that discussion in so far as it relates to membership of Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann, and the Assembly of the European Community. Members may not be aware of it, but &mdash; going on memory, I do not think this applies to membership of a local authority &mdash; you can be a member of a local authority and a member of a semi-State board.  You can be a director of the ESB and CIE and be a member of a local authority.  There is a reason for that which I support.  Within the context of this Bill and the Private Rented Dwellings Act, 1982, certain authority is given to the housing authority who have certain functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 6 of this Bill it is proposed that the rents officers should be officers appointed by the housing authorities, and therefore subject to the housing authorities, presumably.  It would be invidious to have a member of the local authority, which is the housing authority, also a member of the tribunal to whom the dissatisfied applicant would be appealing.  In the circumstances, we should firmly lay it on the line that unless there is a very specific reason, there should not be an exclusion in the case of <Col N="732" /> members of a local authority.  However in this case, because there are functions under this Bill and the Act to which it directly relates for local authorities members of local authorities should be excluded from potential membership of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities may make arrangements for the joint discharge of their functions under this Act.</P>
      <P>We are trying to encourage two or three local authorities to designate one person, given the volume of potential business and because there may be some staff negotiations involved, an allocation of scarce personnel resources and so on.

Hence the attraction of being able to appoint someone who knows the prevailing level of housing conditions and rents in the area and not someone who has come into the town and has no proper direct or even indirect experience of the work.

      <P>On Second Stage I said in my view it would be a better Bill if the rent officers system came into operation when the Act came into operation.  The rent officers are a necessary filter system and every effort should be made to bring it into operation.  Having discussed this privately with the Minister, I considered further the question of putting down an amendment which would enable him to make the appointment of a rent officer for some of the local authority areas only.  The Minister correctly pointed out that that probably is not a sustainable position.  It is suggested that all applications will have to be routed through the rent officers and that would have to apply to every local authority.  That is right and anything else would probably be in conflict with natural justice and all sorts of other important concepts.  It is important that the rent officers be used and I recommend very strongly that they be used from the first day the Act is brought into operation.  It is not necessary to propose an amendment to that effect because the Minister will have the power to do that if he wants to.  I recommend very strongly that he use the rent officers because this will be a much better system and we will not be building up a big bureaucracy in the tribunal.</P>

      <P>What Senator O'Leary says has great merit.  The element of human concern involved in this area is extremely important.  We must remember that to qualify for the social welfare rent subsidy, a tenant must have his or her rent fixed by the District Court, and presumably under this legislation by the tribunal or by a rent officer.  Obviously, in terms of the elderly, vulnerable people about whom everybody is concerned, a visit by a rent officer to their homes would be a more humane way of dealing with the problem.  If people do not go before the tribunal they will not qualify, and old people have the option of either paying an enormous rent &mdash; which they might agree to pay &mdash; or paying a small or relatively reasonable rent.  What Senator O'Leary suggested would be very humane and compassionate particularly in the two or three major urban areas where the problem of old people is widespread. A rent officer appointed to carry out these functions could alleviate a lot of the personal distress these people are suffering.</P>

We sought the full co-operation for all Stages of this Bill today in this House because of our desire to establish the tribunal and this mechanism as quickly as possible.  In so far as the establishment of rent officers would not impede the speedy establishment of this system, particularly for the larger urban areas and to achieve the two-stage filter system which Senator O'Leary is talking about, we would look very positively on what he suggested but within the time constraints I referred to earlier.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>... the references in the said section <Col N="737" /> 13 to the opinion of the Court shall be construed as including, as the case may require, reference to the opinion of the Tribunal or the opinion of the rent officer.</P>
    <P>Section 13 dealt with matters which should be taken into consideration in fixing the rent and said it would be a just and proper rent having regard to the nature, character and location of the dwelling, the other terms of the tenancy, the means of the landlord and the tenant and various other things.  The way the court at that time, and the tribunal now, are to approach this is that they would first decide what the ordinary market rent of the premises should be, then they would, perhaps, make certain allowances having regard to these matters which are dealt with, including the means of the landlord and the tenant.  Presumably, if they came to the conclusion that the landlord was a very wealthy person and the tenant was a very poor person, they would fix the rent a little bit lower than it would normally be.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Senator Smith, and the same point was dealt with very forcefully by Senator Whitaker when he was a Member of this House, to the fact that there are cases where the landlord is the poor person and the tenant is a relatively wealthy person. Although I am sure that in the vast majority of cases that will come under this Bill the landlord will be relatively well-off and the tenant not well-off, nevertheless, there are many cases where the landlord is the person in need of consideration. That is a fact which some Members do not seem to be aware of, or perhaps they just choose to ignore it, but it is a fact which has to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 13 states that in certain circumstances the rent should be fixed at less than the proper rate because of the means of the landlord and tenant, but if this legislation is to be interpreted in a fair and non-discriminatory way, it would be open to the tribunal, in the kind of case that I mentioned where the tenant is the wealthy person and the landlord is the impoverished person, to fix the rent at something more than the market rent, <Col N="738" /> having regard to the fact that the landlord has been getting far less than he or she should have been getting, perhaps for many years past.  I would like the Minister to comment on whether he thinks it would be open to the tribunal in the circumstances which I have postulated for the rent to be fixed at something more than the market rent in these circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for this section is to establish legally that the tribunal or the rent officer will have the same rights to fix the terms of a rent tenancy as the District Court originally had under the 1982 Act.  We are simply transferring the entitlement to fixed terms in that context. To answer the second point the Senator raised, since we have consistently said that a just and proper rent should not automatically be seen as the market rent but should take into account circumstances on the ground as they relate to particular cases, the instances he referred to &mdash; and some occur &mdash; should be dealt with in a manner that takes all those factors into account.

      <P>I want to comment on subsection (5).  It is becoming an increasingly dangerous occupation to get married. A person would want to be very careful about whom he marries because not only would membership of a local authority disqualify him from all sorts of things, and Membership of the Oireachtas disqualifies him from all sorts of beneficial appointments &mdash; but his spouse, by her profession, could also disqualify him from the most extraordinary things.  I doubt that it is necessary to put anything in this Bill about spouses.  The whole movement in marriage relationships should be towards the separation of the <Col N="739" /> husband and wife as being two separate individuals, not towards considering them only as a unit or one being dependent on the other.  There seem to be two conflicting strands of opinion running through our legislation as present &mdash; to grant a proper place to each partner and to identify their interests as being separate and distinct and capable of being defended by the law &mdash; and it is proper that they should be defended by the law. In this case a beneficial interest includes the interest of a spouse.  If the spouse is the landlord or tenant of the building that is a beneficial interest of the other partner. If the spouse is a member of the company or other body which is landlord of the dwelling, or even if the spouse is in the employment of a person who is either the landlord or tenant of the dwelling, that is considered as being of beneficial interest to the partner.</P>
      <P>I know why this subsection is written into this Bill and it does not worry me from a personal point of view, but we are a bit confused about what we want marriage to mean.  Do we want people to have separate identities, or do we want to tie them hand and foot together?  I think we are going both ways simultaneously and we are in a total mess, as a result.  It is not necessary to have this subsection included.  The point was made by Senator Durcan this morning that even if this section was never there, there would be an overriding duty on every person not to act as a judge in his own case.  That overriding duty could, in certain circumstances extend to properties and to situations where a person's spouse, son or daughter was involved. That overriding interest will be there irrespective of whether we pass this legislation. I do not think it is a good idea to be tying spouses together by legislation. This is adding an unnecessary complication to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I recognise the intent, but I wonder why only those relationships which are defined by the laws of holy wedlock are referred to.  For instance, the father/son relationship is not referred to.  As far as I can see it is only the spouse. I do not see why people who are married are specifically picked out in this case, particularly since, by and large with the nature of Irish life as is, it will be the women who are picked out in this way.</P>

      <P>This could be discriminatory. I am not sure that it is a good idea specifically to pick out a spouse, who should be treated as a separate individual in his or her own right.  It is questionable whether we are reversing what is now taken to be norm, that we treat everybody individually as having his or her own right, even in a married situation. On the question of taxation and other areas, we are bending over backwards to ensure that people are treated separately.  Why suddenly identify them here as having to be treated differently?</P>

      <P>Much as I enjoy the company of the Members of this House, I have no desire to participate in the House's 7 o'clock business, despite my views on the matter.  Going on from the Second Stage comments that I made earlier today, the reason why there is such <Col N="741" /> an apparently elaborate section 14 for a matter that would otherwise have been covered by natural justice is twofold. First of all, we have begun the piecemeal process, legislatively speaking, in a broad sense of identifying in her own legal right the legal spouse of the marriage relationship, particularly in relation to property and to the family home.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that local authorities now fix joint tenancy as a matter of course for husband and wife irrespective of the definition of wife in that particular instance.  The reason why we thought it necessary to include references to spouses in this instance was because under the 1982 Act proper, the spouse will have a successionary right in relation to tenancy in the context of being a tenant, but the declaration of interest could cut both ways.  The point, therefore, is that if you put it in for one you should put it in for others.  We did not want it to become unnecessarily complex to include father and son and other successionary rights.</P>
      <P>The intent behind it is fairly clear.  It is part of the legal process about which the Senators will have more substantial comments to make.  Ultimately, the moving from a position where all of the property was held, or deemed to be legally owned, by the husband in the relationship, by a gradual process, to now being partially, or jointly, or separately owned is going to continue to result in these anomalies which only substantial legislation, such as the kind that the committee will look at in the lifetime of this Oireachtas will be able to eliminate.</P>

If so, what Senator O'Leary said about the danger of getting married is substantially true and you would be a good deal better off not to marry.</P>

      <P>The Minister on Second Stage said that the definition of the word &ldquo;service&rdquo; in this section was framed to cover the widest possible range of services provided and to give local authorities power to charge for any of these services.  At the moment local authorities charge for the processing of SDA loans, Housing Finance Agency loans and house improvement loans. Would the Minister see other services which the local authorities provide being included as services for the purpose of charges?  I am thinking in particular of services such as the processing of higher education grant applications, of essential repairs grant applications, or disabled persons' grant applications and such services.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this legislation, among other things, as Senators will recall from the <Col N="744" /> last debate, is to give, in relation to the legal entitlement of the local authority the charge for a service at this stage, the maximum degree of flexibility on the services they wish to charge for.  Therefore, in response to Senator Mullooly's point, the answer in essence is yes, that it is legal.  If it can be legally seen to be a service, then the local authority can put a charge on it, but the counterbalance to that is that the Minister of the day &mdash; either myself, the Minister for the Environment or any of our successors &mdash; will not be directing a local authority to so charge.  While the authority will have the power, for the first time, to charge for services for which they cannot currently charge, they will also have the corresponding and complementary power to decide themselves what services they wish to charge for.  Therefore, any fears they may have in relation to services which are currently being provided free and not directly charged and which may subsequently end up being charged are fears over which the authority have total control.</P>

      <P>It will be noticed that there are no amendments from this side of the House on this very important and controversial Bill.  It is regrettable that the amendments which were put forward in the other House were not accepted.  Of all Bills, this is one that requires the dedicated thought of every legislator throughout the State because it is a Bill to bring about fundamental changes in chargeability as between State and local authority.  Up to now, revenue expenditure has been funded by rates, by domestic rates and by grant from the Department <i>in lieu</i> of rates and from a variety of receipts.  May I say at the outset that we are not putting forward an amendment because no amendment was accepted in the other House, but we are going to discuss every section in depth and to debate the Bill in full.  We regret that none of our proposed and worthwhile amendments on this controversial Bill was acceptable.  Today we are not making promises, we are making law &mdash; very important local government law. <Col N="745" /> For that reason, our amendments should have been accepted in the other House.</P>

Then, when it comes to a Bill, he writes into the Bill that nobody elected to either House can go on a board, and we have more of that here.  He said in his reply to Second Stage that based on present knowledge, the maximum amount to be raised by local authorities under this legislation is £20 million.  Does he think that is possible?  He goes on then to talk about the abolishing of rates, but I will come to that on another section.  If he thinks that local authorities will have to collect £20 million this year, what does he think they will have to collect next year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise on section 2 a point I raised with the Minister on Second Stage last week.  That concerned what I described as the risk of a double charge arising for owners of commercial property in relation to services provided by local authorities.  The Minister was kind enough to allow another discussion <Col N="746" /> on it on Committee Stage.  For that reason, I want now briefly to re-emphasise the point I was making then.  Under section 2 we are empowering local authorities to make charges for certain services.  We are also empowering them now to bring in a double charge for certain services &mdash; be it water, refuse, sewerage and so on.  They are now the remaining ratepayers.  Many have small businesses, as shopkeepers, publicans and so on.  They are already paying rates on their property and within the rates there is an element that part of that rate is set aside to cover the cost of the provision by the local authorities of the services to which I am referring.  It is important that we ensure that an injustice does not arise as a result of the passing of the legislation where these people are concerned.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point in replying on Second Stage that it was possibly covered by the fact that the charges could be offset against income tax, corporation profits tax and so on.  I accept that point in relation to the people who are begging for it and who are on tax assessment against which these charges can be offset. The reality is that at present many people in the categories I mention are making a loss.  I want to give an example from a trade with which I am most familiar, the licensed trade.  In 1981, a survey carried out by Stokes, Kennedy and Crowley showed that any provincial publican with a turnover of less than £50,000 was in a loss-making situation.  In other words, he was not able to sustain himself or his family income without supplementing it from outside his business.  The way out envisiged by the Minister would not apply there because he has not got a profit and has nothing against to offset the charges. That survey also showed that approximately half of our publicans were in that situation.  People may find that hard to accept but Stokes, Kennedy and Crowley are regarded as a sufficiently reputable company for their findings to be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the Minister is prepared to consider an inclusion in that provision there to cover that situation, the one thing that we will guarantee with certainty by passing <Col N="747" /> this legislation is inconsistency in the implementation of it throughout the 27 county councils.  Under the Fire Services Act, there is now evidence that there are 27 different interpretations on the safeguards, improvements or provisions within the different counties.  In this situation, we are going to get, if not 27 different interpretations, quite a number. The people who do not have the opportunity to offset these charges will find themselves being double charged.</P>
    <P>I do not want what I am now going to say to be considered in any way as being anti-farmer.  However, agricultural land is derated and many land-owners utilise or avail of water services, and, in fact, the amount of water used on many farms will correspond to and, perhaps well exceed, the quantity of water used by many of the business people concerned. There will be no double charge because the rates are gone from agricultural land. There will be simple, straightforward charges on the water consumed.  The point I am making is that the small businessmen in this situation will be paying a double charge.  There is a simple answer; that is for the Minster to include a provision that the element that the small businessman, publican, shopkeeper, whatever he may be, pays within his rates for the provision of these services will be offset against the new charges.  That will remove the risk of injustice.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient, in bringing in this law, to say that it is a matter for the local authorities or for the county councils.  I repeat that we may get 27 different interpretations on the implementation of this. We will have inconsistency.  It would make for better law if we have a consistent national service.  There are few ratepayers involved.  We should not persist with this legislation if we are satisfied that it is not good law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Howard on the point made about the double charges.  I raised this also on Second Stage and referred in particular to small family businesses, the small premises part of which is residential and part of which <Col N="748" /> is the business premises.  The residential portion of such premises is derated but the business portion still carries rates. The owners of such premises will be paying twice if they have to pay charges for services for which they are already paying through their rates.</P>
      <P>Senator Howard suggested a solution that the element in the rates that goes to pay for these services should be offset against the new charges.  I suggest that it should be the other way about &mdash; that the charges in question should be offset against the rates liability of these people.</P>
      <P>This is the section that empowers the local authorities to charge for the provision of services.  In actual fact, it will be the county manager who will decide on the level of charges for services.  In many cases, the first that local authority members will know about the level of the charges is when they see a copy of the county manager's order setting out the level of charges for the various services. That is my understanding of the situation. It would be much more satisfactory if the level of charges were determined by the elected members rather than by the county manager.  This should be a reserve function rather than a restrictive function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, also, regret that the Minister seems here to be giving the power to the county manager.  Again, as Senator Mullooly has said, it is when it is all decided that the elected person will know about it.  Perhaps it is important for the Minister to realise that he has not up to now got stick about this because these new charges have not hit home down the country.  If he survives 12 months, he will then know more about it than he does today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case I gave the impression last week here, as an elected local authority member, that I was dead set against all county managers and that they were all the bad guys, I want to correct that.  I do not feel that way at all about county managers. We happen to have the best county manager in Ireland.  There was talk a while ago about votes, but I can say that freely now because I do not need any favours from him &mdash; he will retire in October and <Col N="749" /> will not be able to do anything for me.  I can pay him all the tributes I like today. The Minister might consider him for that new board he is setting up.  However, I have a holy horror of these bureaucrats. You can never get too bigheaded if you have to stay with the people and get elected.  These county managers are grand guys now but if they are given more power, and that power is taken away from those of us who have to stay with the people all the time to survive, they may not be so affable as senior officials.</P>
    <P>On this section, when the rates were abolished in 1977 and 1978, the average household rate was in the order of £200 to £250.  That is what the Minister said. He must have been talking about one of the big mansions in Donnybrook or the like.  That is not getting away from the fact that we do not know what the end result of these charges will be.</P>
    <P>As regards what Senator O'Toole said, it is sad that the Minister did not see fit to accept any of our party's amendment in the Dáil because I thought the Minister was bigger than that.  There are some Bills that we would not be able to talk about but local government is familiar to all of us who have served for so long in local authorities.  The Cathaoirleach is probably one of the longest serving members in local government.  The Minister seems to be hell-bent on taking power from the elected people of this nation in all the legislation he is bringing in.  It is we who will have to answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJOTooke" hpid="Mr. M. O'Toole Mr. M. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Our amendment was that the making of a charge under the provisions of this section should be a reserved function of the elected members of the local authority concerned.  The intention now is to allow managers to determine the level and the area of charge.  This is a negation of democracy at a time when the whole emphasis of informed opinion at home and abroad is that local communities and authorities should have greater participation in the democratic process.  The Minister's proposals could cause problems in the following circumstances.  Suppose a manager, in preparing the estimate of expenses, included on the income side <Col N="750" /> provision for receipts from charges and the elected members, in considering the estimate, decided to delete that provision, could the manager decide subsequently to levy charges under the powers of the new Bill in contravention of the wishes of local authority members?  This is not clear.  When this amendment was going through the Dáil many Deputies, including Deputies Bruton, Owen, Kenny and Farrelly supported the amendment.  Nevertheless it was not accepted by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring.  That was regrettable.</P>
      <P>I have served on a local authority for many years.  I have seen various changes in legislation regarding the financing of local authorities.  I do not say this is the reintroduction of rates.  Everybody calls it something different.  It is the transfer of the charges, responsibilities and the financing of these services.  We are not against charging for services.  I wonder just how unconstitutional it is in a county like Mayo with a rate of £27 in the £.  The people get their demand notes with the services they can avail of under the said rate printed on them.  Now an additional charge under this rate will be imposed. There is a doubt if some people who are paying rates will be liable for these additional charges.</P>
      <P>The collection of these charges will now be the responsibility of the local authority and charges may not be the same in Mayo as in Galway.  If a person lives in a border area, his next door neighbour may have a cheaper refuse collection and a cheaper water rent.  There is no national charge because it will be a managerial function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could argue all day about whether a manager is part of a local authority.  If we take away responsibility from the local authorities for the implementation of this Bill and the provision of the finances then we are saying it is a managerial authority.  The manager brings in his estimate and we decide the rate in the pound that we will get in the year.  At a time when we should be expanding our services we will pass the burden of the financing of them to local authorities and <Col N="751" /> give full responsibility to the manger for their implementation.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to managers and they do not want this job.  I do not think it will work.  As Senator Honan said, there is only one way to hurt people and that is to hurt them through their pockets.  It has not reached that stage yet but it is only when people have to pay for a particular service that they will realise that they got the same service last year and did not have to pay for it.  Local authorities will be less well off next year than they are this year as a result of this section.</P>
    <P>The most detrimental part of this Bill is giving responsibility to the managers. There will be difficulty in collecting the charges under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very good relationship between elected persons and county managers in most counstitutencies at present.  At estimates time as all county councillors are aware there are long discussions.  As Senator O'Toole asked, can county managers decide on charges other than those previously agreed to at the commencement of the year?  Can they take on to themselves to add extra charges as it goes on?  Is it not a possibility that not alone will we have the charges at the beginning of a year but extra charges at some other time during the year?  Perhaps I am putting too much emphasis on the power that the Minister has seen fit to give to the county managers but I am worried because while there is a good relationship between the elected councillors and managers I fear if they have this power the results may not be too good.</P>

      <P>While we are on section 2, it is inevitable that we must bring into account certain other factors which really belong to other sections so in the spirit in which this section has been debated I will respond.  First of all, let me deal specifically with Senator Howard's comment in relation to the element of double charging. It may be hard for some members of Fianna Fáil to recognise the spirit of the Bill because it is such a long time since they saw a Bill devolving real powers <Col N="752" /> back to a local authority that perhaps it is a strange bird.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It was introduced, Senator Honan.  It was not the Labour Party or Fine Gael that introduced the managerial Act or sacked Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation or centralised housing grants.  Local authorities are not accustomed to having powers devolved upon them.  Our recent experience as local councillors is that any powers we had are, in some way or another, taken away whether they were administrative or not.  The most recent example relates to the administration of housing grants and home improvement grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Mullooly and Howard referred to the fact that a local authority in its reserved function, determines the estimates and the amount of money needed in the estimates to provide the services that it intends to provide for the forthcoming year.  You have power in so far as you are members of a local authority. Members can decide, on the basis of the grant that they will get from State in agricultural relief if it is a combined rural and urban authority or the domestic rate support grant, combined with the anticipated revenue from house receipts and so on how much money they want to put on the commercial and industrial rates etc. and they can leave it at that.  They can say that is the amount of money we will have and we will have no additional charges.  That is their power.  That is a reserved function.  That is the law as it is and it is not proposed to change it in any way.  Members call the opening shots and define the field within which the manager subsequently has to act.  If they so choose, they can say that for a variety of reasons that are peculiar to their local authority, they do not propose to require the manager to raise any local charges whatsoever.  Obviously, that will have an effect on the available services to local citizens.  That is a political choice and is a choice which in legal terms they have the power to make.  If they decide, in order to maintain services or expand them, in addition to the moneys that they <Col N="753" /> anticipate or forecast in their estimates that they need additional current account receipts in order to fund services in their local authority for the forthcoming year, then they can fix the amount of money needed.</P>
    <P>First of all, they can decide that they will raise no money at all.  Secondly, they can decide to raise some money but the maximum amount will be so much.  These are the powers which they currently have. The manager, as is the practice in relation to water rates, having been requested to raise a certain gross amount of money under the legislation, as determined by the elected members at their estimates meeting, has the power and the responsibility to design the scheme, how much should be charged per household to raise the gross sum required and what form and what kind of waiver would be appropriate for the circumstances in the area.</P>
    <P>In that context let me return specifically to the query that Senators Howard and Mullooly raised in relation to the problem of double charging and the fiscal and financial difficulties of small businesses. I accept that they exist.  There is no reason why working under the kind of co-operation that Senator Honan referred to&mdash;Clare is a very good example of that kind of co-operation between managers and members&mdash;informal discussions could not take place between the manager and the elected members to decide, for example, that there will be no charges applied to the commercial industrial sector already paying rates.  They can be excluded.  That power will not come from Dublin.  It can be decided in Ennis, Castlebar, Westmeath or wherever. We will not tell them how to do it or what way they should do it because this is part of the process of returning to local authorities a degree of autonomy, respect and dignity which regrettably successive administrations have taken away from them.</P>

They have the power to suggest to the manager that certain categories of enterprise, small family firms or whatever who are not making a profit and who, therefore, cannot avail of the tax reliefs that I referred to in the Second Stage speech, should be excluded.  If the manager does not appear to be forthcoming in the informal discussions and does not give precise details but is rather vague about how she or he proposes to raise this money, then by resolution under the existing legislation governing the powers of local authority members, a motion can be put down on the order paper requiring the manager to bring forward the detailed scheme of the charges that he proposes to raise and the waiver attachments to it before any such charges are implemented.  These are councillors' powers at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why the Minister for the Environment in the Dáil, did not accept the amendments to which Senator O'Toole referred earlier is that we believe the range of powers that I have is more than adequate to meet the legitimate concerns and fears that have been expressed by some Members here and in the Dáil.  If, however, at the end of two years&mdash;I repeat the commitment made by the Tánaiste in the Dáil and which I made here on Second Stage&mdash;it emerges that the kind of relationship which Senator Honan described in respect of her county does not exist, that managers appear to be travelling down a road totally at variance with the wishes of the elected members, by order of the Minister for the Environment we can under the 1955 Local Government Act and the Schedule to those sections which are deemed to be a reserved function and therefore the exclusive pleasure of elected members, assign the function of fixing these charges as well.  I have described a series of levers of power that are vested exclusively in the elected members in relation to the operations of these charges.  As a consequence, we do not believe that it was necessary at this <Col N="755" /> stage to accept the amendment proposed in the Dáil because the necessary powers are there.  I am not making a political point but we are reversing the whole thrust of the relationship between the Custom House and local authorities throughout the country.  It may be difficult for some Members to recognise that there is a fundamental shift in policy. Over the next four years, Members will get an opportunity to see in a variety of ways just what form and substance that will take.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that local authorities will have the choice between deciding to fix an amount to be raised by charges or deciding not to impose any local charges at all.  In practice that choice will not exist.  It would exist only if the Minister would give a guarantee that he would compensate local authorities in full for the amount of domestic rates relief given and the amount of agricultural rates relief given. That has not happened this year.  Local authorities have not been compensated in full.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in my Second Stage speech that in County Roscommon the block grant which we received from the Exchequer in lieu of the agricultural and domestic rates relief grants in the current year represented an increase of only 6.6 per cent on the amount which we received last year.  It was not 100 per cent of the amount of rates relief given in the county.  I submit that local authorities will have no choice but to supplement the grant which they will receive from central funds by including in the estimate an amount to be raised by local charges.</P>

      <P>Perhaps this is an unfair question but I must ask it.  In a block of flats in any given part of a local authority area where there is a communal water pipe to service the whole area and a number of refuse bins left outside, how do we define who is to be charged?  The owner may be in Taiwan or wherever and he is not responsible for collecting the charge. Is it the manager who will decide?  Are we to put a number on the bin as they are doing with the milk cans in the west at present or how will the refuse from my house be identified from that of my neighbour?</P>

      <P>This section states that different rates of charges may apply in respect of different classes of persons, premises or services.  It would be very hard to apply different rates of charges equitably.  If it were to be done equitably, then every house would have to have a water meter and every refuse collection vehicle would have to have weighing facilities.  In addition to that, what is the position regarding consumers who do not wish to avail of particular services or whom the services which are provided by the local authority do not suit?  I am thinking of a situation where a weekly refuse collection service is provided in small rural towns or villages.  A weekly service may not suit or meet the requirements of a particular premises.  The owner of such a premises would have to make his own arrangements to have a daily service provided by a private contractor. It would not be equitable if that person, though he is not availing of the service being provided by the local authority because the service does not suit him, has to pay for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not get too hung up on this.  Local authorities have been imposing charges for a long time, especially county councils who had no restriction on them from making a charge for this service.  There is already a difference between services provided by local authorities in towns and villages which do not have an urban authority running them, in other words, businesses were charged differently, they were separated <Col N="757" /> into publicans, hairdressers, doctors, dentists and so on.  They had a specific charge which was different from the householders' charge.  This was for water. It has never been a problem to differentiate between what section in a town should be charged a separate charge from another section.  If the option was available, a person receiving the service could have a meter which is a fairer system. Meters are expensive.  It costs at least £50 per household to fit a meter.  Naturally, one would not fit a meter to an old age pensioner's cottage or a cottage with one person living in it where the income from the water charge would not justify the installation of the meter.  We have a flat-rate of charge or a meter.</P>
      <P>The charges will be specific and they should be separate.  There are people in rural areas who do not have a refuse collection and they should not be included in a blanket charge for a sanitary service on the basis that they do not benefit from a refuse collection.  In all towns and villages where they have a refuse collection we can make the people there responsible for a refuse collection charge. We do not have to identify bins or put numbers on bins.  We can have a minimal charge for it the same as for water.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been implementing a scale of charges for many years.  All this Bill does is give power to urban authorities and corporations which have been precluded from charging for these services since the rates were done away with, to charge for them.  It is social justice to extend charges to people who can afford to pay for services that other people in rural areas have always been paying for.</P>

      <P>We are not, as Senator Ferris said, getting hung up on something but this is the place to say what we have to say.  Talking about the services that the urban areas have and which the county areas did not have, this is where I see trouble.  In a big housing estate of 200 or 300 houses how are we going to implement charging people for refuse collection in that type of housing estate if 15 or 20 of those people refuse to pay?  Senator <Col N="758" /> Ferns has a lot of experience of dealing with some of those people just as I have. How are you going to make 20 householders in the type of housing estate that I am referring to pay for a refuse collection? We can bring in the legislation here today but we cannot knock them down and make them pay for a service if 20 out of a block of 100 or 200 refuse to do so. I am a great believer in saying anything I have to say where it has to be said.  This is the place to say it and not down the corridors.</P>

I accept what she says, that nobody will pay any bill if he can get away with it.  If the local authority have the responsibility to make a charge they most certainly have the responsibility to collect it.  That is why I was so worried about Senator O'Toole, whom I respect and who has been a member of his own local authority.  He knows that they have been making charges.  I was trying to follow his argument and to know how they would apply them in certain sections when we know that he and I have been applying them already in the same section.  But the local authority from an urban point of view have not been applying them.  That is the point I wanted to make.  Certainly, non-collection is another problem but it is one for the manager.  He would have the statutory power to collect.</P>

We have a county-at-large charge and there is an estimate and a provision made for the collection services throughout the whole county.  What this Bill is going to do is bring it down to the bin and to the person at the moment.  I thought I would take this under a different section.  Senator Ferris is trying to help the Minister.  You do not have to help that man: he is well able to handle the situation himself.  It only applies in <Col N="759" /> my county on a county-at-large basis. This Bill will change that.</P>

I am putting the problem in front of the Minister so that the Minister will be aware of what is happening down in Mayo.  Indeed he probably knows it as a result of his visit there recently.  We appreciate very much that he came down to meet us and see us on the ground and in the flesh and how we operate.  We had a very useful discussion on many aspects of our responsibility.

I am a member of a local authority and I am just putting my view on this legislation on the record of the House as to how we have implemented various schemes and various charges in a county council area.  If that is not how it is implemented in other counties then we will benefit from an exchange of view across the floor with the permission of the Chair and the ear of the Minister.  If the Minister feels any county is doing anything wrong, he has the right to intervene. I certainly am not defending him because there might be other aspects of this where I would like much more power for local authority members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened intently to his contribution in which he pointed out that he will still hold certain other functions and if the local authority members cannot get their proper rights in the initiation of these charges, the formulation of schemes and the relief from them, then certainly the local authority members would have lost the proper input they were elected to <Col N="760" /> give.

      <P>I intervene briefly to comment on what Senator O'Toole said that in Mayo the cost of the refuse collection is a countywide charge.  That is true I am sure of quite a number of counties. How can we justify the continuation of that situation where you put on a charge on a countywide basis?  We are back to what I said earlier, where the last remaining group of ratepayers are paying for the service or can now be in a position to avail of it and which is being availed of by another category of people.  I was making the point that in the refuse collection in Clare about one-third of the total number of houses are involved in it. It is only fair that those who are availing of the service, to whom the service is of value, should make a contribution towards it.  Is the fact that this was supposed to be available free not the very reason why we are continuously getting demands to provide a refuse collection service in an area where it is very hard to justify?  It is hard to continue justifying a situation where some people are paying for a service that is free to others.  I believe that what we can justify is providing a service and putting a charge on the people who can avail of that service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I could confine my remarks to section 3 and answer specifically the question raised by Senator Mullooly initially. In deciding on whom legally a charge would be levied, it is prudent for the Minister from a management point of view in Senator Mullooly's own experience, that the person whom you are legally going to list as the recipient of the charge should be someone who is permanent for the purposes of law and <Col N="761" /> debt collection.  Otherwise, you will find yourself in a situation that in the event of a default you really have no effective recoverable claim.  It is for that reason we would envisage, as is common practice in other aspects of local authority government, that in a block of flats where there is a clear legal tenant, a long-term tenant. someone who is there and capable of having a civil bill served upon him in the event of a default or non-payment, then that person would be the person who would be the main recipient of the charge.  In a house that is converted into a number of flats, furnished lettings, weekly tenancies and so on, where there may be two or three tenants in the one fiscal year, then we would see the landlord or the registered owner of that premises being the person who would be liable for the charge.  This is subject to what the local authority themselves want to do.</P>
      <P>If for argument sake, you have six dwellings in that building owned by one individual and the water or general purpose charge is £25, then the landlord, the registered owner, would be charged £150 and he or she in turn would then make his or her own arrangement with the tenant. In a manner similar to the old collection of rates when such tenants were not eligible for rates, it would vary.  The purpose behind it is an administrative one; you set it against the person who is the best conceivable target, if I could use that particular phrase, so that in the event of default you have someone to go after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was raised: if the service is there but you are not really availing of it, do you have to pay for it?  That is a bit like somebody saying to the TV licence collector, &ldquo;Well, I live in Dublin: I never watch RTE 1 or RTE 2 and I do not want to pay the licence&rdquo;.  It sounds fairly sustainable. In fact, if there is water being delivered to your house by a piped system and you are not using any of it or are using very little &mdash; for example my requirement to wash my hair would be far less than perhaps Senator Honan's &mdash; that is the kind of factor that no doubt people will argue but it is not sustainable. It the service is there, whether you are availing of it or not you are going to be liable in law.  That is the way we envisage <Col N="762" /> it in relation to a refuse collection or in relation to anything else that may be decided by the local authority in conjunction with the manager as being required.</P>
    <P>On the question of equalisation, the whole purpose of this Bill and the whole thrust of its administration will be to allow local authorities to re-establish norms that are appropriate to their own county.  Senator O'Toole gave an instance unwittingly of that when he referred to the county rate in Mayo of £27 which is much in excess of what the county rate in County Clare is, which is £18 or £19.  But that is appropriate to the needs of County Mayo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The power is there in the first instance because it is a fall-back position that any superior House or body such as the Oireachtas must have in respect to any subsidiary body such as the particular local authority.  The devolution of power and local autonomy is not the same as the granting of full independence. Therefore, that fall-back position is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> I take the spirit of what Senator Mullooly is saying.  In regard to other legislation, particularly housing legislation where provision is made in the enactment of that legislation for the delivery at local level of a particular service as an integral part of the housing policy, it would on first hearing sound somewhat iniquitous to be charging for it in the manner mentioned. All I can say at this stage is I support the spirit of what the Senator said in principle and I will certainly look at the comments the Senator is making. It would apply to other services that have been traditionally free and for which there is a very good argument against inclusion, balancing the impact they may have against the possible revenue they would raise, for example, charging for library services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we take it from what the Minister said in regard to retaining this function to himself that if members of a local authority were unhappy about a specific area of charging that the manager intended to include, they would have the right to send a request to the Minister to look at that particular trend in case it was, as Senator Mullooly said, a charge for a disabled person's grant &mdash; people we are trying to facilitate really &mdash; and it would be an area of real social need where you would not like to be making a charge or just the processing of an application for a higher education grant which has very little administrative work at county council level.  This is very straightforward and it is completed by the applicant anyway.  Suppose the manager, in trying to make up a deficit, suddenly started to pull out of the sky this kind of service which would certainly concern me and other Senators in the House, would we have the right by resolution to demand that the manager would not implement those without the final approval of the Minister on the basis of this section which gives him the power to exclude some services from charges?</P>

      <P>In connection with section 5, it appears that there is no directive given to the county manager as regards the time limit and there are no guidelines laid down in connection with what type of scheme a particular manager will bring in in connection with the waiver of certain charges under this Bill.  Perhaps down at home I would not be able to say this: we have a very humanitarian manager and I have no doubt that he would implement that scheme quite adequately but I am talking about the Minister bringing <Col N="765" /> in legislation for a period of time and managers come and go.  I would like some guidelines as to what type of person the Minister had in mind to waive or give some relief to.  If there is going to be a waiver scheme the members of the local authority should first have the option to examine it and it should be brought before them so that they could examine and amend a waiver scheme before its implementation because in the absence of a time limit and guidelines it would appear to me that the Minister is saying to the manager, &ldquo;On you go; implement the Bill and your own waiver scheme&rdquo;. Having done that, it will be a different waiver scheme possibly in different counties. I know that quite possibly the managerial associations have their own meetings and they will discuss this at their meetings and it will perhaps be made as uniform as possible.</P>
      <P>Every county varies.  What may be acceptable in Cork may not be acceptable in the west and <i>vice versa.</i>  A waiver scheme should be brought before the members of the local authorities for examination, amendment and adoption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator O'Toole said.  Any blanket waiver scheme introduced would have to be very flexible.  The Minister, in his Second Stage speech, said he would be issuing guidelines to local authorities to assist them in deciding on the waiver scheme they would bring into operation.  I would like the Minister to suggest, or even more than suggest, to local authorities that there should be some kind of an appeal process set up because if the county manager decides that charges should not be waived in the case of a particular person and if that individual comes to me or some other member of a local authority and asks that representations be made on his behalf and an appeal made against the manager's decision, we are going back to the person who made the decision in the first instance.  In the vast majority of cases, unless we are able to bring to the manager's notice information which was not available to him at the time he made his decision, then the likelihood is that the original decision will stand.  I would <Col N="766" /> like to see in that kind of situation some appeal machinery which we could use and which would arbitrate on the particular case which might only arise in a small number of instances.  An individual concerned would feel his case had got a fairer hearing if there was some kind of appeal machinery in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to introduce and give formal recognition and power to the principle that people pay according to their means and that those people who as a consequence of their means are not in a position to pay are not levied.  That is the principle upon which the provision of the section stands. In pursuit of that principle it is logical that we identify people who, for categorisation purposes, are clearly, because of their receipt of a particular social welfare allowance, manifestly people of low or poor income.  These allowances are self-suggestive, non-contributory pensions, deserted wife's allowances, prisoners' wives allowances and so forth.</P>
      <P>Senator Mullooly is correct in saying that I said in my Second Stage speech that we would be issuing guidelines.  I want to emphasise that they will be merely guidelines and it will be up to the local authority to interpret them as they themselves see fit.  The problem of the borderline case will arise in relation to any waiver scheme.  Once a category is set even at local level, having regard to a guideline, a person either meets or does not meet it &mdash; if he is in receipt of a pension, or is not, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to the principle of relating ability to pay with the waiver scheme, there has to be built into it a degree of discretion or degree of appeal that would enable the manager and the local representative to make a case on behalf of a particular individual.  I am disposed to that if it is operated at local level for the reason that at local level people know what the situation is on the ground in the vast majority of local authority rural areas.  It manifestly would not function in the Dublin area or within the larger urban areas.  The guidelines we will be issuing in due course will simply be such but they will be addressing themselves to the principle <Col N="767" /> that ability to pay is an integral part of this.  Senator O'Toole and others who have far more experience of local authorities than I have, will recall that the old rating system, when it operated prior to 1977, did have provision for a waiver scheme.  There is experience there of its operating and also in the operation of the appeals procedure related to it.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if a person fails to avail of a service and he is unable to pay and the service is cut off, if he decides the following day or two days or a week afterwards that he wants the service, will the cost of restoring service far exceed that of giving him the service in the first instance?  However, I admit you must have some administrative principle.  Weeks or months after the implementation of the Litter Act I see a big problem arising in most of the western counties.  We live close to Sealink beaches and if we charge people for refuse collection, the first thing they will do is dump it on the beach, the bog or on the side of the road or anywhere.  Who will be in a position to identify them at their work of dumping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is a county-at-large charge at the moment people are getting this service and they think it is free but they are paying it on a rate basis.  Indeed some people who are not paying rates do not pay at all.  That has been the way in local authorities down through the years under the system we had where there was a county-at-large charge for all services. People in rural areas did not get group water schemes that people in towns enjoyed.  I can see problems arising in a tourist area.  We will have problems in trying to stop people from dumping freely on beaches, roads and scenic areas.  That is my fear here.  I hope it will not happen. I hope the communities in the areas concerned will see that it will not happen <Col N="768" /> because it is unsightly, to say the least. The collection of refuse is a great service and we should try to maintain and improve and increase it.  We provided three dumps in County Mayo.  If people can get this collection service done by a private agency, will the local authorities stop them from dumping in the dumps we have appointed?  I am sure the Minister is aware of the danger which exists in a tourist area.  If people are already being charged for refuse collection in other counties it will not arise but we will have to be watchful in the case of counties which have a county-at-large rate.</P>

      <P>To answer Senator O'Toole's question first, the people of County Mayo must recognise the extraordinary assets they have there, <i>vis-á-vis</i> tourism.  Therefore any action about indiscriminate dumping is ultimately going to offend and hurt themselves. That is a general argument that frequently individuals exempt themselves from.  It is for that reason that the Litter Act was passed by this House last year.  There are much stronger provisions for prosecution than were there before. There are difficulties about enforcement because Mayo is a big county.</P>
      <P>The combination of public education and political leadership at local level is essential.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that, for a variety of reasons, health reasons, environmental reasons, tourist reasons, a refuse service is essential and should be provided.  To answer Senator Honan's question, if the service is made available to a district, then it will be mandatory on the recipients of that service to comply with whatever charges are deemed to be required by the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I have reservations about this section.  If the person in question accepts that he owes money to the local authority, or that the sum in question is due to the local authority, then that is fine.  But, if there is a dispute as to whether the sum in question is due to the local authority, then it would be very unfair that any money should be deducted until that dispute is settled in some way.  If a local authority employee was being charged a certain sum, and he disputed the sum being charged, under this section it would appear that the local authority would be entitled to deduct from that employee's wages the amount of the sum in question, even though he disputed the fact he owed the total amount or part of it.  I would like the Minister to reassure us on this section.</P>

      <P>This would be totally wrong.  It seems at the moment that persons working for a local authority could have some money taken from them if they were in dispute over a payment.  A Chathaoirligh, will you allow me to refer to something which is not relevant to this Bill?  This morning I had the wireless on in my room.  I would ask whichever Minister is reponsible to tell Mr. Mike Murphy and Mr. Pat Kenny from RTE, who are both very good comics, that we would be most grateful as elected persons from all constituencies at local authority level if they stopped making a joke of employees of local authorities.  They are very good workers in all our local authorities and they have themselves and their families to think of.  We hear: &ldquo;Oh, they are not working now because the sun is shining&rdquo; and it is some other crack when the snow is on the ground.  Mr. Murphy and Mr. Kenny are living and working in comfort at the taxpayers' expense in RTE and it is easy for them to have a go at the ordinary county council workers.  I am still with the workers of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>There is an old saying &mdash; and I am sure Senator O'Leary would be able to give us the legal side of it &mdash; that stoppage is no payment.  You have <Col N="770" /> no legal right to stop a man's cheque if he owes you payment.  In the past people did this.  They were brought before the courts and the people from whom the money was stopped succeeded in winning their cases.  A number of people work for local authorities such as labourers, cleaners, clerk typists, clerical officers, and various other people.  They are in a position to avail of these services and, if they did not pay for them, the charges could be deducted from their wages.  A doctor or a nurse working for the Western Health Board would be in a different position, or perhaps an instructor working with ACOT or an OPW ganger or overseer who is resident in the county. They charge us a statutory amount, whereas the county council worker is easy to catch.  This might be a clanger for the Minister to answer.  How would he catch the OPW man, or the ACOT worker, or the man working with the Western Health Board if he refused to pay?  How does this section deal with two different sets of people?  I hope I have explained myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the first part which relates to external money, so to speak, not salaries.  Let us exclude for a moment the question of employees of local authorities.  On the question of where moneys would, in the normal course of events, be coming to an individual by way of a grant of whatever kind, where for simple accountancy purposes you can offset one against the other, this is a standard provision.  It goes back to the older days when people were paying local authorities moneys of one kind or another.  It relates, for example, to the present practice on commercial rates.  It is to facilitate ease of transaction between the local authority and an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of people who are employees of local authorities, it is certainly not the intention of this legislation that deductions should be made in that way.  We have no specific power.  The nearest we can get to it is in a seminal piece of legislation known as the Truck Act, 1831.  There are words in a song about &ldquo;owing my soul to the company store&rdquo;.  People were effectively made <Col N="771" /> company slaves.  They were paid in a currency which could only be cashed in the company store.  The thinking behind it is that they would not be locked into that situation.</P>
    <P>On a personal note I would add that, as a former employee of a local authority and as a former member of the LGPSU, I have a fair idea of the reaction of Harold O'Sullivan and the President of the LGPSU to such a proposal.  Any attempt to do so would have a fairly dramatic effect on the working relations within a local authority.  Senators are right to draw attention to it.  In the guidelines which will emanate from the Custom House we certainly make our views very clearly known in relation to it.  On the general question of external moneys, it is a standard provision and I think it will be useful and will facilitate transactions.</P>
    <P>On the point Senator O'Toole made, I would prefer to comment by saying that we are limiting the statutory demands in relation to OPW to 5 per cent this year, as distinct from the average of a 38 per cent increase, which they were looking for.  We are moving on the other ones. not necessarily in the direction suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I raised the question of the block grant or the cash grant which will be paid to local authorities in the future.  Heretofore local authorities were paid an amount which coincided with the amount of domestic rates relief which they provided and also a sum equal to the amount of agricultural rates relief. Those two rates relief grants compensated the local authorities in full for the rates relief they gave.  That will not be the situation in future and, as I mentioned earlier, the block grant or the cash grant which Roscommon County Council received this year represented an increase of only 6.6 per cent on the figure which we received in 1982.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister how the amount of this year's grant was decided.  What factors were taken into consideration in arriving at the amounts of the grant which we were given this year, and what factors will be taken into account when those grants are being decided in the future?  All local authorities will not have the same scope for raising revenue through local charges. Local authorities in counties which have a number of large urban areas will have considerably more scope than local authorities in the rural counties.  My own county is a mainly rural county and, therefore, I submit that the scope which we will have for raising revenue through local charges will be limited as compared with other counties.  I would be very happy if I got some kind of an assurance from the Minister that he will take that factor into account in deciding the level of the cash grant which our county will receive in the future.  It appears to me that it will be very difficult to bridge the gap between the cash grant which we will get and the total amount of rates income which the local authority should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand and recognise the spirit of Senator Mullooly's contribution.  He reflects the crisis local authorities have experienced in relation <Col N="773" /> to bridging the gap between what they need and what they are likely to get.  This is experienced very acutely at central Government level.  In the Second Stage debate Senator O'Donoghue recalled the circumstances in which the remaining sections of the domestic rates grant were removed at that time, and that the 1978 Act was seen as a temporary one with certain powers being given to the Exchequer to put a ceiling on what would be given to local authorities, and that obviously some long-term solution to financial restructuring would be required.</P>
      <P>Against that background, and against the background of fiscal difficulties all local authorities have experienced, it became necessary in this legislation to rectify some of the anomalies which have grown up over the past couple of years in relation to recoupment.  What we are trying to do is to remove any doubts. Some local authorities were trying to suggest that there was a legal claim, or that there were difficulties in relation to the amounts of money that were due.  Once we moved away from the rateable valuation&mdash;and Senator Mullooly referred to the problems of Roscommon&mdash;the legal tax base was limited.  Not only is it now limited, but it is somewhat at risk because of the High Court action which queries the whole constitutionality of a portion of it.  All of these are simply further factors which point to the necessity, to which Senator O'Donoghue and indeed many other speakers referred, to get local authority finances onto a new, secure legal basis.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for the Environment said in the other House this must be seen as legislation of a somewhat temporary nature in relation to the overall problem of local authority financing.  It will be reviewed in two years in relation to its operation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the elected members, but it must be seen as part of a programme designed to deal with the whole question of local authority finances.  It is in that context that section 9 is being moved.</P>

      <P>Suggestions have been made that the Fianna Fáil estimates <Col N="774" /> of 1983 had a short tall of around £33 million.  They were only estimates, but I should like to remind the House that, when the Coalition Government presented their budget, there was a short fall in the allocation to local authorities in the region of £12 million and that is what Senator Mullooly is talking about in relation to the Roscommon area.</P>
      <P>There is no percentage indication in the Bill as to what amount of money the local authorities will get from central Government next year in a block grant. For that reason, one would hope the charges to be implemented by local authorities will offset this deficit of £12 million, which will be much greater next year because there will be a considerable drop in this commitment by the Exchequer to local authorities.  This Bill will not have the desired effect of making up the short fall.  The anticipated savings will be made because the Minister and the Minister for Finance will decide to give a lesser grant next year and the following year to local authorities.  Whichever Government are in office at that time will be in a position to review the situation.</P>
      <P>We are opposing this section.  Last year the Coalition Government failed to honour their commitment by £12 million, and this year they will fail to honour it, but to what extent I do not know.  It is stated in the Bill that a grant will be made available, but the Bill does not indicate what percentage of the grant.  Responsibility for charging for services is being changed from central authority to the local authorities. We are opposing the Bill on the issue of the failure of the Government to make adequate funds available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9(2) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall as regards each local financial year, as soon as may be, furnish to each rating authority an estimate of the grant which he proposes to make to the authority under subsection (1) of this section...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of the word &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; in that subsection would appear to me to indicate that if the local authority in question are able to make a sufficiently strong case to the Minister, that estimate is open <Col N="775" /> to revision.  As soon as the Minister furnishes this estimate to the local authority each year, there will be a procession of deputations from local authorities making a case to the Minister to revise upwards, of course, the amount he proposes to give them.  The only satisfactory way in which funds can be paid from central Government to the local authorities is on the basis of the system which we have had up to the current year, that is, that local authorities are paid a domestic rates relief grant which will compensate them in full for the amount of domestic rates relief given, and also an agricultural grant which will compensate them in full for the cost of agricultural rates relief.</P>
    <P>If that were done, the Minister could truly say that he was allowing local authorities to supplement their revenue by imposing local charges.  As was the case this year, all the local charges will be doing if 100 per cent grants are not given, is bridging the gap between the amount received from central Government and the amount to which the local authorities should be entitled.  Therefore, the financial position of local authorities will not be improved one iota by this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite wrong to suggest that in some way or other the 1978 legislation was open-ended, and that the Minister was automatically locked into a particular commitment.  In fairness &mdash; and I am not being political about this &mdash; there is a certain degree of artificiality about this because, on the one hand, central Government are giving the money to the local authorities and, on the other hand, what we are arguing about is the basis upon which this money is to be calculated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mullooly already referred to the disadvantaged position of Roscommon having regard to its tax base, which is its rateable valuation base.  For that reason section 9 specifically does not lay down the exact manner &mdash; or does not link it entirely to the rateable valuation of this stage &mdash; in which moneys will be <Col N="776" /> paid in the future.  It may be necessary to apply other criteria to compensate for the poor tax base local authorities have, having regard to the possible implications of any Supreme Court action in the near future.</P>
    <P>On the question of the word &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; in subsection (2), the intention is very clear.  The word &ldquo;estimate&rdquo; is already used by local authorities in relation to their own fairly precise estimate of moneys required in the course of their own financial or accountancy year.  Our intention is to signal as soon as possible to local authorities what money it is intended to give to them by way of a current account grant-in-aid which, in effect, is what it will be.  The reason for that is to enable them subsequently to make their own local estimates having regard to the size of the block grant and to decide in their own time and with proper regard to other factors how they want to allocate that money.</P>
    <P>If we give them the estimate as soon as possible, by definition it cannot be 100 per cent accurate because of the constraints that operate on all of us.  It is subject to revenue account holding up on tax receipts, and so on, and it is subject to a number of other factors as well of which all Members will be aware.  It is totally unsatisfactory to be told at the end of the year exactly how much you are going to get, because it effectively paralyses you during the course of the year. You do not know how much to spend if you do not know how much you are going to get.</P>
    <P>The other alternative is the one all of us as members or former members of local authorities would like.  That is, to be given as accurate an estimate as possible early on in the fiscal year of what you are going to get by way of a global block, current account grant-in-aid, and that will subsequently enable local authorities to make up their own detailed estimates.  That is the thinking behind the provision.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The purpose of the Bill is to provide the criminal courts with a further sanction which they may apply in appropriate cases.  Essentially, the Bill provides that where a person is convicted of an offence for which the court considers that in the ordinary way the appropriate sentence would be one of imprisonment, the court may, with the offender's consent, instead order him to perform a specified number of hours of unpaid work.  The work would be of a kind which would benefit the community but which people could not readily be got to do in the ordinary way for pay.  The arrangement of the work would be a matter for the Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice and that service would be expected to find tasks for offenders which would be of a worthwhile nature.  The work would also be carried out under the general supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service and under the direct supervision of voluntary or paid on-site supervisors.</P>
      <P>Before going on to deal with the advantages which will follow from the passing of the Bill, I feel that the Bill ought to be put in perspective.  While a very important and progressive piece of legislation, it is only one of a number of measures being taken and planned to cope with the problem of rising crime which concerns us all.  For example, as already indicated, another Criminal Justice Bill is in the course of preparation which will include measures to deal with strengthening the power of the gardaí in dealing with persons suspected of having committed serious offences and with new measures to deal with the problem of offences committed by persons on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I would like to return to the present Bill and the advantages of it.  First of all, it would be of considerable advantage to the courts by giving them an extra <Col N="780" /> sanction and it will improve the ability of the courts to match the penalty to the crime.  In some other jurisdictions where community service is already a court sanction rather striking use has been made of the principle of suiting the sanction to the crime: for example, State and municipal courts in the United States of America order traffic offenders to carry out work in hospitals, and in the Federal Republic of Germany juvenile courts can order young offenders with alcohol problems to help in homes for inebriates. However, I do not see it as important that there should be any close connection between the nature of the crime and the penalty imposed, but I think it would be quite appropriate, for example when offenders are convicted of acts of vandalism, that they should be required to repair the damage.</P>
    <P>Community service orders have a number of advantages for offenders.  First of all the making of the order will require the offender's consent and thus he will be given a say in the way in which he will repay the community for his criminal activity.  An order would not upset the offender's daily routine because he could fulfil the obligations of the order in his spare time.  Accordingly, he could continue with his education or employment. In addition, there would be the minimum disruption to the offender's family life.  Then community service orders have the advantage to the community in that work of value to the community, which would not otherwise be done, would be performed under the orders.  Some examples of this work would be: helping the disabled and the old with some of the problems which they have to face in dealing with their incapacities or helping organisations both voluntary and statutory which provide assistance for those people.</P>
    <P>Other examples of the kind of work which might be undertaken are set out in a White Paper dealing with community service orders which was published in June 1981.  Incidentally, the widely-distributed White Paper invited the public to give their views on community service orders and it is a source of some disappointment <Col N="781" /> to me that there were very few responses to it.</P>
    <P>An important advantage of community service orders is the help they should give in containing any increases in the numbers being committed to custody.  So, hopefully, community service orders would play their part in reducing the need to resort to the undesirable but necessary practice of &ldquo;shedding&rdquo; offenders from custody after they have served part of their sentences.  However, it ought to be borne in mind that community service orders are not a panacea for the current pressure on prison accommodation: the immediate solution to this pressure lies in the provision of additional accommodation. In this regard moves have been made in the right direction by the recent opening of Loughan House as an open centre and of a second wing in Cork Prison.</P>
    <P>Some members of the community may be slightly apprehensive about offenders coming to work among them.  I would like to allay any such apprehension.  In general in the Bill I have tried to achieve a situation whereby as far as possible there is little or no risk to the ordinary members of the community by reason of the fact that offenders are sent to work among them: first of all community service orders will not be an option to courts in respect of crime for which the law has provided a mandatory sentence. This would exclude offenders convicted of murder.  Secondly, community service orders will not be an option open to the Special Criminal Court and accordingly community service orders would be ruled out for persons convicted of the serious offences which come before that court. Thirdly, the judge dealing with the case is required before making his decision to satisfy himself that the offender is a suitable person for community service and for this purpose to consider a report about the offender prepared by a probation and welfare officer.  In addition while performing community service an offender will be under the general supervision of a probation and welfare officer as well as being under the direct supervision of the paid or voluntary on-site supervisors to whom I have already <Col N="782" /> referred.  I am convinced that these safeguards are adequate and they should go a long way towards easing the worries which some people might have about community service.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill offenders who are aged 16 years or older will be eligible for community service.  The reason such a low age is being fixed is that community service orders have been found to be particularly suitable in the case of the young offender.  In Britain the minimum age for community service orders was 17 years since the early seventies but, due to the success of the community service order for young offenders, the minimum age was reduced to 16 years a month or so ago.  During the passing of the Bill through the Dáil it was suggested that the minimum age be reduced to 15 years, but this suggestion was opposed on the grounds that as a general rule persons under 16 years of age are not sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's Institution or to imprisonment, though they can be committed to institutions under the control of the Department of Education.  It was considered that it was best not to interfere with this situation at least until the whole area of child care comes up for consideration in the context of the Children Bill now being prepared by the Minister for Health.  The question of the proper way to dispose of charges where an offender is under 16 years is one which ought, more appropriately, to be considered in the wider context of that Bill rather than in a Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>An important aim of the Bill is to try to ensure that compliance with the community service order will not jeopardise the offender's employment or his availability for employment or unduly disrupt his family life.  The Bill, therefore, provides that directions as to the times for which an offender may be required to do the work as far as practicable will avoid any interference with the times the offender normally work or attends school and the Bill is framed on the basis that the work will be carried out in the District Court district where the offender resides. If he fails to comply with the order proceedings will be taken against him for such failure and he may be fined up to <Col N="783" /> £300 without prejudice to the continuance of the order.  There is an alternative method, of course, of dealing with the offender for failure to comply with the community service order: he can be returned to the court which made the order and dealt with there for the original offence.  The court to which he has returned may revoke the order.  This might be appropriate if, for example, the offender was clearly determined to disregard the requirements of the order.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that if the offender moves from one part of the country to another, for example in the course of his employment, the community service order may be amended to allow him to do his community service in the area to which he has moved.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to provide in the Bill for a review of the community service orders when circumstances have changed since the order was made and the interests of justice dictate that it ought to be reviewed.  Such review will be carried out by the District Court in the area where the offender resides.  An example of where an order might be reviewed in the interests of justice could be where the offender, because of deterioration of his health or for family reasons, will be unable to continue with the work.</P>
    <P>It is an important requirement of the Bill that the offender must have consented to the making of an order and I consider that I ought to explain why this requirement has been included.  First, it would be highly unlikely that an offender would comply with the order unless he had accepted it in the first instance.  Secondly, it is important that we do not breach the letter or even the spirit of international conventions dealing with forced labour to which we have subscribed.  I anticipate that there will be no shortage of offenders who would consent to the making of community service orders: after all, the alternative is imprisonment or detention.  I believe that many offenders will appreciate that there is a positive side to community service as opposed to the negative aspects of custodial sentences.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the maximum and minimum periods of work under community <Col N="784" /> service orders shall be 240 hours and 40 hours respectively.  When at first a sub-committee considered this particular aspect of community service in Britain they recommended a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 120 hours.  However, in the course of the passage of the Bill through Parliament the upper limit was raised to 240 hours.  Incidentally, France have how adopted the same limits.  As regards the minimum number of hours I consider that anything much less than 40 hours would lead to administrative difficulties.  The maximum of 240 hours seems to me to be about right.  An order requiring very long hours could influence the offender as to whether he should continue to comply with the order.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that it should come into operation on such day as the Minister for Justice by order appoints.  The selection and necessary training of staff for this scheme and the making of necessary rules and regulations will take some time but I can assure the House that there will be no unnecessary delay in bringing the Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to reiterate that I consider the Bill to be important and progressive.  The Bill brings into our criminal justice system a new sanction which is fundamentally different from other sanctions.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating it as a panacea for all the ills of our court system or prison system, but I do recommend it as an important contribution, an alternative sanction which is progressive, liberal in intent, and which will help to deal with our problems of overcrowding in our prisons and in the shedding which has taken place from our prisons in recent years.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people will be disappointed that this Bill is being introduced rather than another one dealing with crime which is urgently required. This is a good Bill and I do not think it should be criticised merely because it is not another Bill.  In the course of recent debates here, some of the measures brought forward were criticised very often because they were not something <Col N="785" /> else, I strongly feel that something should not be criticised for that reason.  With the Minister's assurance that the other Bill is being introduced in the near future, we can devote ourselves to this one Bill and commend it for the very useful provisions in it.</P>
      <P>There is no question whatever that we need to explore new methods of atonement, and new sanctions and this Bill provides a new approach in that respect, and for that reason it is very welcome.  It is important not merely for what it does, but because it encourages the Oireachtas to look at this problem more closely, to explore the position and, hopefully, as a result of our discussions here today to introduce reforms in due course.  In this connection would the Minister indicate whether his Department have further proposals of this kind, and if so, if he would perhaps indicate what they are?</P>
      <P>The advantages of the Bill are very considerable.  The fact that a person convicted of a crime can serve his sentence and at the same time continue his education or his job is a very good one.  Also, there will be a minimum disruption of family life and a young offender will avoid associating with more experienced offenders, or hardened criminals as they are sometimes described.  These are all important features of the Bill.  Now the offender has some say in how he pays for his offence, in the sense that he is able to opt between going to the ordinary prison or accepting the proposals in this Bill. These are fairly important considerations and add to the constructive nature of this Bill and to the possibilities it opens up for further reforms of this kind.  These proposals can only be introduced with the consent of the offender.  It could not be otherwise for the reasons the Minister has outlined.  The very fact that the offender does consent, that he does have an option, that he is allowed to take part in the consideration of how he should serve his sentence, may in many cases make the sentence, the way in which he atones for his crime, slightly more palatable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before making an order of this kind, apart from getting the consent of the offender, the judge must consider him <Col N="786" /> suitable.  This is going to present some difficulty for judges.  First, a judge must get a report from the probation officer and, having considered that report and the possibility that the offender might be a danger to the public, and having obviated that possibility he then can consider whether he should go ahead and introduce this form of sanction.  There is also the difficulty of having a report in almost every case.  I suppose the offender would have to be put back for sentence while the report is obtained and this means a great deal more work for the probation officers.  I will be referring to that later.</P>
    <P>The other question that arises is whether suitable work is available.  In the initial stages if many offenders opt for this form and if the judge considers them suitable I think it is going to be difficult to find a sufficient amount of work. Another aspect which may give rise to some difficulties, to some comment at any rate, is the fact that there may be discrimation, not deliberate discrimination but discrimination nevertheless, in the sense that in some areas when an offender consents to do this kind of work, the work may not be available and he may have to go to prison, whereas a person in exactly similar circumstances in another area will be able to do work of a kind provided by this Bill.  That will be discrimination.  It could be argued of two people with equal degrees of guilt that one will have to serve his sentence in a much more objectionable way than the other and certainly would have some cause for complaint in this respect.</P>
    <P>For the sanction to bear some relationship to the offence is certainly a very good idea indeed.  For a person to be put to work repairing the damage he has done, as in the case of vandalism, or put working where he will see the result of similar offences, is an extremely good thought and should be introduced wherever possible.  It may be very difficult to provide work of this kind and certainly in the initial stages we will have very few cases where it will be possible to provide suitable work of this kind for an offender. Nevertheless, the idea is an excellent <Col N="787" /> one, that of atoning tor a crime in a practical way by recompensing society.</P>
    <P>In the present situation, before the introduction of this Bill, judges in many cases put back an offender for sentence and were influenced by the behaviour of the convicted person in the meantime and, in particular, by whether compensation was paid where possible.  This was, in a sense, something similar to what we are talking about in this Bill.  It was an excellent idea and one which judges might consider more often.  I have no doubt that judges will be glad to have this additional option open to them, even though in some cases it may be difficult to decide whether it is the proper thing to do.  Certainly to have an option open is something that most judges will be glad of, because the most difficult part of a judge's job is deciding what is an appropriate sentence.</P>
    <P>In many cases, an offender may be an object of considerable pity, and all kinds of special family circumstances may make the judge inclined to be excessively lenient. The French have a proverb which says that to understand all is to forgive all.  If the circumstances of every crime and the background to every offender were totally understood by a judge, then he would find it difficult to impose any sentence.  This is a very serious problem for a judge, but he must think of society, of the wrong done to the public and to individuals and must sometimes be much less lenient than he might feel inclined to be.  He also has to think of the danger of repetition if no deterrent exists and the danger to the public if offenders appear to get off scot-free.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, there have to be exceptions to every rule but, by and large, a judge must bear in mind the fact that crime does not pay and must not appear to pay.  Consequently, judges will be grateful for an option such as this which, on the one hand, will be fairly lenient as far as the offenders are concerned and will avoid some of the harsh aspects of going to prison but will, nevertheless, show the offender and those who are watching what happens that he is not <Col N="788" /> going to get away completely with his offence.</P>
    <P>Many judges are ill-equipped to deal with this question of penalties.  A judicial appointee may be well versed in the law and may have very good experience in evaluating evidence and in assessing character, but very often he has no experience in deciding on appropriate sentences to strike a fair balance between the offender and the public.  A recent motion here in regard to reform of the legal system referred to training courses, refresher courses, seminars and so on for judges.  I would not be in favour of this in general terms, but if it is justified in any area, it is in this area of discussion and exchanging of experience in regard to appropriate sentences.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister about a few points arising from this Bill.  What will be the position in regard to the availability of probation officers?  As far as I know, they are fully occupied at the moment but it is extremely unlikely that this Bill could be operated successfully without an additional number of officers. Not only are they going to have to provide reports, as mentioned in the Bill, before the judge makes up his mind, but in addition, they are going to have to supervise the work being done and to devise that work.  The success of this Bill will depend entirely on the work of the probation officers on this new and additional arrangement.  It seems inevitable that additional probation officers will have to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Government are dedicated, and properly so, to not expanding employment in the public service because of the additional cost that this would entail, but in this instance an exception could be made because, on the one hand while there would be an additional cost of employing probation officers, on the other hand it would save a great deal of money by not sending these offenders to jail.  There could be considerable justification for taking on extra officers in the particular circumstances where, in fact, the end result might be a saving of public expenditure, rather than additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister <Col N="789" /> what is the accommodation in regard to prisons at the moment?  This Bill is partly to deal with the problem as well as to provide an extra means of dealing with offences.  One of the reasons for its introduction and welcome is that it would ease the present position of lack of accommodation for offenders, resulting in other prisoners having to be let out before their time to allow new prisoners in.</P>
    <P>The Minister did say somewhere recently, possibly in the debate on this Bill in the Dáil, that contrary to public belief there was not a very large increase in the number of prisoners in the country over the past five or ten years.  On the other hand, we have had a new wing in Cork and some additional accommodation in Loughan House.  Perhaps the Minister would give us the accommodation position at the present time with these additions.  Is it now possible to accommodate all offenders sentenced to terms of imprisonment and, with the provisions of this Bill, will the accommodation problem be less serious in the future?</P>
    <P>The other point is: are there any open or semi-open prisons in the country at the moment, ones that would be half-way between the ordinary prison and what is provided for in this Bill?  I understand that there is such a prison in Wicklow and would be glad to know whether that is the case.  If so, approximately what accommodation is provided in these kinds of open or semi-open prisons?  Generally, this is an excellent Bill and will have our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Ryan in welcoming this Bill.  The Bill, in effect, provides an alternative sanction for the courts in dealing with offenders who come before the courts and, as such, represents a radical departure. All too frequently in the past, the administration of justice and, indeed, those who administer justice, have been condemned and criticised unfairly because of the ineffectiveness of the sanctions available to the courts and to those who administer justice.  I welcome this Bill also because it provides a suitable sanction in a situation where our prisons are overcrowded and where for many <Col N="790" /> crimes now coming before the courts custodial sentences or custodial orders are not suitable sanctions.  Furthermore, the Bill must be welcomed because this heralds a positive approach to crime.  On the one hand, the operation of this Bill, if successful, should help the criminal &mdash; or the offender as the Bill terms him or her: on the other hand, the Bill by its very nature should in its operation prove beneficial to society.</P>
      <P>Anybody who attends our courts frequently sees in operation the dilemma with which the Judiciary in criminal courts are faced.  On the one hand, they are faced with the plea of defence lawyers who point out to the court the problem which a custodial order could occasion to their client.  Problems of family background, of family finance, of hardship, of individual inadequacy will all be pointed out to a justice or a judge as being good reasons why an offender should not be sentenced to prison.  On the other hand the judge as the person administering justice in any court is faced with his duty to see that society is protected.  He may have before him somebody who has a list of previous convictions, convictions which in all respect have offended society in an open and public way and yet he is faced with this dilemma whether, on the one hand, he should give the offender a second, third or fourth chance and perhaps thereby do some good for the offender or, on the other hand, he should take a step which some might argue would be for the benefit of society, namely, to sent the offender to prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frequently, we see our judges and justices faced with the dilemma of trying to evaluate the difference between administering justice on the one hand and applying the law on the other.  It takes, as Senator Ryan said, an exceptional judge or an exceptional justice to walk that very narrow path between those two distinct concepts.  Therefore, the Bill in its radical nature, by providing an alternative sanction does something which should make it easier for those administering justice to find their way along the narrow path.  The administration of the Bill and the implementation of its terms would seem to lie overwhelmingly in the <Col N="791" /> hands of probation officers.  Perhaps that is a good thing.  As I see our probation service, it seems generally to work satisfactorily. The officers who operate that service certainly are people who are equipped and trained to implement the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, when he comes to making regulations for the implementation of the terms of this Bill, to take steps which would ensure that the probation service would link up with various other organs of State.  I refer to Manpower, the Youth Employment Agency, local authorities and various voluntary organisations, which increasingly are playing a linked role with State and semi-State organisations at all levels in our society, and finally with the Garda Síochána.  There may be those who would criticise a link up between the operation of this scheme and the Garda Síochána because in all cases the Garda Síochána are those who prosecute for crimes coming before our courts.  Nevertheless, it is a good idea because in rural Ireland the Garda operate very much as a community force.  We have gardaí in small towns and villages who are aware of the social circumstances and background, the qualities and problems of offenders.</P>
    <P>My experience of watching gardaí at work dealing with offenders and with people who come before the courts, is that by and large they operate in a very helpful way and indeed there seems now to be a very good working relationship between the probation service on the one hand and the Garda Síochána on the other hand in helping offenders to find their way out of crime.</P>
    <P>There are certain areas of work to which offenders could be directed.  The unpleasant graffiti we see on so many walls could be removed for the public good.  Removal of litter which in many circumstances is becoming quite a nuisance, particularly in public places, despite the enactment of recent legislation, is another area.  I could also mention here voluntary organisations.  I would also see a role for offenders in improving the appearance of every town and village in the country for the Tidy Towns competition. <Col N="792" /> It is only by taking steps of that nature&mdash;by ensuring that we become tidier where we are untidy&mdash;that we can steer people, in a broader sense, away from crime.  By directing offenders to work of that nature we would not merely be helping the offender but, overall, the work done would be a help to society.</P>
    <P>Another work area into which I would like to see offenders moving would be the preservation of national monuments.  We have a problem of lack of finance in this area and many of our national monuments are crumbling.  With the help of the Office of Public Works and of local authorities steps could be taken to get offenders involved in that kind of work also.  I just mention these matters because the Minister has to make regulations under this Bill.  I would like to see this legislation operating as far as possible within the confines of these matters.</P>
    <P>At the moment at District Court level the justice has four options in dealing with any offender.  He can sentence the offender to prison; he can place the offender on probation; he can apply the Probation Act and he can adjourn the charge&mdash;which to my mind can often prove a very effective measure.  I have already mentioned in relation to custodial orders that these frequently do not seem to have satisfactory effects.  This may be due to a number of reasons.  It may be due to the unsatisfactory nature of our prison service, if it is unsatisfactory, and I am not in any way condemning it.  It may be due to overcrowding.  It may be due to any number of factors, but it does seem that people who serve prison sentences, even for a short period, at the end of the day do not appear to have improved and society therefore continues to suffer all the more.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second manner in which a judge or justice can deal with an offender&mdash;namely, placing the offender on probation&mdash;the probation service appears to be working satisfactorily.  In its operation there could and should be a closer continuing relationship between the service and its officers on the one hand and the offender and his defending lawyers on the other hand.  After an order has been made.  that relationship ceases. <Col N="793" /> It can be argued that the relationship may continue with the offender but in many cases it is important that that relationship should continue with the offender's lawyer.</P>
    <P>The final sanction open to a judge or justice is that of adjourning charges.  This matter is important as it relates to this Bill in a general sense, particularly in rural areas where offences which are of a community nature come before the courts.  I am referring to dancehall rows, assaults in public places and so on.  A judge or justice should use the adjournment procedure as a deterrent and a warning that if there was any repetition of this conduct a final order would be made.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that in the operation of this Bill I would like to see a link between certain organs of the State, in particular in this context with the Garda Síochána.  In rural areas we are lucky to have the benefit of a resident Garda establishment in most of our villages and small towns, where there is a close relationship between all members of society and their protectors.  That role is one which has developed.  Older members of the House living in rural areas will remember the role of the Garda in dealing with agricultural census returns, with ordinary census of population returns and even in dealing with social welfare matters.  There was a time in the not too distant past when old age pension books were always first delivered by a member of the Garda Síochána.  There are those who now condemn that role of the garda within the community.  It is an excellent role as it has the effect of keeping gardaí closely in touch with the population, of providing them readily with a basis for obtaining information and knowing exactly what the community is doing.</P>
    <P>I am not wandering from the Bill, as we are speaking about community work and community policing and the administration of justice in a broad community sense.  We are operating a pilot scheme in rural areas which can have the ultimate effect of removing gardaí from a residential basis into central locations.  While at all times providing a Garda presence in every village where there was formerly a <Col N="794" /> resident garda, nevertheless the gardaí will not have to be resident in rural areas. The Minister should look at this scheme in his concern for the operation and administration of justice and the maintenance of law and order in rural areas.  The Department should ask themselves if the operation of the pilot scheme will have the effect of keeping in closer contact with those in rural areas, if it will have the effect of ensuring that the gardaí know what is happening in rural areas.  I think that it will not.  Ultimately gardaí will be travelling out from the larger central barrack towns to the various villages with Garda stations, for one or two hours per day and that is not a satisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention specifically one or two matters in relation to this Bill. Section 2, referring to the persons to whom the Bill applies may be a little restrictive.  It refers to people over the age of 16 years.  The Minister referred to the lowering of the age limit in Britain from 17 years to 16 years and gave certain reasons as to why the particular age limit is applied.  I am concerned about situations where people under the age of 16 commit crimes against society and where their parents would be anxious, for a number of reasons, that the provisions of the Bill should operate.  One can argue against this point of view by saying that there are international conventions dealing with ages of work and so on but nevertheless if a parent gives his or her consent to the provisions of the Bill operating for a person of a younger age, the judge or justice should be able, with the parents' consent to make the provisions of the Bill applicable.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals basically with matters which a judge or justice must consider in applying the Bill with the offender's consent. It is not specifically stated but suggested that he should have before him a written report from the probation officer. Is that not too cumbersome?  Other than those specific matters, the Bill is an excellent measure.  In a very unassuming way, it is a radical departure &mdash; a departure which in the administration of justice will prove very effective, if properly implemented.</P>
    <Col N="795" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has almost established a reputation for often bashing the Department of Justice, I enthusiastically welcome the Bill.  It is a progressive measure, an imaginative measure and my rather frequent contacts with the Minister in the last few months have convinced me that it is a measure that will be implemented imaginatively as well.  I have, therefore, great hopes for the Bill.</P>
      <P>At a time when we have something close to a panic about crime and about the apparent ineffectiveness of our law enforcement and of our prison system to do what our society collectively expect these things to do, it is good and courageous that this legislation, which will not appeal to many in terms of how they believe instinctively the crime problem should be dealt with, should be before us.</P>
      <P>I use that phrase &ldquo;something close to a panic&rdquo; about the country's crime problem but the reality is that, of course, it is terrible and terrifying every time an elderly person is beaten up and a young girl is assaulted, when we have armed robberies in the streets of towns and cities that ten years ago did not know what an armed robbery was, except from what they saw in a wild west movie of something that happened thousands of miles away a hundred years ago.  We are in a position at this stage to respond imaginatively to our crime problem.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt about it, one solution to crime, unquestionably, is extraordinarily severe penalties, extraordinary legal powers for the police force and an extraordinarily rigid prison system. Anybody who visited, say, Spain, during the regime of General Franco will testify that crime was then at a very low level.  Anybody who visited many of the countries in Eastern Europe for instance, will know that one can walk with absolute safety through the not too well lit streets of East Berlin, or Dresden, or Bucharest late at night and feel quite safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether you talk from the right or from the left, extreme measures will work.  What is true is that if the demand for more police powers, more sanctions <Col N="796" /> and more imprisonment were satisfied it would not make a difference.  The only sort of sanction that would really have a deterrent effect would be socially unacceptable here, apart from anything else.  That is my view on it and I suspect it is the view of many people in the Department of Justice.  What is extraordinary is the length of time it has taken for the new Criminal Justice Bill actually to emerge.  There may be different views about different aspects of it, but we will await that Bill.</P>
    <P>Politicians have a duty to keep things in perspective in the area of crime.  We have reached the stage now when many people from rural Ireland are quite frightened about coming to Dublin because of the panic about crime.  However, they will go on continental holidays to the capital cities of Europe and quite happily stroll around late at night, even though the objective evidence is that many of these are much more crime-ridden than Dublin.  So we have an obligation not to frighten ourselves into a panic in the way that, for instance, people in the United States have done.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a major attempt to re-define punishment or penalties for offenders outside the prison system for the areas of offences where prison would be the normal penalty.  That is a major almost revolutionary reforming measure.  It is imaginative, it is new and I suspect that it will produce the problems of local acceptability, and community acceptability that were mentioned by the Minister and in the White Paper also.  Politicians have a habit of being in favour of various good causes at a safe distance.  Everybody is in favour of looking after the travelling people at a safe distance.  Everybody is in favour of looking after homeless people at a safe distance.  Indeed, there are occasions when people have taken some exception to looking after even handicapped people when they come too close.</P>
    <P>When community service orders begin to be introduced and to be a part of court procedures, I hope that all of us public representatives will not begin to jump on whichever is the politically appropriate bandwagon to prevent individuals who <Col N="797" /> may be convicted of relatively serious crime getting involved in community service work in the area because of one or two people.  This is a method of treatment of offenders which has worked, and worked very well in other countries and has worked with our young people.  As one who regards himself as a professional liberal, I am always disappointed to have to record that whether you treat young offenders by the harsh regime that some theorists espouse or by the much more liberal rehabilitative, educational regimes that other people espouse, most of the evidence is that at the end of it all you do not get much difference in terms of control or further offences and so on. There is no really proven method, will all the experiments that have been done in western society.</P>

      <P>We have two motions which have been sent to us from the Dáil. It is necessary for us to pass these motions before Dáil Éireann can proceed to make a substantive motion in regard to the establishment of these two committees. I suggest to the House that we might perhaps debate the two committees together.  The subject matters are cognate and a single debate would be adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That, for the purpose of facilitating consultation between the Houses of the Oireachtas and representatives of organisations concerned with the position of women in Irish society, it is expedient that a Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas (which shall be called the Joint Committee on Women's Rights) consisting of 11 members of Dáil Éireann and six members of Seanad Éireann be appointed.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the Joint Committee shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  examine or propose legislative measures which would materially affect the interests of women;</P>
      <P>(b)  consider means by which any areas of discrimination against women can be eliminated and by which the obstacles to their full participation in the political, social and economic life of the community can be removed;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  consider specific economic and social disadvantages applying to women in the home and bearing in <Col N="799" /> mind the special nature of their contribution to the community, to recommend effective policy and administrative changes to help eliminate these disadvantages;</P>
    <P>(3)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to engage the services of persons with specialist or technical knowledge to assist it for the purposes of particular enquiries.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the Joint Committee, previous to the commencement of business, shall elect one of its Members to be Chairman, who shall have only one vote.</P>
    <P>(5)  That all questions in the Joint Committee shall be determined by a majority of votes by the Members present and voting and in the event of there being an equality of votes the question shall be decided in the negative.</P>
    <P>(6)  That the Joint Committee shall have power to print and publish from time to time minutes of evidence taken before it, together with such related documents as it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>(7)  That four Members of the Committee shall form a Quorum, of whom at least one shall be a Member of Dáil Éireann and at least one shall be a Member of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>(8)  That the Report of the Joint Committee shall, on adoption by the Joint Committee, be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas forthwith, whereupon the Joint Committee shall be empowered to print and publish such Report together with such related documents as it thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to recommend these motions today concerning the setting up of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and the Committee on Marriage Breakdown.  It marks a milestone not only in our parliamentary history but in the development of the <Col N="800" /> movement for women's rights.  I will speak firstly about the women's rights committee.  The Oireachtas has been accused from time to time &mdash; and I believe rightly &mdash; of bringing through legislation by default and nowhere has this been more apparent than in the legislation affecting women's rights, whether we are speaking of employment equality rights, the right to family planning services, the right to serve on juries, or tax equity for married couples.</P>
      <P>Women have had to fight bitterly for these rights and in many cases succeeded in winning them only with the assistance of the courts, or through the EEC.  For a community which has spent such a great deal of its intellectual resources in seeking to establish our identity as a nation, it is regrettable that when it comes to social issues &mdash; women's rights being just one of a number of key social issues &mdash; our efforts have been sadly bereft of originality and vigour.  We have reacted with indifference and indeed occasionally outright hostility to social developments which have enhanced the economic and social position of women in the community and rarely have we taken a lead.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that the setting up of this committee will mark a break in this pattern and that we will now see a fresh approach to the examination of the barriers &mdash; both legal and otherwise &mdash; which still exist for women in attaining their full potential.  I believe in this context that while profound changes have taken place in the role of women and in the contribution they are making to the economic and social life of the community, the potential contribution they are capable of making is far more considerable if measures are taken rapidly further to promote and facilitate changes in their role.  Since the publication of the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women just over ten years ago, considerable progress has been made in removing the basic and more overt forms of discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a wider range of measures open to society actively to promote and facilitate greater opportunities for women, which I hope the Oireachtas committee will be addressing.  For <Col N="801" /> instance, many women, particularly women working full-time in the home, are still insulated from the full economic and social life of Irish society, for such reasons as lack of community development and organisation; lack of cultural and recreational facilities; failure to organise job opportunities and job arrangements to facilitate married women and the persistence of traditional views about jobs appropriate to women. The underlying demographic, educational and labour force trends demonstrate clearly the need to create new opportunities, facilities and attitudes if our economic and social growth is not to be seriously retarded by restricting the potential contribution women can make.</P>
    <P>Too often lately one hears economic and social commentators suggest that if married women vacate their jobs or are actively discouraged from continuing in them we might be helping to ease our unemployment problem.  To such people I would say that it is not a simple case of arithmetic &mdash; one group cancelling out another.  The opportunity cost of depriving the community of the talent and expertise of a particular category of workers would be very real.  The challenge is to create job opportunities for all those who wish to work rather than deprive women because of their sex and marital status of their right to work.</P>
    <P>One of the terms of reference for the committee refers to the identification of the disadvantages in various fields as these apply to women in the home. Though the number of married women gainfully employed outside the home is increasing significantly &mdash; from 37,000 in 1971 to an estimated 105,000 in 1983, an increase of 68,000 &mdash; the majority of married women continue to make their considerable contribution to the community as housewives.  In 1981, the estimated number of married women in the economically active age group non-gainfully employed was 477,900&mdash;four times more than the number gainfully employed.</P>
    <P>The economic contribution of the non-gainfully employed married women has never been included in economic measurements.  If an imputed value were given to this contribution equivalent to <Col N="802" /> the average female weekly earnings in industry in, say, June 1983, that is, £88.12 for a 37 hour week, the total value would be £2.190 million or about 18 per cent of the estimated GDP in 1982.</P>
    <P>But even without such statistics we all know the immense contribution in terms of caring, nurturing, unpaid voluntary work of all kinds and general support, which such women make.  Increasingly, economic and social policy must have regard to the status and well-being of the housewife, the widow and the unmarried mother and particularly those with low incomes, large families and handicapped children.  Fiscal policy, children's allowances and other possible family allowances are areas which must be examined to see how an equitable economic balance can be struck between those who are gainfully employed and those who are not but whose work is an important foundation on which the family life of the community rests.  Apart from considerations of economic equity, it is clear that much more needs to be done to provide a fuller social, cultural and recreational life in local communities.  A primary function of organised community development must be to draw housewives out of their individual isolation into a mutually-supportive community system of activity and service.  Public policy in such matters as housing design, neighbourhood design and facilities must also be fully supportive of the housewife in basing its standards on the ascertained living, working and recreational needs of the family.  A particular concern must be those areas such as rural areas and inner-urban areas where economic and social changes have left a residue of poor living conditions whose impact on the housewife is particularly acute.  The social planning services and facilities in the large new residential communities developing around each sizeable urban centre are as important as the basic housing and roads.  Greater attention will have to be given to those services and facilities particularly in the earlier stages of new residential developments.</P>
    <P>There still exist some forms of discrimination in social, cultural and economic fields which our existing equality legisiation <Col N="803" /> does not cover.  I refer to such sexual discrimination as access to clubs etc. and difficulty for married women in acquiring hire-purchase credit.  In certain other countries such discriminations are covered by an all-embracing Act such as the Sexual Discrimination Act in the UK. I hope that the Oireachtas committee will consider these remaining discriminations which can act as a particular irritant for many women wishing to participate fully in certain fields.  Remedies for the removal of these barriers should follow on this consideration.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs and family law reform, I look forward to participating in the work of the Oireachtas committee which I believe should complement the work I am carrying out in my ministerial capacity and hopefully give a lead in certain areas.  To bring the debate on women's rights into our Parliament is, I believe, a very positive step and should be a welcome indication to Irishwomen that their legislators recognise their contribution and will work to remove the remaining barriers to their full participation in society.</P>
    <P>I should now like to move on to the Committee on Marriage Breakdown. This committee derives its origin from the Government's commitment that the problem of marital breakdown should be seriously considered by the Oireachtas. I know that when the Government advocated the approach of consensus in the setting up of the committee there were many people who felt that this was a mere stalling tactic and that the committee would never get off the ground.  I am therefore very glad that we have been able to get the agreement of the major parties in Dáil Éireann on setting up the committee and would like to register appreciation to the Leader of the Opposition and Whips.  I hope that this agreement and willingness to work together will be reflected in the way in which the committee will tackle the task before it and, finally, in the report which it is required to produce next year.</P>
    <P>The central terms of reference of the committee are &ldquo;to consider the protection of marriage and of family life, and <Col N="804" /> to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage, and to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas thereon&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The agreed statement which was issued on 24 June made it clear that these terms of reference will enable the committee to consider every aspect of the matter including any legislative or constitutional changes which might be necessary. Within the terms of references agreed, the essence of the committee's work will be to examine the problems of marital breakdown and consider various responses.  Many people have strong personal views about this issue but the place for discussion of what are indeed widely differing views to be considered is now in the joint committee.</P>
    <P>The joint committee will consist of 11 Members of Dáil Éireann and five Members of the Seanad.  The committee will have power to send for persons, papers and records and, subject to the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, to engage the services of persons who are specialists with technical knowledge to assist it for the purposes of particular inquiries.  Subject to its terms of reference, the committee will agree on its procedures and will, I am sure, be open to submissions from the interest groups which are active over the years in the area of family law and marital breakdown and have done invaluable work, amongst whom are AIM Group, Divorce Action Group and FLAC.</P>
    <P>Looking at the available records of families affected by marriage breakdown some people, I am sure, conclude that society has changed for the worse.  This is perhaps a simplistic view and does not take into account the types of pressure which a changing society and different expectations create.  The time is gone when the traditional authoritative role of the father and the subservient role of the mother at home looking after the children would be acceptable.  The increasing movement towards equality of the sexes and the emphasis in modern thinking on individual human rights have brought about a situation where the emphasis in modern marriage is now on sharing and companionship.  Couples nowadays <Col N="805" /> expect more and are less prepared to put up with difficulties they would have readily accepted years ago.</P>
    <P>There is correctly in the terms of reference emphasis on the protection of marriage and as I said in the Seanad before, we need to consider how the resources of the State should be mobilised in support of marriage.  We also need to look at the way in which the marriage laws of the State in the latter half of the twentieth century should reflect the current practices and moral ethos of society.  Above all, we need to admit that there is a real problem and the public are entitled to expect that we as legislators will work together to bring forward acceptable solutions.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for me to say more at this stage.  I am very glad that the patience of the Government has been rewarded and that the committee is being set up by agreement.  It is now a matter for the membership to be determined in the ordinary way of Oireachtas committees and for the date of the first meeting to be set.  On behalf of the Government and the Oireachtas I wish the joint committees well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I give a warm welcome to the setting up of these committees and to the commitment which the Minister of State has shown in pursuing these matters.  She has shown her willingness to act both in the improvement of the position of women and in dealing with some of the problems that arise with regard to marriage laws in this country. I am sorry that the attendance for this motion is sparse.  I notice that the female attendance and the Independents attendance is very high.  But among the other parties, very few other Senators have seen fit to come into the House for this motion.  After all, seeing that in every consideration of matrimonial law there is both a man and a woman I would have thought that some of the men would have shown more interest.  However, if this is the way they behave, they cannot blame us if, in their absence, we do all sorts of things to them that they might not like. I draw attention to the attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the text of the motion <Col N="806" /> before us, I was very pleased to see that the committee on matrimonial law has a time limit in which it should report.  A year's time limit is given.  We are all human and I am sure other Senators will agree that most of us do nothing unless the gun is held to our heads and we work to a deadline.  There is no doubt that the fact that a deadline is set will make the committee aim at getting something done by that time.  I am sorry that the women's committee has not got the same deadline. I appreciate that the problems cannot be so easily quantified but I am afraid that any committee which does not have a deadline might drag on and on.  I am thinking of the example of the task force which produced very valuable work in the end, but only after years and years. I hope this committee will not go on for years and years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the terms of reference of the marriage law committee will enable it to consider every aspect of the matter including any legislative or constitutional changes which might be necessary.  The wording of the resolution has been carefully framed so as to avoid any mention of constitutional change and above all any possible mention of the dirty word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo;.  The idea is that we should not mention anything so naughty as actually considering the introduction of divorce.  I am not going to repeat the arguments which were made in the debate on the divorce motion proposed by Senators Ross and Robb but I consider the Houses of the Oireachtas are showing themselves to be well behind public opinion on this subject when they should be acting as leaders.  As the results of opinion polls which were published last weekend in the Sunday newspapers have shown public opinion is largely in favour of divorce.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that we should be so worried by the whole thing that even in the Minister's speech the only mention of divorce is that where she named the divorce action group as one of the groups that would be consulted.  I am very pleased that they will be and that FLAC and AIM will also be consulted. Nevertheless, we are backing away from <Col N="807" /> the actual problem by saying that we may have to change the Constitution.</P>
    <P>One aspect which was raised during the debate dealing with the previous committee was the number of people to be on the committee and the very small number of Senators that are to be appointed.  This arises in relation to this committee.  I should like to hear from the Government what reasons there are for making these committees so small.  Why only 11 members from the Dáil?  Why only six members for the women's rights committee and five members for the matrimonial law committee.  Perhaps the Independents are becoming paranoid in their old age, but one can only have the feeling that the reason for having such small committees is to exclude the smaller groups both in the Dáil and the Seanad.  I understand that a certain arrangement has been made with regard to the marriage law committee.  I welcome that but at the same time, in principle, I cannot see what is the <i>rationale</i> behind having six people on the women's committee and five people for the marriage law committee.  Why the difference?</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the rationale behind having such a small number of people.  There are many people both in this House and in the Dáil who would be well able to contribute to the deliberations of these committees.  I know that the numbers are agreed between the parties rather than just by a unilateral decision of the Government.  One should say it is not just a Government decision but a ready-up by the major parties.  Not only would the Independents and small groups be excluded in the Seanad and in the Dáil but the Labour Party voice would be extremely small and one could picture the Labour Party member on the committee not even having somebody to second what he or she wanted to propose.</P>
    <P>Can it be said that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that in the Dáil and Seanad the minority groups and the Labour Party have made it very clear where they stand on the issue of reform of matrimonial law?  Their position has been made quite clear and perhaps it is <Col N="808" /> not a very welcome one.  I do not want to accuse people of deliberately excluding that point of view, but when looked at from the outside it looks very like it.  I should like an explanation as to why the numbers are so small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the establishment of these committees because they will be examining two very important areas of our social legislation which have, as the Minister of State said, been neglected or treated in the past in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  I also welcome the Minister of State to the House for the debate on these motions.</P>
      <P>The committees, the work they will do and the evidence they will hear and gather will be largely for the education of Deputies and Senators and will provide a structured opportunity to bring together the information and the deep knowledge of the problem which exists in our community.  There are various reports and major studies which have been carried out.  Individuals, groups and bodies have been calling for reform for decades.  Now at last we have a structured opportunity for Deputies and Senators to sit down seriously over the next year in the case of the marital committee and over a somewhat similar period in the case of the committee on women's affairs.</P>
      <P>Before I come to some critical aspects, I warmly welcome the fact that these committees have been established.  I regret that it has taken as long as it has. I regret the oblique wording of the motions because, like Senator McGuinness, I have some doubts as to whether the motions are sufficiently broad and comprehensive to tackle some of the real problems that exist in the areas of women's rights and marriage reform.  We can at least examine them in that context in this debate and seek clarification and assurances from the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the committees individually and their terms of reference, I join with Senator McGuinness in criticising the size of these committees.  It seems very difficult to understand why the committees are so small, particularly <Col N="809" /> with regard to the Seanad participation. There are Senators ready and willing and with a significant contribution to make who would like to participate.  Why, in the terms of reference, are we excluding them?  Were it not for an informal arrangement being made in the case of the Independents, why are the terms of reference of the marital committee and the women's committee so small that they would appear to exclude Independent representation?  I find it very difficult to understand and, like Senator McGuinness, I hope the Minister of State will be able to give us an understanding of how the size of these committees emerged. We have dealt with a number of Joint Committees and they all have different compositions.  They all have slightly different terms of reference.  I am aware that the major political agreement is the agreement between the Whips expressing a political consensus to the establishment of a committee but behind that, there are some machinations that I should like to know more about on the size of the overall committee and the participation by Members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>As regards the committee on women's rights, I welcome the possibility of a structured assessment of various aspects of the position of women in society.  I, the Minister of State and a number of other female Members of this House have attended on various occasions when reports of the Employment Equality Agency have been published, for example, and there is no guarantee that they will receive any parliamentary consideration. There is no forum at present in which either annual reports or important reports on various aspects of women in employment can be considered.  There is no guarantee that the call in a report of the agency for an increase in the resources or the capacity to fulfil its statutory obligations will be met with a proper response, a guarantee that it will be considered at parliamentary level. Hitherto, all we have been able to do is from time to time put down motions to debate individual reports of bodies such as the Employment Equality Agency.  I hope that this committee will provide a structured and considered framework in <Col N="810" /> which the reports and documentations of the agency will be considered and members of the agency and of other bodies who are working in the field of either employment, law or social legislation particularly affecting women will have an opportunity to make their representations.</P>
    <P>In that regard I regret that neither in the committee on women's rights nor in the committee on marriage breakdown is there express reference to the single parent family, to the enormous number of women particularly who have responsibility in society for the bringing up of children.  They range from the widows to the deserted wives, to prisoner's wives, unmarried mothers and they suffer from a cumulative disadvantage and discrimination which are of particular concern and interest.  I hope they will be given priority attention by both committees. When I come to the committee on marital breakdown I intend to criticise to some extent its rather narrow terms of reference in a similar vein.  But I would hope that the committee will not fall too smugly into a consideration of married women and their possibilities of access to employment.  Of course the situation of married women in employment and the situation of married women in the home is important but it is by no means the whole of the situation and it overlooks the factual situation of the number of one-parent families, the vulnerable families in our society.  There are reports, such as the report of the NESC on family income support, which have clearly demonstrated the much greater disadvantage of one-parent families.  There are various aspects of that, lack of structures and supports in our society, which aggravate the difficulties for the single parent who is not always but is, by and large, generally a woman with responsibility for young children.  Also there is the position of single women in our society.  There are very severe economic and social discriminations against single women which must be of considerable concern to this committee.</P>
    <P>I hope that the committee will be able to exert some political force and muscle in getting reforms, because it does not <Col N="811" /> seem to be enough to argue the principal and even get agreement on the principle. I remember a debate in this House on the issue of domicile, the dependent domicile of married women.  I do not think there was a Senator who expressed disagreement with the principle and yet there is a lack of willingness to follow through and ensure that either agreement on the principle or reports on issues of social concern resulted in legislation.  So I would hope that these committees, perhaps through the good offices of the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs, will have a very direct line with the parliamentary draftsman's office and with the proposals for legislation.</P>
    <P>In that regard I am not quite sure what relationship the Committee on Women's Affairs would have with the legislative committee which is concerned about law reform that we were speaking of, because much law reform would be in the area of women's rights.  There may be some early teething problems in trying to ensure that these committees work constructively together but I do think it is important that the committees do not just compile reports but that they think very effectively of ways in which they will be able to advance the pace of social legislation. In that regard I feel that if there was a commitment from the Minister of State to produce a White Paper on the basis of the report by the Committee on Women's Affairs on a whole range of reforms which would be introduced in a programmed way over a brief period of, say, 18 months or two years in this area, that would be an incentive to the committee and it would focus attention on the particular areas.  It would be a very helpful focus in that regard.</P>
    <P>I would also hope that the committee will not just consist of the converted who tend on the whole to be the women Members of the Dáil or Seanad.  I hope that there will be a significant number of male Members who will participate in the committee out of a conviction of the usefulness to them personally of the material the committees will have access to, by being able to hear the submissions and <Col N="812" /> receive papers and evidence from various bodies and the opportunity they will have to examine in more detail some of the problems of our society.  I feel that it would be a reflection on the attitude of the male Members if there was a general opting out of this committee and leaving it somehow in a backwater as merely a committee that should be dealt with by women but is not really of concern to the mainstream of Deputies and Senators.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the women's committee I feel that it would be desirable to publicise broadly the existence of the committee and invite submissions. That has been one of the very healthy developments in the last decade certainly in Irish life &mdash; the number of women's groups of various sorts that have sprung up, not just in Dublin or the other larger cities but all over the country.  These smaller groups very often have a knowledge of the real situation for women in their area, are much more open than in my experience are some Members of the House in a formal sense on issues in relation to the discriminations and problems that exist in our society and the changes we need to bring about.</P>
    <P>This committee &mdash; the same would also be the case with the committee on marriage reform &mdash; should be concerned to publish more widely than is normally the case in Oireachtas committees, their existence and openly invite submissions from groups and bodies and individuals who have a view and an experience and expertise to offer to the committee.  I hope the committee will address itself to the importance of compiling statistical information on this situation.  That would also be true of the marriage committee. We lack proper compiling of statistical information which is the basis for properly based and researched reforms in the particular areas.</P>
    <P>Turning to the committee on marriage reform, I have already made one criticism which is a criticism equally of the two committees, that in this committee on marriage breakdown there is a focus on the protection of marriage and of family life.  That, in an Irish context, could be a very narrow focus because family life under the Constitution is confined to the <Col N="813" /> family based on marriage.  I would be concerned that the committee does not so confine itself.  Indeed, I hope that the committee will address itself to the question of whether the definition of family under the Constitution is too narrow and discriminatory in that the interpretation of the family under Article 41 by the Supreme Court in successive cases has resulted in family rights under the Constitution being confined to the family based on marriage.  In a recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights the court made it clear that family rights under the European Convention on Human Rights are not confined to the family based on marriage, so that it is certainly possible that in narrowing the range of family rights under the Constitution to the family based on marriage Ireland is, potentially at least, in breach of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>It also gives rise to very real difficulties for couples who are in a stable relationship and where the relationship results in children and they would many if free to do so but they are not free to do so. Those couples and their children suffer from very severe legal, social and economic discriminations in our society.  I know the Minister of State is on record, and I welcome this, as being concerned to introduce legislation to remove some of the legal discriminations in the area of illegitimacy.  This is very important and I would press her to go ahead with that and not require a committee to report on it.</P>
    <P>Apart from the situation of illegitimate children there is also the severely disadvantaged situation of partners who are not in a formal marriage, or perhaps even who think they are in a formal marriage but the marriage would not be recognised by the State.  They cannot, for example, avail of the Family Home Protection Act or the barring order remedy; they cannot avail of maintenance or they cannot look for a share in the family home.  All of these measures of reform in the area of family law exclude what are in reality family relationships but which are not so recognised by the State.</P>
    <P>The major issue which this committee <Col N="814" /> will have to face is the issue of divorce. On this, as the Minister of State well knows and as the House well knows, the Labour Party have a very clear position and a position that we will hold to very firmly in this committee.  It is a position which was given public expression recently by the party leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, in which he made it very clear that the Labour Party are unequivocally committed to the introducing of divorce law.  In a sense we have to wait until, hopefully, through the force of the arguments that will come through and of the evidence and statistics which will come through and of the sheer human misery of so many people caught up in situations that they cannot get any legal redress for, that the thrust of all this over the next year will result in a majority at least, if not a consensus, of Members agreeing to amend the Constitution.  But I would hope that the amendment of the Constitution that will result from this committee on marital breakdown will not just simply be a deletion of the prohibition on divorce: I hope it will be a redefining of the family for the purposes of the family rights under the Constitution and the whole structure of approach to families and the relationship between parents and children and the type of society which we want to have for a very young and growing population and that we will not be afraid of the issues that we will have to discuss and not have preconceptions of what is the norm.  The norm is not fixed and rigid; it is a matter of looking at the values in our society and also the extent to which, to a certain extent, those values are changing and adapting.  Rather than consider any change in this area as a totally negative thing we should look at the real situation and face up to it and ensure that our laws are helpful and supportive in this area and not negative and destructive.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating my warm welcome for the establishment of these committees and the structured opportunity that they will afford to Members of both Houses and to those working in these areas in Irish society who have for a very long time wondered why the Dáil and Seanad are so slow and so obtuse and <Col N="815" /> so incomprehensively unaware of how serious the social problems are in our society and of the critical need for reform.  This is indeed a red letter day.  I would certainly hope that the committees would get off the ground before both Houses rise and will have their first meetings before they adjourn and will come back in early September for further meetings so that substantial work can be done before both Houses come back into session in the autumn.</P>

      <P>These committees are in principle at least most welcome in the sense that there is obviously important work to be done in both areas.  May I record briefly my dissent, to put it mildly, to the extraordinarily inconsistent manner in which the size of committees on Joint Committees have been arrived at. Most of us in politics are supposed to be numerate and since we are, among other things, given charge of regulating the economy of the country which is effectively measured by numbers.  I would have thought that some basis for arriving at the numbers and the membership of committees would not be beyond the wit, imagination or indeed the calculation of those who do these things.  So, like many other people I should like to know wherein lies the offending individual or individuals who choose the size, scale and the numbers of these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to talk on the committee on women and the role of women in society because it needs to be stressed over and over again that in the context of this House, the assumptions made very often in the business of this House and the assumptions made very often by politicians in their own lives understandably are a direct antithesis of the values that a society which regarded women as equal participants in society would espouse. We do not really believe in this House that women's problems are as important as the problems which bedevil the male half of society.  I have mentioned this before and I am mentioning it again and this criticism is as much directed against myself as anybody else: on the occasion in the the Members' Bar in this House <Col N="816" /> when a vote of no confidence in the previous Government was being debated after the news on the television &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; came on and everybody turned down the volume of their own conversations and the television was turned up to watch what we assumed would be yet another programme about ourselves and our affairs and our spectacle and so on and we were all fascinated.  It turned out to be only a programme about rape in which case the television was turned down again and all of us, including myself and some prominent female Members of the Oireachtas turned back to our discussions about our own internal preoccupations.</P>
    <P>I say that as much in criticism of myself as anybody else but that is where we politicians have to begin our analysis of our real attitudes to the role of women in society because it is in those instinctive responses that we demonstrate the conditioning and values of generations. There are of course a whole host of areas of practicality that have not even begun to be approached in terms of equality in society.  One in particular that needs to be reiterated again and again is the relative levels of payment of women and men in manufacturing industry.  It is still a fact that women earn only about two-thirds of what men earn in industry and that is after years of equal pay legislation and after years of commitment to the idea of equality.</P>
    <P>So, in this country we seem to be very willing to espouse equality except where hard cash is involved and this criticism applies as much to the trade union movement in many cases as it does to employers. I suspect that deep in the hearts of many of my colleagues in the trade union movement is a firm conviction that after all they are only women and their husbands are probably working also.  If it is a widow, she will also have a pension and therefore you do not find the type of passion that one would expect in an area of such obvious discrimination and inequity and equality as one would expect from a crusading organisation like the trade union movement generally.</P>
    <P>An even more appalling area of neglect and one that I hope this committee will <Col N="817" /> direct its attention towards is the huge host of unorganised women in the work force, the whole mushrooming service industry, the catering industry, fast food industry and all the areas where trade union organisations rarely penetrate and where women are coping with the most appalling working conditions for the most appallingly low wages in many cases.  And we have not even begun to talk about it. Let it be said again and again that an economic recession is not a justification for any perpetration of structural injustice. If there is a limited cake available in a society and the cake is not getting bigger then that is not a justification for perpetrating inequality.  Therefore if women are badly paid in large areas of our society then it is not good enough to say &ldquo;Wait until next year,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wait till growth resumes.&rdquo;  People in employment are entitled to be given proper living and working conditions.  That is as much the fault of the trade union movement which shows a singular lack of enthusiasm for organising these huge areas of employed people as it is of anybody else.  The position of women within the social welfare code is well documented at this stage but it is still a fact and nothing so far has been done about it.  In particular, there is the extraordinary fact that in most areas it is very difficult for a woman to get any legal access to her husband's social welfare payments if he is still living in the home. The extraordinary justification for that that I have had put to me is: &ldquo;Well if you were to try to take it from him he would probably run away and then we would have to get a maintenance order and so forth.&rdquo;  I do not believe that if the position was reversed that a virtually 90 per cent male Legislature would dismiss the issues so simply.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that in a peculiar and particular way women are victims of poverty in our society.  This is an area which is not particularly referred to in the terms of reference but I think in terms of any examination of the role of women and the injustices towards women in society it is important that this committee should identify that section of women who are poor in a particular way because they are women and are poor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> It is a fact, for instance, that women live longer than men and therefore among our old people there will be a far higher proportion of women and all the appalling injustices that we do to our old people particularly affect women.  We have the extraordinary collection of social conventions which means that, for instance, a widower will have plenty of access to social activity.  He will be able to go to pubs, golf clubs and to various places on his own.  A widow, on the other hand, is debarred by social convention from many of these things.  It is not as easy for an unattached widow to get involved in social life again.  We create a whole series of mystiques around women which at the end of it all do more harm than good to women and leave them detached and isolated from society and when they are, as they usually are, left on their own since 70 per cent of women are predeceased by their husbands, we leave them with what was conceptually a position of elevation but in fact it excludes them from most social activities.</P>
    <P>Women are in a special way the victims of unemployment.  They tend to be in the areas of employment which are most vulnerable to recession.  They tend to be in the areas of employment which are poorly paid and also they tend to be the ones who very often have to hold a family together on the pittance of an income that people on unemployment assistance receive and therefore again in that area of poverty women suffer in a particular way.  I mentioned it earlier and I will just refer to it again: women suffer in particular from one of the most appalling forms of isolation and deprivation that urban society can generate and that is loneliness because of the things I have just referred to.  Women in particular are afflicted by loneliness.  A committee like this must look at male attitudes to women in a fairly critical light.  It has for instance become unfashionable in this country, probably as a reaction to the idiocies of a previous generation to talk any more about pornography.  We have decided more or less that because of the appallingly stupid things we did in the past we are now going to pretend that we are fashionable and liberal and trendy and <Col N="819" /> pretend that pornography does not exist. Pornography is an offence against women.  Fundamentally it is an offence to treat women as sexual objects; it is corrupt, decadent and materialistic and harmful to women.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for anybody in Irish politics or in Irish society to do otherwise than take exception to pornography.  We all have our definitions of pornography and I and the Society to Outlaw Pornography would have very different definitions. That is not to get away from the fact that pornography is an offence against women and we have no reason to believe that there is some sort of absolute canon of liberalism which makes all forms of pornography acceptable in the interest of something.  It is an offence against women and it encourages a very unpleasant male attitude towards women.</P>
    <P>The fact that after years of work by the Rape Crisis Centre it is still very difficult to persuade the Department of Justice that a woman who has been raped should if possible be examined by a female doctor is an indicator of our insensitivity towards women.  There is a story that can be told about at least one of the doctors who was until recently involved in Dublin in dealing with victims of rape which would horrify one and yet it seems to be difficult to get this simple message through.  There is no major issue of policy involved but it is an area where men never have to suffer the sort of trauma and pain that are involved and yet we do not seem to be able to get that simple message through.  We have an enormously long distance to go.</P>
    <P>It would be an interesting &mdash; but I suspect it will not happen &mdash; challenge to this committee to look at the role of women in the major institutions in our society and the role and attitude of the major institutions to women.  I have already mentioned the trade union movement. I have already mentioned politicians. It would be an interesting challenge if this committee were to look at the attitudes of the Churches, who are a major institution in our society, to women.  It would be a major and quite revolutionary undertaking and one that <Col N="820" /> is badly needed both within the Churches and outside them.  I suspect it will not happen but sooner or later all the Churches will be forced either by the pressure of women from within the Church or the absence of women from the Churches to face up to their responsibilities to women.  I suspect it will be more the latter, that is their absence than the form of their activities that will persuade the Churches to do so.</P>
    <P>I would envisage two different complementary roles for the committee on women's affairs, one, to work for the whole myriad of legislative changes and indeed probably constitutional changes that are necessary if there is to be genuine equality between the sexes, secondly, to work towards the change in male attitudes towards women, the sort of things I talked about before, the sniggering that goes on in male company about women that we all need to grow out of.  There is a major educational and value-changing role which will not be achieved in a short period but without which we can have no real equality.</P>
    <P>The committee on marital breakdown is of course extremely welcome but the primness of the language in the terms of reference must be astonishing to the 70,000 people that we know to be victims of marital breakdown.  It must be even more astonishing to all the run-of-the-mill politicians, backbenchers like myself who chase all over the country and who will now tell you that consistently week in, week out at their clinics one of the most important and most difficult and most intractable problems they are running into is marital breakdown.  The way the terms of reference are written one would think that this was an emerging problem affecting a small number of people under very isolated circumstances instead of being probably the biggest social problem, after unemployment, facing this country, the fact that marriages are breaking down in large numbers and at an increasing rate.  Probably if we ever get the figures people will be horrified.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before here what Fr. Fergal O'Connor said about ten years ago. In 25 per cent of Irish marriages, in his estimation, husband and wife do not talk <Col N="821" /> to each other.  We are not talking in prim language about a minor problem.  We are talking about a huge social problem.  It is extraordinary that, in the terms of reference, the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; cannot be mentioned. Apparently if it was mentioned a large section of the Oireachtas would not have accepted this committee.  I do not have any great enthusiasm for divorce.  I have even less enthusiasm for fudging issues and pretending that problems can be solved by ignoring them.  If somebody could convince me that he had a way of solving the problem of marital breakdown which did not involve the introduction of divorce, or at least the deletion of the constitutional clause on divorce, I would listen very carefully.</P>
    <P>I am quite conservative about attitudes to marriage, the stability of marriage and the responsibility of people who undertake marriage and in particular bring children into the world.  Those who most vigorously defend that Article of the Constitution seem to be singularly lacking in realism about the scale of the problem, in imagination about how to tackle it, and in compassion for the people who are the victims of that horrible situation. As we have done so often before we drive it underground.</P>
    <P>I hope these committees are successful. I hope that women's rights in one case and marriage breakdown in the other case will be the major items on the agenda, not political point-scoring, not an attempt to display who is most committed to the defence of the Irish family unit in the face of alleged onslaughts from materialistic secularism and that sort of nonsense.  I hope compassion will be the guiding light of the committee on marriage breakdown.  I hope a broad vision of Irish society, and not just a narrow view about a couple of issues, will dominate the committee on women's affairs. In conclusion, it would be extremely regrettable if women only were to take an interest in the committee on women's affairs.  The problems of women in Irish society as I have often said here before are as much the problems of men in Irish society.</P>

      <P>A properly equal society in which women and men were treated totally and properly as equal and complementary would be to the enrichment of both sexes.  It is not so much a question of one section of society achieving their rights as of both sections of society achieving their full development.  That is what the development of women is about.  It is as much about the development of men as it is about the development of women.  I hope the committee on women's affairs does begin to attack some of the fundamental questions of values and attitudes that underlie the whole inequality of women in Irish society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a brief intervention in this debate.  The motions are concerned with the establishment of the last two of nine committees. The two committees we are setting up now are certainly as important as any others and in my view more important than some.  It has been a matter of very distinct concern to all those interested in the subject matter of these two committees that long delays and uncertainties were encountered along the way.  We can all be grateful that we are here this evening to establish the two committees.</P>
      <P>There is one point that I would like to deal with very briefly because I do not think it would be fair to leave it to the Minister of State to deal with as part of her reply.  This relates to the question of numbers.  To the best of my knowledge of what has occurred in this particular regard, the Minister of State carried no responsibility for the reduction in numbers in regard to these two committees. Senator McGuinness said that she was disappointed in regard to the question of numbers generally on our nine committees, particularly disappointed with the number of Senators and most particularly the number of Senators on these last two committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of these numbers generally, the original proposals for this new committee system brought forward by Deputy John Bruton the standard <Col N="823" /> committee size was nine Members of Dáil Éireann and seven Members of Seanad Éireann.  The first thing we must note about this distribution is that in fact it is generous to Seanad Éireann, virtually an equality even though there are only 60 Members in Seanad Éireann and 166 Members in Dáil Éireann.  I commented at an early stage of the discussions that even these numbers might well be increased.  It was decided not to do so and there were two reasons for this.  Both these reasons are important.  It is certainly my earnest hope that the committees we have set up in recent weeks and are setting up today will be very different committees from Oireachtas committees in the past.  If they are not we are wasting our time.  On the last occasion we discussed the establishment of committees, Members of this House mentioned the difficulties of finding a quorum, of people coming into committees staying for a short while and then leaving, and so on. It is the intention of Deputy John Bruton that we should try to get away from that. Therefore it was the intention in these proposals that have come forward that a Member of the Oireachtas should, except in special circumstances, serve only on one Oireachtas committee, so that a person would have a commitment to the work of his or her House of the Oireachtas and also a commitment to one committee. If we are to improve the performance of Oireachtas committees this is a necessary thing, a serious commitment to one committee rather than one divided between more than one committee.</P>
    <P>If we take it from that point of view, and I think it is a reasonable one, and if we look at the overall numbers proposed for Seanad Éireann, we find in fact that of the places available on the nine joint committees there are 59 Seanad places. We allow the Cathaoirleach to remain in his isolation.  Very few Senators will be on two, but by and large, every Member of this House will be assigned to one committee and one committee only.  This is the intention, as I understand it from various conversations I have had over the last few months, in regard to the size of the committees generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> Equally, we should look at the type of the committee that would thus be formed.  If we had every one of our committees consisting of nine Deputies and seven Senators we then get a committee of 16.  If we say that is insufficient then it should be substantially increased.  We would get committees of quite a different type.  If you take a committee of 25 persons, the group dynamic of the way in which that committee tackles its job is very different from that of a committee of 12 to 15 or 16 members.  Once again we are looking for a particular type of committee.  Concentration of commitment and a size that will enable committees to deal not merely with a superficial survey of the topics entrusted to them but a really deep examination.  Certainly in the committees that we are concerned with here this evening, nothing but deep examination, nothing but hard commitment to the committee, is going to bring the result that we hope will come from these committees.</P>
    <P>If we look at the number of committees and we try to think of how these committees are going to do a first class job, I do not think that there is that much wrong with either the total numbers of members or with the division between Dáil Members and Seanad Members.  We can be satisfied with the number of Senators except for the two committees that we are discussing here this evening and except for the Committee on State-sponsored Bodies.  I want to say quite frankly I think the responsibility for these lower numbers does not lie with the Minister of State and it does not lie with the Government. The Government would have been content with the original numbers nine Deputies and seven Senators in this regard.  I do not want to go any further than that.  I do think that in fairness to the Minister for State I should say what I have said.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the question of the workings of these committees.  I have already mentioned that I consider them committees of great importance. Indeed I hope to serve on one of these two committees myself in which case I hope to have plenty to say about the scope of that particular committee and <Col N="825" /> about the work it has to do.  I would like now as a senior Member of this House to say that I am glad that I am here to see these committees established and will be gladder still when I see these committees report and I will be happiest of all when I see the recommendations of the committes implemented and achieving a real reform in Irish society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it was remiss of me that I did not get in at an earlier stage. A shock, though it may seem, I warmly welcome these two committees.  The Leader of the House talked about the composition being nine and seven, and that gives this side of the House only two or three members.  I will be serving on one.  I did not get the chance to serve on the two.  I totally agreed with Senator Dooge when he said you should opt for the committees to which you know you can give your full time and commitment. Where my parliamentary party were concerned I did not opt for any other than the one on health.  I already have a place on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have now taken one of the places on the marital breakdown committee. I am glad to tell the Minister that, while it took a bit of chat to get them to agree to these committees there is total and absolute support within our party for the setting up of them.  It would be wrong to go into all the different details of what might be the end result.  I and other members of my party have taken their places on both committees.  We will participate and we will help in any way we can.</P>
      <P>Since nobody formally welcomed the setting up of the two committees on behalf of Fianna Fáil I do so sincerely now.  I do this as one of the conservatives in this House.  Having served for so long in public life I have to see what is real out there, and I am doing that also.  I wish both of those committees well.  For the Minister's sake, for ours and, indeed, for the sake of all the people of this nation on behalf of my party I do hope we will work together and that the end result will help everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put on record to my unequivocal welcome for <Col N="826" /> the establishment of these joint committees both on women's rights and on marriage breakdown.  I was very interested to hear Senator Honan indicate that perhaps our reaction to her welcome might be one of shock.  It is indicative of how far along the road we have travelled when a self-confessed conservative like Senator Honan welcomes with such warmth and evident determination the establishment of these committees and sees their necessity in the modem day Ireland for which we are in the business of legislating.</P>
      <P>I was also intrigued to hear that in her party they felt it necessary to have a little bit more chat about these committees, which is a very nice way of dealing with prevarication and delay about which some of us who felt extremely impatient about the establishment of these committees were perhaps less charitable in our private moments.  It would be unkind of me at this historic moment to hark back to that delay.  I certainly welcome most warmly the establishment of these joint committees.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State who is here at the historic setting up of these joint committees made what I would consider to be a very hard hitting speech.  It certainly grasped some of the nettles which I feel this committee will be in the business of grasping.  She also said that in the past we have very rarely given a lead.  I consider the lack of leadership which public representatives have shown in this area as a great weakness in the past.  Because of their size and composition those committees will have a very strong commitment and determination to pursuing these areas.  I feel that we are going to see leadership and we are going to see these committees given a lead in the area of public opinion.  This I am very glad of, and I hope the recommendations which they bring forward will be backed very speedily by legislation which will implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I liked the reference Senator Robinson made to a White Paper followed by a legislative programme covering a couple of years.  This is important.  I should hate to think that there would be any evidence of betrayal of women and betrayal of those who are involved in marital breakdown <Col N="827" /> in these committees if we did not have this follow through of legislative change.  I should hate to think that these reports and recommendations would be filed under &ldquo;miscellaneous&rdquo;, and left to gather dust for years to come and that it was just an exercise in verbal waffle.  I hope very dearly that I will be honoured to be given a place on one of these committees and that there will be a follow through.  That is significant.</P>
    <P>There has been very much discrimination against women in the past.  When you think that, for so many years women were on the outside of Leinster House, knocking at the door, begging for recognition, it certainly points up all the change that has occurred when we women in this Chamber and in the Dáil Chamber are able to stand on our feet and welcome the establishment of these historic committees.  It is indicative of the pace and the change in Irish society that this has come about, and it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in a time of recession that there would be a lunge towards fundamentalism. I have noticed in areas where there is a particular emphasis on the crisis in unemployment, that when unemployment is being discussed, the old shibboleths and old discriminations rear their heads.  It is suggested that married women should get back into their homes again and their right to work, which is a basic fundamental human right, is to some extent under threat because of the economic situation.  I do not like to see that.  We had a debate on it in this House and it caused a certain ripple.</P>
    <P>This is something the committees will have to keep a very close eye on.  Because we are in an economic recession, women should not become the casualties of the tragedy of unemployment with which we are all trying to cope.  A structured opportunity now exists to discuss these problems and, certainly, looking at the area of marriage breakdown, there is no doubt in my mind that, following the debate we had in the House on this issue, there is a very strong recognition and realisation among Senators that marriage breakdown is a reality, and is one of the very <Col N="828" /> great tragedies of our time.  Even our conservative Senator Honan has gone on record as recognising the fact that marital breakdown is a reality and that we must be prepared to recognise it, and to face up to it, and to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Time is running out and I realise the Minister would like to reply to the debate.  Once again I warmly welcome the establishment of both these committees. They are vital and necessary, and they give relevance to this House, and the other House of the Oireachtas, and to all those people out there who are looking to us with a feeling of expectation that we will recognise the problems and that we will get on with the business of doing something about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I do not share the great enthusiasm that I have felt amongst all sides of the House for these two committees.  The Seanad has shown once again an extraordinary capacity to congratulate itself on something. If we were to achieve something that would be much more useful.  I was brought up in a school which believed, strangely, that Governments were meant to govern.  I do not believe that these all-party committees will achieve a great deal.  It has taken three months already for these all-party committees to be set up, even for their terms of reference to be set up.  That in itself is a great problem. We are now delayed on the marital breakdown report by one year.  I see in the terms of reference &mdash; and there is great distinction in the terms of reference of the two committees which are being set up &mdash; that the committee on marital breakdown is to report in one year &mdash; to report.  The committee on women's affairs is to propose legislation and to recommend.  On that there is no limit. There is no time limit for the report on the one that is to do specific things, but on the one which is not to do such specific things, there is a time limit.  There is a significance in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the composition of the committees.  A very odd thing has happened here.  The Independents who have led the fight on marital breakdown, who were the only <Col N="829" /> people to put down a motion in this House on marital breakdown, have no inherent right to a place on this committee. I do not know what is going to happen about this but, as the numbers stand at the moment, those who have led the fight for divorce, and those who have been eager to debate marital breakdown, have absolutely no right to sit on this committee.  It may be that an arrangement can be made that an Independent can actually sit on the committee as it stands.  It is utterly wrong that as of the setting up of this committee, no Independent who is part of a group which had the greatest input into this subject is on the committee.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why, on the marital breakdown committee, the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; cannot be mentioned.  That is the crux of the matter.  I cannot understand why the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; was not mentioned in the Minister's speech, because this is the crux of the marital breakdown committee.  There is no point in giving us platitudes about the protection of marriage and family life and examining the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage and reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas thereon, and then going on to talk about legislative or constitutional changes.  If that means divorce, why can we not say so?</P>
    <P>What we are talking about is divorce. If we are not talking about divorce, let us say we are not talking about divorce.  One way or the other let us be realistic about it.  Let us not refer it in a self-congratulatory way to a committee which will report to the Houses of the Oireachtas and then that report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have absolutely no guarantee of any legislative action afterwards.  The committee is not even meant to make recommendations about legislation, according to its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I should like the Government &mdash; if they are a Government &mdash; to say: &ldquo;Yes.  We will go ahead and do something about these things ourselves.&rdquo;  If there is discrimination against women, which there is, it is patently wrong.  We do not need a committee to sit <i>ad infinitum</i> to tell us that.  If there is discrimination it should <Col N="830" /> be legislated against.  If divorce is right, it should be introduced.  We do not need a committee to sit for a year and possibly produce platitudes.  The Government can then sit on the report which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>These committees are, unfortunately, a great let-out for those who recognise this as a problem.  These committees will come up with very watery conclusions. The last all-party committee on the Constitution, which was a very thorny subject, reported on this issue and nothing was done about it, as on several other issues.  The Government should be giving a lead here, and not kicking these two very sensitive subjects away to committees, and leaving them for at least one year with a great sigh of relief.</P>

      <P>Having heard Senator Ross speaking just now, I want to express a view that, is important.  I compliment the people who drafted this motion, and the Minister in particular, for laying emphasis on the role of the women who work at home. The impression is given or taken that only women who go out to work daily have problems.  Many women who stay at home are very happy at home and have a very important role in looking after children and husbands.  Unfortunately, some women are not happy at home. They must be taken into consideration. I am glad to see that there is a good deal in the Minister's speech dealing with women in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is where I want to refer to what Senator Ross said.  I am glad the terms of reference for the committee on marriage breakdown are to consider the protection of marriage and the family life.  The idea will run rife that this is a committee on setting up divorce in Ireland.  There are some people who quite genuinely feel that divorce is needed immediately. <Col N="831" /> There are others to whom it is complete anathema.  An examination of marriage breakdown is very important and must be done in a positive way, and not in a negative way.  Using the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; can often prejudice people in advance. There are problems which, if tackled properly, might prevent many marriage breakdowns: housing, finance and young marriages.  People are getting married so young now that they find it difficult to stay together.  You want a certain maturity for marriage, and a certain toughness. It is not all love all the way.</P>
    <P>I hope that this committee will do good work.  Half of the population are women, and half of the married couples women. There may be discrimination against men in many ways but, if we are to have a happy population, the other half of the population must see that they are getting justice and that we are looking after their problems.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Senators who contributed to the debate this evening.  This morning, because of the last minute features of the agreement to the terms of reference, we did not have time for a debate.  I was sorry about that, because I know there are many people in the other House who wanted to contribute to the debate on both these committees.  I am certainly very pleased to hear the comments here this evening.  They will help me.  Many positive points were made.  I am sorry Senator Robinson is not here at the moment.  I am quite sure neither of these committees will fall smugly into any particular area, or overlook any vital aspect of either marital breakdown or women's affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with another point she made with regard to the publicising of the fact that the committees have been established. I know there is a great deal of public interest in the committees.  In fact, for me it has been a stop-start project to the extent that many people have phoned me and contacted me to know when the motions would be moved in the Dáil or in the Seanad because they would like to <Col N="832" /> come in to hear the debate.  Therefore, there is a lot of public interest.  I do not intend to go into any of the details of what they will be dealing with but I hope the committees will be publicised, particularly the committee on women's rights, in prominent areas where women will see it.  This need not necessarily be in the main dailies, but in places like the women's magazines, and so on.  It is important to make the information readily accessible for them.</P>
    <P>Another point made several times was the fact that there is no time limit on the women's committee.  I hope that committee will be making interim reports and will be consulted and consultative and work very much along with me in my Department.  There will be no stagnation in legislative programmes or policies because of the existence of the committees.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment I have listened in this House to very eloquent debates on the issues relevant to the committees. Every politician who has been elected to either House of the Oireachtas knows that the issues of marital breakdown and women's rights need special and sustained consideration.  It will take more than eloquent speeches for us to get our programme and planning together and seriously take these two issues on board in the Dáil and in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any time will be wasted.  I feel very happy that I am in politics at a time when these working committees are being set up.  I am very happy with the welcome they have received and I thank Senators sincerely for that.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to continue with the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill.  There has been some discussion with the Whips and it would appear to be the general view that the Committee Stage of that Bill could also be taken tomorrow.  After that, it is intended to take the motions on the 19th and 20th reports on developments within the EEC.  It is proposed to take them at 2 p.m., if not reached earlier.</P>
