      <P>I have notice from Senator Lanigan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposed to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The problems being created for public authorities throughout the country due to casual trading.</P>
      <P>I rule that this matter is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds that it involves criticism of or the advocating of legislation.</P>

      <P>The longer I remain in this Chamber the more I learn.  The unfortunate part about the learning process is that it is not until you put down a motion in the House that you find out that there is an inhibition on the discussion of a motion of this nature.  I cannot understand how any motion on the Adjournment that I have heard has not been in some way critical of a particular piece of legislation or of something that is included in legislation.  The situation here is that right throughout&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Merchant Shipping (Light Dues) Bill, 1983: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan) John F. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Transport by order to give a statutory <Col N="131" /> basis for the levels of light dues collected in respect of ships calling to ports within the State and to enable him to vary the levels of light dues from time to time.</P>
      <P>The provision and maintenance of the lights services, comprising lighthouses, beacons, buoys, and other aids required for general maritime navigation, around the coasts of Britain and Ireland, including Northern Ireland, are governed by the provisions of sections 634 to 669 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, as adapted.  The Act vested responsibility for the lights services in three bodies known as general lighthouse authorities.</P>
      <P>The three general lighthouse authorities are Trinity House, London, which has responsibility for the lights services throughout England, Wales and the Channel Islands, and also the adjacent seas and islands; the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses whose responsibility extends throughout Scotland, its adjacent seas and islands and the Isle of Man; and the Commissioners of Irish Lights who are responsible for the light services throughout the 32 counties of Ireland and its adjacent seas and islands.  The 1894 Act also confirmed the three authorities in the ownership of the lights and other property held and maintained by them.</P>
      <P>Local harbour lights, buoys and other navigational aids, which are used only by vessels entering or leaving a particular harbour or pier, are provided and maintained by the individual harbour authority or other local body concerned, subject only to the technical supervision of the appropriate general lighthouse authority.</P>
      <P>While the lights in the three areas are separately owned and managed by the three general lighthouse authorities, who have wide discretion in local matters, the whole system of lights around the coasts of Britain and Ireland is administered as a single self-supporting financial unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All ships using ports in Britain or in Ireland, except those specifically exempted, pay light dues on a uniform scale, fixed by the British Department of Trade, to the general lighthouse authority within whose areas of jurisdiction the ports lie.  Light dues in respect of vessels <Col N="132" /> calling to ports within the State are collected by local customs officers, acting as agents of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  They are remitted via the Department of Transport to the British Department of Trade, by whom they are paid, together with the light dues collected by the two other lighthouse authorities, into a statutory General Lighthouse Fund established under the Merchant Shipping (Mercantile Marine Fund) Act, 1898. Expenditure incurred by the three general lighthouse authorities is met from this fund.</P>
    <P>The fixing or altering of the level of light dues is governed by the Merchant Shipping (Mercantile Marine Fund) Act, 1898, as adapted.  Section 5 (2) of that Act provides that light dues may be altered by Government order.  Since the foundation of the State, however, the practice has been that the light dues fixed from time to time by the British Department of Trade have been applied on an administrative basis to vessels calling to ports within the State.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the anomalous position of the Commissioners of Irish Lights was raised by the British Comptroller and Auditor General in his report for the years 1979-80 and 1980-81, in which he drew attention to the fact that there was no legal basis for the collection of light dues in the State at rates in excess of those in operation in 1922.  He also referred to the loss of revenue to the General Lighthouse Fund by virtue of the fact that since Ireland joined the European Monetary System on 13 March 1979, light dues had been collected in Irish pounds as though they were equivalent to pounds sterling.</P>
    <P>Preliminary discussions took place last year between the British Department of Trade and my Department about various legal and financial anomalies of the situation of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  It was agreed at the time that the whole complex question of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and their relationship with the British and Irish authorities should be the subject of further bilateral discussions after the matter had been considered by the Department of Transport in consultation with other Government <Col N="133" /> Departments and other interests concerned.  It was also agreed in principle that light dues charged at Irish ports should be fixed as soon as possible at a level in Irish currency equivalent in value to the sterling rate fixed in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General, who has been consulted by the Department of Transport, has confirmed that there is no statutory basis for the charging of light dues at Irish ports at a level in excess of that prevailing at the time of the transfer of powers from Britain to Ireland in 1922. It is necessary, therefore, to take steps to remedy this position and, as already mentioned, that is one of the purposes of this Bill &mdash; the other being to enable the Minister to vary the levels of light dues from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the provisions in the Merchant Shipping (Mercantile Marine Fund) Act, 1898, whereby light dues may be altered by Government order.  Section 5(3) of that Act provides, however, that, before any such order is made, the draft order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for not less than 30 sitting days and may be rejected by resolution of either House.  Because of the excessive delay which would be involved in following the procedure laid down in the 1898 Act, the Government decided to introduce the present Bill for the purpose of amending and updating the relevant provisions of the 1898 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short one and is primarily of an enabling nature.  Section 2 of the Bill will empower the Minister for Transport to make an order amending the scales, rules and exemptions set out in the Second Schedule to the 1898 Act for the levying of light dues, with retrospective effect to the date of introduction of this Bill.  The purpose of the retrospective clause is to prevent a shipowner from claiming that he was not obliged until the ministerial order was made to pay light dues at a level higher than that existing in 1922.  Under section 2(4) any such order will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in the customary manner. Section 3 provides for the repeal of certain parts of section 5 of the 1898 Act which will become redundant once this Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="134" /> I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House wish that this Bill should go through as quickly as possible.  It is an enabling Bill and, as has been said by the Minister, it gives the Oireachtas the means of collecting fees which up to now it had not the legal right to do, as it would appear that they were being collected under a Bill of 1922, and that any fees that had been collected up to now had not been legally collected.  It should be said, during the passage of this Bill, that great credit is due to the people who have worked the Irish Lights throughout the years and it is also worthy of the statement that the Irish Lights Commissioners deal with the lights services throughout the 32 counties of Ireland.  There is no doubt that the people who have operated the lights services since the State was founded have done a tremendous job. They now see, by virtue of the fact that the lighthouses were originally placed in inaccessible areas and in seas which are extremely dangerous, that very many families had to suffer because members of lighthouse staffs were away from home for very many months in times of very rough conditions.  Now that most of the lighthouses are automatically operated, the workload of the lighthouse keepers is not as great as it was but, nevertheless, they still have to maintain the automatic lights right around our coasts.  The people who operate shipping within our coastal areas know the dangers of our coastlines and I am sure that they will not disagree if this Bill goes through unamended.</P>
      <P>The draft order up to now suggested that under the 1898 Act 30 days would have to elapse before an order could be made.  I am glad to see, by virtue of the passing of this Bill, that whatever charges need to be levied can now be levied and that the operation of the lighthouse service right around our coasts will continue to be operated in the excellent manner in which it has been up to now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like Senator Lanigan, would like to welcome this Bill.  It is enabling legislation which is important in <Col N="135" /> that for so long this country has not kept pace with developments in this area.  I am fortunate, in making my contribution today, in that for some time I was a Commissioner of the Irish Lights.  I know the way in which that body operate their services.  Their extraordinary efficiency and the way in which they deal with their work are exemplary.  They have a tremendous relationship with the British lights authorities and we have been fortunate to have adopted as part of our system the standards that are operated there.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that in the short time that this Seanad has been sitting we have had two very interesting Bills, one the Statute Law Revision Bill which came before this House a few weeks ago and today this Merchant Shipping (Light Dues) Bill, 1983, which cover a very long period of time in which this State has been apparently totally inactive in relation to the need to update our law and to become responsible in areas which have, over time, got very much out of control, or out of control of this Oireachtas.  This Bill is to be welcomed on that note alone.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that even having the advice of the Attorney General, who has been consulted by the Department of Transport and by the Minister, we have at present no statutory basis at all for charging light dues at Irish ports in excess of the 1922 level.  There is need to enable the Minister and the Department, in due consultation with the Houses of the Oireachtas, to bring in varying fees and dues for the various installations around our ports, and to allow this Oireachtas to play a much greater role in the development of the various facilities around our coastline and, obviously, outside the jurisdiction of the port authorities who already take care of the situation, such as the Port and Docks Board do in Dublin. It is necessary that the input from this Oireachtas be brought to bear in a supportive capacity to the very considerable and excellent work of the Commissioners of Irish Lights to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most fascinating, enjoyable and interesting experiences for most commissioners is to be able to take off in the Irish Lights vessel and travel around <Col N="136" /> the coastline to see the installations as they are.  However, my period as commissioner was not long enough to enable me to do that.  The previous uncertainty in this area is now being reduced and we are now becoming statutorily involved.  I welcome this Bill and presumably the enabling legislation will ensure that the Minister will, in the near future, look at the levels of light used, at the development of facilities around the coastline and ensure a much better system and a much more supportive role by the State to the Commissioners of Irish Lights.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senators Lanigan and FitzGerald for their contributions to this Bill.  Were it not for the fact that this legislation is necessary, we would not bring it before the Seanad on this occasion. I thank Senators for their co-operation. Senator FitzGerald mentioned that he did not get an opportunity to go around our coastline and have a personal view of all the buoys, beacons <i>et cetera</i>, which are in operation.  I think that the Lord Mayor of Dublin is automatically a member of the Commissioner of Irish Lights, so, if we have the Senator as Lord Mayor of Dublin again, I hope he will get an opportunity to do exactly that.</P>

    <Title>Courts-Martial Appeals Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I apologise for keeping the House.  My officers were under the impression that the Bill was third on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which is a major reforming measure in so far as the administration of <Col N="137" /> military law is concerned has two main objectives.  Firstly, it provides for the setting up of a new appeal court &mdash; to be styled the Courts-Martial Appeal Court &mdash; which will hear appeals against conviction by courts-martial.  It also provides for the introduction of a scheme of free legal aid for accused persons in court-martial cases and on appeal.</P>
    <P>Under the system of military law in this country there is at present no provision for an appeal to a higher tribunal by persons convicted by court-martial.  Such persons may, however, petition the Minister against the findings or against the findings and sentence.  The Minister, where it appears to him that the proceedings of the court-martial were illegal, must quash the finding and may at the same time direct that the accused be tried again.  Where it appears to the Minister that the accused was wrongfully convicted he may quash the finding of guilty. Provision also exists whereby the Minister or the Adjutant-General may mitigate or remit, in whole or in part, punishments awarded by a court-martial.</P>
    <P>Where a petition to the Minister raises a point of law the proceedings of the court-martial and the petition are referred to the Attorney General for his advice as to any action which it might be proper for the Minister to take under the powers vested in him in relation to the quashing of findings and mitigation or remission of sentences.  The petition procedure stemmed from the deliberations of a committee of legal experts set up by the then Minister for Defence in 1951 in the context of the passage of the Bill which became the Defence Act, 1954. The terms of reference of the committee were, and I quote:</P>
    <P>to consider the question whether it is necessary or desirable that a system of appeal from conviction by court-martial should be introduced for the Defence Forces and to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The committee, having considered various options, were against conferring a right of appeal.  They recommended instead that the rules of procedure to be made under the Defence Act should provide <Col N="138" /> for petitions against any of the findings of a court-martial or against the sentence or against both findings and sentence.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the committee were accepted and were implemented after the Bill became law.  I might point out here, since there seems to be an obvious question, that under the Constitution &mdash; specifically Article 38.6º &mdash; courts-martial are not bound by the appellate provisions applicable to the civil courts.</P>
    <P>While I am glad to say that the petition arrangements have worked well, and I believe fairly insofar as the petitioner was concerned, developments in constitutional and international law over the years since they were introduced have made it increasingly clear that it would be both prudent and opportune to establish a judicial appeal for persons convicted by courts-martial.</P>
    <P>The proposed Courts-Martial Appeal Court will be constituted in the same way as the Court of Criminal Appeal and will have powers similar to that court.  The new court will thus be in a position to avail of the services of the judges who, under existing arrangements, may constitute the Court of Criminal Appeal and also to use the machinery of that court. The petition arrangements are being phased out and the appeal procedure will be introduced as soon as practicable.  I should, however, mention that the powers of mitigation and remission to which I referred earlier will remain in force.</P>
    <P>As to the question of setting up a separate appellate system for court-martial appeals instead of using the existing facilities available on the civil side in criminal cases, this matter was fully considered when the legislation was being contemplated. The Government reached the conclusion that because there is a separate <i>corpus</i> of military law and a separate system for its enforcement, that distinctiveness and separateness should be preserved into the appeals arrangements.  It was considered important to maintain the distinction since to merge the two systems at appeal level could be detrimental to both.  There is also, of course, the added <Col N="139" /> advantage that when an appeal arises from a court-martial it may be possible to deal with it more expeditiously because it will have a separate and distinct court in which to be heard.</P>
    <P>In order that the appeal arrangements being provided for in the Bill should be as meaningful as possible I propose also to introduce a scheme of free legal aid for accused persons in court-martial cases and for appeals to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.  The scheme of legal aid outlined in the Bill is similar to that in operation for accused persons on trial on criminal charges in the civil courts.  It is proposed to apply the same criteria as the civil courts both as regards the type of case in which legal aid would be granted and the assessment of means of the applicant for such aid.  Under the proposed arrangements, therefore, the soldier accused before a court-martial will no longer be at a disadvantage by comparison with persons being tried by the civil courts.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that both the Courts-Martial Appeal Court and, where appropriate, the Supreme Court will have power to grant legal aid.  It is not considered practicable to bestow this power on a court-martial as each court-martial is an <i>ad hoc</i> body composed of military officers which is convened specially to try specific charges and dissolves after the trial.  Instead provision is being made for the grant of legal aid at courts-martial and, where applicable, at preliminary proceedings, by a prescribed authority who will be a senior military officer with legal qualifications.  The question of legal aid will, therefore, be decided before the commencement of the court-martial thus avoiding delay or adjournment on this question.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill relating to legal aid are largely self-explanatory. One small point I should like to mention in that connection is that at present any soldier charged with an offence before a court-martial may elect to be represented by an officer subject to military law.  This time honoured practice is completely free to the soldier and I propose to continue it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> As many years have elapsed since the disciplinary provisions of military law as applied to the Defence Forces have been debated it may be helpful if I said something about the jurisdiction of courts-martial and how they function.  Courts-martial are the military tribunals provided under the Constitution for the trial of offences against military law committed by persons while subject to military law.  The detail in relation to such offences and in relation to the constitution and procedures of courts-martial is provided in defence legislation, notably the Defence Act, 1954 and rules of procedure made thereunder.</P>
    <P>Courts-martial are of two classes&mdash; limited and general &mdash; the essential difference in the classes being one of jurisdiction. A general court-martial, as the title implies, has jurisidction to try a person subject to military law for any offence against military law.  The jurisdiction of a limited court-martial is restricted to the trial of non-commissioned personnel and some major offences such as murder are excluded from the jurisdiction.  In this connection, I should mention that a court-martial may, in certain circumstances, try a person subject to military law for an offence which is punishable by the ordinary criminal law of the State.  However, no court-martial can try a person for treason, murder, genocide, manslaughter or rape unless the offence was committed while the person was on active service.</P>
    <P>Courts-martial are convened as required by convening authorities &mdash; in practice senior military officers authorised by warrant of the Minister so to act. For example, each general officer commanding a command is so empowered. The officers who make up the court are appointed by the convening authority. Provision is made for the attendance at each court-martial of a judge-advocate &mdash; normally an officer holding the legal qualification of barrister-at-law &mdash; whose functions include advice to the court-martial on matters of law, summing up of evidence, the recording of the proceedings of the court-martial and ensuring that the accused is given a fair trial.  The prosecutor and the person being tried by <Col N="141" /> the courts-martial may be represented by counsel, meaning either a barrister or a solicitor.</P>
    <P>The findings and sentence of a court-martial are not valid unless confirmed by a confirming authority &mdash; an officer authorised by warrant of the Minister so to act.  In arriving at his decision the confirming authority is fortified by the advice of the judge advocate-general &mdash; a practising barrister-at-law of at least ten years standing who is not a member of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Our system of military law has remained unaltered since the passage of the parent Act in 1954 nearly 30 years ago.  This Bill is proposing major substantive changes in specific areas but the general <i>corpus</i> of military law needs to be reviewed.  I have commenced this review and look forward to introducing in due course whatever further amendments are necessary to bring our military law up to date.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that the military authorities fully support and welcome the present proposals.  Indeed the impartial and efficient manner in which they have administered the system of military law over the years is worthy of special tribute.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the more noteworthy provisions of the Bill.  Sections 5 and 6 amend sections 202 and 203 of the Defence Act.  1954, dealing with findings by courts-martial of unfitness to stand trial by reason of insanity or of guilty but insane.  The arrangements currently provided in those sections are no longer regarded as satisfactory and this opportunity is being taken to revise them.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for the establishment of the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, for its constitution, registrar, sittings and procedure and for the right of appeal to it.  Section 14 provides for the right of the convicted person to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  It also provides that where, on a question of law, an appeal is decided in favour of the appellant, the respondent to the appeal may, without prejudice to the decision in favour of the appellant, refer the question of law to the Supreme Court for determination.  Section 21 provides for the postponement of execution <Col N="142" /> of a sentence of death in the case of an appeal to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.  Section 22 provides that the authority convening the court-martial shall be empowered to defend the appeal.</P>
    <P>Part III contains the provisions for the granting of legal aid certificates and which are analogous to those pertaining to criminal charges on the civil side.  I trust that I have adequately explained the purpose of the Bill and I now commend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a reforming measure and which brings legislation in this area into line with that in most other European countries. Trials by court-martial are relatively few.  I do not know what the numbers are but they are for serious offences only.  There is a summary procedure for trivial offences.  I understand that there is no appeal against these.  Should this be considered?</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the system will more or less correspond with the civil set-up.  The Minister has given his reasons in the other House as to why there should be a separate system.  Under this Bill a Courts-Martial Appeal Court, modelled on the Court of Criminal Appeal and with similar powers, will replace the petition against findings and sentences and the Minister's powers to quash findings and sentences of courts-martial. Provision also exists in the Defence Act, 1954 where under a superior authority, for example, the Minister, the Adjutant-General or other general officer appointed by the Minister for the purpose, may mitigate or remit in whole or in part punishments awarded by a court-martial.  This provision will remain in force.  I understand that whatever about reducing the punishment or sentence, there will be no question of increasing the sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defence legislation does not provide for free legal aid for persons tried by courts-martial.  The Defence Act, 1954, provides that any person being tried by a court-martial may be represented by counsel, namely a barrister-at-law or a solicitor or, if not represented by counsel, by an officer of the Defence Forces subject <Col N="143" /> to military law.  If represented by counsel, the person being tried by a court-martial would be liable for the cost involved.  Representation by an officer of the Defence Forces is free.  Would that representation be by an officer who is also a lawyer?</P>
    <P>It seems strange that even in situations where there was a sentence of death no machinery for an appeal was provided. The Bill is most welcome and I hope that the procedure to introduce the free legal aid scheme will be implemented as soon as possible after the Bill has been passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the provisions being introduced in the Bill.  It is a matter of history that we have had in most countries a parallel system of civil and of military law.  Our Constitution is very jealous in regard to the establishment of courts and the exercise of judicial functions but it does allow, under Article 38.4º, for the establishment of military tribunals.  The reasons why this separation occurs are valid ones.  The Standard International Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences tells us, and I am quoting from the article on military law in that reference work:</P>
      <P>The basic reasons for the existence of a separate system of military justice may be summarised as (1) the need for swift and summary machinery for the maintenance of discipline; (2) the fact that the adjudication of military crimes may require military expertise by the court; and (3) the fact that the armed forces may be stationed abroad, outside the jurisdiction of their country's civil courts.</P>
      <P>So there is a very sound foundation for this dual system of law.  Nevertheless, one would like to see within the course of the development of law that the two systems would operate in parallel.  Therefore, it is indeed welcome that the Bill before us today introduces into our military law certain reforms which have taken place in the civil law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already mentioned that when review was going on in 1954 it was thought that the time was not right <Col N="144" /> for that particular change.  I do not think we should be critical of the decision made at that time, because, in fact, we should recognise that we have here a balance, trying to give all the protection of the civil law to those subject to military law without at the same time introducing elements which will frustrate the reason why there is in existence separate military law. I have already quoted what has been given in a standard reference work on this point.  What we are now faced with is that we are deciding to introduce an appeal procedure.  This is a decision to give an appeal which is very much the same type as the appeal available in civil law.  It is something that outweighs the need for swift and summary military justice and the balance is in favour of making this change.  Equally the second basic reason given for the separate system of military law is that the need for military expertise is now outweighed by this necessity for appeal.  I should like to ask the Minister, perhaps on Committee Stage, whether there might not be occasions when a military assessor might be required as technical assessor to assist the judges of the High Court who would be hearing an appeal.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated to us that our last attempt to legislate in this matter was almost 30 years ago.  It has stood the test of time very well.  Perhaps we should remind ourselves of the fact that the legislation we processed in the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1954 was one of the very first pieces of legislation that adopted the procedure of a special committee discussing in detail the myriad sections of the Bill.  Even the part of that Act that we are dealing with today, Part V, which deals with discipline, contains 134 sections and that is as big as a Bill on its own, yet only part of the Act.  We also had in that year the Statutory Instrument of the Rules of Procedure under that Bill which is another 154 pages.  We have this substantial <i>corpus</i> of law.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that at present there is a review of military law under way; 30 years afterwards this review is being made.  I would ask the Minister that at the conclusion of that review he should consider very carefully the question of <Col N="145" /> whether the legislation he should bring in should not be rather in the form of consolidated legislation; I am not talking about consolidation in the technical sense, I am considering that we should avoid the worst excesses of legislation by reference in regard to the 1954 Act and in regard to the Statutory Instrument on the Rules of Procedure of 1954.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that one can discover in the Oireachtas Library, discover far more easily, what is the position in regard to any particular aspect of military law as regards the United Kingdom than one can in regard to a military law for this country.  Even though we have only one Act and one set of Rules of Procedure it is not that easy to find it.  I say immediately in this regard it is not too difficult either, and I can certainly say it is not as difficult as finding the position in regard to a number of other military regulations because there is a veritable forest in some other areas.  I would hate to think that the relatively consolidated position in regard to military law would be lost when the other various desirable reforms are brought about.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points but I might more appropriately leave those until Committee Stage.  However, I welcome the fact that military law has now been updated with regard to these three aspects of a finding of insanity, in regard to appeal and the provision of legal aid. The Minister and his advisers have done a good day's work in bringing this before us.</P>

If it had not been for recent remarks of the Minister about where he saw our economic, cultural and political interests lying, I would have great pleasure in doing so but since he sees those interests lying with an alliance which murders poor people, rapes and murders nuns in Central America, destabilises countries in Central America and gives succour to the opponents of the oppressed and the poor in this world, I for one regret that at least in his official capacity I can offer no welcome to the Minister who would align us <Col N="146" /> with the murderers of the oppressed and poor in this world.  I regret that and I am sorry to have to say it.</P>

      <P>I have said what I wanted to say on this issue and I have made my position perfectly clear.  This Bill, like all military legislation, contains within it the mystique of armaments and the mystique of the armed forces.  Senator Dooge explained to us the reasons why there is a need for a separate <i>corpus</i> of military law.  There are good and rational reasons for it.  I believe that we have other reasons for having a separate <i>corpus</i> of military law as epitomised by this legislation and that is the whole mystique of the armed forces which is probably psychologically a necessary part of justifying their existence. They have their own rules, legislation, police force and what is called their own codes of honour.  There is a certain element of bravado about the way armed forces advertise themselves and within all that we have to keep them separate from the rest of us.</P>
      <P>What is an army in reality?  They are those who are charged with the obligation of using violence on our behalf to protect that which we regard as necessary to be protected.  They are, without being offensive, our paid killers.  They are the people we pay if necessary to use violence and to kill on our behalf to protect us.  There are those who do a similar duty on our behalf without weapons who get far less of the mystique, our fire-fighters for instance and people like that.  The question should be raised &mdash; apparently it is unacceptable to raise it &mdash; as to why this is?</P>

      <P>The Bill is welcome.  It is obviously a good Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on it and I look forward with some interest, if not with some possible distaste, to his future reforms in this area.

      <P>I differ from my colleague Senator Ryan in his reservations about welcoming the Minister.  I sincerely welcome him.  Having read the script I should be grateful if the Minister would answer some questions I wish to put to him.  I would be grateful also if the Minister would tell me what pressure, though that may be too severe a word, there is on him to bring in this legislation.  I am concerned that the end result of this legislation may not be as good for the person serving in the Irish uniform as is the impression given when one reads this Bill and when one hears about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister bringing in this legislation because of recent events of some of our Army personnel serving outside the nation?  If that is so we will take it a stage further.  Is the Minister happy about the number of our doctors in the Army Medical Corps?  Is he happy about the medical checks on our Army personnel and the force in general?  Maybe some of these persons are serving abroad for too long a period.  Is the Minister satisfied that the <Col N="149" /> medical checks are carried out by people who are experts in psychiatry and that the medical history of persons serving in the corps outside might need closer survey? The Minister is now putting his finger up to his mouth.  One person stopped Senator Ryan and the Minister does this to me but I will continue anyway.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I am concerned that the person who will benefit eventually from this legislation will be the man in the uniform.  I have a horror of the legal profession of this nation and I do not want the unfortunate soldiers to be thrown to their mercy.  Here again I differ from Senator Ryan in my regard for the men who at any time decide to put on the Irish Army uniform.  I have the greatest admiration for them.</P>

      <P>I note that the Courts-Martial Appeal Court have not the power to award costs to a person who has been granted a legal aid certificate so I would like to ask the Minister where is the gain here for the persons I am concerned about?  I am concerned also as to how better off as a result of this Bill will be the private, the corporal or indeed the commissioned officer.  Something that has gone out of the country a little but which is still very much in the Army is the trust of one person in uniform in another.  In the old Courts-Martial Appeal Court a man had at his discretion a choice of officer to defend him.  He went to an officer whom he absolutely trusted to defend him in a court-martial. If we let this into the outside world, will such a person have the same loyalty from the person who is defending him and the same protection as he has at the moment under Army regulations?  As Senator Dooge said, the present system has stood us well for 30 years, something which we cannot say for a lot of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system is that there are five officers, <Col N="150" /> from a lieutenant up to a colonel. This is very fair.  A rather interesting point is that when they are deciding their judgment in regard to a defendant they commence with the lieutenant &mdash; and not the colonel &mdash; who gives his decision first and says whether the defendant is guilty or not.  I want to make it quite clear how fair this is because one could appreciate that if the colonel was asked to give his decision first, the lieutenant would be left with no choice at the end of the five except to say the man was guilty, because the colonel had said so.  They start the other way when giving judgment of guilty or not guilty, which is in the order of the lieutenant, captain, commandant, lieutenant-colonel and colonel, so there is fairness and the person being tried knows he has support and that there is no question of his being convicted unless he is abolutely and totally guilty.  At this stage, of course, the Minister will have sized up who briefed me a little on some Army regulations <i>et cetera.</i>  I do not have a back-up group but I do know somebody who served with great loyalty and love of his country.</P>
    <P>To give an idea of the fairness of a court-martial in just one case, without delaying the House, there was a particular private charged before a court-martial as the impression was that because he wanted to leave the Army he shot off his right hand index finger in order to be discharged.  Before the trial at all it was said that he was guilty.  He was very wise in his choice of officer to defend him at the court-martial because it was an officer who had served on an Irish Army shooting team.  Here again is an example of the trust I talked about between the non-commissioned man and the commissioned officer.  That non-commissioned soldier was able to prove that he could shoot with his left hand also, which is a bit unusual, so he did not shoot off his right hand index finger in order to get a discharge.  Of course the verdict in that case was one of not guilty.</P>
    <P>I am trying to emphasise that I have reservations but if the Minister tells me that he is happy that both the non-commissioned and the commissioned personnel in the Army will have a fairer or a <Col N="151" /> better deal, those reservations may be allayed.  Perhaps there is something in this Bill that I do not understand.  We are joining military law with civil law but will these changes provide us with a better system?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there will be a separate court and that Army personnel will have a swift trial and verdict but I am going back again to something I said earlier. I do not think the medical corps in the Army may be sufficient for people who are serving in a different field at the moment than they served in years gone by.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the whole situation.  I do not want the people who serve our country, and serve it well, to be sent into the civil world out there because there is a loyalty and a bond when one is serving.  That is still very much in the Army today as it was in the past.  I think the Minister has a fair idea of what I am getting at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to make on this legislation. First, I must say that I was absolutely appalled by the references made by Senator Brendan Ryan to members of our Defence Forces.  He may try to gloss over what he said by suggesting that he was talking about armies in general and that in doing so he might get over the fact that he has denigrated one of the finest armies in the world.  We have a Defence Force and there should not go out from this House any suggestion that we have a group of paid killers in our Defence Forces.  Our Army, since the State was founded, has protected this State.  Our Army has gone abroad and has protected the freedom of people abroad and I sincerely hope they will continue to do so. The reference to paid killers is not one that I would ever like to hear again in this House.  Whatever way Senator Ryan tries to gloss over what he said, it stands as a record which I am not too sure he should be proud of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to this Bill.  I have always felt that it is unnecessary to have two types of courts in this State, to have civil courts and military courts.  From what has <Col N="152" /> been said by the Leader of the House there may have been historical reasons for this.  He mentioned the question of expediency when people were serving abroad and also the fact that military regulations were different in a sense from civil law.  Something we should be proud of is that we have an educated Army.  I think that if one went through the historical basis on which military tribunals were set up, one would find that in days gone by the people who constituted the courts in the military sense were made up of the gentry and that they decided what was to happen to the poor lads down on the firing line.  There was a totally uneducated upper class military establishment in Britain and in many other European countries and they dictated what the plebians should do.  They were never very much to the forefront when the fighting had to be done.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a court of appeal is being set up and that free legal aid can be made available to people who go before a court-martial.  The system up to now was that people within the military system were tried by their peers and in all cases they were tried &mdash; if they were non-commissioned officers or privates &mdash; by commissioned officers right up along the line. As anyone who has had any dealing with the Army will know, there is an inhibition on the private soldier when he comes up against a court-martial or any committee which is made up totally of officers.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the only appeal that could be made on conviction was by virtue of a petition to the Minister.  The system again dictated against the rights of the individual who was on trial or who was petitioning because what happened next was that the Minister had a look at the findings of the court-martial and he then asked various people who were involved in the hierarchy of the Army or in the court-martial to give him further information.  It was on the basis of this further information that the Minister then made his decision as to whether the judgment should or should not be set aside.  I wonder how many petitions to Ministers have been successful down through the years.  It would appear to me, listening to many people who are connected <Col N="153" /> with the Army, that it was very rarely a Minister set aside a court-martial decision on petition.  I know of only one case and the Minister in that instance had to withstand a lot of pressure from both the Department of Defence and from the senior military officers before he decided that the situation, as put to him, should be reversed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that although this court can be set up and will be similar to the Court of Criminal Appeal, judges from the Court of Criminal Appeal can be used but he stated also that the powers of remission or mitigation shall still be in the hands of the Minister.  Would the Minister tell us whether this means that irrespective of the outcome of the court of appeal, the Minister will still have the power to over-ride the appeal if the appeal goes against the original finding?</P>
    <P>The Minister said also that the military court can try people for offences which are not of a military nature but that there are certain crimes such as murder, treason, and genocide for which no court-martial can try a person unless the offence was committed while the person was on active service.  I would just like to have clarified what is the situation when a military court tries somebody for a civil offence.  Does that mean that that trial overrides any case that can be taken against that person in the civil courts?  It seems that the military court has the power to try the case but if they do try the case is that the end of the trial for the person concerned?</P>
    <P>The situation regarding military trials throughout the years basically could be said to have been as fair as was possible under military law.  We have seen that it takes quite a serious offence to have something brought before a court-martial because the normal misdemeanours of a disciplinary nature that can occur can be dealt with on a summary basis by the comanding officer in a particular barracks and so it precludes the need to go to court-martial.</P>
    <P>The court-martial procedure is outdated but I am glad that we are getting a sense of respect for the fact that a person, even though he is in the Army, is still a citizen of the country and, therefore, can <Col N="154" /> have free legal aid and if convicted there will be a Courts-Martial Appeal Court set up in which the court-martial appeal judges need not necessarily be military people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will reform to a degree an anomaly that has been there for a number of years in that a member of the Armed Forces would not be able to avail of the same civil rights as would a person who was not a member of the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, take this opportunity of welcoming the Minister to the House.  He was a minute or two late coming into the House because he was engaged in what I would call a very practical exercise of civics.  He and I were meeting with school warden teams from the Dean Kelly school and the Marist school in Athlone.  Many of these well-disciplined young boys are sons of Army personnel and I have no doubt that many of them will be the soldiers of tomorrow.</P>
      <P>This Bill has two aspects to it.  It provides a system of appeal for persons convicted by a court-martial and, secondly, it provides legal aid in connection with court-martial proceedings.  It is only right and proper that we should pay tribute to the military authorities who, down the years, have ably and impartially administered the system of military law.  The military authorities, it should be said, fully support the Bill.  They have been advocating it for quite some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my experience of courts-martial in my own town in which are located Custume Barracks, one of the biggest barracks in the country, I know that there are two forms of courts-martial.  One is the general court-martial type consisting of five members.  They would deal with very serious offences.  Then there is the local court-martial consisting of three members who deal with less serious offences. Having checked on the records since the Defence Act, 1954, came into being I understand that probably no more than four or five of the serious types of courts-martial have taken place in that barracks.  This would be the trend right across the country.  In fairness, we have to say that this is a fine tribute to the men <Col N="155" /> who have formed the Army since the mid-fifties and before.  The standard of discipline is of an extremely high order. The Army is to be congratulated for this discipline.  The Army men in Athlone play a major role in many events &mdash; sporting and cultural &mdash; and in the many areas of administration in the town.  They instil into the youth of our town, if they are involved, a discipline into the character training of these young men which they themselves have obtained in the Army. This is something which should be mentioned at this time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this Bill will probably be a start to a review of the Defence Act, 1954.  I welcome this.  That Act needs updating to deal with the trials and the punishments and, indeed, any other area that may be in need of review.</P>
    <P>Coming from an Army town, knowing what the Army means to my town and knowing what the Army generally means around the country, I am happy to support the Bill.  In a nutshell, the Bill means that under the proposed arrangements a soldier accused before a court-martial will be no longer at a disadvantage <i>vis-á-vis</i> the civil courts, that he will no longer be regarded in any way as a second-class citizen before the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators, with one obvious exception, for their welcome for the Bill.  I thank Senators, too, who have welcomed me here and I include in that expression of gratitude Senator Ryan for his welcome to me on a personal basis even though he was careful to distinguish his welcome for me personally and for me in my official capacity.  Having expressed my gratitude to him I now proceed to make the same distinction as to what I want to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share with Senators Fallon and Lanigan a deep sense of distaste of Senator Ryan's denigratory remarks about our Army.  He attempted to run away from his remarks by suggesting that they were made about all armies and could not be construed as applying to our Army.  That is a distinction that was perfectly capable of being made in the course of his <Col N="156" /> remarks but he failed to make it.  He was making his remarks in the course of the Bill dealing with our Army and not with any other armed force.  Ordinary interpretation could not lead anyone to believe but that he was having a go at the members of our Permanent Defence Forces.  I reject totally the insulting remarks he made about a loyal, dedicated and disciplined body of men who are an example in a country which is falling apart from a lack of loyalty, lack of discipline and from intolerance.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan in his out-of-order opening remarks, which I regret I have to reply to at the risk of following him down that slightly disorderly road, misrepresented and misquoted what I said in the speech on the Estimate for Defence in the Dáil.  All I can say is that what he displayed here by way of intolerance and of his dishonest approach &mdash; I regret I have to say it &mdash; are the hallmarks of the professional liberal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Professional liberal.  It will be on the record as well and the Senator may read it there.  With regard to some particular remarks he made, which typify this inaccurate approach, when the inaccuracy is carefully chosen to add to the case, he regards the measure with barely concealed contempt and says that I described it as an elemental piece of reform.  This is in the context of denigrating the armed forces as a body so bereft of standards that they would be incapable of reform.  In no part of the Bill did I use the word or the description &ldquo;elemental piece of reform&rdquo;.  I said the Bill is a major reforming measure.  If we are going to be critical and quote we should do it accurately.  He had a sneer at what he described as &ldquo;what are called their own codes of honour.&rdquo;  I have had close contact with the military for many years.  The military code of honour is a very real and upstanding thing.  It means that there is a great sense of loyalty and discipline, two qualities which are badly needed in this country today.  It is a real code of honour.  However, I feel, like Senator Lanigan, that it is not a subject <Col N="157" /> that one wants to pursue at too great a level.</P>
      <P>On the contributions on the Bill itself, Senator Fitzsimons asked why we need the appeals court at all.  I mentioned in my opening speech that the Constitution specifically permits a situation where there is no appeal from findings of courts-martial and that is why there has not been any appeals court up to now. However, having regard to the development of jurisprudence in the area of civil rights it is quite clear that that jurisprudence is expanding and that the spirit of modern domestic jurisprudence in that area and international jurisprudence demands that we would acknowledge the new tone and acknowledge the fact that the right of appeal from a trial tribunal is now part and parcel of any system of jurisprudence.  We are supplying the lack in our code through the Bill.  At the time of the passage of the Defence Act in 1954 jurisprudence in that area was not so developed.  It has been evolving over the years and we recognise that and in pursuance of that recognition we are now introducing this measure.  That is why we are having a system of appeal.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzsimons also wanted to know if there would be appeals from summary trials.  There will not be an appeal as such but a person tried summarily may elect for a court-martial and then if he undergoes a court-martial he will have a right of appeal against the findings.  It is not considered necessary to provide for appeals as such from summary trials.  There is a review procedure. If a person is not satisfied he can elect for trial by full court-martial with the right of appeal that that brings with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Honan spoke of the value of the procedure of having a defending officer. The defending officer can be a lawyer, if a suitably qualified officer is available. Most of the officers in the Defence Forces with legal qualifications are members of the legal service and they would not be available for defending persons on trial.  There are more and more officers who are acquiring legal qualifications in their own time and if they are not in the legal service and are in the general service <Col N="158" /> they would be available to act as defending advocates for a soldier in a court-martial. As Senator Honan says, the particular offence might be one where the services of a general line officer might be more valuable than the services of a specialised legal officer.  The Bill, as I pointed out in my speech, continues the position where an accused can be defended by an officer subject to military law, that is, an officer who would be serving.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan wondered if outside advocates would have the same commitment of loyalty to their accused clients as would an officer advocate and on behalf of the outside advocates I would like to reassure her that there would be the same level of commitment and possibly a little more skill in the art of advocacy.</P>

      <P>I thought Senator Honan had left the House.  I take the point. Because it is a valuable procedure it is being retained.  The right of petition against findings is being abolished because of the introduction of the appeal but the petition against sentence is being retained and Senator Fitzsimons asked if following such a petition the Minister could increase the sentence.  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; because the power is to mitigate or remit, so there is no power to increase. The appeals court, on the other hand, in accordance with the recent decision of the Supreme Court, would have power to increase the sentence imposed by the court-martial on the determination of the appeal, as would an appelate court in a criminal matter on the civil side.  Regarding petitions to the Minister against sentence, the power is only to confirm, mitigate or remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the appeals and the nature of the court hearing them, Senator Dooge raised the question of a military assessor being a desirable adjunct to the court.  I do not think it would be necessary, any more than it would be necessary in the case of civil appeal courts or civil courts of trial on a technical matter. Where technical considerations apply they are generally disposed of in courts <Col N="159" /> of trial by expert witnesses and in the case of the appeal court the transcript will be available and in addition learned counsel would be able to guide the court on any technical matters that might arise. In any event, so far as the military scene is concerned, I cannot envisage anything of such a technical nature arising that would require the presence of a military assessor to guide the appeal court.</P>
    <P>The number of appeals is not anticipated to be many.  The number of courts-martial in the past year was approximately 148 and in many of those the offences would be purely military and they would not all be general courts-martial. As Senator Fallon pointed out, a general court-martial is a comparatively rare occurrence.  Most of these would be limited courts-martial dealing with purely military offences such as absence without leave and the number of appeals or petitions from them is very few.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan raised the question of how many petitions there would be and the fate that petitions suffer.  The number of petitions coming before a Minister in any one year would hardly exceed six out of an average of 150 courts-martial.  That gives an idea of the low incidence of appeals.  I have not got the figures for the rate of success in the petitions but I would like to assure Senator Lanigan, contrary to his belief in this matter, that Ministers consider petitions very seriously and do not follow the procedure which he described where they get the petition and then go and seek advice from various members of the military or the civil side of the Department.  The file comes to the Minister with the full transcript of the hearing, the judge-advocate's address to the court and the court's findings.  All petitions are sent as well to the Attorney General's Office for an expert legal view on the law and procedures involved and the complete file then comes before the Minister.  It is then the personal prerogative of the Minister to make a decision. As in most appeals before the civil court, the number that would succeed would be less than the number that fail because it has been my experience since I came into office and my experience as an advocate <Col N="160" /> in an Army town appearing before courts-martial that the trials are punctilious in their attention both to procedural and legal detail.  Consequently it would be only the occasional petition that would succeed on the grounds of mis-trial or some error of law or fact.  The Minister of the day up to now has had the assistance of expert advice from the Attorney General's Office in this regard.  It will not arise in the future because petitions against findings are being abolished and the procedure will now be dealt with by way of appeal.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned that he knew of one case where the Minister had to withstand pressure from his Department both on the civil and military sides and he nevertheless set aside a court-martial. He could well have been right; I do not know the facts.  I would be surprised to hear that he was being pressured by either the civil side or the military side in any one direction because my experience is that the matter is presented to the Minister without intervention from either the civil or military side.  It is the Minister's prerogative and I would be surprised if Senator Lanigan's statement is accurate in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan asked if there can be an appeal against sentence after determination of an appeal, in other words if there can be a petition to the Minister to mitigate the sentence.  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The petition procedure against sentence is being retained both as regards the findings of the court-martial and as against the confirmation or otherwise by the court of appeal.  This would be analogous to the petition procedure available on the civil side to the Minister for Justice. Senator Lanigan wondered if we need courts-martial at all.  I am satisfied we do.  Senator Dooge pointed out the reasons in his speech and those reasons are valid and will continue.  The system has worked well and fairly.  It is very important that in military matters there would be a speedy conclusion and that there would not be any undue delay in matters coming to trial.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked the reason for the provision that no costs could be paid to a successful appellant who was in <Col N="161" /> receipt of legal aid.  Clearly if that person is in receipt of legal aid he should not have any need for costs and it is just to remove the matter from doubt that the provision is being made or to remove the danger that the State might have to pay twice for the one appeal.</P>
    <P>I can assure Senator Honan that the medical expertise available within and to the Army is adequate for all military purposes and all military requirements. There is an excellent medical service for members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Dooge's point that after 30 years the time has probably come to review our code of military law.  The fact that 30 years have elapsed and there has been general satisfaction with the provisions of the Defence Act, 1954, is a tribute to the careful way in which that Act was brought into being.  It might be apposite at this time when committees are being spoken of to recall that this Act was dealt with by a Special Committee of the other House.  A most careful, analytic and painstaking debate took place in the other House on Committee Stage of the Defence Bill in 1954 and preceding years.  Certainly the care that was put into that measure was well worthwhile because the measure has endured up to now in a most satisfactory manner.  The amendment that is now being made is not due to any inherent defect in the parent Act but is a response to the way jurisprudence in this area has been evolving.</P>
    <P>There will be further amendments made and they will be essentially of a minor nature, updating penalties and matters such as that.  While I take Senator Dooge's point that it would be a pity to have these amendments made in such a way that they would involve referring back to the parent Act, they would be essentially, so far as I can see at the moment, not minor amendments but a large number of technical amendments. I will have to consider or certainly keep in mind Senator Dooge's point that one should re-enact the entire Act for ease of reference in the future.  Essentially it is only a matter of printing.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with all the points that were raised.  If there are any more detailed points we can deal with them on <Col N="162" /> Committee Stage.  In conclusion I thank Senators for participating in the debate and by and large welcoming the measures proposed.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he would explain to us exactly what is involved in the change here.  It applies also to the following section and they are both bound together in section 7.  As I read the Bill, what is being done here is to introduce a power in the High Court to release somebody from custody to which he has been committed as a result of being found not fit to plead or, in the following section, found to have been insane at the time of the committing of the offence.  I would like to ask the Minister: is this another way in which the High Court is coming into the military system or is it essentially part and parcel of the appeal procedure?  It seems to me that this is almost an introduction of <i>habeas corpus</i> into the military law in this restricted field.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have that incidental effect or consequence but the motivation for the change is based on the fact that the parent sections 202 and 203 of the Defence Act, 1954, provide in the two cases of &ldquo;unfit to stand trial&rdquo; or &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; for the person being detained at the pleasure of the Minister.  There is a view that because of recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court in relation to the idea of custody during pleasure that the power might be held to be in conflict with the Constitution.  In order to obviate any danger in that regard it was felt that the <Col N="163" /> power of the Minister to detain during pleasure in those two restricted situations should be removed and that the power be given to the courts.</P>

      <P>That is a grey area both in regard to this matter and in regard to the criminal law generally.  Those applications come to be made by the person himself or are possibly brought to the notice of the court by a friend or a professional adviser, or it sometimes can be brought to the courts by a medical professor taking an initiative.  It is very difficult to lay down a procedure as such. We just have to assume that the normal channels of going to court will be availed of by and on behalf of the person in question.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation and I welcome this provision which in a sense is an additional reform other than the three which we have been debating.

This provides a fourth reason to welcome the Bill.</P>

I do find it strange that the words in brackets in the first and second lines are included.  They are certainly helpful but it does read here as if there is an Act of 1954 concerned with the quashing of findings of courts-martial, whereas it is only the section that does so.

      <P>Am I right in thinking that the last three lines of that section mean that there may be occasions when four or five or more judges may sit at a court-martial?  It states:</P>
      <P>but any other available judge or judges of the Supreme Court or the High Court may, at the request of the Chief Justice, attend as a member or members of the Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not to do with the numbers but with the personnel.  The court normally would consist of judges of whom one would be either the Chief Justice or a judge of the Supreme Court and the other two would be two judges of the High Court or the President of the High Court or another judge of the High Court.  So the court of three would consist <Col N="165" /> of a member of the Supreme Court and two from the High Court, one of whom could be the President, but any other available judges of the Supreme Court or High Court may attend.  I understand that means that we could have, for example, a court consisting of three judges of the Supreme Court in the event that members of the High Court were not available. In addition, I refer Senator Ryan to subsection (2) which provides that the court shall consist of not fewer than three judges.</P>

      <P>I did raise the point on Second Stage, to which the Minister responded, in regard to the question of technical military matters being involved. The Minister thought this would not be necessary.  I did indicate that in the civil code there is the question of expert witnesses. We have a difficulty here when we depart from the military code in which the officers of the court-martial are providing the technical element.  In the court-martial itself, technical evidence in regard to the military aspect would not be brought because of the fact that the officers who constitute the tribunal are experts.  When it comes to the appeal, we have the position that the appeal is under section 17 judged on the proceedings, on the actual record.  There is no direct provision for expert witnesses to be interpolated for the benefit of the judges in this case.  I do not want to argue the point too strongly in this regard or to say that it would always be necessary but I put forward the point that there may be occasion on which justice would be helped by ensuring in some way that expert military opinion is available.  It may well be that it is necessary under section 17 to enable the judges in the Courts-Martial Appeals Court to take evidence from somebody other than the <Col N="166" /> president of the court-martial or the judge-advocate.  There may be an occasion on which judges can say there is nothing in the transcript before them which enables them to evaluate that particular circumstance because of the military expertise involved.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, this was the point I was trying to get across but I think the Minister missed it.  I was not speaking too clearly it seems and normally I do.  I am concerned about the military evidence being left out of the appeal but obviously the Minister did not understand that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point that Senator Dooge, Senator Ryan and the Leas-Chathaoirleach make.  There will be appeals generally in the two main areas, where the offence was purely a military one and where the offence would be a civil offence tried before a court-martial. Obviously in the latter case there will be no need for an assessor.  So we would be dealing then with an offence against a peculiar piece of military law.  It might be, for example, a court-martial on a charge of desertion and it could turn on the question of whether there was intent or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;desertion in the face of the enemy.  Fortunately we do not have enemies.  The absence of an assessor would not prejudice the appeal or in any way inhibit the court for two reasons.  All that an assessor would do would be to expand to the court on the nature of the particular military thing involved.  In doing that he might seem in some way to be presuming the court's prerogative to make that decision itself.  It would be <Col N="167" /> difficult to have in regard to a purely military offence advice that would be more than just advice or explanatory.  He would be automatically getting into a judicial position.</P>
      <P>In so far as technical explanations to the military court will be concerned, I find it difficult to envisage what would be so technical in that sense that would require an assessor that could not be explained to the court or be open to the court by counsel in the normal way explaining a technical matter to an appeal court.  In addition, section 17 says that an appeal should be determined on the proceedings of the trial with power to the court to hear new or additional evidence and to refer any matters for report by the president or judge-advocate.  If there was difficulty on a technical point the appeal court could call for a witness or call for an explanatory report from the president of the court-martial or the judge-advocate at the court-martial.  I think that should cure the Senator's worry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of practice, when it comes to appeal the Minister will be represented by the Attorney General or by counsel nominated by the Attorney General.  In the case of an unsuccessful appeal, if the Minister thinks there is a point of law that should go through the Supreme Court, it would be appropriate that it would be the Attorney General who would define the point.  It would be the Attorney General who would be seeking clarification of that particular point.  He would have the right to specify the point on which he wants clarification, which, of course, would be without prejudice as a general note to the appeal itself.  The appeal would have been decided and that would be a <i>fait accompli.</i> The only matter then for argument would a point of law in the Supreme Court.  It would be appropriate that the person seeking the decision on the point of law would be the Attorney General. This power is analogous to a power on the civil side; either the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General <Col N="169" /> can bring an appeal without prejudice to the findings of the appeal court on a point of law to the Supreme Court.  In such cases the point to be clarified is identified by the Attorney General on behalf of the nominal respondent.</P>

      <P>There is here a provision whereby the court may increase the sentence.  This is normal, but when we look at this on the civil side, there is a very tight joining of the matter of maximum sentence with the particular crime. From a quick reading of the Defence Act, my understanding is that there is not the exact one-to-one correspondence in military law, that there is more flexibility in regard to the range of punishment in this regard.  Is there some difficulty about limits on the increase of punishment in the appeal court?</P>

They would be well aware that they would be dealing with a matter which was not a normal criminal appeal. The experts in deciding sentences would probably be the lower court.  I could see them being slow to intervene in whatever the lower court found as the sentence in a military matter.  If it were to be a case of appeal concerning a criminal charge tried by a court-martial, different considerations might apply because the court, obviously, would have more experience in that regard.  There is a limit built in by <Col N="170" /> the provisions of the Defence Act, 1954. The maximum punishment is provided in each section.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) states that the court may, notwithstanding that it is their opinion that the point raised in an appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considered that no miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.  Subsection (3) deals with costs and gives a discretion to the court not to award costs in certain circumstances, even though the appellant has been successful.  Has the court discretion under subsection (2) when, in fact, the appellant was right in law, but they are deciding that no miscarriage of justice occurred, to give him costs?  If he has a legal point, if he is right in law, even though he does not win his appeal, he certainly should not have to pay the costs.</P>

      <P>I was mildly surprised on reading section 33, on regulations the Minister may make, that he may prescribe certain things, and that it includes matters of legal aid certificates.  A very important prescription in these regulations would be the question of prescribed persons which are referred to specifically earlier in the Bill.  I found it strange that that was not directly cited in section 33. This does not prevent the Minister from making such a prescription but I would have thought that where one did have the question of prescribed persons who play quite an important role in regard to the provisions of the Bill, they should be specifically mentioned.</P>

      <P>It is intended that the prescribed authority would be the Deputy Judge-Advocate-General.  He is the senior legal military officer in the Defence Forces and the intention in the regulations is to prescribe him as the person to decide on the granting of the legal aid certificates.  I thought it better not to write the identity of the person into the Act because then it would be fixed for all time.  The regulations give a little more flexibility.  If it should happen that it did not tie in with the job or duties of the Deputy Judge-Advocate-General we wanted the power to change it to another prescribed authority.</P>

When you look to section 33 you do not get the reference back, whereas in regard to the legal aid certificates, which are also mentioned in section 25, their form is specifically cited.  The criticism is not of the Minister.  It is a mild criticism of the draftsmen.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The special ground rent purchase scheme provided by Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, was given a life of five years by section 18 of that Act and is due to terminate on 31 July next.  The Bill proposes to extend the operation of that purchase scheme for a period of 12 months, that is, to 31 July 1984, subject to a three-fold increase in fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase scheme was introduced for the benefit of ground rent tenants of dwelling houses who wish to buy out their ground rents and under it the Land Registry does the legal work, up to the present for merely nominal fees.  The declared purpose of the scheme was to bring about the abolition by purchase of existing ground rents on dwelling houses following the enactment of legislation, earlier in the same year, which in effect <Col N="173" /> prevented the creation of any new ground rents of that kind.</P>
    <P>For reasons that must be largely a matter of conjecture, purchases under the scheme to date, about 22,000, amount to only one-tenth of the total number of potential purchasers as tentatively estimated at the time the scheme was introduced. However, there is at least some evidence to suggest that failure to avail themselves of the scheme on the part of a substantial number of persons may have been due to the effects of the ground rents campaign which sought to persuade people neither to pay ground rent nor to buy out the ground landlord.  That is, that campaign may have created the impression that ground rents on dwelling houses could simply be made to disappear by the waving of a statutory wand, and without the ground rent tenant having to buy out. It is possible that such persons may now have come to recognise that that is something that will not happen and cannot happen.</P>
    <P>At all events, there has been an increase, little short of dramatic, in the number of inquiries and applications under the purchase scheme since the date, some months ago, when the Minister for Justice drew attention to the pending termination of that scheme. Some of this increase may arise simply because intending purchasers put matters on the long finger: however, much of it may arise from the growing realisation that there are two and only two ways in which ground rents can be abolished: one is by purchase and the other is by confiscation. Purchase must mean purchase by the property owner himself because even the promoters of the ground rents campaign have not suggested that the purchase of ground rents should be paid for out of public funds, and of course even in normal times any such suggestion would be indefensible.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice already has made it clear when announcing the impending termination of the scheme that confiscation of the ground landlord's property would be still less defensible. Accordingly, the inescapable conclusion is that if existing ground rents on dwelling <Col N="174" /> houses are to be abolished, that abolition is up to the ground rent tenant himself.</P>
    <P>Of course there may be many householders who are not concerned to abolish their ground rents and who are quite happy to hold their dwelling houses under long leases.  For those who are so concerned, however, I should like to say a further word on the question of abolishing ground rents by confiscating the property of the ground landlord.  Naturally, everyone is against confiscation. Nevertheless, it has apparently been quite possible for the ground rents campaigners to be overtly against confiscation and at the same time to advocate policies that would amount to the same thing.  For example, the idea has been advanced that a date could be set, by statute, some years in the future, after which the payment of ground rents on dwelling houses would cease to be legally enforceable.  In the intervening period the ground landlord and the ground rent tenant should negotiate.  It is not explained, however, just why the ground rent tenant should negotiate about anything if his liability to pay is going to terminate anyhow &mdash; that is, if confiscation will come to his aid should he be unwilling to buy out the ground landlord. It has also been suggested that some ground landlords are more &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; or less &ldquo;deserving&rdquo; than others and that a ground landlord who inherited his property is less deserving than one who bought into ground rents in the first place &mdash; without however explaining the implications of this kind of thinking for other areas of our law, for instance, succession and taxation.</P>
    <P>Finally, it has been suggested that a ground rent tenant who with his predecessors has paid ground rent for as long as 30 or 40 years is the person deserving of compensation, rather than his ground landlord &mdash; again, apparently, without facing up to the implications.</P>
    <P>The organisers of the ground rents campaign appear indirectly to have conceded that arguments of this kind do not stand up to scrutiny, in as much as they have lately been calling for a referendum on a proposal for constitutional change to enable ground rents to be abolished <Col N="175" /> otherwise than by purchase.  This call amounts to an indirect admission that abolition without payment of purchase money, in whatever guise any such proposal would be presented, would amount to confiscation and would be unconstitutional.  It is important that everyone concerned should be quite clear about the Government's position on this.</P>
    <P>The Government will not initiate any change of that kind.  It is not a question &mdash; as sometimes seems to be suggested &mdash; of the Constitution raising a technical obstacle and of removing that obstacle by bringing about a corresponding technical change in the Constitution.  The constitutional barrier to the abolition of ground rents without compensation to the owners of those rents is a fundamental one. Indeed, that barrier is the same one that leaves houseowners themselves secure in the possession of their own properties.  It would be wrong in principle to try to remove it.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day what we are left with is a situation where purchase applications under the 1978 scheme are now pouring into the Land Registry at a rate that is almost bound to generate substantial arrears by the time the original termination date arrives.  More important, many intending purchasers may be left disappointed in as much as they may be unable to lodge completed applications in time.  In this situation the Government have decided to extend the scheme for a period of 12 months, as this Bill proposes. The main reason for the extension is, of course, to give a further opportunity to purchase to those who otherwise may be too late.  A supporting reason is the consideration that, because of likely arrears of work arising out of the present flood of applications, the Land Registry staff concerned must in any event continue to be employed under the scheme until well beyond the original termination date.</P>
    <P>However, what has to be ruled out is any extension of the scheme at the same fees as were fixed in 1978.  The scheme was expressly introduced to encourage the abolition by purchase of ground rents on dwelling houses, and the fees were fixed at what even in 1978 were nominal <Col N="176" /> levels.  That is to say, it was expressly recognised that the operation of the scheme would involve a significant charge on public funds and this charge was accepted, for a strictly limited period, so as to encourage that abolition.</P>
    <P>Whether that abolition is substantially achieved during the period of extension that is proposed, there is no case for continuing to accept a charge on public funds the original case for which depended on its being a strictly limited time.  Indeed, even if maintenance of support from public funds at the same level were to be contemplated, changes in money values alone since 1978 would indicate a doubling of the fees.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said, there is no case for continuing to support the purchase scheme from public funds at any level of subsidy.  At current costs, the estimated break-even point comes with a trebling of the fees and that is what the Bill proposes.  More accurately, the Bill proposes to treble those fees that are prescribed in the 1978 (No. 2) Act itself, that is, the fees payable by owner-occupiers. For &ldquo;consent&rdquo; cases the fee payable in respect of applications lodged after 31 July next will become £15 instead of £5 while the fee payable where arbitration is required will become £36 instead of £12.  The remaining fees, including the fees payable by purchasers who are not in occupation of the relevant dwelling houses, it is proposed, will be increased accordingly in revised regulations. Although the new fees are indeed matched to the cost of the scheme it is fair to say that they are still very moderate.</P>
    <P>There is one caution that it may be well for me to enter: the proposed extension of the purchase scheme on a self-supporting basis may be taken to imply an intention to provide for its further extension, and perhaps its establishment on a permanent basis, after the extension now proposed has run its course.  I would ask the House not to read any such implication into the proposals in this Bill.  The matter is one that may indeed come under examination but if and when it does there are factors that must be considered that would argue against any further <Col N="177" /> extension of the scheme, and would argue quite strongly against it.  It follows that intending ground rent purchasers who wish to avail themselves of the scheme would not be well advised to long-finger the matter any further.</P>
    <P>However, there is on the other hand something else that I would like to make clear: despite some newspaper headlines which have recently appeared, termination of the 1978 purchase scheme does not involve termination of the right to buy out ground rent, the right to buy out ground rent is something quite distinct from the operation of the 1978 scheme. Even if the scheme were to be allowed to terminate next month the right to buy out would be unaffected.  Ground rent tenants of dwelling houses would retain the full entitlement to buy out that was first given by the 1967 Ground Rents Act &mdash; although, of course, they would no longer have the benefit of the services of the Land Registry and would have to make their own arrangements for any legal services they might require.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I ask for a Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the extension of the 1978 Act which is provided by this Bill.  I was glad to hear during the course of the Minister's speech that there are now a very large number of people applying to buy out their ground rents.  By and large, the campaign against ground rents has very little merit.  Many people have been misled by this campaign to their detriment.  There may, of course, have been cases in the past in which ground rents appeared to have been inequitable and unjust, but generally speaking a case against all ground rents as such cannot really be made and should not be made. I am glad that the Government have taken such a strong stand on this issue, that there are only two ways to get rid of a ground rent: one way is by buying it out and the other is by confiscation, and the Government have no intention of introducing legislation to permit confiscation. I hope this campaign will peter out, as I think it must, eventually.  I hope that many more people will avail of the opportunity provided by this extension of the <Col N="178" /> Act to buy out their ground rents if they wish to do so.  Of course there are many people who are quite willing to pay ground rent, have no ambition to buy it out and they are perfectly entitled to adopt that point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the Bill has a twofold purpose.  First, it extends the operation of Part III of the 1978 Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act for a further period of one year.  Second, it has the effect of trebling Land Registry fees payable on applications made to the Land Registry under that Act.  Regarding the extension of the operation of the 1978 Act for one further year, in effect it allows the individual to continue for that period to use the machinery of the State, through the Land Registry, in effecting the completion of the purchase of his ground rent interest. Of course, it does nothing to interfere in any way with the right of somebody holding his rights under the 1967 Ground Rents Act.  The only difficulty that would arise in relation to that Act is that the individual may have to incur somewhat greater legal fees.</P>
      <P>It may be appropriate at this stage to make the point to the Minister that in certain situations when there is a single ground landlord and when his interest is registered in the Land Registry, it would facilitate and reduce costs tremendously if a key map of that particular landlord's interests was made available for tenants in a particular locality.  I have in mind my own locality, Westport, where the ground landlord is the Marquis of Sligo, and Castlebar, where the ground landlord is lord Lucan.  In both cases, individuals purchased their ground rent interest without availing of the provisions of the 1978 Act, such individuals as well as paying their own legal costs and the legal costs of the ground landlord's solicitor. also have to pay the cost of employing an engineer to map the ground which is being purchased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Registry have very stringent mapping regulations and this can impose a charge of £40 to £60 on somebody who is paying a ground rent of 50p or £1 per year.  If the Department of Justice and <Col N="179" /> the Land Registry were to get in touch with various interests throughout the country and make available in various locations key maps, that could have the effect of reducing substantially the cost of purchase in places where the purchase price is very small.  Regarding the trebling of Land Registry fees, much has been said about that, particularly in the other House.  It is well to note however, that since 1978 Land Registry fees in relation to all other transactions have at least increased on two occasions.  The increase of fees under this Act brings the fees into line with other fees and makes the operation within the Land Registry no longer loss-making.</P>
    <P>I agree absolutely with the point made by Senator Ryan in relation to the campaign to confiscate ground rent.  The Minister has made the point very well in her speech to this House that ground rent interest cannot be confiscated.  One would run into tremendous constitutional difficulties if one attempted to do that and the people who have been propagating such campaigns are possibly aware of it and have been misleading people who have been giving them support on this point.  Other than that, I fully support this Bill.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls for the establishment by the Government of an independent working party to carry out a comprehensive assessment of access to legal education and the provision of legal services in the State, and recommends that the following specific matters be included among others in any such assessment and may be the subject of separate reports:</P>
      <P>Legal Education</P>
      <P>&mdash;Access to legal education; the academic law courses available at third level and the cost of these courses,</P>

      <P>&mdash;Opportunities for specialist education or training for members of judiciary,</P>
      <P>&mdash;Sentencing policy in criminal cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate <Col N="182" /> this motion in the Seanad.  It has been tabled for debate, not as an academic exercise but for a number of cogent and pressing reasons.  Perhaps I should begin by listing these: first, to highlight the importance of the whole legal process and the provision of legal services in our society; secondly, to point out that the widespread ignorance of the law and of legal procedures and remedies is itself a serious social problem which should receive more urgent priority and attention; thirdly, to show the unsystematic, unplanned and unsatisfactory way that access to legal education and the provision of legal services have developed in Ireland over the years, and finally to demonstrate the urgent need for an independent review and assessment of both legal education and the provision of legal services so that specific areas of reform can be identified and so that proper structures for greater accountability, openness, fairness and better use of resources can be established.  I should begin by explaining what the words &ldquo;independent working party&rdquo; in the context of this motion mean so far as the Labour group are concerned.  We were anxious to have a working party which would be independent, but representative of the various interests.  Clearly, it would require to be representative of the interests of the Department of Justice, but also at Government level, the interests of the Department of Education because of the emphasis on examination of legal education.</P>
    <P>Indeed, there might be other Departments, such as the Department of Health which might have a particular interest. The Coolock Community Law Centre is under the auspices of the Department of Health at the moment and therefore the intention was to invite and to hope for representative departmental participation in such a working party.  Clearly, both branches of the legal profession have an interest in being represented and have an expertise to offer to such a working party.  It would be intended that they would be invited to and would participate in it.</P>
    <P>There is also a broader public interest &mdash; the interest of the consumer and of the <Col N="183" /> ordinary citizen and, to some extent, that interest can be well represented by some of the bodies and organisations which have been working closely with people on the ground.  I am thinking of FLAC which have been providing their own contribution to legal services down the years and are continuing to do so, or organisations such as Cherish or Aim or Ally which work closely with people who have a need of legal services.  We believe that the working party should be broadly based in that sense, so that it will have a rounded, balanced, practical and realistic contribution to make.</P>
    <P>Having described the nature of the independent working party which we would call for and hope that the Minister will agree to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the short break I outlined the main objectives in tabling this motion for debate in the Seanad this afternoon.  I was clarifying the reference to an independent working party which was intended to be independent but representative of the interest at departmental level, the obvious interest of the two branches of the profession and the broader public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to discuss in more detail the four objectives of this motion which I have listed.  The first objective is a very basic one which we have neglected for a long time in our society.  It is to highlight the importance of the legal process itself. This involves an understanding of the role and potential of law in our society. Law in this context can be described as a hidden infrastructure which supports, regulates and, in many ways, determines almost every aspect of our lives in modern society.  As it is an all-pervasive infrastructure the law can operate in <Col N="184" /> quite different ways.  It can &mdash; this is the case all too often at present &mdash; become a rigid infrastructure supporting and maintaining the <i>status quo</i> and carrying on structures and institutions which have long lost their usefulness or relevance. Seen in this light, law and the legal process can be a barrier to progress and change.</P>
    <P>Law can even be an instrument of repression weighing on those who seek greater flexibility and adaptation in the system.  By contrast, because it is this hidden and pervasive infrastructure, law can also be an important instrument and trigger for social change.  It can stimulate political thinking about new ways of achieving greater participation or involvement in decision-making in our society.  It is a fair comment on the Oireachtas down the years that we have underestimated the potential of the role which law plays in our society and its potential in particular for the kind of adaptation and change which we need to meet our rapidly changing society.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because the process of law has been largely hidden, secretive and remote in its operation in Ireland, it has all too often played that rigid congealing role of supporting and upholding the <i>status quo</i> as an end in itself.  This has resulted in considerable alienation of sectors of the population from law and the legal process.  I instance, for example, the very widespread attitude among trade unionists who are of the view that law in the area of industrial relations, in so far as it intervenes, does so crudely and unhelpfully on the other side of the divide.  Similarly, there are many individuals weighed down by family problems who, when seeking a legal remedy, find that they do not have ready and easy access to a reasonable commonsense remedy which is helpful to them.</P>
    <P>This leads to the second objective of this motion which is again a very basic one that must not be neglected.  It is to highlight the serious social problems which result from widespread ignorance of the law and of the whole legal process. The word &ldquo;ignorance&rdquo; used here is not intended in the pejorative sense.  It is not intended in any way to either judge <Col N="185" /> people or be critical of the fact that they lack knowledge of the basic law, legal procedures and legal process.  The word is deliberately chosen because it is the word which appears in a very basic maxim of the law &mdash; ignorance of the law is no excuse.  In other words, there is a presumption that a person knows the law and, therefore, it is not possible to plead ignorance as a defence to a criminal prosecution or as the reason for the failure of a citizen to assert a legal right, for example, within the statutory period that is allowed for doing so.  The stark reality &mdash; this is well known to Members of the House &mdash; is that a large number of people are not only ignorant of the law in the sense of lacking basic knowledge of it but they are intimidated and frightened by the law in so far as they come in contact with it and are alienated by it to a very serious degree.</P>
    <P>If we accept the political proposition which this is, that knowledge is power, then this lack of knowledge is its own kind of powerlessness and helplessness. A basic knowledge and understanding of the law confers on a person the power and confidence to cope with the system, even to use law as a positive help and as a tool or instrument to achieve a particular object.  Unfortunately there are whole sections of our population &mdash; the poor, young people, the person who drops out of school at the year of 14 or 15 &mdash; who are unlikely to have any basic knowledge or understanding of the role and the potential of law in our society and its relevance to them.  They are, therefore, powerless and defenceless in our modern technological society.</P>
    <P>The second objective is to highlight the fact that this lack of basic knowledge or understanding of the role of law is itself a serious social problem which is generally ignored or overlooked when other social problems are being highlighted.  It is certainly a serious and significant factor in perpetuating the poverty traps in our society.  It leads to very polarised perspectives on crime and vandalism in our expanding cities and towns with one side arguing the need for greater penalties and more effective enforcement of legal measures and the other side pointing to <Col N="186" /> the inequalities and the harsh social and economic conditions which form a breeding ground for further crime.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with access to formal legal education as it is taught in the universities and other third-level institutions, I should like to make a specific plea for increasing people's opportunities to acquire a basic knowledge and understanding of the role of law and of their basic rights.  We could go a great deal further in achieving this.  We could, for example, do what so many other countries have done and introduce as a Leaving Certificate or other course subject at secondary level a knowledge of the Irish Constitution and the role of law in society. This would be a very relevant and realistic subject for people going through secondary school to learn.  We expect voters at the age of 18 to vote on possible amendments to the Constitution and yet we know very well that in a large number of cases they do not know the context of their votes.  They do not know what the Constitution provides and how these measures contain certain safeguards and certain remedies and protections for the individual.  At second level we should examine, as other countries have done, the teaching of law.  We could do it in an acceptable and relevant way.  I have seen very exciting school-books used in Australia, New Zealand and in parts of America where they use relevant materials &mdash; newspaper headings, accounts of cases and profiles of juries &mdash; to give young people a real sense of how the whole legal process operates and how it affects them.</P>
    <P>We could go much further in expanding opportunities for adult education. There is an almost insatiable demand among many members of the public for various types of non-specialist courses which would help them to understand the nature and role of law, develop their own contribution to society and help them understand how they can improve their own potential use of law and legal remedies. As part of that I would highlight the potential role of neighbourhood law centres.  We have underestimated the importance of the community-based neighbourhood type law centre.  It is, <Col N="187" /> therefore, regrettable that the legal aid scheme established by the Government following the decision in the Airey cases before the Court of Human Rights was based on a number of law centres merely providing professional legal services on an individual client basis.</P>
    <P>An important opportunity is being missed for much greater education of local communities, involvement on a management committee of representatives of those local communities, identification of problems in a local community be they landlord and tenant problems or a recurring type of family problem or a recurring type of environmental problem or whatever in a particular area which could be dealt with on a representative level.  It is through the community based law centres that it is possible for the preventive side of law in local communities to come to fruition.  People would acquire the knowledge to enable them to take steps to prevent further difficulties and enable them to see the possibility of improving their own knowledge and understanding of their situation through a better knowledge of the legal rules and remedies.  That is the other basic objective of this motion.</P>
    <P>The third objective is perhaps more evident in the wording of the motion.  It is to show the present unsystematic, unplanned and unsatisfactory way that both access to legal education and the provision of legal services have developed in Ireland.  It is worth noting with regret and with a certain sense of self-criticism that neither the area of legal education nor the area of the provision of legal services, including the administration of justice, has received any independent examination or assessment since the establishment of the Free State when we broke from the British system but inherited from it a great deal of the common law tradition and the structure of the profession and other aspects of the legal system.  It is all the more striking that in a young Republic which inherited a system of legal education and a division of the legal profession into barristers and solicitors there has not been a realisation of the importance of assessing and considering <Col N="188" /> how well both the legal education side and the provision of legal services have served us in a broad way since we achieved our independence.</P>
    <P>Ironically, and this just points out the need for criticism of our own lack of study, both the area of legal education and the provision of legal services have been extensively examined by the jurisdiction from which we borrowed much of our tradition and carried it over.  For example, a committee which was appointed in December 1967 and reported in March 1971, examined legal education in England and Wales.  More recently, a royal commission on legal services was established in 1976 and reported in 1979 on the whole broad area of the provision of legal services in England and Wales.  The report of that commission is contained in two very substantial volumes each divided into two parts.  The final report in part 2 of the royal commission report contains a number of interesting and useful surveys and studies, including a survey of users of legal services in Northern Ireland.  Apart from that, there was the Armitage Report in 1973 specifically on legal education in Northern Ireland.  I am sure the Minister is also aware of studies that have been carried out in most other jurisdictions of very important areas where so much has changed and is changing and where the area itself is of particular public concern and not just the exclusive province of the legal profession and of those who aspire to become members of the legal profession.  Here in Ireland we have been content up to now to carry on with our inherited system without any inquiry as to its adequacy.  This is all the more curious and all the more unacceptable in our view because the situation with regard to legal education and the provision of legal services has not remained static.  It is not a situation about which one could say, there was no need to have an inquiry or an examination because nothing really has changed over the years and everything is carrying on in an orderly and leisurely way.  The exact opposite of that is the case.</P>
    <P>There has been what can be described only as an explosion of numbers seeking <Col N="189" /> to study law either at the universities or at other third-level institutions in the past decade and a half.  This is reflected also in a doubling or more than doubling of the number of legal practitioners in both branches of the profession in the past decade.  Again, a few statistics on the record probably demonstrate more dramatically than words how the situation has changed within a decade.  For example, I am taking first the Bar, the professional barristers.  In 1973 there were approximately 219 practising barristers. The present figure is 480 or more than double the figure of ten years ago.  A similar pattern is evident in the number of solicitors.  Taking the base in the report of December 1976 of 1,800 practising solicitors this has risen to the present number of approximately 2,752, again a very dramatic increase from 1,800 to 2,752, this time in only seven years.  Half of those solicitors operate out of firms located in Dublin.  There are approximately 672 firms in the country as a whole.  Dublin appears to be very much overendowed with solicitors' firms.  Perhaps this is because Dublin has all the additional business of being a capital city but it is interesting that it has twice the number of solicitors as the city of Cork for the percentage of population.</P>
    <P>Another more serious criticism is that solicitors' firms tend to be located in the commercial centres, in the business centres of the towns and cities and are badly and inadequately distributed in the housing estates and densely-populated but poorer areas.  This is an important factor in talking about physical access to legal services and to the kind of expertise which people need.  Even on those minimum figures there has been a very dramatic increase in the number of practitioners and this is also reflected in the situation for law students and graduates. Their situation has become very competitive and very difficult because it is not planned in a systematic and fair way.  It has grown up in an <i>ad hoc</i> way where nobody necessarily relates in any decision-making to any of the other bodies involved.  Neither of the professional bodies need to, or do particularly consult <Col N="190" /> each other in planning their numbers or access to their courses.  The universities operate in a separate way and are not consulted until afterwards by the professional bodies in relation to decisions.  Certainly they are not consulted in a way which would allow them to influence and affect decisions to be taken by the professional bodies.</P>
    <P>Although the law schools have increased their numbers in recent years these do not go any way to satisfying the possible demands for places in the law schools.  Time does not permit me to elaborate very broadly on that but again figures illustrate the extent of the pressure for places in law schools in Ireland.  Take the applications for places in the law school in Trinity next September and October: for the 63 places which will be available in the legal science course there are at present 532 applications indicating first preference for law.  Last year the number was 441 applications for 63 places and a similar pressure on numbers is evident in the other law schools.</P>
    <P>What is now happening and is causing very real concern to law students graduating from the law school is that the numbers of law graduates are beginning to exceed the quotas which have been placed on entry to the professional courses by the two professions.  This has been a very serious running problem in the past few years.  One difficulty is that the professions themselves are the sole determinants of whether there will be a quota and the size of the quota for entry to the professional course, as they are the determinants of the cost and all the other aspects such as the duration and the content of the courses.  It is now becoming clear that law graduates may no longer have an option of going to Blackhall Place to take part in the course for solicitors. It looks as though in the next few years the projections of numbers will mean that similarly some law graduates will be turned away from the possibility of pursuing a career at the Bar at the King's Inns.</P>
    <P>All of these issues are not just issues for the individual student and for the legal profession, either branch of the legal profession involved.  They are matters <Col N="191" /> of public concern about allocation and use of resources, access to education and access to a career.  They should not be left to be determined by a branch of the legal profession which has a monopoly. The King's Inns has a monopoly of conferring the degree of barrister-at-law and therefore can, as it has done in recent years, assert that monopoly to teach for non-law graduates the two preliminary years of the diploma course followed by the two years of the professional course needed to become a barrister and which law graduates also have to take.</P>
    <P>The cost of the professional courses is also a matter which is giving very serious cause for concern to the present generation both of law graduates and non-law graduates.  The figure basically for the professional course in Blackhall Place comes to a total of £2,450.  That is the fee for the course including the cost of the indentures, the five-month first professional course and the six-week advance course.  Not only is this a very high sum but the fee for the five-month professional course is £1,580.  That must be paid in one sum by whoever wants to pursue the course and the fee for the six-week advance course after the period of apprenticeship is £565 as of next October. That again has to be paid in a lump sum and together with the fees for the Irish examination and so on, it comes to that total of £2,450.  The fees for the King's Inns is of a similar level.  For the two diploma years it is £500 and for the second year £506.  Then you have to apply to enter the professional course and pay a fee of £180 and there are two further years at £506 each on present rates.  It comes to more than £2,000 for a non-law graduate and a further two years of high fees for graduates.</P>
    <P>Any body which is set up to examine this area will have to look at the content of these courses and at their duration and in particular at the content and duration of the course offered by the King's Inns. I have had the benefit, in preparing to move this motion on behalf of the Labour Group, of talking to a wide number of different bodies with views on this issue. I have spoken to representatives both of <Col N="192" /> the Incorporated Law Society and of the Bar Council.  I am glad to say that neither body oppose the establishment of an independent working party such as this. I am grateful to the representatives I spoke to for taking the time to make the points which they wished to make in that regard.  I noted that neither branch opposed in any way the establishment of a working party, but the students going through the King's Inns and the Incorporated Law Society to whom I spoke were, on the whole, very critical of the cost and content of the courses, of the pressures being exerted on law students to try to achieve entry to professional courses and at the lack of accountability to any other body as a sole and own control over the whole access to the profession of the two branches of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>The case for an examination of the whole situation, given the developments, the explosion in numbers, the pressures and changed circumstances, is unanswerable and is very much in the public interest, which is the motivation behind this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion asks that the House proceeds with the setting up of a working party to examine the question of access to legal education and of the provision of legal services in the State.  The whole question of legal education and the access to it is one which confuses many people.  It is important to realise that we have two systems of legal education. First, we have the academic institutions, the universities and regional technical colleges, which provide legal education and secondly, we have the professional bodies, the King's Inns and the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  Both of these bodies also provide legal education for professional courses.  They involve themselves also in the training of professional lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that the access to legal education within the academic institutions is very clearly governed by the system. Access to these bodies is the very same as access for all other courses which the universities and regional technical <Col N="193" /> colleges offer; if a student obtains the number of points he obtains access.  The situation with regard to the professional bodies is somewhat different because they offer courses of a professional nature.  Their structure also is somewhat different.  It is unfortunate that the whole question of legal education has become something of a kite which people feel free to fly occasionally.  Many people view these kites without realising what is happening within the professional bodies.  I have not got much experience of the King's Inns but I understand that in so far as they train barristers, their training courses have been considerably improved in recent years.  Their courses are taking cognisance of the needs of Irish society, of the increasing complexity of our legal system and of the new areas of statute law which are rapidly developing in this country.</P>
    <P>As a solicitor of ten years standing, I am quite amazed when I meet young lawyers and realise the amount of training they have the benefit of but which I did not have.  Courses have developed in planning law, in family law, in labour law and in a whole plethora of legal aspects which simply were not available ten years ago.  As a student, I was a member of the first class in family law which was taught formally in this country.  That was back in 1971.  I am open to correction on that but I believe that the first formal class in family law taught in this country was in UCD in 1971.  Now that is virtually a compulsory subject in every one of our law schools, whether professional or academic.</P>
    <P>The professional bodies which teach law have been unfairly criticised.  I refer in particular to the situation pertaining within the law society as I have greater knowledge of what has been happening there being a former student of that body. It is vitally important that Members of this House and the public realise that the law society is governed by statute.  The operation of the solicitors' profession is governed strictly by the Solicitors' Acts. Admission to the law school of the law society is also very strictly governed.  Suggestions have been made that admission is simply available to very few and that <Col N="194" /> the fees charged by the law society to their students are exorbitant.  It is important to put on the record that these suggestions are not altogether true.  It is important to realise that the financing of the law society and the fees charged by the society to their students are matters governed also by statutory regulation and are under review by the President of the High Court who as a judicial person has particular responsibility for the solicitors' profession.  Secondly, it is important to realise that any entrant to the society's law school must first pass the common examination which is called the final examination.  That rule applies to everybody whether they be law graduates, law clerks of seven years standing or graduates in other disciplines.  The cost of that course in all is in the region of £2,000.  It is in two parts.  The initial part costs approximately £1,500 and the final part costs in the region of £500.  Another point which should be borne in mind is that while an apprentice is training to be a solicitor he spends a considerable amount of time in his master's office.  While there he is paid a reasonable salary for the work he does and he learns the practical discipline of what it is to be a solicitor.</P>
    <P>As a practising solicitor, I have had the experience of having three working apprentices in my office.  It is a system which works well.  Having met apprentices who have operated and developed under the new law society system, at the end of the day they are very well trained. The law society must be complimented for developing within the past ten years the new course which leads to what I would term the new type of solicitor who is extremely well trained.</P>
    <P>The motion refers also to such matters as division between solicitors and barristers. This is a subject which one could debate and discuss at tremendous length. There is a natural division in any profession or in any vocation between the general practitioner and the specialist.  Even if the formal terms are abolished and if formally we have a unified legal profession, in practice we continue to have the general practitioners on the one hand and the men and women on the other who are experts in particular fields of law. <Col N="195" /> Whether the experts continue to conduct their business &mdash; I refer at the present time to barristers &mdash; as they do at the moment, is entirely a matter for them but in practice the system is reasonably satisfactory. One can best judge the working of it from those who are involved in it.</P>
    <P>The motion raises also the question of legal fees, costs and matters of that nature.  This is something which gives cause for concern because many people at times in their lives which are particularly difficult, for example, when they buy a new house on getting married or when a death occurs in the family are faced with heavy legal fees but the fees charged are not unreasonable.  However, certain modifications could be made.  I refer to two matters.  First, in situations where a new house purchaser takes a mortgage on his house, it is unreasonable that he should be faced with three sets of legal fees.  I am referring to the purchaser's fees, his own fees in dealing with the building society, and the building society's fees.  I cannot see why a procedure cannot be developed whereby one solicitor would deal with all aspects of the transaction.  Bearing in mind the close scrutiny which the law society maintain over practising solicitors and bearing in mind the statutory position which exists and the ultimate power of the President of the High Court to deal with erring solicitors, if the onus was placed on a solicitor acting for a purchaser to deal with all aspects of the transaction he would be in a situation where he would have to do so or would have to face the consequences.  The Minister should discuss this with the law society.</P>
    <P>The question of VAT should be looked at in certain situations.  I am thinking of a purchaser who takes out a mortgage and may be caught for VAT on three sets of legal fees.  That is unfair.</P>
    <P>The motion refers also to a complaints machinery.  That refers merely to the professional lawyers, to the Bar and to the solicitors.  I am not familiar with the procedures which exist for erring barristers but I am aware of the fact that there is a statutory situation existing in so far as solicitors are concerned and for solicitors <Col N="196" /> who do not discharge their duties in the way they should.  That procedure works extremely efficiently.  It works frighteningly expeditiously.  From the moment a member of the public makes a complaint, if a solicitor does not respond he will in a matter of weeks find himself before the disciplinary committee of the law society.  If there is no adequate response he will find himself in a very short period of time before the President of the High Court.  One must contrast that with the situation existing in other professions where it seems there is no adequate complaints machinery.  I do not want to specify the professions I have in mind.  I have had experience in recent times of wondering how one complains against a member of a caring profession but I was not able to get very far in dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The motion raises the important question of the entire method of practice, particularly the practice of solicitors.  We are faced with a situation where we have a society that is rapidly becoming urbanised and where the rural population is declining but nevertheless we have a situation where in rural Ireland we have many small towns with quite a number of solicitors' offices.  The difficulty that can exist in these offices is that there is not the personnel to deal with the wide and broad ambit of legal matters that come before solicitors.  Law students now leaving training institutions whether professional or academic will leave equipped with a knowledge of such matters as planning law, taxation law, family law and labour law but there are a great number of small one- and two-man offices which are not equipped to deal with the various complex problems which a solicitor should be able to deal with and which citizens frequently bring to their attention. In so far as the motion relates to the method of legal practice the law society and other relevant bodies should encourage amalgamation.</P>
    <P>The motion refers also to the Judiciary in regard to methods of appointment.  We have a political method of appointing people to the Judiciary.  That has been criticised.  One must ask whether the system works.  If one examines the results of <Col N="197" /> the system one finds that since the foundation of the State appointments in 99 per cent of cases have been excellent and have worked extremely well.  The reason for that is that successive Ministers for Justice and successive Attorneys General and successive Governments have made appointments in a most responsible way. There would be an advantage in examining the British system and in establishing a Department somewhat like the Lord Chancellor's Department which would examine individuals suitable for appointment, would consider applications for appointment and would consider in a general way the manner in which members of the Judiciary at various levels discharge their duties.  Consistency in sentencing policy is one matter that is mentioned in the motion.  Consistency in the general discharge of their duties would be welcome.</P>
    <P>One point that is never mentioned but which is important to recognise is that the legal system is basic to the maintenance of the State.  The legal system is by and large discharged, organised and run by lawyers but the State has a duty in dealing with the legal system and it has a duty to finance the legal system to a far greater extent than is the case.</P>
    <P>One of the problems which the legal system suffers from is a complete lack of funds.  This is exemplified in a number of ways.  It is exemplified by the lack of staffing in all court offices, from the offices of the Supreme Court to the central offices of the High Court and to the office of the District Court.  Members of the public complain about delays.  They complain about delays in relation to the collection of debts.  The solicitor may not be to blame but it may well be the sheriff's office that is to blame or it may be a delay in obtaining an order from a relevant court or it may be a delay in the bureaucratic system.  That delay is occasioned by lack of finance.  This is exemplified in a second way, that is, by the conditions under which lawyers are expected to work.  There is a total inadequacy in the funding of the courts system.  Courthouses are in a deplorable condition. While this is a matter for local authorities, it is a matter that the Department of <Col N="198" /> Justice and the Government must examine as a matter of urgency.  I do not think that any other professional body would work under the conditions that lawyers are expected to work under in this country. The fact is that they must work in antiquated courthouses without adequate consultation rooms, frequently without heat, sometimes without light and sometimes not even in proper court buildings.  I have attended courts in dance-halls, in public house lounges, in semi-derelict schools and I have attended courts in the most appalling conditions. I have attended courts where district justices have been unable to deal with family cases because it was impossible to provide a private facility.</P>
    <P>It is a deplorable situation that there is in rural Ireland no adequate facility for dealing with family matters.  I am not referring to the training of the Judiciary but in a structural sense, to buildings. There is an immediate need for an injection of funds to help restore confidence because members of the public complain of what they see but they never complain about what they do not appreciate, namely, the work, the hardship and the dedication that goes into maintaining the legal system.</P>
    <P>The motion raises many matters of interest.  I am glad it has been debated in this House because it gives us the opportunity of considering these matters.  I know the Minister is concerned about many of the matters which have been raised and I know that in the next four years of his ministry we will see a substantial reform in many of these areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not rising as a member of the legal profession but as one who has an interest in the motion which is very wide-ranging in its implications.  It may be that it is too wide-ranging to be encompassed in one report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a practical basis it was only recently that I came across the question of access to legal education.  My son has just finished his law course in UCD.  In the furtherance of a legal career he will have to go through the process of either going through King's Inns or Blackhall Place. From what I have seen of the educational system that brings people to the situation <Col N="199" /> where they either become barristers or solicitors, those who are accepted for law courses in the universities or who go through the college in Rathmines or do an arts course first, the course is extremely difficult and is also extremely expensive.  Not alone is the course in the colleges very expensive but the law books required by a student are also extremely expensive.</P>
    <P>The situation this year is that if one wants to become a solicitor one has to apply to Blackhall Place.  I believe that the limit which is set by Blackhall Place this year is 150 students and in King's Inns there will be an intake of 50.  When one considers the number of students who will come out of UCD, UCG, Trinity and the College of Commerce in Rathmines, the figure of 150 would seem to be extremely small.  In UCD this year there are in excess of 150 doing the final BCL exam, and if all those students were to go further there would be no places left for students from any other college.  Having got their BCL, not alone do they have to do a separate examination to get into Blackhall Place, which will be of an extremely competitive nature, but the cost of the course there is in excess of £2,000 this year.  The situation in King's Inns is that they are taking in 50 law graduates this year and if the person has not a BCL or the equivalent King's Inns will provide a course themselves for which they will set the standards and of course they will set the fees also.  So there is very limited access to legal education at present and it would appear that access is purely for people who have quite substantial sums of money.  I do not think the legal profession or any other profession should be confined to people who have access to large sums of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want to get in to Blackhall Place the fee will be over £2,000.  Who can afford over £2,000 other than somebody who has access to a large sum of money, to get into an educational establishment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not capable of going into the content and structure of the courses.  I <Col N="200" /> will leave it to the people who have gone through these courses to judge whether the content and structure are correct.  It would appear outside the legal profession that there is an incongruity in having two sets of people from two separate sets of educational structures dealing with the same type of case in court.  It seems to me peculiar that a solicitor should have to have a barrister by his side when dealing with relatively trivial matters in the Circuit Court.  Often in very trivial matters it seems to somebody who is not in the legal profession that the solicitor or the barrister or one particular type of lawyer should deal with the case.  The peculiarity of going to a courthouse and seeing barristers running in and getting from solicitors the bones of a case which will be taken on that day and possibly within half an hour of the barrister being briefed does not seem to be right or proper.</P>
    <P>On legal fees, costs and expenses, it would appear to many people that because these are set not in each individual office, but outside the office, there is no competition as between solicitors for the work that solicitors do.  There is a feeling in the country at present that there are too many solicitors in the Dublin area and not enough in certain rural areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the relationship between the legal profession and their clients, family tradition seems to dictate that people stick with the one solicitor's office as long as they can and it is not until they find they are not getting the required service that they change.  The complaints machinery would seem to be very much in favour of the profession rather than the client, because the only means of taking an action against a solicitor is to go to another solicitor and if you cannot get another solicitor to take it you must go to the profession itself.  It is the profession itself that dictates whether the complaint will be dealt with properly or not.  There should be a separate complaints machinery which would be outside the legal profession for dealing with complaints made against the legal profession.</P>
    <P>Those are a few points I wanted to make on this very broad motion which <Col N="201" /> takes in every aspect of legal education and the manner in which the legal profession works.  Perhaps separate motions should have been put down to deal with specific areas.  The Judiciary seems to be a totally separate item from either of the first items on the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general the idea behind the motion is an acceptable one. Certainly to oppose it would be to suggest that no improvement was possible in these areas or no improvement was required, and that certainly would not be correct.  It is not inappropriate to ask the Government to look at some of the subjects mentioned and to take some action in relation to them.  By and large successive Governments have not made much contribution to reforms in the legal profession or the legal system generally.</P>
      <P>I feel in relation to this motion that it is rather too ambitious, that it is rather vague in its terms and too wide-ranging. To set up a committee to deal with all these subjects at once would be to set up a committee which, even with the best will in the world, would not report back for several years.  Even some of the committees that have operated in the past, such as the Pringle Committee which had to deal with a fairly restricted area, took quite a long time &mdash; a couple of years &mdash; to report back.  For one committee to try to deal with all of the things that are set out in this motion would probably mean that we would not hear of it again for a long time.  Events would probably overtake many of the matters with which they would be dealing and their report and recommendations might be irrelevant by the time they would get round to reporting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know what is meant by an independent working party, what kind of composition the movers of the motion had in mind, from where it would be drawn and so on.  I feel this motion is too ambitious and I would much prefer to see some of the subjects referred to in the motion dealt with individually by appropriate committees.  This would be a much better way of dealing with the problem. The subjects dealt with fall into three <Col N="202" /> different areas and that in itself suggests that it might be appropriate to deal with it in three different committees.  I would not be in favour of trying to deal with all of these matters at once.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on a few of the matters that are dealt with or suggested for consideration.  There is an implied suggestion that the division of the profession into barristers and solicitors is not a desirable division.  I find it a rather curious suggestion in this day and age that the legal profession should be merging, when in most other professions the exact opposite is happening.  If you take the medical profession which originally merely had surgeons and physicians, there are now literally dozens of specialists in all kinds of areas of medicine. To illustrate this, there was a story at a medical conference recently where one man asked the other, knowing that he was an ear, nose and throat specialist, what he specialised in and the other man replied that he specialised in the antrum; he was then asked whether is was left or right.  This is the kind of specialisation we have.  It is largely correct to say that when I went to college there were really only mechanical engineers and civil engineers but now there are seven or eight or more different types of engineers emerging from university and they go on to specialise in various post-graduate courses and so on.  To suggest therefore in the legal profession where at present there are only two divisions that these two should merge into one seems to me to be swimming very much against the tide.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, the division is a sensible and workable one.  In very general terms, solicitors look after the day-to-day problems, the office work for their clients, whereas anything that goes to court is looked after by the barristers. This is, of course, a very natural and sensible way of dealing with it.  It would be impossible for any one lawyer to spend, on the one hand, all day in his office dealing with clients and, on the other hand, to spend all day in court. This, in a sense, is what seems to be suggested by those advocating a merger of the professions.</P>
    <P>The system is a particularly useful and <Col N="203" /> suitable one for the small office, the one-man firm in a small town because he does his work in the ordinary way.  He probably appears in the District Court himself, gets a junior counsel for the Circuit Court and then when he has the occasional High Court case he is able to bring in senior counsel.  If once or twice in his lifetime he has some outstandingly important case he is able to get the best and most appropriate person in the Law Library to deal with this special case. There is tremendous flexibility in this system. Flexibility is particularly important and useful for the office in a small town where the solicitor can get exactly the counsel he needs for a particular purpose. The merger of the professions would present no problem at all for the very big Dublin firms because they already have 15, 20 or more people in the office and they would quite simply take in half-a-dozen barristers to do the court work and would carry on much the same as usual. For them a merger would not present any difficulty for the simple reason that they already specialise and would continue to specialise, but for the one-man firm it would be very much to his disadvantage, the disadvantage of his clients and ultimately to the disadvantage of the public in general.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt whatever that the present division of the profession into barristers and solicitors is a very appropriate and sensible one and the rather facile and simplistic criticism of it is ill-conceived and does not really stand up to examination.</P>
    <P>As regards legal education, I am not in a position to comment on education as far as the Incorporated Law Society is concerned.  In King's Inns education is both very accessible and very inexpensive and the newly constituted council at the King's Inns have brought many changes and reforms, modernised the education system as far as members of the Bar are concerned and very much improved the quality of the education available.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of uninformed or misguided criticism in recent years suggesting that recent changes would result in a restriction in <Col N="204" /> the number of those being able to do the course in the King's Inns.  In fact, the number of places has increased in the last few years.  At present, there is no limitation on the number of those who wish to do the course there.  Eventually this may be necessary because there has to be some limitation on the number who are able to do the course in any particular year.</P>
    <P>All costs of education are very high but the cost of the course at the King's Inns is certainly lower than at the university and this is in spite of the fact that the King's Inns receive no capitation grant or anything of that kind from the State.  The only subsidy comes from the profession and some scholarships are provided, also.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that the King's Inns provide sufficient places, far more than required by the number who actually want to practise at the bar in any particular year.  Something like 30 barristers actually commence practice each year. The King's Inns now have places for up to 100 and many of those who actually do the course go on to other areas.  To that extent, there are far more places provided than are actually necessary to fulfil the needs of those who wish to practise at the Bar each year.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of judicial appointments, there is mention of qualifications and the method of appointment of members of the Judiciary.  The qualifications are a certain number of years practicising at the Bar and this is the best possible qualification unless we are to have a system which they have in Germany where people are trained specially to be judges.  I do not think that is the best possible system.  As regards setting up some kind of method of picking people for the bench, it is extremely hard to predict who is going to be a good judge and who is not.  What is necessary is experience, temperament, power of assessment and commonsense.  My experience over a number of years at the Bar is that many people who are appointed as judges very often do not turn out as one would have expected, to the extent that some of the most outstanding counsel we have ever had turned out to be very disappointing judges and <Col N="205" /> some rather mediocre counsel turned out to be very outstanding judges.  What a committee or board could do to pick judges I do not know.</P>
    <P>The present system by and large has provided very good results, very adequate results.  Perhaps the Government should have more consultation with the profession before making appointments but apart from that I would not be inclined to agree that there should be a radical change in the method by which judges are appointed.</P>
    <P>I am certainly in favour of reviewing the matters mentioned in the motion and introducing reforms where they are considered necessary.  The motion is too far-reaching and it would take too long to get a report from a single committee.  I would be much more inclined to deal with these matters piecemeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am very glad to be in the Seanad to hear the contributions of the Senators on this topic.  No one will deny that each of the 12 items listed on the motion are of great importance.  I would like to express views on some of the items listed and then to explain my attitude to the motion.</P>
      <P>The matter of legal education has been mentioned by many Senators and it has taken up quite a proportion of the debate.  The Solicitors Act of 1954 vests autonomy in the Incorporated Law Society in regard to the regulation of the educational requirements for admission as a solicitor.  Regulations made by the society under the Act do not require the concurrence of the Minister for Justice and, while every such regulation must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, neither House has power to annul such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Society of King's Inns controls entry to the profession of barrister.  It is an independent body with exclusive control over education, training and admission to the profession.  I understand that education grants are available to qualified students in respect of the professional courses for solicitors and barristers, which I am told the Department of Education recognise as being equivalent <Col N="206" /> to post-graduate study for grant purposes.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that previous Ministers for Justice have commented on the question of legal education.  The emphasis in many of these statements was on the need for reform of legal education and in particular on the desirability of getting the professional bodies to require a university degree in law to be a prerequisite to admission to the profession and on the possibility of establishing a joint professional law school, no doubt with a view to encouraging a more unified profession.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that both of the professional bodies involved have engaged in considerable reform of the structure and content of their educational requirements and activities in recent years.  While some of the changes introduced aimed at professionalising the content of the courses provided are surely welcome developments, others have been criticised largely on the grounds that they have the effect of restricting entry to both branches of the profession and affect the availability of courses of legal education at other institutions.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to debate the arguments relating to these issues in the course of this motion.  However, I personally consider the present entry arrangements to both sides of the profession to be over-restrictive.  I am concerned that, while we have in recent years taken real steps towards making justice more accessible to people, at the same time access to the practice of the law is being made more difficult for persons coming from the less privileged social stratum.  I invite the professional bodies to consider carefully the long-term implications of their policies in this area.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should emphasise that this whole question goes well beyond my area of responsibility and raises wide matters of public policy with regard to third-level education, as well as educational facilities in the broadest sense.  The public criticisms which have been made of the present arrangements have come in general from academic quarters and from student bodies.  While students will be the people most immediately affected by the changes that have been made, they <Col N="207" /> are not, I suggest, the only group affected. Parents and prospective students must also be concerned and the availability, quality and cost of legal services are also important as far as the general administration of justice is concerned.  Taking Senator Robinson's point on access to the law and current interest in legal education and the desirability that the public at large would be better informed on legal matters, any changes which are made, which have been made, or which will be made would be of interest legitimately to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>Two of the Senators made reference to the cost of legal education.  While obviously wandering outside my own particular area, it might be of interest to look at the professional fees charged in other professions.  For example, in UCD the fee charged for a primary degree, to qualify somebody in arts or for secondary teaching as a profession, is £658 for three years and an additional £488 for the Higher Diploma in Education, a total of £2,462.  To qualify as a national teacher in, for example, the College of Education in Drumcondra, over three years costs £1,920.  To become a veterinary surgeon at UCD would cost a total of £4,850; to become a dentist £4,798; to become a doctor, which takes six years, costs a total of £5,013 in UCD and about the same in Trinity; to become a pharmacist takes four years in Trinity College and costs a total of £3,352.  Looking at the fees to gain the professional qualifications necessary for entry to other professions, I do not think the point is valid that the fees for access to the legal profession are prohibitive. They are certainly not more prohibitive than fees for access to the other professions.  Obviously that does not prove anything; it just indicates that fees in third-level colleges are generally high.</P>
    <P>There is an implication in the motion that nothing has been done or is being done on the wide range of legal issues set out.  That is not so.  A number of issues mentioned are already the subject of specialist examination.  The Restrictive Practices Commission have conducted a public inquiry into conveyancing restrictions and the prohibition of advertising <Col N="208" /> by solicitors.  I understand that they have submitted their report to the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and that it is being considered in the Department at present.  The question of examining other alleged restrictive practices referred to in the motion would be appropriate for consideration in connection with the statutory restrictive practices machinery for which the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is responsible.</P>
    <P>An area in which I have statutory responsibility at present is that of legal remuneration and costs.  Here, too, separate inquiries have been carried out in the past.  However, the most usual complaints in relation to this which have come to my Department have come from the profession itself and relate to ministerial refusals to implement proposals to increase costs.</P>
    <P>With regard to the solicitor and client relationship and complaints machinery, I am aware that there have been calls in the past for reforms in this area and in particular for a degree of lay participation in the disciplinary machinery for solicitors, which is the responsibility of the Law Society and the High Court under the Solicitors Acts of 1954 and 1960.  This is a matter which is under consideration in my Department already and I was interested in the points made by Senator Lanigan in this context.</P>
    <P>There are many constitutional implications in regard to the matters concerning the Judiciary included in the motion, in particular the item calling for an inquiry by an independent body into sentencing policy in criminal cases.  Do the movers of this motion envisage that the judges will be called before this body? The Judiciary are, of course, independent in the exercise of their functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.</P>
    <P>In the course of a recent debate in the Dáil on a motion about uniformity in sentences imposed for serious criminal offences, I stressed the unique relationship between both Houses of the Oireachtas on the one hand, and the Judiciary on the other, and that the independence <Col N="209" /> of the Judiciary is at the very heart of our system.  I also said on that occasion that I favoured more consultation among judges and district justices and, apart from consultations, a greater readiness on the part of individual members to take account of the consensus among their colleagues as to what sentences are appropriate.  Obviously, consultation is ineffective if those who partake in it go their own way afterwards and take no notice of the advice offered.</P>
    <P>I indicated that I was prepared to do anything I could, with propriety, to encourage such consultations, when circumstances suggested that they would be useful.  I do not think that I can go beyond that in relation to the terms of the motion, having regard to the Constitution and the other considerations I have referred to.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am aware of the public concern that has been voiced in relation to sentencing.  I can sympathise with that concern.  I have already said that I do not see any possibility of greater uniformity being achieved by legislation. It seems to me that the solution to the problem is within the competence of the courts themselves.  Senators may be aware that under existing legislation there is specific provision for meetings of district justices, under the chairmanship of the President of the District Court, to discuss matters relating to the discharge of the business of that court, including, in particular, the avoidance of undue divergences, and I quote, &ldquo;in the exercise of their jurisdiction by justices&rdquo;.  While there is no similar provision in relation to the other courts there is nothing to prevent such meetings, and in recent years the Chief Justice has been holding meetings of judges and justices to discuss matters of this kind.  I have been happy to facilitate such meetings.  But again I would stress the point that meetings, as such, will be of benefit only if those who participate in those meetings are prepared to take the advice offered by the consensus of their peers.</P>
    <P>This motion presents a difficulty to me because first of all it calls on the Government to establish an independent working party.  Obviously, I cannot accept <Col N="210" /> such a large measure of policy as presented in this motion without consultation with the Government and without the authorisation of the Government.  I have not had an opportunity to discuss it with the Government.  Second &mdash; and the debate has clearly shown this &mdash; it is inter-departmental in nature: many of the things discussed here are appropriate to the Minister for Education and many are appropriate, as I said, to the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism. Third, there is a problem with committees. I think committees have been used frequently in our system to side-step issues which could be dealt with directly, and I do not want to be in a situation in which matters would be referred to a committee and inhibit ministerial action subsequently until a committee has reported.</P>
    <P>But within the constraints of that, and within the time constraints imposed on me by the division bells ringing at the moment, I would like to say that I am very glad to have had the opportunity to listen to the views expressed by the Senators. I will communicate those views to the Government and I hope that in the normal ordering of business in the Seanad, subsequently in some months time there will be an opportunity to look at the situation again.  Beyond that I cannot go for the reasons I have explained, but I will communicate to the Government the views expressed here and I would hope that some mechanism can be provided where I can communicate to the Seanad again on the issues raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to the debate, and obviously the Minister, who has had to depart for a vote in the other House.  I think it is to some extent significant that most of the Senators who contributed are lawyers, which to a certain extent illustrates at least part of the motivation behind this motion.  For a number of other Senators, and Senator Lanigan is an exception to this, it is difficult to know enough about the practice of law and the provision of legal services to feel competent enough to contribute and criticise or make a constructive contribution to the debate.  The <Col N="211" /> mystique and the hidden operations of the law defeat many people who are interested but basically not able to voice or express their criticisms.  That is the first point that I would like to make.</P>
      <P>I think of my two legal colleagues who spoke.  There was a tendency to defend and justify a system in the absence of the kind of examination that this motion basically called for.  It is a case of &ldquo;looking into the legal heart and all is well&rdquo;.  I don't think that is adequate or sufficient. We tend in Ireland to be prepared to carry on with a system even if it is open to criticism, and is criticised, as the present situation with regard to access to legal education and provision of legal services is very substantially cirticised both by students, in so far as it is relevant to legal education, and others in our society, and the ordinary consumer of legal services and those who work with people who do not have access to legal services.  There are very substantial criticisms and I regret that many of these have not been voiced here this evening on this motion.</P>
      <P>Turning to the points that were made by those Senators who contributed, I was interested in a number of the specific points made by Senator Durcan in relation to developments in the content of law courses.  He is correct that there have been very interesting and useful developments in the kinds of courses and indeed the tendency to have an optional structure of the academic law degree courses to enable students to opt for particular subjects and therefore, to some extent, determine their future career opportunities of specialisation.  He is correct that a course in family law was only introduced in any of the law schools here in the early seventies.  That is an area which is still very much neglected and only beginning to form part of law teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also a matter for concern is the whole area of social welfare law, which affects a very substantial number of people and yet it is very hard to get access to knowledge and expertise in the area.  It is significant that this is an area that FLAC are particularly concentrating on at the moment.  They have changed their <Col N="212" /> approach since the introduction of the limited civil legal aid scheme and the operation of the law centres.  FLAC have been concentrating on providing welfare rights centres to provide knowledge and information about welfare rights to that sector of the population who tend not to have access in the normal way to legal services and who are very often deprived of basic knowledge of their rights and the remedies that might be available to them. I spoke to some representatives of FLAC about the work they are doing, and they emphasised the importance, as I would do, of developing the proper neighbourhood community law centres to meet and to expand this demand.</P>
    <P>The representatives of FLAC with whom I discussed this motion also emphasised, in a different way from Senator Durcan, the need for an improvement in the complaints machinery.  Senator Durcan seemed to be relatively happy with the way the complaints machinery operates through the disciplinary committee of the Incorporated Law Society and the reference to the President of the High Court.  That was not the experience of FLAC.  Again and again they said they deal with complaints about individual solicitors or firms.  They advise on how the complaints should be filed with the Incorporated Law Society, and in a very large number of cases, as far as the members of the public are concerned, there the matter rests: nothing effective happens; if anything happens it is not immediately and efficiently done; months pass and very often then at the end of it there is a letter from the disciplinary committee saying the matter is being examined, and there is no cause to bring it any further.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the representatives of the Incorporated Law Society with whom I discussed this motion made the point that in their view and in the view of the Incorporated Law Society as a whole, the disciplinary committee do not have adequate teeth.  They pointed out that following the successful legal challenge that was mounted in 1954, and the change in the position, the Disciplinary Committee of the Incorporated Law Society cannot themselves impose any sanctions. <Col N="213" /> They cannot fine, or suspend or take any direct action against a solicitor or firm that has been involved in what would be regarded as malpractice.  They can merely refer the matter to the President of the High Court and he then has power to impose sanctions.  The representatives of the Incorporated Law Society admitted that there are delays and inadequacies in that system and that they would welcome some strengthening of it and some examination of it.  There is a need for a public component there, and the Minister referred to this.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan was the only Member of the House who spoke as a non-lawyer, and I think he spoke with the experience of a parent who has a child who has just gone through law school and who may wish to go on to one of the professional courses.  A number of the points he made would be a fairly wide reflection of public criticism of some of the cost and inaccessability of the system.  He commented on this motion as being too wide-ranging and that it might have been preferable, perhaps, to have two separate motions &mdash; one on legal education and another on the whole question of provision of legal services.  Indeed, Senator Eoin Ryan made a similar comment about the width of the suggested terms of reference.  To some extent, the broad framing of the motion was for practical reasons, but it is difficult to get time for Private Members' motions in this House to have matters discussed and, therefore, there is the temptation at least to frame a motion in such a broad context that various issues of competing and perhaps equal importance can be raised and discussed.</P>
    <P>More relevantly, whenever there is a discussion about either access to or the contents of legal education that leads to a consideration of the provision of legal services, this leads on naturally to the consideration of the way in which we provide legal services in the State.  Similarly, you cannot discuss for any length of time the provision of legal services without looking at access to legal education and the way in which that is structured, and the division between academic law and the courses offered by the two branches of the profession.  So it is better <Col N="214" /> to have a broadly framed motion which raises these issues and gives an opportunity for full examination of them.  Also, the motion is flexible in expressly permitting the independent working party, if established, to bring in separate reports on different aspects of it and, therefore, to establish an order of priorities of what is to be examined first, and different working parties on different aspects under the broad auspices of the independent working party.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Eoin Ryan and the Minister referred to the part of the motion which deals with the Judiciary.  Both, as I would do myself, quite properly emphasised the importance of the independence of the Judiciary under our system.  That, of course, is not in any way threatened or intended to be undermined, by this motion.  However, it is worth drawing attention to the fact that there is no provision in Ireland for any refresher or specialist courses for members of the Judiciary. That is in striking contrast to developments in other countries.  There has been an increasing tendency to provide for specialist courses and refresher seminars and opportunities for members of the Judiciary at various levels to inform themselves and to acquire further knowledge of the areas of law with which they may have to deal in court.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Durcan about the need for a greater injection of funds into certain areas of the administration of justice. An extremely important and not very well understood point is the under-funding of the whole administration of the courts system: the failure to appoint registrars in certain areas; indeed, the question of whether we have enough judges, particularly of the High Court, to deal with the backlog of cases that has now arisen.</P>
    <P>We could do other things which do not cost, to improve the way in which judges are able to do some of the work, particularly in the High and Supreme Courts. There was a report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure away back in 1970 on the judges of the Supreme Court, on the operations of the Supreme Court, which recommended that Supreme Court judges should have law <Col N="215" /> clerks allocated to them to help them with research into their judgments and to provide the kind of backup service which law clerks provide in the United States and in other jurisdictions.  This is something which will be well worth examining because there are very long delays at times &mdash; I would submit unacceptable delays &mdash; in the handing down of judgments in serious cases, be they serious constitutional cases or cases that raise difficult legal issues.</P>
    <P>That is understandable, because the only support service for judges at the moment is a typist, and even there I understand certain judges have difficulty in getting typed judgments which they have prepared and written up.  There is just that bare minimum service.  They should have the possibility of using research facilities, and this would provide useful and very good job opportunities and experience for graduates coming out of law schools.  I have heard it said that in fact graduates coming out of law schools are only fit to write the draft opinions of Supreme Court judges: that that is what they are best trained for when they come out of law schools.  It is something which I think would be very well worth examining.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his contribution displayed his own interest as Minister in the areas under examination and made the point, which I accept, that a number of the issues are broader than the scope of his jurisdiction as Minister for Justice. They involve the Department of Education, the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and I would submit, possibly other Departments such as the Department of Health in this whole area of preventive law and the development of neighbourhood law centres which would bring the knowledge and the relevance of law much closer to large population centres and areas which are not properly provided with a legal service at present.</P>
    <P>I accept, therefore, that the motion goes beyond his jurisdiction but I am pleased that he has indicated he will draw to the attention of the Government the points made here today.  I hope it will be <Col N="216" /> possible, by raising the matter on the Adjournment, to request some reference back to this House of the attitude of the Government: whether there is a willingness to establish the independent working party which is called for.</P>
    <P>I made very clear when moving this motion the nature of the independent working party which the Labour group envisaged.  Senator Eoin Ryan raised this point.  I do not think he was here when I was outlining the nature of that independent working party.  The motion is broad enough and framed in terms that give it a considerable flexibility, but I still maintain, and I do not think that this debate in any way has answered that basic point in the tabling of the motion, that there is an unanswerable case for looking into the situation.  We cannot, particularly lawyers cannot, look into their hearts and say &ldquo;All is well and there is no real need for an examination&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it is even a greater matter of public concern that the whole area is so removed from criticism as so much of the practice of our law really is.  There may be some criticisms on the ground that it is so difficult for people from the outside to penetrate and to make any impact on the very entrenched, very privileged position of the legal profession in Ireland.  It is necessary that we as a democratic country, as a country which values the importance of the whole process and system of law, have that kind of examination and that we know then at the end of it where the areas are that are really in need of reform and how we make progress on them.</P>
    <P>My final point is that I very much support the Minister's own desire not to hold things up by referring matters to a committee. I urge him, if there are areas in which he feels it is necessary to move more rapidly, these are areas which need not be referred to any working party or committee when established.  We can progress on them with perhaps a Bill or a further opportunity in this House to discuss those specific reforms.  I again thank the Minister and other Senators for contributing and I would hope we will have a further opportunity in the near <Col N="217" /> future to assess the response of the Government to this motion.</P>

It might be convenient, if we agreed, that we would have a single debate on all of these motions, with, of course, separate decisions. We will be taking the Criminal <Col N="218" /> Justice (Community Service) Bill, which was not reached today.  The Dáil is expected to pass today the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, which is concerned with local charges, and it is expected to pass the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill tomorrow. In accordance with an undertaking I gave last week, I hope we will be able to take next week the Government motion on Developments in the European Communities.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 29 June 1983.</P>
