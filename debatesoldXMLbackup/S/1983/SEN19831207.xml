      <P>I have notice from Senator Bulbulia that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The present inadequacy of Ballygunner National School, County Waterford, and the proposals for its replacement.</P>
      <P>I regard this matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. or earlier if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and to take No. 5 if time is available.  The Senators of course are familiar with the phenomenon that towards the end of the session we have a rush of legislation.  Accordingly, I think the House should endeavour to clear any legislation that it has before it at the moment.  Therefore, I propose that if we do not complete the four Bills that are before us today we should sit tomorrow morning in order to complete them and to avoid undue congestion next week and the week after.  For the information of the House I might say it is proposed to <Col N="812" /> sit on Wednesday, 14 December and Tuesday, 20 December.  In regard to the motion, I suggest we do not follow the usual practice of breaking for it at 5 o'clock, but rather we let the legislation go on and if there is sufficient time to enable us to make a worthwhile start on the motion then we should do so today. This question of course, can be reviewed by the Whips as the day develops.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business it has been customary to make expressions of sympathy in regard to persons of note or in cases that affect us particularly.  I would like the Seanad to note with horror and dismay the death of the Assembly man, Edgar Graham, who was murdered outside Queen's University, Belfast, this morning.  It has been said by a noted writer that in the death of every man each of us dies a little.  I think this is horribly true for us here in Ireland today that for every one of these victims of violence not only do we die a little but our hopes for our country die a little with every one of these outrages.  It is pointless to talk at length, words cannot reflect one's feelings but I did think it was well that it should be referred to briefly in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join the Leader of the House in his expressions of abhorrence at the wilful murder that took place this morning.  I think that in doing so we should also say that we do not condone any of the violence occurring North or South of the Border in recent months and indeed for the past number of years.  The name of Ireland is being blackened no matter where we go because of the senseless murders which take place right throughout this island which, in some instances, are being done in the name of nationalism, and there is no doubt that they are not furthering the nationalist case.  In some cases they are said to be done in the name of republicanism, in other cases to be done in a Unionist sense.  Anybody who knows the origin of the word republican would realise that nobody would commit murder in that cause.  There is no point in making a long speech.  I join with the Leader of the House in his expression of sympathy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Robb</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak.  I should like to join in the expressions of sympathy from the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition.  It has been a particularly sad and distressing time, this last hour, because I have debated with Edgar Graham and although I would be opposed to the point of view that he held, I respected him as a fearless man who always said what he believed.  He never left anybody in any doubt about where he stood on any question and he stood before his opponents with great courage. Recently someone tried in a snide way to tell me that he was a lightweight &mdash; they have their answer today.  Senators may have seen a little programme which was done on our group last August, some of them were generous enough to participate in it.  Edgar Graham, from the Unionist tradition, was also generous enough to participate in it.  I remember him well last year facing a very hostile audience in Queen's University, Belfast. The union was packed and Mr. John Hume, myself and the late Edgar Graham had been asked to address the audience. I realised that night that this very young man, highly intelligent, with such a boyish face, was able to take criticism as easily as he gave it.  If men such as Edgar Graham are to be designated legitimate targets, there is no one in this House who is not also a legitimate target and I think that the people of Ireland should all ask themselves individually to what extent each one of us has contributed to the murder of Edgar Graham by not becoming involved in the tragedy that is Northern Ireland today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The murder of a representative is surely the ultimate expression of contempt for a tradition and I submit that there is no tradition in Ireland that is deserving of this sort of contempt.  Assassination is the ultimate sign of decadence and it brings together the three points that Eric Fromm talked about a generation ago, necrophilia, the love of death, narcissism, a belief in the purity of your own cause to the exclusion of all others and incestuous fixation, ancestor worship or the worship of soil and blood.  If we <Col N="814" /> look at ourselves in Ireland today we can see that we have plenty of those three things.  The only real tribute to Edgar Graham is whether we can turn around with a change of heart and a re-birth of the human spirit to promote growth and life where at present there is so much decadence, despair and hatred.  I send to his wife and family my sincerest sympathy and I am sure I speak for all in this historic Chamber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little I can add to what Senator Robb has said but I would like to join with him, the Leader of the House and Senator Lanigan in deploring this new horror and expressing sympathy with the wife and family of the dead man.  Once we get into the business of saying that someone is or is not a legitimate target that seems to be the beginning of the end as far as brotherhood, reconciliation and genuine peace in this country is concerned.  Once you start discarding the Commandment &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo; there is no end to the horrors that can be perpetrated.  In recent weeks we have seen a new escalation of what can be done.  Like Senator Robb, I am particularly moved by this event because these are my people too.</P>
      <P>I know that Senators are with me in expressing sympathy to those who have been bereaved in this tragedy.  When we say such-and-such is justifiable or so-and-so is a legitimate target, are we not contributing to the continuation of what has become a war?  Once we say that people on one side are legitimate targets then we open the doors to the other side to say that their opponents are also legitimate targets and there is an escalation of violence as has happened in the past week.  I hope that this will perhaps make people feel more strongly about what they can do positively to try to stop this slaughter and in such a way contribute towards the promotion of a peaceful solution, but I fear that things have reached the stage when it is very difficult to see anything of the sort happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I join with the Leader of the House <Col N="815" /> in condemning this outrage which occurred today.  I also extend to the late Edgar Graham's family our deepest sympathy. When we read daily of tit for tat killings and of people claiming credit almost for the disastrous deeds which are being done &mdash; as Senator Lanigan said &mdash; in the name of the Irish people, we must ask ourselves when this cancer will ever stop, especially in this season of good-will.  What good-will has been shown when there is no respect for human life? These people do not even respect points of view expressed.  It is a tragedy to be in this shocking situation just coming up to Christmas when people are being murdered for the sake of political beliefs or otherwise which none of us &mdash; even those who want to see Ireland united &mdash; shares. We do not want to see Ireland reunited at any cost if that is what is in the minds of these people.  The cost of human life is a primary one and those of us on this side of the House do not condone this in any sense or form.  It is with regret that it is the Leader's duty today to express this sympathy or that the reason for it should ever arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. Listening to Senator Robb something came to mind that Terence McSwiney said a long time ago: &ldquo;It is not those who can inflict the most but those who can endure the most who will triumph&rdquo;.  If any message should go out from this House today it is that, irrespective of what the brutal men who claim to act on our behalf do, those of us who disagree or have been angry about many things, have the capacity and the will to endure whatever these people throw at us and still endure.  What we believe in, freedom and democracy and the rights of minorities to freedom and democracy, cannot be defeated by violence.  We have a capacity, as civilised people, to endure whatever they throw at us and still say they are wrong.  We will not be defeated because we can and will endure in spite of anything that brutal men can throw at us.  I hope that all of us will reflect more and more deeply on whether it is ever justifiable, in any circumstances, to <Col N="816" /> resort to warfare to do anything because I believe that human beings have the capacity to endure whatever brute force is used against them without being defeated.  The message that a democratic institution like the Houses of the Oireachtas have to convey again and again is that violence will not triumph because we will endure whatever is thrown at us and we will not be brutalised by violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenMcGonagle" hpid="Mr. McGonagle Mr. McGonagle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGonagle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a deep sense of shame that I stand to address the Seanad today on this brutal murder.  It is no less brutal, it may be said, than all the other murders.  Quite so, I agree.  The people of Northern Ireland have suffered for 14 years.  No one will ever be able to assess the degree and depth of their suffering and their anguish.  Perhaps the numbers of people committing suicide or those committed to mental institutions give some indication.  What is it doing to children in the name of God?  These people are not acting in my name or &mdash; I would like to think that Senators agree with me &mdash; in the name of the Irish people.  Democracy is on trial.  There is destabilisation in Northern Ireland.  It is plain to be seen but efforts are being made to destabilise the situation in the Republic of Ireland and that is not so plain to be seen.  Mr. Owen Carron said in Manchester that that was his objective. I must take it then he was speaking for Sinn Féin, for the extremists or whatever. If even a degree of destabilisation comes to the Republic, democracy is really in trouble because I never stop to praise the democratic concept in the Republic of Ireland and point with pride to it to the people of the North in my efforts to try to get reconciliation and conciliation.  I have not always failed nor have the Protestant people turned a deaf ear to me because probably I was anti-sectarian, not so much non-sectarian; in a quiet, neutral, indifferent kind of way, I was a militant, active anti-sectarian.  Perhaps that is why I was accepted in the North and was never knocked for my views which I stated publicly.  They all knew where I stood, for unification of the people of Ireland, not six or 26 green <Col N="817" /> fields but for the people of Ireland, a different proposition.  It is difficult to try to convince the great bulk of the Protestant people that they can live with us in sympathy and in harmony.</P>
      <P>Will anyone dare tell me that by shooting Edgar Graham or anybody else they will unite the people of Ireland?  That kind of shooting is counter-productive, so you get tit for tat.  But I am scorching with flame the people who dare to represent that what they are doing in their murderous violence is uniting the people of Ireland.  That is not the way to unite people and I am talking about the unification of the Protestant people in the North with the rest of us in Ireland and I feel very, very badly today.  I have already spoken with Senator Robb with shame in my heart and a very uneasy mind.  This is not the way and we will have to try to get it stopped.  Perhaps speeches like we are making today might make a contribution to that end.  I do not know.  I am not too sure what the motivation is among these people.  I am not sure what their ideology is.  People tell me they want a socialist republic.  I am a socialist.  These people are not socialists. They do not understand what the word means.  No decent minded socialist, even a Marxist, would hardly be involved in what these people are doing.  Ireland is divided on a sectarian basis by every action of these people. Partition is here for a long time to come because of their activities.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, is it intended that item No. 6 will be taken before Christmas?  This item has been on the Order Paper since the beginning of the session.  In view of the urgency of debating what is happening in Europe at this stage it is the most urgent item that is hanging over the House at present. I should like the Leader of the House to give consideration to taking it before Christmas.</P>

      <P>With regard to No. 6, I have been in touch over the past few days with the office of the Minister, as the Minister himself was taking part in the Athens Summit.  I have asked the <Col N="818" /> Minister to hold himself available for next Wednesday in case there is time to debate the EEC motion.  I emphasise again that we should endeavour to deal with our legislation as some of it is urgent. I have been contemplating taking the motion before Christmas if at all possible. If we find ourselves pressed with legislation I will guarantee that the House could meet in the middle of Janaury to take it in Government time.  With all Senator Lanigan's enthusiasm I am sure he would not want to sit on Christmas Eve to take this.  I assure the House if there is not room for it before Christmas, we will take it in the second or third week of January.</P>

    <Title>Intoxicating Liquor (National Concert Hall) Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the grant of a special licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor in the National Concert Hall.  This is necessary because doubts have arisen as to the validity of the liquor licence now held by the concert hall.</P>
      <P>Under existing law a certificate of the Circuit Court is required before a new liquor on-licence can be issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  Since 1902, there is a further statutory requirement that a new on-licence cannot be granted unless the applicant has extinguished at least one licence of the type sought to be obtained.  In an urban area a new on-licence can be granted on proof that there has been an increase of at least 25 per cent in the population of the civil parish since 1901, but an existing licence in the city or town would also have to be extinguished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licence now held by the concert hall was granted on foot of a Circuit Court certificate but in view of the doubts which have arisen about the validity of this licence the Attorney General appealed to the High Court to have the licence quashed.  The appeal has been <Col N="819" /> adjourned and an opportunity now exists to regularise the matter by way of new legislation.</P>
    <P>There are precedents in the licensing code, in relation to premises such as airports, the bus station at Aras Mhic Diarmada and three Dublin theatres, for the grant of special liquor licences without a preliminary certificate of the Circuit Court.  These precedents were borne in mind in the drafting of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the principal provision of the Bill.  By virtue of this provision, the Revenue Commissioners will be required to grant a special liquor licence for the concert hall on application by the company or their nominee.  A prior court certificate will not be required nor will it be necessary to comply with the provision in the licensing code as to extinguishing an existing licence.  The licence will remain valid as long as the concert hall remains at its present location and will not have to be renewed annually.</P>
    <P>The licence will authorise the sale of liquor to patrons and persons taking part in functions and to employees at the concert hall, from half an hour before the function until one hour afterwards.  For this purpose &ldquo;function&rdquo; covers concerts &mdash; which may be regarded as the primary activity of the concert hall &mdash; and also conferences.</P>
    <P>There is a penalty provision in subsection (3) to cover the unlikely eventuality that drink might be sold at the concert hall otherwise than in accordance with the terms of the licence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that upon the grant of the special licence envisaged in the Bill the liquor licence now held by the concert hall will cease to have effect.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that certain provisions of the licensing code will not apply in relation to the concert hall.  Since the normal regime of permitted hours will not apply, the application to the concert hall licence of provisions relating to exemption orders and occasional licences, or the provisions relating to prohibited hours, would not be appropriate. The exclusion of Part III of the 1927 Act means that the provisions in the code <Col N="820" /> relating to the endorsement and forfeiture of licences will not apply to the concert hall licence.</P>
    <P>I think it will be generally agreed that the National Concert Hall has been a great success and has provided a very welcome addition to the cultural life of this country.  The hall is administered by the National Concert Hall Company, incorporated on 27 March 1981 and it gets an annual State subvention, the amount for the current year being about £170,000.</P>
    <P>I trust it will be agreed by Members of this House that the grant of a special liquor licence for the National Concert Hall is fully justified in view of its unique national position.  The present Bill proposes to ensure that the hall has a liquor licence commensurate with its needs.  I trust that this Bill will be accepted as a straightforward and non-controversial measure and I recommend it to the Seanad for acceptance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my first time to speak on a Bill in this House in the presence of the Minister of State and I should like to take the opportunity to welcome her to the House.  We on this side of the House support the Bill.  I should like to place on record our deep appreciation for the manner in which the National Concert Hall has performed, so to speak, since its opening night.  The standards achieved to date have surpassed many of our most optimistic expectations.  We all have a great sense of pride in the fact that already so many famous orchestras have performed there.  There was an historic performance by the Russian Symphony Orchestra, and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra have also performed there.  We should also mention our National Youth Orchestra.  When I am driving I hear radio performances by them from the National Concert Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad that there is a balance being maintained in the National Concert Hall.  Irish music, ballads and folklore are getting much attention at this very high level.  I understand that the concert hall is paying its way and we must pay a special tribute to the public for giving almost maximum support to it.  It is quite <Col N="821" /> evident that our National Concert Hall of which we are all so proud, is giving good value for money and giving entertainment at the very highest level which is not that easy to find in the present climate.  We are glad that the hall did not turn out to be another national monument. It is very much alive and long may it live.</P>
    <P>However, there are a few aspects of this Bill which need some clarification although the Minister has clarified some in her statement.  I refer specifically to section 3 which provides that sections 4 and 5 and Part III of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1962 and the provisions in relation to the prohibited hours of the Acts shall not apply in relation to the concert hall.  That is fair enough.  The Minister mentioned that intoxicating liquor could be served for half an hour prior to a function or a concert and for one hour afterwards.  The section of the 1927 Act to which I have referred relates to abuses or alleged abuses in the licensed trade.  I was a little concerned that we might be setting another principle in this regard but we in this House should ask ourselves how will the licensed trade in general react to the section being revoked once again.</P>
    <P>There are people in the licensed trade whose livelihoods are about to be taken away from them as a result of this section of the Act.  I would like to take this opportunity to tell the Minister that the section is becoming more difficult each day to comply with.  This is due to such factors as the high cost of drink and people coming late into the ordinary public house.  The advent of the breathalyser test was another factor in that.  When people put back their drinking by an hour it is impossible for the licensed trade to operate under the Act as it stands.  It is impossible to clear a public house in the time stated.  The onus to vacate a premises at present is on the licensee.  I firmly believe that the onus should be shared at least by the customer.  With the best will in the world it is impossible today for a licensee to comply with the Act.  More detail and attention are being paid by the <Col N="822" /> Garda to ensuring that pubs are cleared on time than are being paid by them to the protection of other sections of the community. In saying that I am not reflecting on the Garda.  I fully support them.  They are there for the protection of the people and deserve every co-operation from the public.  However, one can be sure that gardaí will be on duty, especially half an hour after closing time, yet in my own town only last week we were awakened in the middle of the night by people who had stolen a car in Dublin, driven down to the quiet town of Oldcastle, broke in a window of a premises that a man had spent a lot of money on after purchasing and renovating it and cleared off with about £7,000 worth of clothing.  We had no gardaí on duty in this quiet, respectable town of Oldcastle during that night. This is what is happening around the country.  The legislation needs to be changed urgently.  The ordinary people in the licensed trade &mdash; I speak mostly of the family-run public house &mdash; when they had the handling of the drinks trade in this country ensured that we had not the problems that exist today in this area. While there may be exceptions in terms of abuses, people in the licensed trade know in their hearts and souls that people who engage in after-hours business go out of business eventually themselves because of that fact alone.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the licensed trade, red lights are flashing and I would say that it is time the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism took immediate steps to salvage an industry which is crippled by the most extravagant demands that have ever been placed on any commercial aspect of business either in this or in any other country.  It is a fact <Col N="823" /> that what was thought to be the goose that lays the golden egg it is now a drooping hen.  Anybody who knows what a drooping hen is knows what the life expectancy is.

I was not a Member of this House, and I do not know how many people here were, when the Act was put into effect. The Performing Right Society have the power under an Act whereby they can walk into any hotel or other public place especially where intoxicating liquor is being served and where public performances or, indeed, television programmes or tape music is being played and document the number of days that either live performances have taken place or tape music has been played, make an assessment and then demand from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister to look into that aspect of it.  I think that legislation should be either amended or abolished completely.  It is quite stupid. Having made those remarks I would ask the Minister to look into the points I stressed in regard to the licensed trade in general.</P>
      <P>We are all very proud of our National Concert Hall and we wish it every success. The Minister is quite right in introducing this Bill at this time instead of waiting until later on when it could be a long drawn out affair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Concert Hall is our newest national institution and one that we are all very proud of.  As the Minister said in her opening remarks, it has already acquired a unique national position.  It is a great tribute to the management and to everyone with responsibility <Col N="824" /> for running the National Concert Hall that in less than two years it has acquired this position in Irish life.  That in great measure is due to the standard of performances and to the general way in which the concert hall is managed.  As such, I welcome this Bill in so far as it allows certain necessary facilities to be provided at the National Concert Hall.  I should like to take this opportunity to wish the concert hall well when this facility is operational.</P>
      <P>The fact that we are considering this Bill begs a question.  Why are we considering it?  We are considering it because our licensing laws are a most dreadful mish-mash and ragbag.  Our licensing laws are in a most appalling condition.  It is a terrible indictment of legislators over the past 60 years that it is necessary for the National Concert Hall to seek legislation to ensure that licensing facilities are available.  It is most peculiar that without legislation they cannot acquire these facilities.</P>
      <P>If one examines the development of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts over the past 60 years one will see that this kind of piecemeal development has taken place.  We have had special legislation to allow licences for greyhound tracks.  We had to have special legislation to provide a licence at Store Street bus station.  We had to have special legislation to provide licensing facilities at our turf-burning peat stations.  Of course, as the Minister said in her opening remarks, we had to have special legislation to provide for the licensing of airports.  In fact in County Mayo we already have one licensed airport and I look forward to enjoying a drink at the Barr na Coille pub when the Connaught Regional Airport becomes operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most peculiar that all of this legislation is necessary for each of these individual situations.  The question must be asked &mdash; and I would like to get the Minister's comment on it &mdash; why have the licensing laws not been codified or updated?  In recent years we have seen codification in certain areas of our legislation. The Income Tax Acts have essentially been codified, the Social Welfare Acts were codified fairly recently, but in <Col N="825" /> this particular case no effort, apparently has been made at all, despite the fact that since the foundation of the State we have had two-and-a-half special commissions dealing with the Liquor Licensing Acts. In 1925 we had a special commission. That commission recommended, on page 4 of their report, that codification be effected.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The first licensing Statute for Ireland was passed in the year 1634 and since that time the law has been constantly altered, amended and repealed by various Acts with the result that the licensing law has now become a veritable legal jungle in which none but the most intrepid and skilful explorer can find his way.  We, therefore, recommend that the codification and consolidation of the existing law should be undertaken without delay.</P>
    <P>Again in 1956 another commission was set up.  In paragraph 46 of that commission's report they recommended consolidation of the licensing laws.  Despite those strong recommendations, following both of those commissions, all that happened was that amending legislation to deal with individual situations was introduced.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to set in train, within her own responsibility as junior Minister with responsibility for law reform, some steps to ensure that the licensing laws are updated.  At a recent meeting of the legislation committee I raised this issue.  I know that the legislation committee of the Joint Houses are to consider the matter in the future but I should like to see some impetus coming from the Department of Justice on this issue.</P>
    <P>In her opening remarks the Minister referred also to the fact that if one wants to get a new seven-day licence one must go to the Circuit Court.  Of course she is right.  One must get a certificate from the Circuit Court and go from there to the Revenue Commissioners.  If one wants to get a wholesale beer dealer's licence one goes to the District Court and from there to the Revenue Commissioners.  If one wants to get a wholesale spirit dealer's licence, one goes directly to the Revenue Commissioners.  If one wants to have a <Col N="826" /> hotel licensed, one goes first to Bord Fáilte and from there to the Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot see why a single avenue is not available, why a single licensing authority is not constituted for all types of licences and indeed why the types of licences we have are not looked at because many of them are obsolete, representing licences and circumstances which existed in the nineteenth century and have no bearing whatsoever on twentieth century life.  There is an urgent need for the Minister to look at these areas and to see that the kind of consolidation I am talking about should be introduced.</P>
    <P>When I mention the kind of licences which are irrelevant, one can equally comment on the difficulty there is in licensing outlets which exist and which are very necessary to a twentieth century economy.  I refer to our restaurants and the difficulty in getting proper licensing facilities for them.  Despite many calls in this House in my short time here, and also outside it, nothing has been done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>They are some of the points I wish to make on this Bill.  The main question is <Col N="827" /> that we must have a commitment to the consolidation and codification of the licensing laws.  It is something which should be put in train immediately.  If I can refer to the specific terms of the Bill itself&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the generalities of the Acts, but coming to the specific terms of the Bill, I am a little worried about section 2(3) which provides for the creation of an offence when a person sells intoxicating liquor to someone other than a person attending at the concert hall or taking part in a function or employed at the concert hall.  That would seem to create a very strict statutory offence.  The Minister should consider inserting the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; after &ldquo;who&rdquo; in subsection (3).  At this stage it may be difficult to introduce an amendment but it is something the Minister and her advisers might consider.</P>
      <P>I am also a little concerned about the very specific definition of &ldquo;The Concert Hall&rdquo; in section 1.  There may be a reason for this because licences are, of course, granted for specific premises.  But what happens if the concert hall decides to change venue?  What happens if the concert hall should acquire additional premises, if we have an expanding concert hall?  Does that mean that we cannot have licensing facilities there?  The definition as contained in section 1 is very restrictive but there may be very good reasons for that.</P>
      <P>They are the only comments I wish to make.  My main concern is that there does not appear to be any action from the Department of Justice in relation to codification and I would like to see a commitment from the Minister on that.  I would like to wish the concert hall well with his new facility being made available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CatherineMcGuinness" hpid="Mrs. McGuinness Mrs. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill, which is to provide a reasonable facility for the concert hall, and in wishing <Col N="828" /> the concert hall itself well.  I have a particular interest in this field and indeed I remember &mdash; it must be at least 20 years ago &mdash; singing in concerts for the Music Association of Ireland, which were aimed at raising money to provide us with a national concert hall.  No one could be more pleased than myself to see such a fine concert hall provided and also to see that this gives an opportunity for Irish artists &mdash; also artists from abroad, but principally Irish artists &mdash; to have a venue in which they can give live performances of their work.  In the whole field of music, of the theatre, of the Arts and so on, it is extremely important that as a State and as a Government we should encourage the performances of our own artists.  In passing, it might be interesting to note that our own artists have been outside playing music here, in the hope of attracting our attention to the necessity for us to support the live theatre.  While I know that other people have got away with wandering into shebeens and the licensed trade generally, perhaps I might get away with wandering into the live theatre and suggest that we all might support this campaign to reduce or remove VAT on theatre tickets, which would give an opportunity to Irish artists.</P>
      <P>To return to the concert hall itself, it is particularly important when you provide a national venue like this, to have proper facilities with it.  It is a very impressive when one goes to the concert hall so see the fine surroundings and the fine facilities that are provided.  This is brought home to us when we see how sadly other live performance institutions have been neglected.  Those of us who have been attending the operas in recent weeks have seen the decay of the Gaiety Theatre and have hopes that help may be given to it in the future.  One of the important things about the concert hall is that when one goes into the building one is surrounded by a fine ambiance.  This Bill to facilitate proper licensing facilities will add to that and help to provide facilities to the patrons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker is right in suggesting that the licensing laws and many other sections of our laws need to be codified and reformed.  It is noticeable <Col N="829" /> that as regards the licensing laws in the useful series of volumes produced by Mr. Woods on the law in the District Court he has to devote a whole volume, and by no means a slim volume, to the licensing laws alone as they apply in that court apart from the Circuit Court and the other courts.  This bears out what has been said about the extreme complexity of the present code and the necessity for its simplification and reform.  Those of us who travel abroad will see quite clearly the kind of difficulties that are created in this country by the licensing code as compared with what happens in other countries. I hope the Government will turn their attention to this in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I hope it will lead to dealing with this whole situation as regards licensing of various types of premises on a more rational basis than is the case at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMagner" hpid="Mr. Magner Mr. Magner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Magner</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the Bill I should like to take this opportunity of belatedly congratulating the Minister of State on her appointment.  She is widely admired for her work with women's groups.  In Cork the Minister of State is well liked among Labour supporters but for so long as they admire her and vote Labour I will have no objection whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill I will not range over either restaurants, pubs or shebeens because the only interest I have in drink is as a consumer.  The Opera House in Cork has a licence and we should be generous enough to allow the concert hall in Dublin have one also.  However, there is one matter that disturbs me.  I am thinking of fancy clubs, some in Dublin and some in London.  What is the definition of a function or a conference?  It is like a picket.  How many people constitute a picket?  How many people constitute a function?  I would hate to think that we would pass a Bill that would set up a very elitist sort of shebeen.  A person interested in arts and crafts and more interested in good whiskey might repair at any hour of the day or night to partake not in cultural events but in other sorts of events so the definition may be broad.  Maybe I am jealous because I am from Cork and I <Col N="830" /> could not participate if that situation came about, but I would ask the Minister when replying to define the function of a conference because that could conceivably be a loophole.  I welcome the fact that the concert hall after many years of planning and so on is now there and is very successful in its own right.  It is only proper that it has civilised facilities which I hope will be used by all within the confines of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to join with my colleagues in extending a welcome to the Minister of State.  It is my first time to speak in her presence in the House.  I admire the work she is doing in her role as junior Minister with responsibility for law reform.  I would ask, like Senator Durcan, that within her area of law reform she would look seriously and urgently at the question of reform of the liquor laws as they stand.</P>
      <P>I will, in the course of what I have to say, advance reasons as to why that is desirable.  You allowed some of my colleagues a passing reference to certain subjects and you might permit me to do the same.  I will be very brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not abuse your kindness in that regard.  In relation to Senator Lynch's comments with regard to the Performing Right Society, I fully endorse his observations and I would suggest that there is common cause between us here to face this issue and hopefully to resolve it satisfactorily.  Shebeens are not a feature of Mayo alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Durcan referred to the licensing of restaurants.  It was inevitable that this question would be referred to.  I am satisfied that in this regard misconception has been manufactured and successfully sold, because the reality is that the owner of any restaurant who is seriously concerned about obtaining a liquor licence can do so under the law as it stands by normal application to the courts.  The campaign that gave rise to these observations has at its root a desire to avoid the measure of accountability and <Col N="831" /> examination that the licensing laws extend to all applicants through the courts structure.  This is an attempt to get a licence by the back door.  I do not intend to stray further from the point.</P>
    <P>I will now return to the Bill.  I want to assure the Chair in advance that I have taken the utmost care in preparing my remarks so that they would be related to the Bill or to the likely effects of it so the Chair need have no worries in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister concluded her speech by saying that she trusted that the Bill would be accepted as a straightforward and non-controversial measure.  That is a sentiment I cannot accept.  I have reservations in regard to this Bill.  I have reservations in regard to complications that I believe would arise from its passage, and I will endeavour to outline these.</P>
    <P>This is a unique and extraordinary piece of legislation.  It is a historic event in some ways, certainly in so far as that we should realise that when this legislation goes through we will be licensing the largest public house in terms of capacity throughout the length and breadth of this island, north or south.  That will have implications for other licensed retail outlets. The licence that is proposed in this legislation to be given to the Concert Hall is special and unique, and is without parallel so far as the issue of retail liquor licences are concerned.</P>
    <P>As legislators we should all be concerned about one concept that is basic to our legislation, that is enshrined in our Constitution and which has been upheld by the courts on many occasions, that is, that all stand equal before the law.  Therefore, legislation, whatever else it may aim to achieve, should avoid in so far as possible creating within any sections of the community or any sections of the trade or within people, disadvantages for some and advantages for others.  It is against that background that the impact of this Bill should be measured.  I endorse fully the well-deserved tributes that have been paid to the National Concert Hall and to its management in particular.  It has been a success since its establishment two years ago.  It makes and has made a valuable <Col N="832" /> contribution to our national culture; it has a vital role to play in our society and it is playing that role well and adequately. It is providing a much needed facility and I wish it every success in the future.  I hope that it will expand and develop the success that it has achieved to date.</P>
    <P>Equally I accept that the availability of drink is a desirable, probably necessary factor in the successful operation of the concert hall.  I have no objection whatsoever to a liquor licence being available in the National Concert Hall provided that it is granted through the normal channels.  There is a recognised and long-established method by which liquor licences are issued to the courts.  There is a recognised and long-established set of regulations and requirements that applicants for liquor licences must fulfil.  The vast majority of these applicants fulfil these regulations and requirements, in both the obtaining and renewal of their licences.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us proposes to relieve the concert hall of the obligations, requirements and procedures that we expect every other liquor licence holder in this country to comply with.  I am measuring this Bill against the principle of equality of all before the law and in that regard I find it difficult to reconcile what has been proposed here, that a special privileged status be conferred on a building, with the denial of that to other concerns in the same line of business.  I am also concerned with the fact that there is no renewal requirement in relation to the liquor licence for this public house, and I do not use that term in any derogatory sense.  It is a public house in the accepted meaning of the licensing code as we know it to date.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that I have an interest in the licensed trade and I am involved with a trade organisation that represents a major section of the retail liquor trade.  I want to make it clear that despite that, the views I am advancing here are my own personal views.  They may well be supported with knowledge that I have obtained through years of experience at the retail end of the trade. I question what is proposed in the Bill and the implications and effects that this <Col N="833" /> Bill will have, not alone within the liquor licensing code in the years ahead but also at retail level.  I emphasise that I am taking that line on a personal basis and in my role as a legislator in this House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) of the Bill states that the Acts and this Act may be cited together as the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1983, and shall be construed together as one.  Senator Durcan rightly pointed out that the first licensing laws applied to Ireland were enacted in 1634.  One hundred and ninety-nine years later it was found necessary to introduce further laws and indeed to try to combine the existing laws into one understandable, readable and enforceable measure.  I do not know how highly the opinions of His Majesty King George IV in 1833 would be regarded in this House.  The preamble to the Act that was passed in the sixth year of his reign stated that it was necessary to have this legislation because the laws governing the sale of drink in Ireland had become confused, doubtful and complicated. That was stated 199 years after the passage of the first licensing laws in relation to Ireland.  In my opinion, 150 years further on, they are more complicated, confused and doubtful than they ever were.  I join with Senator Durcan in his call for an up-dating of the licensing laws and I regret that the opportunity that presented itself with the presentation of this measure was not availed of to achieve that end.</P>
    <P>About 19 different types of retail liquor licences are issued in this country under the various Licensing Acts from 1833 to date and the situation is confused and unsatisfactory at the moment.  By the passing of this Bill we may well be adding a further layer of confusion to an already confused situation.  I intend to show why I think that.  Perhaps there is an adequate answer, and if there is I will be only too willing to accept it.  In the confusion that has arisen in relation to the various licensing laws they are wide open to abuse and my colleagues here have referred to that abuse.  Their operation, particularly at supermarket, off-licence and wine shop level, is a national disgrace.  I believe there is a direct link between breaches of <Col N="834" /> the licensing laws, illegal trading and alcohol abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder may you make a major speech on the whole licensing trade under this Bill.  I merely say that to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and you may well recall that before the Cathaoirleach left the Chair I made the point that I took special care in preparing my remarks that they would be relevant to the Bill.  I intend to show that.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (2) provides that the Acts and this Act may be cited together as the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1983, and shall be construed together as one.  Therefore, this Bill when it becomes an Act under that subsection becomes part of the entire licensing package.  Other sections of the licensing Acts are being referred to in various parts of the Bill, so I believe that they all impinge on one another.  If the Chair will bear with me I will endeavour to show that the points I am making are related to the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I said, I have read the Bill with interest.  It introduces a totally new concept in liquor licensing at retail level in that it confers on the concert hall and its clientele special privileges, special status and a special drinking environment that will not be enjoyed by other outlets and their customers.  Thirdly, the Bill will discriminate in a most adverse manner against the trading position of adjacent licensed premises, which premises are burdened in addition with constraints that will not apply to the National Concert Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally on that aspect, I am satisfied that under the Bill it will be impossible to prove illegal trading, and I intend to show why I say that.  I want to compare, <Col N="835" /> against the background of equality for all the law, the manner in which we propose to license this building with the regime that we lay down for the ordinary citizen in his application for a retail liquor licence. Under section 2 of this Bill a liquor licence cannot be refused to the National Concert Hall.  No one can deny it to them.  The courts are excluded from this. Contrast that with the situation that the ordinary citizen would face if he were to apply to sell liquor at retail level in, say, Earlsfort Terrace, Lesson Street or adjoining areas.  He would first of all have to apply to the Circuit Court.  He would have to serve public notice, which is an invitation to objections.  He would have to satisfy the court not alone as to his own character, fitness and suitability but equally as to the character, suitability and fitness of the premises proposed to be licensed.  He would have to prove a population increase in the civil parish and that there was need for this additional retail outlet.  He would have to prove that the proposed business would not have an adverse effect on existing retail business in the area and he would have to extinguish an existing liquor licence.  His &mdash; or her &mdash; application could be objected to by the Garda, the local authority who I assume would be Dublin Corporation, the health authority, the fire authority, and local publicans on the basis of damage to their trade.  It could be objected to by local property owners on the basis of interference, noise, or devaluation of property, and it could be objected to by any resident in the civil parish on the basis of noise, traffic or inconvenience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the PP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>He is excluded.  He was included in the 1833 Act but he was subsequently excluded.  These are demanding requirements which the ordinary citizen must meet.  However, under this Bill the concert hall will be spared all this hassle.  It will be sheltered from the risks and objections that may arise and from the requirements and the demands that we make on others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In comparing the privileged way that <Col N="836" /> we propose to grant this licence with the hassle that the ordinary citizen would be confronted with, I want to refer to another fact.  This building has been generously aided by public funds and it receives a subvention from the Exchequer of £170,000 per annum.  These facilities, again, would not be available to any ordinary citizen applying for a liquor licence in that area.  It is a vast building with seating capacity in its main hall for 1,300 people and standing and other capacity for as many more.  I could not help but be amused at Senator Durcan's suggestion that they will be buying further property to extend the trade area.  However, I am simply making the point that here is a vast building with a vast seating capacity, aided by public funds and, furthermore, being provided with a facility in this very special way which we do not through our laws enable the ordinary citizen to avail of.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the function of issuing a retail liquor licence to the concert hall should be taken from the courts. I am not satisfied with the lack of provision for annual renewal of that licence through the courts.  The vast majority of the other 15,000 retail liquor licences that are issued must be renewed annually in the courts.  One of the principal objectives behind the annual renewal of licences is to ensure that the trading in the premises is not carried on in a manner that is found objectionable or disagreeable by certain categories of people.  If the type of trading carried on is objectionable, they have the option and they are provided in law with the opportunity of going in at the annual licensing session and objecting to what is happening.  We set out in this Bill to deny people that opportunity of registering their objections if the occasion should arise.  This is a special concession that we are making available to this building and it is not available elsewhere.</P>
    <P>How does the concert hall lose its liquor licence?  As far as I can see from this Bill it can never lose it, short of a change there.  Perhaps I disagree with Senator Durcan on this.  We are all familiar with how the ordinary publican can lose his licence.  He can lose it if he has <Col N="837" /> three live endorsements which he can incur in the space of one week, and not alone does he lose his licence and his livelihood with it but he can never again hold a liquor licence and the premises to which the licence that is forfeit applied can never again be licensed.  Again we have excluded the concert hall from that kind of risk.  As far as I can see, they cannot lose their licence.  Senator Durcan was talking about shebeens in Mayo.  It is conceivable that poteen could be made in the concert hall and they still could not lose their licence for doing it.  I am not saying that to be derogatory, I am simply saying that we cannot ignore the fact that we have left ourselves in that position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would expect them to be traditional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  There is provision for a fine of £500 for the sale of drink illegally, but I think it would be impossible to prove that drink is sold illegally there.</P>
      <P>I have referred to the endorsements and recordable offences that can be imposed on the licence of the ordinary publican.  There is no provision whatsoever for endorsements or recordable offences in relation to the licence we propose to issue to the National Concert Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect that I want to turn to relates to section 2 of the Bill, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, but you might permit me to refer in general terms to what I have in mind so as to enable the Minister to anticipate the queries that I will be raising on Committee Stage.  I want to refer to the type, extent and control of trading done.  Does the licence apply to the entire building?  Will it be legal to sell drink in any part of that building, and how many bars will be in the building?  At the moment I understand there is a bar downstairs and a bar upstairs.  Will it be legal to sell drink in every part of the National Concern Hall?  How will drink and its sale be subject to Garda inspection?  What will the Garda require if they want to inspect or, to use the usual phrase, raid the premises?  Will they require the same <Col N="838" /> authority that they require, for example, to raid a club where they must have a search warrant issued by an officer not below the rank of inspector, the name of the raiding garda must be on that warrant and it must be in existence for 24 hours before the raid takes place?  Can a garda simply walk in off the street and can he raid the place as in the case of a pub?  I would appreciate clarification as to what are the powers of the Garda for inspection in relation to the sale and consumption of drink outside the regulations, wide as they are.</P>
    <P>Another question relates to the fine of £500 and to whom it may apply.  I do not think it applies to the company; at least the Bill does not so state.  If the Garda inspect the place how will they identify the legal trader?  Section 2 (2) indicates that the people entitled to be there are the patrons, the participants and the employees.  That is an extremely wide umbrella that anybody could very conceivably shelter underneath.  It will be next to impossible to prove illegal trading, and I think that is accepted by the people who drafted the Bill because there is no provision whatsoever if you are found there to be fined.  What is the position?  Does the fine apply to those to whom the categories of patrons, participants and employees do not apply?  That is extraordinary, particularly when 50 yards down the road at the corner of Leeson Street are Hartigan's, Dwyer's and Hourigan's and they can be raided and the people found on those premises can be fined and their licences can be endorsed on that.  Restricted hours will apply to their premises.  Their doors will close at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. as the case may be, but the doors of the concert hall up the road can remain open and it can ring to the rafters till the small hours of the morning.  If I were the proprietor of any of these three places I have mentioned I would certainly feel hard done by.  When we pass this legislation we should be concerned about the adverse effect it is going to have on the trading position of adjoining or adjacent licensed premises.  Senator Magner raised the question of the definition of a conference. No doubt on Committee Stage on section <Col N="839" /> 1 of the Bill we can establish what are concerts and what are conferences.  Successful concerts are held in the hall. Groups and individuals who can be bracketed together and who rate very highly in the estimation of many people &mdash; The Chieftains, Shaskeen, Dublin City Ramblers, Anna McGoldrick, and Foster and Allen &mdash; have performed successfully in the National Concert Hall and they will do so again and licensed trading will be permitted there up to an hour after the conclusion of performances.  It so happened that the groups I have referred to have also played in my licensed premises in County Clare but I must observe restricted hours and I cannot trade for an hour after the conclusion of the performance of these artists.</P>
    <P>We will be defining also what a conference is.  I suggest to the Minister that every night of the week in licensed premises throughout the country local residents' associations, sporting clubs, ladies' associations, farmers' organisations all hold their meetings.  Can we not argue that they equally are in conference and that it is not right that the location in which they hold their conference is penalised in a manner that will not apply to the building to which this proposed legislation applies?</P>
    <P>What will the position be in relation to trading or drinking in the National Concert Hall on Christmas Day and Good Friday?  These two days are set aside in all the Licensing Acts and it is provided that drink shall not be sold in weekday licensed outlets on either Christmas Day or Good Friday.  Will the same restriction apply to the National Concert Hall or is this piece of law steadily falling into decline or disregard?  In recent times certain clubs have advertised publicly on these days functions to which the public are invited to come and participate and where drink is available.  I want to ask the Minister whether drink will be available in the National Concert Hall on Christmas Day and Good Friday.</P>
    <P>I have a final query.  Every licensed premises in the country is required by law to display the prices of the drink they supply.  Will the drink control regulations <Col N="840" /> apply to the sale of drink in the concert hall?  Will they &mdash; as all other publicans are &mdash; be obliged to display a price list?</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to feel that I am advocating less control in either the sale of drink or the licensing of outlets and I do not agree that extended drinking hours would be a good thing.  We have serious problems &mdash; perhaps later this evening we will be talking of them &mdash; related to alcohol abuse.  There are three areas which can be related to what we are proposing to do here.  The principal one is late night-early morning drinking.  It happens in many places.  The courts in 1981 issued 42,000 special exemption orders for the sale and consumption of alcoholic liquor, and this on top of the 15,000 ordinary liquor licences that are issued through the courts and the Revenue Commissioners each year.  Late night drinking is one of the greatest problems associated with alcohol.  It happens up and down the country and I believe it will also happen in the concert hall.  Late night-early morning drinking has been identified by experts in the field as the primary cause of absenteeism from work. It is well to register that point but this is not the occasion to develop it.  The second aspect under that heading that I would like to raise and which was raised in the other House is the problem of under-age drinking.  It is unlikely that it is happening in the concert hall at the moment.  In normal circumstances it is unlikely that it will happen there but should the National Concert Hall company decide to hold a rock concert in their building it will happen on a large scale and there is nothing in this Bill to say that it should not happen.  I will not develop that point too much, and perhaps we will debate it later this evening, but if we accept that under-age drinking is the problems that most of us believe it to be then we have an opportunity as legislators to register where we stand.</P>
    <P>I conclude by endorsing again the appeal that was made by Senator Durcan earlier for an update and rationalisation of the licensing code to eliminate the irregularities and inconsistencies that are there.  This is urgent and necessary.  One <Col N="841" /> principle should be applied and that is that there should be a standard practice in relation to the issue of all liquor licences. If these licences are to come through the courts, all should come through the courts.  The conditions and requirements should be equal for all applicants.  The hours, conditions and terms of trading should be the same for all retail outlets.  In other words, if some outlets are obliged to close at 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. then all should close but if some outlets are entitled by law to remain open until 3 a.m. then all should have the same entitlement.  I want to eliminate privileges and exceptions.  I want the Garda to have the same right of inspection of all premises.  There should not be a privileged type of inspection for some premises and wide open inspection for others.  The same rights and terms of inspection should apply to all.  Let the same opportunities and the same obligations apply equally to all engaged at retail level in the liquor licence business.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her speech referred to the circumstances that have given rise to this Bill.  The National Concert Hall is at present licensed but there is a danger of that licence being lost.  The circumstances in which the licence was obtained would appear to be doubtful.  The local gardasuperintendent, as is his right, objected to it and it is now pending appeal in the High Court.  We are coming to the rescue in relation to these premises but we are doing other things as well.</P>
    <P>The new licence which we propose to issue to this building will take away from that garda superintendent the right he had up to now to object to the trading there if he thought such objection was warranted.  We are also taking from the courts the right to issue the licence and the right to renew it.  I understand that licence was issued in September 1981.  It was first issued as a theatre licence and a few weeks later there was a further application to the Circuit Court in which the judge in question issued a full, unrestricted licence.  We are now taking away from the courts and the Garda the rights they enjoyed heretofore in relation to the control of the business conducted there.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the people in <Col N="842" /> charge of operations at the National Concert Hall would abuse the situation. Indeed, I have great respect for those people.  I am simply saying that I do not believe we are acting in accordance with equality for all in providing special methods by which this licence can be obtained, which methods are denied to others.  I have no great objection in coming to the rescue here.  The objection I have is that from now on we will not use the same channels we expect every other applicant to go through in relation to seeking a licence.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that in conducting a rescue operation in relation to the licence for the National Concert Hall we would in some way broaden our horizons and recognise that there are other licensees in need of rescue also.  I know at least three licensees whose licences will be forfeited in the near future if circumstances take a certain course.  I want to refer to one licensee in my own county who has one conviction on the licence and two prosecutions pending.  If there is a conviction on both of these that licence will be forteited.  The livelihoods of two families are involved in these circumstances. There is the livelihood of the parents who are in their fifties, the livelihood of a son employed on the premises and who has recently married and there has been a substantial investment of about £50,000 in renovating the premises in recent years.  Therefore, if we come to the rescue of the National Concert Hall, I believe, in justice, we should be prepared to include such cases in this Bill to ensure that the livelihoods of two families are not shattered.  In reality, if the National Concert Hall never got its licence no livelihood would be put at risk but in my county there are two families whose future is in jeopardy.  Their cases could be decided in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by asking the Minister to assure me that if the worst happens to my constituents in County Clare a similar rescue package will be applied or, alternatively, would a Private Member's Bill to rescue these people receive the same enthusiastic support as has this measure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great interest to Senator Howard's very impressive speech.  Coming from a man who has such standing within the Licensed Vintners' Association and is a successful publican himself his contribution must carry great weight.  I support the Bill's general provisions.  The opening of the National Concert Hall filled a void which for a very long time needed to be filled.  It is being supported by the public and has introduced to our country artists and orchestras who otherwise would not have the opportunity of playing for our people.  From that point of view it is necessary that the normal facilities be provided in the beautiful concert hall we have in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers I am rather disappointed that the Minister did not take the opportunity of further reviewing or overhauling the licensing laws in general. As has already been stated, it is widely recognised that there are some shortcomings and anomalies.  I believe hours of trading should be set locally rather than nationally.  Publicans should be able to come together to decide on the hours that would meet the public demand in their own areas rather than having the Act settling the situation right across the board.  Opening hours should be either enforced or scrapped.  Perhaps that sounds a little harsh but in all sectors of administration there is growing disregard or contempt for the laws of the land in this sphere as well as in many others.</P>
      <P>I believe that a stronger stand should be taken against having lottery machines of any kind in public houses and I think that we should look for stricter administration. Worst of all is the blind eye that is turned in so many places to under-age drinking.  That is something that must be tackled.  I think publicans who allow the sale of drugs on their premises should have their premises confiscated.  It is not just enough to bar them from having a licence.  The authorities are pussy-footing with these grave abuses which are affecting the younger generation to an extraordinary degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many interesting points have been raised on this Bill.  I should like to ask the <Col N="844" /> Minister to look at the problem where we have 200 or 300 licensees with six-day licences.  Years ago these people were not interested in Sunday trade and they applied for only a six-day licence, but with habits in the country changing this has altogether changed.  In the main these tend to be the smaller premises with mainly older people ekeing out an existence. I ask the Minister to look at the possibility of introducing a system whereby he would convert those existing six-day licences to seven-day licences.  I think it is unreasonable for the State to expect these people &mdash; in the main they are the less well-off publicans and invariably are older people &mdash; to buy out a second licence in order to conver it to a seven-day licence.  The Minister, as a matter of social justice, should rectify that anomaly which we find in so many towns across the country, to bring equality to the situation.  If we can introduce a Bill like this for the better-off sections in our society then I think we should take a more sympathetic view of the few hundred small publicans across the country who are restricted by the terms of the six-day licences.</P>
    <P>Should someone book the concert hall for, say, a passion play on Good Friday, then I assume it will be the only place in the whole country that will be able to let up the shutters and open up the pub on that day.  I would have a grave objection to that; irrespective of the theme of the play.  It has already been mentioned that there are two black days.  Perhaps the concept of a black day is gone in the kind of society we are living in, but if the entire country has at least on the surface to abide by those rules &mdash; as I expect is the case in 99 per cent of the pubs across the country &mdash; I see no reason why any one place should be exempted.  If the concert hall puts on a matinee it will be the only place that does not have a &ldquo;holy hour.&rdquo; Is that a good thing or will it attract people into the concert hall who could be described as being on a pub crawl?  They say the idea for the &ldquo;holy hour&rdquo; was to get people out of the public houses and not have them sitting in all day.  Surely this is something that the Minister should look at.  I am not too sure if the National <Col N="845" /> Concert Hall is a semi-State organisation or if it is a private company making a profit.  Do the Government consider the provision of this kind of licence will subsidise the operations of the entire venture there to a very considerable degree?</P>
    <P>The concert hall should have facilities and they should be on a part with the facilities that are available in the great concert halls in Europe.  I know that in the Philharmonic Hall in Berlin it is possible in the five or six minute intervals during the performance for several thousand people to go and have refreshments. I am sure the same kind of facility will exist in Dublin.  It must surely be annoying and frustrating for people who earn their livelihood solely in the pub trade to have to compete with a semi-State organisation such as this who have all the benefits but none of the restrictions.  I think restrictions are certainly necessary because of the way some elements of the trade appear to be abusing the system at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it provides for refreshment in the National Concert Hall, something that is available in other places of recreation in the city of Dublin.  Indeed it was surprising to most people that it was necessary to put a Bill through the Oireachtas to have this provision.  Senator Howard dealt with the Bill in great detail and it was very enlightening to listen to him here this afternoon.  I am not going to deal with the Bill in such detail but I will say I am disappointed that we deal with the licensing laws in a piecemeal way. During my time in the Oireachtas we have had a number of Bills dealing with the licensing laws.  During the years we have had various Bills dealing with bits and scraps here and there.  I refer of course to the legislation providing for drinks at dog tracks, at the bus station at Store Street and at racecourses.  There was provision for the extension of licences or the granting of licences on special occasions such as sporting events and the like.  They are all dealing with just one small aspect of the licensing laws, but most Members of the House would prefer <Col N="846" /> to see a Bill dealing with this matter in a broader way.</P>
      <P>We have, of course, the anomaly in the Dublin area where it is not possible for the courts to grant a licence for a premises which is within a mile of a premises with a licence that existed in 1963 or whenever the last major Bill dealing with licensing of premises was enacted.  In my constituency of Dublin South-West, in County Dublin and in all parts of Dublin where there has been a tremendous development over the years we have had many proposals for licences for premises which were within one mile of a premises with an existing 1963 licence and it has not been possible to grant those licences.  The time is long overdue for this anomaly to be rectified and I appeal to the Minister in this connection.  When I was a Member of the other House on more than one occasion I drew the attention of the then Minister for Justice to this anomaly.  I last spoke on it in 1975 or 1976.  The Minister agreed with me at the time but despite that many years have now elapsed and still nothing has been done to correct it. I do not need to remind the House of the great development that has taken place in areas such as Lucan, Clondalkin and Tallaght where it is still only possible to grant a new licence one mile from an existing licence.  It is a ridiculous situation and one I would urge the Minister to look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure Senator Howard was correct in saying that in passing this legislation we are granting a licence to the largest licensed premises in the country. I can refer to one with far greater seating capacity of the National Concert Hall. We are going to have larger public houses, something most people would not want, because it is not possible to have a licence in neighbouring housing estates.  Because it is necessary to have a distance of one mile between an existing licence and the granting of a new licence, this tends to lead to larger premises.  This is something which should be discouraged. It also tends to create the necessity for club licences.  There are football clubs and other areas where sporting activities take place.  I do not need to name the <Col N="847" /> areas where there are many club licences. This is necessary, particularly in County Dublin, because of the legislation which prevents the granting of public house licences within one mile of an existing licence.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, having heard the remarks in this House, to give serious consideration to a Bill which will update the licensing laws not only for County Dublin but for the whole country.  The Minister should look seriously at the number of club licences being granted. Many parents are concerned that their children have to frequent places of recreation such as football clubs &mdash; where we are supposed to encourage our children to go &mdash; where one of the main attractions seems to be the licence which is operated on a daily basis.  Some operate only at weekends simply because they have not the business to keep the bar open on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>Many speakers have strayed from the Bill.  It is an opportunity we have been given &mdash; which we are not often give &mdash; to draw attention to the anomalies, such as those to which I have referred.  I will bow to the Leas-Chathaoirleach's judgment on the matter as to whether it should be discussed on a broader basis or just on the narrow basis of granting a licence to one premises.  A complaint which I and many Senators have is that we deal with a matter as a problem arises.  This is a parochial way of dealing with the licensing laws of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many people attending the National Concert Hall will take more than two drinks?  Publicity has been given in recent weeks to the slogan &ldquo;Just two will do&rdquo;.  Is it intended that this licence will be used for those who will take just two drinks or is it intended that they will take more?  I want to voice my abhorrence at the departure of the National Road Safety Association from their slogan of other years, &ldquo;If you drink, don't <Col N="848" /> drive&rdquo;.  I am sure everybody will agree that was an extremely successful slogan. They say they have progressed to the slogan &ldquo;Just two will do&rdquo;.  I hold that the National Road Safety Association are not a competent body to judge how much drink a person can have and be capable of driving safely.  It takes no account of a person's height or age or the amount of food a person might have had during the day.  Neither does it take account of any medication a person may be taking.  I maintain if a person is taking a particular medication and has one drink he or she is incapable of driving on the roads.  Also it shows little appreciation of the difficulty of a person with a drink problem who drives.  It is far easier for such a person to refuse the first drink than to have to refuse the third drink.</P>
    <P>I hope the National Road Safety Association will take account of the protests there have been about their new slogan. It is too late now to change it but, we in County Dublin have refused to handle their posters.  We have produced our own posters and we are taking full part in the road safety campaign over Christmas.  I hope that the new slogan of the road Safety Association does not lead to more accidents than there would have been if they had remained with the old slogan &ldquo;If you drink, don't drive&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I may have strayed from the Bill but it was necessary and I am glad of the opportunity of saying it in this House.  I have said it at council meetings.  I was successful in having our own National Road Safety Committee reject not all of the National Road Safety Association's posters but the one that says &ldquo;Just Two Will Do&rdquo;.  It is only right that there should be drink available in the National Concert Hall.  While accepting much of what Senator Howard said it is necessary that it should be available there.  Removing anomalies and updating legislation usually take a long time because big wheels move slowly.  It may be necessary to put through this legislation so that refreshment would be available to our National Concert Hall goes but I appeal to the Minister to hasten the day when she will be back here with a more comprehensive Bill to deal with the licensing laws.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Senators who offered such kind and generous comments on my appointment and they are all the sweeter and better because of the fact that I am now almost a year in office.  I should like to thank Senators for their wide ranging comments, and I am pleased that there has been general agreement on the pleasure that the concert hall has given to the whole country, not merely to the city.  I know it is in Dublin but I think it is seen as a cultural amenity for the whole country. It is very important that in a recreational area like this there should be facilities for enjoying a drink.  I must thank everybody, and I hope that I will be excused for suggesting that the publicans' Oireachtas lobby is alive and well and living in the Seanad because I certainly learnt an awful lot from the various contributions. I will attempt to deal with individual Senator's contributions; the same type of comments and proposals were made in the Dáil and there is a definite and genuine feeling that we need to have new legislation in relation to intoxicating liquor.  I realise that other factors and interests must also be taken into account in this connection.</P>
      <P>Senator Lynch spoke of the excellent standard of the concert hall.  He said it is a place where recreation is provided and drink is an additional amenity whereas he is associated with the type of establishment where the provision of drink is the basic facility but excellent entertainment is also provided.  He referred to section 3 of the Bill, which relates generally to provisions regarding exemption orders and occasional licences.  It provides, in effect, that the concert hall licence cannot be endorsed or forfeited.  I hope that all Senators would agree that these provisions should not apply in the case of the concert hall.  Senator Lynch also referred to provisions applying to licensed premises in general.  It would be inappropriate for me to make any comment on his general remarks in that connection, but I assure the Senator that consideration will be given to the points that were raised by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Durcan and others referred to <Col N="850" /> the need to revise the licensing code generally. He felt that it should not be necessary to legislate to grant an individual special licence.  The codification of the licensing laws is a major task which would require considerable input of official time to accomplish.  Initial steps in this codification process have been taken but will take some considerable time to bring to fruition.  As to Senator Durcan's suggestion that the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; should be put in the presence of this work in existing legislation has had the effect of nullifying some important enforcement provisions and I could not agree that it would be appropriate to introduce it in this Bill.  As to the definition of concert hall this has been carefully considered by the parliamentary draftsman and he is satisfied that the existing definition is necessary and appropriate.</P>
    <P>Senator Magner asked about the definition of &ldquo;function&rdquo; in the Bill.  This definition is not unduly broad.  The concert hall is a venue for a wide range of activities. There could be no objection to including concerts within this definition, and the addition of conferences has been very fully considered.  There has been pressure to extend this definition much further, but I am satisfied that the present definition covers the range of activities where the supply of intoxicating liquour could be reasonably expected and used.</P>
    <P>Senator Howard was concerned about the question of reform of the licensing code and the licensing of restaurants and I have noted his comments in this connection.  The question of the abuses of intoxicating liquor is under review by the Minister for Justice, and this House will have an opportunity of considering in due course any proposals which may be brought forward for new legislation to combat such abuses.  Senator Howard also questioned the propriety of granting a special liquour licence to the National Concert Hall, but I would remind the House that special licences are available to airports, Busaras and greyhound race tracks.  I am satisfied that special arrangements proposed in relation to the National Concert Hall are appropriate in view of its unique national position.</P>
    <P>On the question of the area licensed, <Col N="851" /> this special licence will apply to the whole area of the concert hall and by virtue of section 4 the concert hall will come within the definition of licensed premises.  It will, therefore, attract various enforcement provisions, including those for inspection by the Garda.  There is no restriction under the Bill on the days in which liquor might be sold in the concert hall.  Senator Howard particularly mentioned Christmas Day and Good Friday.</P>
    <P>On the question of regulations regarding the display of drink prices, this is a question for the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  As to particular cases at present affected by the endorsement provisions in the licensing code, individual cases could not be included within the ambit of the Bill, but I will give very careful consideration to any proposals for a review of the provisions now applying in this area.  I am not sure if it was Senator Howard or Senator Lynch who suggested that there would be complaints, or perhaps there had been some complaints or criticism, from persons in the licensed trade about the concert hall licence.  In fact there have not been any complaints about the present situation or the proposed new legislation for the concert hall and it is not expected that there will be any.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald questioned the opening hours envisaged in the Bill.  I am satisfied that the hours are appropriate for the concert hall and I am confident that the board will not abuse the special provision in that regard.  I should point out in this connection that the concert hall has been, up to now, operating on the basis of a full publican's licence for over two years and it appears that no complaints have been made in that period.  I should also point out that the concert hall licence which we are now discussing is more restrictive in this very important respect than the existing full licence.  Under the proposed special licence, the sale of liquor will be permitted only in connection with functions in the hall whereas under the existing licence, as I have said, the position as to permitted hours is the same as in an ordinary licensed premises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the definition of &ldquo;conference&rdquo;, it seems that if Senator Durcan, <Col N="853" /> Senator Lynch and myself were to book part of the hall to discuss this Bill, for example, and if it was accepted by management that it was a conference, we could consume drink up to one hour after we had finished our debates.  If that remains as open as it is, drink can be sold and consumed in the concert hall for 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year.  A conference has got to be defined if it is going to be possible for the authorities to prove legal trading there.  What constitutes a conference?</P>

      <P>Another point which arises from section 1 is that, if I may read it, &ldquo;function&rdquo; means a concert or conference in the concert hall to which persons are admitted upon payment or by invitation. I gather that the invitation has to be by management there, but is this always so?  Can the organisers of a conference issue an invitation to a member of the public?  Can the participants or the performers in a concert invite their friends?  The other thing that worries me in relation to this section is &ldquo;and, where a function extends over more than one day, the part of the function held on any day shall be deemed, for the purposes of <Col N="854" /> this Act, to be a separate function&rdquo;.  You can have a conference beginning, for example, at 10 o'clock in the morning and the sale of liquor is allowed for an hour previous to that.  There could be a break, for example, in the afternoon and there is an hour allowed for consumption of drink after the end of the conference. You have a space of an hour and a half between the end of the conference and the beginning of the evening concert.  As far as I can see, it is quite legitimate to sell drink during that hour and a half.  I do not know what the duration of the concert is, but no matter how lengthy it is, the sale or consumption of drink is allowed for one hour after it finishes.  You are talking about many hours.  If the situation was reversed and the concert was held in the morning, at least one could say when the concert has terminated.  On the other hand, if you have the concert in the morning, an hour and a half time lag after its end and then a conference starting, there is no way you can indicate clearly the end of a conference as you can the end of a concert and still there is this hour of liberty.  Can the participants of a conference invite members of the public and can the promoters or artists of a concert invite members of the public?</P>

      <P>The invitation must be by management, as with other theatres. The Senator is making the point about having two functions running into one on the same day.  I have seen how the concert hall operates at the moment.  They have a break and the management can be relied upon to ensure that the explicit demarcation in the Bill will be recognised. The Senator suggested that an afternoon conference could run into the evening, and that could happen, but I believe that we can have faith in the discretion and integrity of the people who are running the concert hall.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDurcan" hpid="Mr. Durcan Mr. Durcan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durcan</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2 (1) and 2 (2) there is something that troubles me.  The Minister mentioned that the licence will not have to be renewed annually.  The Bill is to be construed as part of the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 1981, so, presumably, the form of licence that can issue pursuant to the provisions of this Bill is not different from the normal type of licence. There is nothing specifically in the Bill that states that it should not be renewed annually.  Subsection (2) says that the licence will remain in force while the concert hall is in existence but it would appear that it still has to be renewed annually.  An ordinary licence remains in force so long as a licensed premises complies with certain statutory provisions, and many licences have been in force for 100 years or more, but they still have to be renewed annually.  I am a little worried that section 2 does not state that fact.</P>
      <P>Another point I am worried about is in relation to licences granted under section 2.  All licences, as I understand it, are subject to the provisions of the Fire Act, 1981, an Act passed following the Stardust disaster.  That imposes very rigid obligations on applicants for licences and applicants for renewal of licences, to satisfy the licensing authority that their premises comply with the provisions of the fire officer.  In the event of the concert hall ceasing to be maintained in accordance with its current good standards and if a situation developed in the years ahead that the place became badly maintained and a fire hazard, do the provisions of the Fire Act apply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the licensed premises, which indeed is the whole premises, as has been quantified by the Minister, would in the ordinary course of events, be subject to inspection by the fire department.  However, as this is a new building all these aspects would have been taken into consideration, because <Col N="856" /> planning permission would not be given for any such type of building unless it had met all the requirements.  As I understand it the bars have been in existence since its inception, so I take it for granted that it was passed by the fire section of Dublin Corporation.  However, I would expect that it would be subject to review annually or part-annually as all licensed premises are and, indeed, many public buildings such as hospitals.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (2) relates to what I regard as the ordinary licensed trade.  It would be almost impossible to implement, in that you could define the 30 minutes prior to the start of a conference although they are usually 10 or 20 minutes late or perhaps a half an hour late.  You could define an hour after a concert but I doubt if you can define an hour after a conference.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister would be relying &mdash; rightly so &mdash; on the management of the concert hall to see that the licensing laws or regulations as stipulated in the Bill would be carried out as efficiently as the management are carrying out their functions at the moment.  It is quite evident that the management there have done an excellent job, and we hope that they will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (3) states:</P>
      <P>A person who sells intoxicating liquor at the Concert Hall otherwise than in accordance with a licence under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £500.</P>
      <P>I regard that as a safety measure built into the Bill.  I cannot envisage how a person can be discovered selling liquor, unless it is through the management, because we have not been told if the Garda have the authority to walk in and out in order to supervise the concert hall. Does a special warrant have to be issued to inspect the premises?  There are guarantees that should be given at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Garda inspections the position is the same as for any licensed premises.  The provisions are there in the event of abuses with regard to the Senator's other question: the substantitive <Col N="857" /> provisions of the Fire Services Act will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of teasing out to be done yet.  The Minister says that the Garda will have normal powers of inspection.  In the course of my remarks on Second Stage I indicated that there was a distinction between the powers the Garda had for raiding certain types of licensed premises.  What normal powers have they?  Is it the power to raid the ordinary public houses or are they to have special powers for raiding the clubs? While there is provision for a fine of £500 for illegal operations there is no provision for a fine on others &mdash; the people we in the licensed trade would know as the &ldquo;found ons&rdquo;.  How can the Garda say then that there is illegal trading if we have no provision for fining &ldquo;found ons&rdquo;?  Are the powers of inspection the pub powers of inspection or are they the club powers of inspection?  There is no provision for fining &ldquo;found ons&rdquo; so I should like to hear if there is such a person as a &ldquo;found on&rdquo; within the terms of this legislation.</P>

I am very conscious of the Minister's statement earlier on that adjacent licensed premises have not complained to date.  I accept that the running of the concert hall up to now is first class but we cannot guarantee that for all time. If the situation arose that the concert hall began to be operated in a way that was objectionable to either adjacent licensed premises, to the superintendent for the area or to people resident in the area who can object to it, how can they register their objection if there is not an annual renewal procedure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two other points on this section.  The first is the reliance on the decency and good sense of the management of the concert hall.  If we say that we rely on these particular outstanding qualities in relation to the present management, are we by implication saying that there are 15,000 other licensed owners throughout the country who are not deserving of the same categorisation? I would not be totally happy with that position.</P>
      <P>I wish to revert to the question of fines. There is provision for a fine of £500 for the illegal sale of drink.  We have failed so far to identify what are illegal sales and how they can occur.  We have failed equally to identify who &ldquo;others&rdquo; are or who the &ldquo;found ons&rdquo; would be.  Reverting to the fine of £500 which I assume would be on the concert hall or on the board of management &mdash; I should like to know who it applies to &mdash; I would welcome it if it had general application to every retail licensed holder.  Is this an indication of the thinking for the future?  If a fine of £500 were to have general application throughout the retail liquor licence trade as a replacement for endorsements and forfeiture of licence I would be happy to accept it.</P>

      <P>I am subject to the advice of the Chair, but there is a question that I believe I am entitled to raise on this section because it says that the Act will be cited with all the other Acts between 1833 and 1983 and construed together as one.  I raised on Second Stage the fact that this was a rescue package because a licence in relation to the concert hall was becoming important.  I outlined circumstances which exist in my own county in which the livelihoods of two families are in jeopardy by virtue of one conviction and one endorsement on their licences and two prosecutions pending, possibly meaning endorsements.  If these three endorsements come together the livelihoods of two families are gone.  We talk of equality.  It is close to the hearts of all of us.  Therefore, could I have an assurance from the Minister that a similar rescue packet will be available should the worse happen in those cases?</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to specify the total number of Members of the Dáil, to revise the constituencies for the election of Members to the Dáil and to prescribe the number of Members to be returned for each constituency.</P>
      <P>In considering the Bill it is necessary to have regard to the provisions of Article 16.2 of the Constitution, in particular to the requirements that</P>
      <P>(a) the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same through the country, and</P>
      <P>(b) the Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years with due regard to changes in distribution of population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional provisions relating to the revision of Dáil constituencies came before the High Court and the Supreme Court in two well-known cases in the early sixties.  The courts, however, did not lay down what variation from the <Col N="862" /> national average number of persons per Deputy would be permissible in the formation of constituencies, nor did they indicate whether the Constitution requires equality of representation as between constituencies at all times or only at the time of a revision.  There is, thus, a lack of authoritative guidance on these important questions.</P>
    <P>The previous Dáil constituency revision took place in 1980 on the basis of the census of population taken in April 1979. When a further census taken in April 1981, disclosed shifts in population, particularly within the greater Dublin area, a revision of constituencies was put in train by the Government.  An independent commission were appointed and given the same terms of reference as those given to the commission which drew up the 1980 proposals, with the addition that, given the short period of time which had elapsed since the last revision of constituencies, the commission should take account of the desirability of effecting the minimum changes.  As Senators are aware, the commission's function was purely advisory.  The Constitution places the obligation to revise the Dáil constituencies on the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The commission's report recommended that there should be no change in the overall membership of the Dáil or in the allocation of seats to individual constituencies.  As regards the definition of constituencies, no change is recommended apart from and there are only two in the entire scheme of the constituency boundaries for the country:</P>
    <P>(i)  the transfer of an area with a population of 10,830 from Dublin South-West to Dublin South-Central, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the transfer of an area with a population of 5,783 from Dublin West to Dublin Central.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to implement the commission's proposals in full.  Senators will note that although only four constituencies are affected by the changes, all the constituencies are defined anew in the Schedule.  This is to ensure that the <Col N="863" /> revision now proposed is a revision within the meaning of Article 16.2 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As Senators have already received copies of the commission's report indicating the changes proposed in these four constituencies, I do not think it necessary for me at this stage to comment in relation to any of these individual constituencies. Maps indicating the territorial changes proposed have been deposited in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like, on behalf of the Government, to express appreciation at the manner in which the commission have done their job and to place on the record of the House our thanks to the members of the commission, Mr. Justice Walsh of the Supreme Court, Mr. Turpin, Secretary of the Department of the Environment, and the Clerk of the Dáil, Mr. Rayel.  I am sure that the House will wish to be associated with this expression of appreciation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very non-contentious Bill.  We on this side of the House claim a certain amount of credibility for having the Bill before us in a non-contentious fashion because in the first instance we were of the Government who decided on setting up an independent commission to deal with the arranging and re-arranging of constituencies.  The previous legislation gave power to the Minister for the Environment to revise the constituencies.  The two Ministers who were responsible for the last two revisions were not successful, whether by luck or by guidance or by whatever method employed, but it did have a certain measure of reaction for both of them. However, I welcome the independent commission although nothing contentious has arisen as a result of the two reports and indeed on this occasion because of the short time since the last revision until the second commission sat &mdash; it was a very short period &mdash; no changes of any account occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the major rural five-seat constituencies, I should like to give an idea of the vast difference between a Dublin constituency or a five-seater that <Col N="864" /> would be about two miles square and my own constituency that I know well from Shrule Bridge on the Galway border to Blacksod on the North side of the constituency and which is more than 100 miles in extent.  That is an indication of the difference between the two types of constituencies we are legislating for today.  Some consideration must be given to that imbalance.  There are also the two-county constituencies of Carlow-Kilkenny and Cavan-Monaghan.  We know it is not easy for any Deputy to represent a two-county constituency and give it the kind of servicing that a constituency should be given.</P>
    <P>To go back to the time when we went to the country on the issue of the single-seat, one-vote constituency, it was regrettable on that occasion the Irish people decided against the proposal. Unfortunately it was made a political issue.  If a similar proposal were to come now from the commission rather than from the Government of the day, I think the Irish electorate would assess it on an equal basis and give a different result. The electorate would have a safety valve because they would have one representative representing a locality or a number of voters but who could be removed at the next election if he was not giving the performance that was required of him.</P>
    <P>If one happens now to be a member of any political party, through the channels of selection that obtain, one can be selected and can serve for a long time under the new legislation.  I am glad to see that the rural vote has changed somewhat, that it is now increasing rather than decreasing.  When that tolerance proposal was put to the people, the west coast of Ireland lost seven seats to the city of Dublin.  That was a major loss on that occasion.  We are reversing that trend and with the prolificacy of the rural people of Ireland I have no doubt but that we will get these seven seats back in a very short time.</P>

      <P>I might ask the Minister at this stage if it is the intention of the Minister for the Environment to hold the local elections in 1984.  If the Minister is not in a position to answer that when replying I shall have to conclude that the Government may not have made up their minds at this time, but the Minister for the Environment did say that he would make a statement before Christmas on the issue.  I would welcome the Minister of State making the announcement here this evening and thereby giving the country registrars, who are now the county secretaries, an opportunity of putting their own house in order in time for the local government election.</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Toole has said, this Bill, which is non-contentious, gives effect to the recommendations of <Col N="866" /> the Dáil constituency commission.  The terms of reference of that commission referred to the fact that such a short period of time had passed since the last commission reported and accordingly the terms of reference were only amended in one respect, namely, that the commission should take account of the desirability of accepting the minimum change possible. In doing their work the Commission have done just that.  I would join with Senator O'Toole and the Minister in complimenting the commission for the work they have done, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that they were appointed on 27 April, 1983 and reported on July 29.  It is their report which is embodied in this legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with every word that Senator O'Toole said in relation to the situation existing in rural constituencies. While the matter may not arise directly on this Bill it arises indirectly, because the Bill is concerned with implementing the constitutional provisions dealing with membership of Dáil Éireann.  There are specific constitutional provisions in that regard.  People who represent urban constituencies have no idea, and certainly have no understanding, of the physical and mental strain which representation of a rural constituency imposes.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the situation existing in Mayo west where one can travel from Shrule Bridge to Blacksod Bay and right up further to north Mayo. He is probably incorrect in saying it is 100 miles.  It is probably closer on 120 miles or 130 miles.  I can speak from experience as a part-time politician, starting off at 7 o'clock in the evening and doing a mere two clinics in the north Mayo area and not arriving home until 3 or 4 in the morning.  On such occasions I would have driven 162 miles.  That is something that I and other people representing constituencies like Mayo West have to repeat.</P>

    <P>This Government, who are committed to reform in many areas, should consider a reform of the electoral laws and of the Constitution dealing with electoral provisions. I do not think that anybody representing a vast geographical area such as those of us from the west must represent <Col N="867" /> can give proper representation or do their jobs properly as legislators bearing in mind the strain which covering that vast area imposes.  Furthermore, I am not satisfied that the multi-seat constituency situation is conducive to good politics. Let us be blunt about it, all of us here operate within multi-seat constituencies and one is frequently more conscious of strains operating within one's own party than the natural strain which operates against your natural political opponent. The abolition of multi-seat constituencies would give rise to much healthier politics. I am not admitting or suggesting that any such strain exists in my own constituency &mdash; it does not &mdash; but it arises in many constituencies.</P>

There is a very important need for reform there, and I hope that the Government will consider taking some steps in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that there will be any great discussion on this Bill because it changes only very slightly the boundaries on which the last general election was fought.  Indeed, the only change that has taken place is in or around the Dublin area.  Four constituencies are affected, but in effecting those changes very many people in these areas concerned will feel aggrieved because most people living there do not yet realise what is happening in the Bill because little attention has been given to it in the past and it is not easy to follow.  The commission's brief was to have consideration to natural and county boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> Unfortunately in the Dublin area very many people pay little regard to the boundary between the Dublin city and county area, which in many instances represents a greater division than the boundaries between many counties.  It has been and still is necessary to couple two counties or parts of two counties into the one constituency.  There is not a great deal of harm in that although rivalry may arise in the counties concerned, but they have an opportunity in most instances of electing a representative to the Dáil from both counties.  The population of the area which I have represented since I was first elected to the Dáil in 1970 and on the county council since 1965 is almost 11,000 and I have come to know those people pretty well.  I am referring to the area of Templeogue and Orwell which is moving for the first time from being a county constituency to a city constituency.  Many of these people have expressed their dislike of this boundary change.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Department to ensure that boundary commissions in future will pay greater regard to this division between county and city.  People from other county constituencies may not see any great distinction there, but anyone who has lived in Dublin county, particularly anyone who has represented the county or on the other side has represented the city will realise the pride that people have in the area in which they live.  To put it bluntly, they do not like being moved as a small unit from the county end into a much larger unit in the city end or <i>vice versa.</i>  At one stage Ballyfermot was in the west county constituency and Churchtown was in the south county constituency.  People living in such areas resent these constituency changes, and we should take note of their resentment and avoid it if at all possible. It could have been avoided on this occasion. A good deal of latitude was allowed and the commission could have recommended, for instance, increasing the representation in the south-west constituency and perhaps taking in another portion of the county area.  The city and county of Dublin are now big and populous enough to allow for the moving of lines without crossing the city-county <Col N="869" /> boundary.  However the boundaries are changed within the city it should be possible to have city constituencies without taking in portions of the county to have proper representation in county constituencies confined to county areas.</P>
    <P>Apart from that I do not think that anyone could complain about the Bill. We hope that we will not see a general election for another four years.  By that time the representative-population ratio will have changed from what it was when the commission sat.  In the south-west and west Dublin county constituencies there is a great movement of population, and even since the commission submitted the report of their deliberations the population had changed and that trend will continue.  I understand that there will not be a further sitting of this commission until after the next census.  I am not sure when that is due, but I am pretty sure that we will not have a revision of constituencies before the next election.  By the time we arrive at that stage we will be back to square one as we were in the last two elections where in south-west Dublin we were electing four TDs where it was almost possible on the ratio to elect five. By the time the second election came the ratio should have permitted a fifth seat. Perhaps the commission should have waited until we had another census before sitting and we should have another census before another election is due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make a long speech on this Bill.  There are a number of things that we should refer to in considering Second Stage and the principle of the Bill which is before us.  It is reasonable to say that the position concerning the revision of the constituencies has reached an intolerable stage.  The idea that a constituency revision must follow every census is absolutely ludicrous. Government faced with the necessity of taking a census for one reason or another, either because of the necessity to get internal information concerning the population structure of this country or as a part of international exercise as members of the EEC or some other body, now have to consider the <Col N="870" /> electoral and political significance of a simple thing like having a census.</P>
      <P>The next census in Ireland is due to take place either in 1984 or 1986, that being five years after 1979 or five years after 1981.  It is probably due to take place in April 1986.  This Government were elected in November 1982 and if they run their full course a general election will take place in the latter portion of 1987, at which stage a new census would have been published.  A census taken in April 1986 would probably be published less than one year later.  Therefore, we would have the ludicrous situation when, having established the position in this Bill, prior to the next general election the constituencies would have to be revised again.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Successive Governments have failed to tackle the problem that arose as a result of the successful challenge in the O'Donovan case of the constitutionality of a previous Electoral Amendment Bill and to make use of the many opportunities of a non-controversial nature to amend the Constitution and get rid of this necessity to have a revision every time there is a census.  A simple revision of the Constitution to say that a revision of the constituencies should take place once every 12 years would solve the problem.  That would mean that at the end of the 12-year period you would use whatever up-to-date census exists.  Do the Members of this House and, more importantly, the Members of the other House, realise that these are not necessarily the constituencies on which the next general election will be fought? What more ludicrous a situation can one have than to be presenting a Bill to the Dáil and Seanad which will copper-fasten the electoral laws now but might be completely out of date before the next general election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some doubt as to the legality of a general election held in the time between the publishing of the census and the enabling legislation to change the constituencies.  This Electoral Amendment Bill could become law and a new census in April 1986 would be published in January or February 1987.  Between that and a new Electoral Amendment <Col N="871" /> Bill to take into account the changes shown up in that census of 1986 it might be, at least in theory, impossible to hold a legal general election in that time.  That all arises because successive Governments have failed to tackle the problem that arose as a result of the O'Donovan case.  I would recommend to the Minister that he give very serious consideration to this serious problem.  During the course of the next few years he should take a suitable opportunity of some amendment to the Constitution to include a simple amendment to get rid of the necessity to have a revision of the constituency boundaries more frequently than once every 12 years.  A very simple, non-controversial amendment would do that.</P>
    <P>The constituencies established in the Bill &mdash; with the exception of the area dealt with by my colleague Senator McMahon &mdash; are those on which the last three general elections were fought. Those general elections reflected generally the views of the people in that the number of seats which parties got reflected the share of the national vote they achieved on each of those three occasions.</P>
    <P>That aside, the Bill is quite acceptable and has our complete support.  I urge the Minister to take an initiative at a suitable time between this and April 1986 to ensure that the <i>lacuna</i> will not exist in early 1987 where a legal general election may not be possible under the law as it now stands.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for the succinct comments on this legislation.  As they have correctly pointed out, it has been well debated elsewhere and it is substantially the same as the set of constituencies that were proposed and devised by the first commission. Indeed, the terms of reference are essentially the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties that rural constituencies have and rural-based public representatives face are genuine.  They have a series of problems related to the geography and the distances the representatives must travel.  They do not <Col N="872" /> necessarily have a monopoly on such problems, because there are corresponding although different problems for urban areas.  For any public representative of any political party the process and job representation are becoming increasingly difficult irrespective of whether you live in a rural area or an urban area.</P>
    <P>I must in all honesty say that the points raised by Senators &mdash; particularly Senator O'Toole and Senator Durcan &mdash; really do not bear on this legislation.  What they suggest as an alternative is a major constitutional change which this country can decide if it so chooses.  On the question raised by Senator McMahon about the Dublin city and county boundary problem, by the next time we come to revise the constituencies in the Dublin area there may not be either a Dublin corporation or a Dublin county council and the boundaries he refers to may be boundaries of history.  You cannot any longer maintain the fiction that the increase in the population in the area of Tallaght &mdash; which was 1,200 in the census of 1961 and is now somewhere in the region of 70,000 &mdash; has been due to the fecundity that Senator O'Toole referred to of the people of the west of Ireland &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The revision factor raised by Senator O'Leary is a legal point, and Article 16.2.3º of the Constitution provides that the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same.  Normally this was done on a 12-year basis, but the O'Donovan case requires it to be done more frequently.  It would need a point of law to be stated to the Supreme Court to have it clarified or a political decision to change the Constitution to be more <Col N="873" /> precise in the way in which we do it.  It raises a long-term problem for this country. If our population continues to grow at the projected rate and we have an extra million people living within the State between now and the year 2000 &mdash; which is only 17 years away &mdash; it would represent something in the region of 50 extra Members, if my arithmetic on a quick tot is correct, on the ratio of 20,000 persons per Dáil Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At some stage that question will have to be addressed, but not in the context of this legislation.  I would point out to Senator O'Leary regarding the fear he expresses about the possible legal validity of the next general election &mdash; which in all probability will be held in 1986-87 certainly at the end of four years &mdash; that while the census is due to be held in 1986 the results of it would not be available for another year and a half and then the courts would hold that it would be reasonable to allow for some time before any change.  Therefore, any doubt about the legal validity of an election result is a very small one.  Having said that, I would like to thank the Senators for their contributions.  Senator O'Toole asked me to refer to the local elections, and all I can do is to repeat what the Minister said in the other House in relation to this matter, that the present situation is that the local elections are to be held in June 1984.  That is the position, and I have no further comment to make in relation to it.</P>

      <P>We need on section 7 to move a technical amendment to refer to a change in the Title of the Bill.  The problem arises in the wording of this section due to the fact that the Bill will repeal the 1980 Act which contains the current collective citation and it is not certain whether this Bill will be enacted before the enactment of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1983 which is the one dealing with the votes for UK citizens.  If that Bill is enacted first then the collective citation for this Bill would be &ldquo;the electoral Acts, 1923 to 1983 shall include this Act&rdquo;.  The wording of this section has been arranged provisionally on the basis that this Bill may be enacted before the voting rights Bill.  It is proposed to seek to arrange progress of the Bill so that No. 2 Bill will be enacted first and subsequently to amend the collective citation of the voting rights Bill on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  This will involve referring that Bill back to the Dáil for approval of the Seanad amendment. As the amendment would be purely technical, reference back to the Dáil should not involved any undue delay.</P>

      <P>Under existing law, British citizens who are ordinarily resident here and have reached the age of 18 years are entitled to vote at local elections and at elections to the European Parliament.  The purpose of this Bill is to grant to British citizens the right to vote at Dáil elections, presidential elections and referenda on conditions identical with those applying in the case of Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes that a British citizen shall be entitled to be registered as a Dáil elector in a constituency if he or she has reached the age of 18 years and if, on the qualifying date, he or she is ordinarily resident in that constituency.  Having been registered as a Dáil elector, he or she will be entitled under the Electoral Act, 1963 to vote at presidential elections and referenda as well as at Dáil elections.</P>
      <P>The Bill, although consisting of a single operative section only, has important constitutional and political implications.</P>
      <P>Article 16.1.2º of the Constitution provides that:</P>
      <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of eighteen years who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of the law relating to Dáil Éireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>In the past, the view was sometimes taken that the right to vote in a Dáil election granted to Irish citizens by this Article was an exclusive right and that it was not open to the Oireachtas to grant a similar right to non-citizens without first amending the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent consideration of this matter has led to the view that where the Constitution guarantees certain rights to a particular category it does not necessarily follow that the Oireachtas is inhibited from granting similar rights by law to other categories.  We are proceeding on the basis that what is proposed in this Bill is compatible with the provisions of the Constitution.  Legal advice has, however, drawn attention to the fact that the question <Col N="876" /> of the exclusivity or otherwise of the rights granted to citizens by the Constitution has not been authoritatively decided by the Supreme Court and that it is not possible that advice given in the absence of such a decision can be completely conclusive.  In such circumstances, should the President, in the exercise of his absolute discretion, see fit to refer this Bill to the Supreme Court, such a reference would have the very considerable advantage of removing all possibility of doubt from such a vital area as the validity of our electoral law.  I would emphasise, of course, that this is a matter entirely within the discretion of the President.</P>
    <P>By conferring on British citizens living here a right similar to that which Irish citizens have enjoyed in Britain for a long time, indeed since 1922, the Bill will redress an imbalance in the voting entitlements as between citizens of the two countries.  I believe that Senators will consider that this is in itself a sufficient justification for this Bill.  From the political viewpoint the Bill is also intended to give a further measure of practical expression to what has been referred to as the unique relationship which exists between this country and our nearest neighbour, the UK.</P>
    <P>There is no official information available as to the precise number of British citizens ordinarily resident in Ireland who will benefit from this measure but it is estimated that the number is in the region of 10,000 to 12,000.  In this connection, some British citizens already have voting rights by virtue of the fact that they hold both Irish and British citizenship.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that section 1 of the Bill proposes to define the expression &ldquo;British citizen&rdquo; by reference to the British Nationality Act, 1981.  Following consideration of a number of options this was considered the best way to express clearly the intention of the Bill.  Prior to 1981 there was no satisfactory definition of the term &ldquo;British citizen&rdquo;.  The British Nationality Act, 1981 distinguished three different categories of citizens &mdash; British citizens, British Dependent Territories citizens and British overseas citizens.  The present Bill will apply only to the first <Col N="877" /> named category, that is, to British citizens. In effect, this means to citizens of the United Kingdom.  It is not intended to extend the franchise to nationals of Commonwealth countries or of British territories.</P>
    <P>The Bill is set firmly in the context of the special relationship between this country and the United Kingdom and, in promoting it, the Government hope that it will contribute in a worth-while measure towards improving the climate of relations between all the peoples of these islands.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that, on Committee Stage, the Seanad will be invited to consider a technical amendment to section 2 of the Bill in relation to collective citation and construction in order to take account of the likelihood that the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1983 will be enacted before this measure.  That last point relates to what we were discussing in the previous legislation that the House has just passed.</P>
    <P>I strongly commend this Bill to the Members of the House.  It is, I believe, a very clear and practical political expression by all parties represented in this House to improve quickly the relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland.</P>

      <P>The leader of our party when he was Taoiseach in 1980 agreed with the Prime Minister of Britain that a reciprocal arrangement would be provided here.  For that reason we have no objection from this side of the House. The unanimity expressed here and in the other House comes at a time when this country should be giving this type of example.  Legislation which could be used in respect of cross-Border traffic and in the removal of the Border at a later date must be accepted in both Houses.</P>
      <P>Many British citizens living in this State have made a worthwhile contribution to industry, socially and in technological training.  They have been resident here for some time.  Nevertheless, the question of legislation to extend this right to British citizens on a reciprocal basis is more complex than might at first appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1698 the House of Commons debarred all aliens from having the right to vote in elections, referenda or in elections to the House of Lords.  As history tells us, up to 1922 we were not regarded as foreigners or aliens under British law. Up to 1949 we were still regarded as non-aliens and non-foreigners because then we were under a different legal system, we were in a British dominion. Although The Republic of Ireland Act, 1949, changed that somewhat, since 1949 citizens of Ireland are not in British law regarded as aliens or foreigners although there are classifications of various sections <Col N="879" /> of Irish people.  I do not know if it is a good thing to be regarded as an alien or a foreigner.  If we look at the other side of the coin, if British nationality law was changed at any time, what would be our standing then?  This legislation does not give to citizens of EEC states the right to vote in Dáil elections.  Membership of the Community will bring many people to Ireland from other countries who will be resident here for long periods but as the Bill now stands it will not give the nationals of member states the right to vote in this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the most crucial point, namely, the matter of constitutionality of the Bill.  I am not a legal person, but having listened to the varied opinions of my legal friends on both sides of the House on another matter recently I wonder what will happen to this Bill when the legal people get hold of it and start to examine it.  I have no doubt the constitutionality of this Bill could be questioned.  Knowing what happened in the legal field of activities in recent times that is a probability.  The reduction in the voting age from 21 years to 18 years was a non-contentious measure but the then Government felt that it would be unconstitutional to bring in legislation without first giving the Irish people the right to decide in a referendum.  It was a very good thing to have that referendum to lower the age from 21 to 18 but it took a referendum to do that.  It was a purely internal domestic matter that concerned this country solely but it took a referendum to make it constitutional.  In the final analysis this matter will have to be considered carefully by the legal people.  I have no doubt the Minister has got the benefit of the legal advice available to him.  All the Seanad can do is to pass the Bill with the reservations I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not know which party will get the benefit of the 10,000 to 12,000 voters who will come on to the register as a result of this measure.  I would simply hazard a guess that neither the Minister's party nor my party will benefit from their inclusion on the register.</P>

      <P>I join with Senator <Col N="880" /> O'Toole in welcoming the substantive provisions of this Bill.  As he remarked, the matter goes back to 1980 when the undertaking was given by the then Taoiseach that this would be done.</P>
      <P>My only regret is that there has been a substantial delay.  Part of this delay may well have been due to the difficulties of constitutionality, but we must be glad that at last we have a Bill before us.  We hope that the constitutionality will be tested at an early date, whether tested at the absolute discretion of the President or tested otherwise after the enactment of the Bill.  Senator O'Toole says that legal opinions differ but at least if we can get the Supreme Court to speak they will not differ quite as much.  They may disagree but at least we will have a binding opinion on it.</P>
      <P>What we are doing now is something that should have been done long ago. While there are very clear arguments that perhaps we should extend what is being done in this Bill to all our partners in the EEC, nevertheless it is appropriate that we should do it first in regard to Britain. There is a special relationship there.  Our country and Britain inter-penetrate one another; not just economically but socially and culturally there is a degree of inter-penetration that makes for a special relationship between us.  I do not think that should be exaggerated but it is appropriate that voting in all of our elections should be extended first to UK citizens. I hope there will not be too long a delay before there is a further extension to the citizens of all the countries in the EEC.</P>
      <P>It is a sound principle.  I do not think we should make too much of it as having any great profound effect, but it was a deficiency, maybe to some people an irritant, that the imposition was for so many years as it is at present.  We have all had the experience of canvassing in elections and people answering the door saying, &ldquo;Well, you will not let us vote&rdquo;. This position is now being remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was just wondering when Senator O'Toole was speaking in regard to where the votes would go if there are any UK citizen members of county councils.  It might be interesting to see whether votes <Col N="881" /> have been cast by UK citizens in the Seanad elections.  I do not know what is the position.  If the position is that there has been a bar, I hope they will not be debarred in the future.  I hope that Senator O'Toole will get his fair share of those extra votes but no more than his fair share.  On behalf of the Fine Gael group I welcome this Bill.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome what is, in fact, an extension of democracy.  It is appropriate that anybody who lives in the country should have a voice in who governs the country and how it is governed.  Indeed UK citizens have expressed concern that although they live here and have to abide by our laws and regulations they do not have a voice in our Dáil elections as of now.  They have extended a comparable right to our citizens in England.  I could imagine the uproar that would occur in England if the Irish there were not able to express at times their abhorrence of some of the Conservative policies that are being enacted over there.  I would like to feel that we are extending a similar right to those who are permanently resident in this country, and who are resident on the dates required by the compilation of the electoral lists.  I see nothing fundamentally wrong with it.  It is an extension of democracy and I certainly welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  Indeed it is legislation that is very much overdue, and one wonders why it has taken so long to have it brought before the House.  There seems to have been a desire on the parts of politicians and Irish citizens generally that the British citizens living with us be given the right to vote.  Great Britain was generous enough to facilitate Irish citizens immediately they landed on British soil and to give them the facility of voting in British elections.  One wonders why it has taken so long for this very desirable piece of legislation to come before us.  Will the Minister tell us if this extends to citizens of the Isle of Man, the nearest island to us?  There is some difference there <Col N="882" /> between British citizens and citizens of the Isle of Man.</P>
      <P>During the years when I was a Member of the other House there were numerous questions to Ministers.  On all occasions it would appear that there was some shadow boxing.  The matter was not completely considered and investigated.  On one occasion it was thought it would require a change in the Constitution, but now we find we can deal with the matter without a change in the Constitution.  I regret that we did not arrive at that position many years ago and allow British citizens to vote in general elections in the past.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure that Senator O'Toole was correct that the votes of the 10,000 plus will go all in one direction.  I am sure that will not happen.  I have had many British citizens approach me, as I am sure most public representatives have had, with regard to this matter.  I know two of them who are very favourable to his party because they were quite straight with me. They asked me to do what I could to ensure that they would in the future have a vote and they also assured me that it was most unlikely they they would be voting for my party.  The Senator should not be too disheartened that 10,000 will be against his party.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Members of the House for their contributions.  Three points have arisen which I would like to deal with very quickly.  The first is the question of constitutionality.  I want to restate what we have said before.  We are quite happy that the provision is constitutional.  However, a respectable body of legal doubt has been expressed against that view.  In order to avoid a situation where the entire result of a general election in which UK citizens participated could be challenged it is obviously necessary as well as prudent to remove all legal doubt. Accordingly, there is a provision under the Constitution whereby the President at his own absolute discretion, and I want to stress this, can refer this measure to the Supreme Court for their opinion.  If that is done and if the Supreme Court <Col N="883" /> give a clear and decisive ruling on the matter then that particular fear can be removed out of the way.</P>
      <P>There seems to be on both sides a degree of unanimity and support for the proposal to extend Dáil election rights to all EEC citizens currently resident in the Republic.  The reason that is not in the legislation here is not because there is a Government decision against that; there is no Government decision for it either. We wanted specifically to highlight the concrete and practical measures that this administration are taking to develop and improve relations between Britain and Ireland and to follow up on initiatives that have been taken by both administrations, Fianna Fáil when in office and by Fine Gael and Labour.  It was to emphasise that it was maintained as an exclusive element, so as not to be open to the charge that we were giving the right to everyone.</P>
      <P>The last point I want to make is in relation to the points raised by Senator McMahon.  It is our clear understanding that the residents and citizens of the Isle of Man would qualify for inclusion under the first categorisation of British citizen as defined in the 1981 Act.  Therefore, as a consequence, they would automatically be eligible to have the vote here, provided they met all the requirements of residence and so forth.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooge made a point in relation to a local authority member who in theory could be a UK citizen and had voted in the Seanad elections.  I do not know if he is referring to anything specific.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan) Michael Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to continue in force, on a permanent basis, the statutory powers in the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956, as renewed from time to time; to provide that orders made under the legislation may be of permanent duration; to extend the time limit within which proceedings for summary offences may be brought, and to provide for increased penalties for offences.</P>
      <P>The Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 was enacted originally for a period of three years.  As the need for the legislation has continued to exist the Act has been renewed under various continuance Acts.  The most recent of these was the Control of Exports (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1956 (Continuance) Act, 1982 which extended the operation of the 1956 Act for a period of one year until 31 December 1983.  That particular measure was the eighth renewal of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act empowers the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism to prohibit, by Order, the export of industrial goods of any description save under licence issued by him.  In accordance with the Act such Orders have a life of 12 months only and may be annulled by a resolution of either House of the Oireachtas at any time during that period.  Control is at present exercised on a range of goods under the Control of Exports Order, 1982, copies of which were presented to the House in December 1982.  I wish to inform Senators that I am satisfied that there is a continuing <Col N="886" /> need for this legislation for four main reasons.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it enables us to comply with our obligations under European Economic Community law to restrict the export of essential materials to third countries where such action is necessary and for the benefit of Irish and Community processors generally.  At present these obligations require the exercise of restrictions on the export of certain scarce scrap metals to conserve supplies and to maintain conditions of comparative price stability in the Community market.</P>
    <P>Secondly, it provides the Government with the legislative authority necessary to ensure that strategic materials are not exported from or through this country to destinations where they could be used for undesirable purposes.  Export control on material classified as strategic is not operated at Community level.  By arrangement, members of the European Economic Community and some other countries control the export of such materials under their national legislation, and this Bill will enable this country to continue to do likewise.  Our participation in this international strategic control is based on this country's need to import certain high technology industrial materials and components required by more sophisticated industries which in latter years have been established here and which contribute significantly to our exports.  Since the movement of these materials to Ireland is contingent on our participation in the strategic control arrangements, it is essential that the Minister should continue to control the export of materials of a strategic character to ensure continued access to the materials and components concerned to the extent that they are needed and thereby ensure that employment is maintained in the industries which use them.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, Senators will agree that it is only prudent for any Government to have immediately available to it a means of dealing quickly with any emergency which might deprive the country of essential materials and which might be required before corrective legislation could be enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> Finally, it is essential to have the authority to control exports to any country if such action were required by our foreign or other policy considerations.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this legislation has been renewed by the House on eight occasions. It is now in operation for over 26 years.  I am satisfied that the reasons for its retention, which I have just outlined, will continue for the foreseeable future. As no practical difficulties have arisen during the entire period of its operation, I consider that the time has come to make the legislation permanent and, in addition, to provide that orders made under it are also permanent.  My proposal should also appeal to Senators for the reason that permanent legislation will remove the need to take up the time of the House with future routine renewals.</P>
    <P>In addition to making the legislation permanent, I would now like to draw the attention of Senators to two other changes in the existing legislation which are included in the Bill.  The changes concern penalties for offences and the time limit on institution of summary proceedings. The present maximum penalty, which was fixed in 1977, for making a false or misleading statement in order to obtain an export licence is £500.  I consider that this is not an adequate penalty because of the fall in the value of money since then.  In addition I believe that a more effective deterrent is needed by way of imprisonment and value related fines to discourage misrepresentations, particularly in the area of high technology.  The value of such goods can often be very substantial, and unauthorised exports of strategic goods could put Irish industry, and employment in it, in jeopardy.  High technology sales abroad are now making a major contribution to the growth in our exports, and the seriousness of any act which would put this contribution at risk cannot be overstated.  In the circumstances, I consider that the penalties outlined in section 3 of the Bill will be effective and, at the same time, be fair in that they are not excessive in the light of the considerations involved.  I should specify that these penalties are:&mdash; for summary conviction a fine not exceeding £800 or <Col N="888" /> imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both the fine and the imprisonment; and for conviction on indictment a fine not exceeding £10,000 or three times the value of the goods for which the licence is sought whichever is the greater or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>With regard to summary proceedings, experience has shown that the normal six month period allowed under the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, for the initiation of such proceedings and which has operated in the legislation up to now, is inadequate.  In the area of export control there can be a considerable time lapse between the date of commission of an offence and its discovery and completion of an investigation.  For that reason it is proposed in section 3(9) that summary proceedings may be commenced at any time within two years of the date of an offence.</P>
    <P>Apart from the changes to which I have referred this Bill is the same as the export legislation which has been in force for many years, and for the reasons which I have outlined I commend it to the favourable consideration of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Minister of State.  We would have an even greater welcome if he was introducing a Bill to secure some of the investors in PMPS, but perhaps he will be back very soon with proposals in that regard. This legislation has come before the House on a number of occasions and this is more or less a replica of what has been considered over the past 26 years except that we are now giving it a permanent face and hence we will not have a reason for the introduction of routine Bills.  It is essentially to safeguard against shortages in scrap metal and to ensure that we have overriding control over these areas in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the midwest region we have had some fantastic developments in the microchip and the technological areas and obviously with that new technology this legislation is very important.  A couple of years ago the press highlighted the problems which related to the possible <Col N="889" /> export of material from this country &mdash; I think it was to Libya &mdash; and hence the necessity to ensure that all this is used for the purpose for which it is originally intended.  I note that the Minister of State did not refer to timber although I think in the earlier statement his Minister spoke about it in the Dáil.  I wonder if we regard timber as a strategic material, because if we do we are paying very scant attention to how we harness it as a resource.  We are importing over 80 per cent of our requirements and still have not faced up to the question of how we can harness these resources although we are exporting timber at as low a rate as £1 per ton.  I would draw the Minister's attention to it although it does not come altogether within the confines of this Bill. It is non-controversial legislation, and Fianna Fáil welcome it and give full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We also welcome the Bill on this side of the House.  The important thing is that it makes it of permanent duration as it was ludicrous that a Minister had to come back once every 12 months to have a continuation of an Order or to allow him to operate within the confines of his Department.  I was quite annoyed recently that the British authorities refused entry into their markets of fowl from this country just because of an isolated outbreak of a specific disease which may have come across the Border in any case.  Have we powers to control imports of undesirable commodities? We have quarantine arrangements but it might be no harm to fire a shot over the bow, so to speak.  There is a lucrative export market to people who have invested quite a bit of money in that part of Monaghan and we must ensure that all the EEC regulations are complied with and that free trade would operate between countries and in the area of export, particularly of produce suitable for human consumption.  I was rather annoyed that they seemed to ignore as they did over the past couple of days in Athens, the whole principles of the Treaty of Rome, and when the Minister is responding he might say what powers we have in the area of imports.  If this <Col N="890" /> country might be used as an inter-route, I would be particularly worried about the drugs and the arms scene because it is occasionally used as a cockpit for people trying to get their wares to other countries.</P>

      <P>On the import and export of strategic materials, in early 1982 a plane landed in Shannon airport and its manifest suggested that it was full of spare parts for machinery which were going to South America.  The plane was serviced at Shannon and when it got to the United States it was found to be filled with armaments for South America, coming from Israel.  If we are serious about this Bill how do we prevent or analyse what is going through the international airports at Dublin or Shannon?  To suggest that scrap metal is a strategic material is one thing but to say and to be able to prove that armaments can go through Shannon airport from a warring country to be used in another country is ludicrous.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief.  I welcome the measure.  It is important that a small country such as ours should have permanent legislation which gives the authorities the maximum control over trade imports and exports, apart from the points raised by Senator Lanigan.  I hope that the Minister will avail of an early opportunity to make a few amendments to the export promotion legislation which would enable CTT to grant aid sales people who may not themselves be manufacturers or producers.  I know that this does not arise under this Bill but nevertheless there are quite a number of people with agencies operating from outside this country and yet they do not seem to get the kind of support that their success sales indicate they are entitled to from State sources.  I wish the Bill success and I am glad that it will be permanent legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators for their constructive approach to this measure.  The legislation envisaged in this Bill has been on the Statute Book since 1956 by way of a succession of <Col N="891" /> renewed temporary provision Acts.  The provision of the Bill was identified with these in the continuation Acts except for changes dealing with the penalties.  By far the greatest administrative activities in export licensing are those of the electronic and computer sectors which, as Senators are aware, are our most successful industrial growth areas with big exports and great employment potential. The components and materials for these industries must be imported and, to ensure a continued supply, it is essential to show that we are exercising adequate measures in controlling exports of the strategic end products.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan pinpointed that with regard to the Shannon area.  This is an area in which there is tremendous growth and major expansion is possible.  We must be very responsible in the export of these computers and other components, so that there is a great responsibility on us from that point of view.  Shannon is controlled under the area but it is not under the Department: the customs and excise authorities have to exercise the controls to ensure that Ireland is not used as a transshipment centre to countries to which strategic materials are sent.  Any case of that nature would be fully and thoroughly investigated, and I hope it does not happen too often.</P>
      <P>Senator Smith referred to timber.  The Departments of Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry control timber, and my Department only grant a licence for export in consultation with these two Departments.</P>
      <P>The question raised by Senator Ferris relates to the Department of Agriculture and I understand they are dealing with that with a view to finding a solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Bulbulia</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Cathaoirleach for acceding to my request to raise this matter on the Adjournment and to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Donal Creed, for coming along to hear what I have to say.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter of Ballygunner national school in Waterford because of the intense public disquiet in Waterford at what appears to be an unacceptable delay in allowing this to go to tender.  In order to make my case and to point out the deficiencies which exist in this national school I will go over the history and origin of the difficulties which parents, pupils and particularly staff are experiencing in this school, which is about two miles from the centre of Waterford City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original school at Ballygunner is situated opposite the parish church and it was built in 1843.  It served generations of Ballygunner children for about a period of 100 years.  In 1941 the old school ceased to function because a new school was provided to cater for about 90 children. In 1966, due to pressure and demand for places, another classroom was added to this building along with six toilets, two for boys and four for girls. Things proceeded happily enough and in 1977 there was again a demand for extra places so two prefabs were erected in the school yard to cope with the increased demand for entrance to this school.  At the time, the Department of Education, when sanctioning the provision of the prefabs, insisted that they should be secondhand because a new school was to be <Col N="893" /> built.  The prefabs came to Ballygunner from Wicklow and are now 15 years old. They are in a rotten condition, and I mean that quite literally.  There are gaps in the floor and gaps in the walls.  The rain is coming in and, as a result of the damp, the electric wiring has become quite dangerous and only one heater at a time can be used, which makes for acute discomfort in cold weather for children and staff.  In 1981 the original old school &mdash; that built in 1843 &mdash; had to be reopened because there was pressure of numbers.  It was opened to accommodate another class.  Two portakabin toilets were erected to serve this room.  These toilets drain into a septic tank located in a nearby field and there had to be an agreement made for the use of the field for this purpose.  This agreement was made for three years and is due to expire in June 1984.</P>
    <P>The school at present has an enrolment of 249 boys and girls.  I have seen these conditions.  I visited the school on Monday morning and I was quite shocked and dismayed at what I saw.  The six toilets in the main school are used by over 200 children.  There are four toilets for 86 girls &mdash; when I visited only three of those toilets were actually functioning &mdash; and two toilets for 143 boys.  I have more than that number of toilets in my house for my family.  That indicates the difficulties the teachers and the children are experiencing. I was very taken aback when one of the infant teachers said to me that one little boy was so upset and distressed at the conditions he found in the toilets that he had regressed to infant behaviour in his toilet habits, and she felt he was an intelligent, bright little fellow but that so unhygienic were the conditions, despite the best efforts of the staff, that one could not blame this little boy for the effect this had on him.  If this has happened to one child whom she knows about it is not surprising that others should experience the same distaste.</P>
    <P>There is a problem of sharing classes because of accommodation difficulties. We have third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes taught by three teachers in the following groupings: all of third class and some of fourth are together; some of <Col N="894" /> fourth and some of fifth are grouped together and some of fifth and all of sixth are grouped together.  As a teacher myself I realise, and anybody who seriously considers the problem will realise, the difficulties that this poses for teachers. It means that you have to set one group working quietly on a project while you teach the others and then swing around and teach the ones who have been working away quietly and give the others some work to do.  It does not create good classroom atmosphere and is not the way you would choose to arrange the teaching of any subject.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education recognise the difficulties and the growth in numbers because they sanctioned the appointment of an eighth teacher and the advertisements for this post were put in the papers last week.  But when this appointment is made there is going to be a further problem of where does the new teacher go with his or her class.  When I visited the school on Monday they were talking about dividing up a pre-fab, putting a partition there in order to create the space necessary to allow this teacher to teach a class.  A partition is paper thin and children will recite things and there will be a certain amount of noise in a class, so I think that both from the point of view of physical comfort and of sound this is not going to work at all.  Yet they badly need this extra teacher.</P>
    <P>The history of representations goes back a long way in relation to this school. They were first made concerning the provision of a new school as long ago as 1979.  Its provision was agreed to by the Department of Education at that time. In July 1981 the Department of Education instructed the Commissioners of Public Works by way of a letter to treat the plans for the proposed school as a matter of top priority.  I would emphasise that that was as long ago as July 1981.  On 24 February 1983 &mdash; this was quite a red letter day for Ballygunner, for parents, children and staff &mdash; the grant towards the provision of the new building was sanctioned by the Department.  The latest position is as given in a reply to a Dáil Question, that the question of authorising <Col N="895" /> the invitation of tenders is being considered at present and that at this stage it is not possible to say when building may commence.</P>
    <P>The parents appreciate that there are difficulties in our public capital programme and in finance nationally but they felt that when the grant was sanctioned on 24 February, it was not too much to expect that in November it should have been possible to give the green light to seeking tenders so that building could start so that by next September there will be some classrooms on site in order to allow this school to expand.  Because they have been getting answers in the vein of &ldquo;as soon as is possible&rdquo; and &ldquo;we will do our best to expedite this&rdquo; and &ldquo;we are not yet in a position to inform&rdquo;, they are not happy. There is a volume of anger, resentment and frustration about this.  The parents have formed an action committee.  The priest, quite uncharacteristically, from the altar the Sundary before last, feeling defensive, no doubt, felt that he should state that both he and the board of management and the parish priest had done all in their power to bring this plan to fruition, but that the blame lay with the Department of Education.  There has been a public petition signed, a public meeting is planned and the issue has made the headlines in the local newspapers so all in all there is quite a storm of resentment, anger and deep bitter frustration building up.</P>
    <P>Many people sent their children to that school last September on the understanding and knowledge that there would be a new school.  In fact, a rather curious thing happened in that the site is already in existence for the new school and it is to be shared with Ballygunner GAA.  Work started on the preparation of a pitch for the hurling and football activities.  When many parents saw the earthworks and the general activity on the site they assumed that this was the construction of the school being started.  From February until the end of August or September many of them were happily under the impressive that the school was being constructed. So I suppose their irritation is <Col N="896" /> all the greater when they realised that, in fact, what they saw was not the school but the GAA pitch.</P>
    <P>I will refer to some difficulties which staff and pupils are experiencing as a result of the cramped and overcrowded conditions.  On Thursday, 24 November, the school had to close early because the water pump was not working properly and so there was no water.  The few toilets that are there could not be used.  The fire brigade had to be called to refill the tank and the principal had to make five telephone calls to the corporation to have a team sent up to look at the pump.  He could not make these telephone calls from the school because such a luxury as a phone does not exist there.  He had to run down to the village to use the public call box.  Again this is a deficiency.  I imagine that at this stage most primary schools in the country have a telephone. To date my information is that there is still no drinking water in the school. When I visited it on Monday we were able to have our cup of tea courtesy of a neighbour.  The teachers went across with a kettle and had it filled.</P>
    <P>The old school which was built in 1843 and which is now in use again has to be seen to be believed.  There is a grand young, enthusiastic teacher down there with 40 children crammed into a limestone building.  There is not sufficient natural daylight so neon lights have to be used all day long.  In fact during a lunch break recently one of the neon lights came crashing off the ceiling and smashed on the floor.  They were extremely lucky that no child was injured as a result of this.  This building is dingy, decrepit, Dickensian and, by any standard of care and education, it is not acceptable in the Ireland of 1984.  This teacher is down there in isolation from his other colleagues. At break time he must march these children up the slight incline to the school in all weathers and they march down again when break is over.  It is an unnatural situation to have children separated and in such appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>The pre-fabs are now in particularly poor condition, as I have already mentioned. The windows are rotting, there <Col N="897" /> are holes in the dividing walls and the roof leaks.  The children have to cross the play area in all weathers to go to the toilets in the main school.  This area of Ballygunner, just two-and-a-half miles or so from the centre of Waterford, is a rapidly developing residential area.  In fact, I had a note from the Minister for the Environment the other day to indicate that he had sanctioned 78 more local authority houses to commence in that area in the New Year.  In the last four years the baptismal records of the parish show that 300 children have been registered for baptism.  So these in turn will be coming on stream and will rightly look to receive their primary education in their own parish of Ballygunner.  Parents are fearful that they may not be able to realise this hope.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the teachers who are commendably committed to and enthusiastic about their work, although they operate in such deplorable conditions.  There is no staffroom.  We had our cup of tea in a corner of one of the classrooms.  There is no place where they can relax totally as one needs to. Teaching is very demanding, as I know since it was my profession.</P>
    <P>When the school doctor visits to do the routine public health examination of children there is no accommodation for him, so one of the classrooms must be vacated while the doctor attends to the children. This leaves a situation of about 80 children in one class for the period while the doctor is there, usually from 10 a.m. until 12.30 p.m. or 1 p.m.  No teacher can teach 80 children.  The most they can do is adopt a policy of containment while the doctor's visit is in progress.  Again, that is a lamentable situation.</P>
    <P>All of this overcrowding has a most inhibiting effect on teaching.  One of the teachers said to me that there is no possibility to do physical education, no possibility to have art work unless with great difficulty you carry water and mix paints at a great distance, and there is no possibility to do drama.  All of these have been recognised as enriching for children and vital to their personal growth, and confidence and to making them well-rounded citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="898" /> It is important to stress that the school administrator, Father Liddane who is the parish priest, and Father Cooney who is the curate, together with the school manager and the chairman of the board of management have over a long period been constantly in touch with the Department to have the various stages expedited.  They certainly have fulfilled all their obligations in this respect. At the instigation of the school doctor a health inspector attached to the South Eastern Health Board recently visited the premises and is to submit a report to the South Eastern Health Board in due course.</P>
    <P>Last Thursday week classes were suspended because of water problems in the school.  That really in summary indicates the present situation in the school.  I will be looking to the Minister in his reply to indicate to me when these schools can go to tender.  It is important that there would be classrooms on site by next September. I hope that when he tells me it can go to tender he will talk about a continuous roll-on tender rather than a phased-type tender, because we do not want a beginning, a middle and eventually an end.  We would like to see the whole thing roll and to see that the end is in sight.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would just thank the Minister once again for listening to me. I hope he will have something hopeful and positive to say, because I want to carry back news to the parents action committee and to the people of Ballygunner that he is aware of their plight and aware of the difficulties under which they labour and that he will give the green light to this school to go ahead.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of attending here in the Seanad on this Adjournment debate and to listen and take note of the points made by Senator Bulbulia.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties in Ballygunner. Today I have had a look at the file and have had discussions with officials of my Department on the matter.  I am aware of the urgency in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something that strikes me about primary schools particularly is that every <Col N="899" /> deputation I receive, and incidentally I cut a deputation short in relation to another primary school to attend at this Adjournment debate, regard their own case as the most urgent case and in need of special attention.  This applies also to whatever public representative is involved.  I want to take up just a few points that have been raised before dealing with the history of Ballygunner school.  I share with Senator Bulbulia her appreciation of the work being done by many primary teachers throughout this country who are working in appalling conditions in schools that are in urgent need of repair.  Teachers and boards of management and all concerned have been heroic in this regard because conditions in many of the cases are very far from adequate or very far from what the position should be.  At the same time the situation in relation to primary schools in which the blame is being laid at the Department of Education is not altogether correct, because the system is of course that the building of a primary school is a very complicated and difficult development.  It must be borne in mind that the responsibility for the building of primary schools and for the primary-school programme is shared with another agency, the Office of Public Works.  I have regularly heard responsibility for school building being laid at the door of the Department of Education.  That is not altogether the case, and I can assure the Senator that so far as the Department and the officials are concerned, we are very well aware of the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>There is the other factor of resources which is one that is rarely taken into consideration &mdash; the resources that are available to the Department in any particular year.</P>
    <P>I wish to state the history of the school in Ballygunner.  I appreciate that the Senator's concern in raising the question of the provision of a new national school at Ballygunner, County Waterford, is to stress the urgency she attaches to the completion of this project.  Indeed I am very much aware of the problems in relation to existing school accommodation in <Col N="900" /> Ballygunner, of the necessity at present to accommodate classes in prefabricated rooms and in other accommodation away from the main body of the schools and also of the growing pressure of enrolments in the area.  It is necessary, however, to put this project in a realistic perspective, the perspective being that national school buildings are long-lasting institutions and that when new schools are provided it is imperative to ensure that they cater not only for existing needs and immediate requirements but for the long term needs of the area as well.</P>
    <P>I want to lay emphasis on this difficulty that the professional educationalist within the Department has in determining what exactly are the educational needs of the future in relation to any school.  There are population trends which we go by and we have consultation regularly, but it is very difficult and this case in Ballygunner is no exception.</P>
    <P>This, in fact, was the context in which the proposal to provide additional accommodation in Ballygunner was considered when it was first raised in 1977 and the relative merits of extending the existing school on an enlarged site, or of erecting a completely new school on a new site, had to be carefully examined before my Department were in a position to take a decision as to the form the project might take.  Following an examination of the existing school and site, the Commissioners of Public Works reported that the site was only one acre in extent and that a suitable site extension would be required so that the additional accommodation which would meet foreseeable future needs could be built.  This is what I am referring to in relation to the determination or assessing of what the education needs of any particular area would be in the future.</P>
    <P>My Department advised the school authorities that a site of two-and-a-half acres was required to facilitate the necessary extension.  It was understood from the chairman of the school board of management on 31 January 1979 that he was unable to secure a suitable site extension and that he was seeking a completely new site for a new school.  In May 1979 the chairman informed the Department <Col N="901" /> that he had obtained an option from the county council on a site for a new school which was a half a mile from the existing school.  It was agreed in the same month that a 16-classroom school would be needed to meet the long term requirements of the area, the school to be built in two stages, the first stage of which would consist of eight classrooms and a general purposes room.  Subsequently, when details of the site were furnished, my Department asked the Commissioners of Public Works to furnish a report on its suitability.  It was understood in May 1980, that the site had been inspected but that difficulties had arisen in relation to sewerage facilities.  These difficulties were duly resolved, according to notification received in January 1981, and my Department were formally notified in April, 1981 that the site was suitable.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works were then instructed to undertake the preparation of sketch plans for the new school as a matter of urgency.  A sketch scheme was produced for consideration but revisions had to be undertaken and a suitable scheme was eventually agreed at the end of March 1982.  The question of title to the new site then arose for consideration and was taken up with the chairman of the school board of management on 23 April 1982 and title documents submitted by him were referred to the Chief State Solicitor on 5 May 1982.  Title was declared to be satisfactory by the Chief State Solicitor on 30 July 1982.  Agreement was then concluded with the chairman on the amount of the local contribution, on the basis of an up-dated statement of costs from the Commissioners of Public Works.  A formal grant sanction was issued for the project on 24 February 1983.</P>
    <P>Let me say also that another area which creates a quite considerable amount of negotiation is the local contribution in relation to the building of a school.  It is something that is negotiable and we have between our officials and the chairman of the board of management discussions and meetings in relation to the local contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> Anybody considering the history of this project will discern two main factors governing its progress.  The first of these, and it is one which I applaud, is the effort to reconcile immediate pressures and long-term needs, and I do not think we will have to wait too long before all concerned with the project, particularly at local level, will be congratulating themselves that they did not rush into the building of an immediate and inadequate extension to the existing school and be faced still with the problem of catering for the increasing primary education requirements of a growing population which is the case in the Ballygunner area.</P>
    <P>The second main factor is that once the basic decision had been made and a suitable site acquired, all concerned worked in harmony to ensure that this project was treated with the degree of urgency which it merited.  In normal circumstances the preparation of working drawings and other contract documents does not commence until satisfactory title to the site of the proposed school has been established and a grant sanctioned following agreement on the local contribution.</P>
    <P>In view of the urgency of this case in Ballygunner, however, planning proceeded while these matters were being dealt with, with the result that the contract documents are now virtually complete, requiring only a final check on the bill of quantities.  My Department are considering the question of releasing this project for invitation of tenders and I can give the Senator every assurance that this consideration will be undertaken as a matter of urgency in the light of the capital provision of 1984 for primary school building.  I might say at this stage that because of the concern of the Senator and of the public representatives in the constituency who have made representations, who have tabled Dáil Questions &mdash; I do not know how many letters have been written to the public representatives there in relation to this problem &mdash; I would like to be more specific in this particular case and say that I would be releasing this immediately.  This is what I would like to be in a position to do.</P>
    <P>On that particular note I am not aware <Col N="903" /> as of now what the capital allocation for primary school buildings will be in 1984. I agree with the Senator that quite a lot of expectations have been created through no fault of anybody's at times and that frustration has been created as a result of people not seeing the work in progress.  I share the concern not alone of the parents and teachers of Ballygunner but of many other areas particularly at primary school level where people are pressing for new schools and extensions. I want to say to Senator Bulbulia that I am looking at this case as a matter of urgency, and I sincerely hope that in the not too distant future I will be able to <Col N="904" /> give more specific information as to when we will proceed to the contract stage.</P>
