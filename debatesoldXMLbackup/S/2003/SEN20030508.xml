      <P>I have received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline his Department's view with regard to St. Brigid's secondary school, Goresbridge, County Kilkenny and to outline the future of secondary education in the Goresbridge area.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
      <P>Before I call the Leader I want to draw Members' attention to the regulations governing the use of mobile phones in the Chamber. Mobile phones should be switched off in the Chamber. It is quite disturbing to proceedings when phones ring and it also causes problems for the official recordings. I am asking for Members' co-operation in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, motion to refer to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service the subject matter of No. 15 on today's Order Paper concerning the draft Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour, the purpose of which is to draw together the various existing rules governing the behaviour of civil servants and address other issues which have come to the fore in more recent years, and which have not been the subject of specific instructions, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on the recently published national standards for foster care, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time; No. 3, statements on Northern Ireland, to be taken at 2 p.m. and to conclude not later than 4 p.m., with the contri<Col N="1318" />butions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes. It was put to me that all speakers should have ten minutes and they may share time if they so wish. There will be a sos from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business as proposed by the Leader and I thank her for so quickly organising the debate on Northern Ireland, which will be very useful in terms of getting the response of Government in the House and the response of colleagues to the current situation there.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise an issue arising from a report in one of today's newspapers to the effect that the Catholic bishops may veto a merger that is likely to take place between the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland and the Scout Association of Ireland. As Members know, scouting in this country from the early part of the last century was divided on denominational lines. The notion that the Catholic bishops could veto such a merger is quite sectarian and I ask them to reconsider such a position, if that is the position.</P>
      <P>I also say to the bishops through this House that this State lectures the citizens of Northern Ireland on a regular basis about tolerance, reconciliation, and the need for ecumenism on all sides, but we need to show these values in this State too. Is it not outrageous that 30,000 kids cannot come together in an organisation which has done so much to help children over the past 100 years or so, since the days of Baden Powell? This House should take a firm position on this issue and support the merger between the Catholic Boy Scouts and the Scout Association of Ireland at a time when it is difficult to get volunteers to help such organisations in their excellent work. I take this opportunity to make this point on the Order of Business because we should say it. We always speak about reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Let us show some reconciliation in this State too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is worth noting the point made by Senator Brian Hayes but it is also worth noting that both Houses of the Oireachtas legislated in recent times to make it legal to discriminate on the grounds of religion in every primary school and institute of education. We should not stop at the scouts. We are now paying the price of the so-called equal status legislation which has introduced discrimination, legislation which we on these benches opposed all the way but which is now being applied to the scouts too. There is no question but that discrimination, apartheid, is endemic. The leaders of two churches in this country argued with me that I was unfair in my comments about them when I objected to this legislation. This is what is happening now. Senator Brian Hayes is absolutely correct, but nobody cares that for the past 100 years a non-believer could not become a boy scout or a girl guide. That is the other side of it, which nobody cares much about. That is the way it has been structured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" />On the Order of Business yesterday, the Cathaoirleach responded to a matter raised by Senator Glynn about Kilbeggan racetrack. We have had many debates in this House about the importance of rural Ireland, about the cutting back of resources and infrastructure. Every time this issue arises it relates to a small issue in a small constituency in the middle of nowhere, and nobody cares about it. This is the kind of thing this House should be taking an interest in, not because of Kilbeggan in County Westmeath, but because a resource is being taken away from a small place.</P>
    <P>I tried to book in some months ago for yesterday's meeting in Kilbeggan. There is no hotel in Kilbeggan. The only infrastructure it has is its racetrack. I decided to book into Ballinrobe for tonight's race meeting there, but there is no hotel there either, and the next cutback may affect its racetrack. Infrastructure in rural Ireland is being repeatedly pulled back, and all the attractions that might be there for people &ndash; lakes, racetracks or walkways &ndash; are being taken away. I would urge the Leader of the House to continue her efforts to get support on these issues. I could give 24 more examples, going round every town in Ireland showing lost infrastructure. There is no hotel in Kilrush, which the Cathaoirleach's Government said would be an ideal place for decentralisation. It would, but it is dying on its feet while it is waiting. We are pulling away from these towns all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had various requests over some time for a debate on competitiveness, as well as comments about public servants and public service benchmarking. We ought to have that debate, because virtually all the media people who criticise benchmarking are paid a hell of a lot better than 95% of the public servants they criticise. They have managed to benchmark themselves during the great boom years, with levels of salary that most public servants, or indeed Members of the Oireachtas, could never aspire to. People in glasshouses have been given the same advice for generations and they should be very wary of pointing fingers at others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is embarrassing Senator Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very difficult thing to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise. The second thing is that benchmarking was entered into because the same people who are now criticising it took great <Col N="1320" />exception to the old concept of relativities in the public service and wanted something based on private sector practice. The problem was that the private sector demanded that all the records of the benchmarking body be destroyed, so we do not know how that body came to any of its conclusions.</P>
      <P>It is a bit ridiculous to blame the people who have to some degree benefited from benchmarking for the incompetence &ndash; or the perceived incompetence &ndash; with which benchmarking was carried out because we cannot judge how decisions were arrived at. If we are to have a debate in this House about competitiveness, benchmarking and related issues, we ought not to talk merely about the public servants, only some of whom have benefited significantly. We need to talk also about the process, the thinking, the strange logic which demands that something be done, and then, when that turns out to benefit people who supposedly should not benefit, puts the blame on these beneficiaries for entering into the process. The trouble is that benchmarking went wrong from the point of view of those who promoted it &ndash; not, incidentally, the public services unions.</P>
      <P>We need a serious debate about competitiveness because there is an opinion abroad that wages are the cause of whatever problems the country has regarding competitiveness, though the appreciation of the euro is probably a far more significant factor. I know the Government is engaged in serious reflection on competitiveness and the economy, and this House could contribute.</P>
      <P>I would like this House to hear at an early stage the position of the Government on the new US, British and Spanish resolution in the UN Security Council regarding sanctions against Iraq. My understanding was that sanctions were imposed on Iraq not because we did not like the regime, but because we were not satisfied that the country had got rid of its weapons of mass destruction. If the United States, Britain and Spain want to certify that Iraq no longer has these weapons, then the sanctions can be dropped. It appears now that we are to be asked to drop the sanctions even though we are assured that the weapons are still there. I would like to hear the Government view.</P>
      <P>I agree completely with Senator O'Toole. The logic behind so much of our infrastructural development is to follow the market, which greatly pressurises the Dublin area, whereas the correct process would be to drive the market in a different direction. Otherwise we will end up with a grossly overpopulated east coast and a completely depopulated western section, for no reason other than lack of proper planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader, and Senator O'Brien, our spokesperson on rural development, to have a debate on this very important subject as soon as possible. I thank Senator O'Toole for his very kind support on the issue I raised yesterday pertaining to Kilbeggan racetrack. While it <Col N="1321" />might be the preserve of the Turf Club to grant or refuse a licence, it has thrown out the baby with the bath-water. There is no cognisance whatsoever given to such situations in rural Ireland. The infrastructure is being taken away. The racetrack is all that Kilbeggan has, apart from Locke's Distillery, which is a help, but in terms of the local economy, the existence and operation of the racecourse is paramount to Kilbeggan and to mid-Westmeath as a whole. We all know what the paragon of virtue in relation to planning, namely An Taisce, is doing to rural Ireland. The sooner we have this debate, the better.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the comments of Senator Ryan regarding competitiveness, and the comments made in relation to benchmarking by fat-cat chief executives of companies. Senator Ross's adjunct to the <i>Sunday Independent </i>business section carried a banner headline last week regarding six or seven chief executives, all of whom were earning more than &euro;1 million per annum. There is no chief executive today who merits such a salary. Many of them run ailing companies and it is time that shareholders took control for themselves.</P>
      <P>In this House yesterday, reference was made by Senator White to <i>The Economist. </i> This week's issue carries a very serious article in relation to Ireland under the heading, &ldquo;Ireland and Alcohol: Sláinte&rdquo;. Regarding Ireland's industrial performance, it quotes one estimate putting the overall cost of excessive boozing at nearly 2% of GDP in lower productivity resulting from drinkers not turning up for work, and from extra crime, particularly violence on our streets. That is a very damning and damaging article. I know we have debated the alcohol problem <i>ad nauseam</i>, yet when an international publication, read throughout the world, pens material like this, nothing is more calculated to damage Ireland's prospects. If a foreign industrialist is seeking to locate outside his country, he will certainly shy away from Ireland on the basis of this article.</P>
      <P>Until now we have tended to internalise the problem in terms of social costs. It is a serious new development when a world-renowned publication focuses on this issue with regard to productivity. This needs to be addressed, not by denying the article, but by addressing the fundamental truth that there is an alcohol epidemic in this country that is causing an awful lot of damage. This should be brought to the attention of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance. It should be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for the first time this week I find myself supporting Senator Brian Hayes, in this case on the question of the boy scouts. I think it is deplorable that the bishops should have inter<Col N="1322" />vened in the way they have. I know people on both sides of the scouting movement who have been working with great courage, diligence and perseverance in recent years to bring this merger about. They have dealt with issues such as emblems and displays etc., in an exemplary way. It is particularly important in relation to Northern Ireland. At a time when we should be bringing people together, anything that drives them apart is to be deplored.</P>
      <P>Following on from Senator Higgins's intervention, anything that brings young people together in an ethos of public and community service is one of the best ways of giving them an alternative to the pub. If public money is going to these organisations, the Ministers involved should look carefully at them if they are acting in a way that is divisive, rather than healing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Leader's attention to the decision by the European Commission to take Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to implement the fourth motor insurance directive. While this should have been done by July 2002, it has not yet been done. This is another example of the lack of attention we have paid to car insurance. We have called a number of times in recent yearsfor something to be done about it. That we are to be taken to court by the Commission shows the lack of interest Ireland has taken in the issue. While I do not know whether we need a debate here, the Minister's attention should be drawn to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views expressed by Senators Higgins and others about the drink epidemic in this country. This is a great country for passing laws. While we have many laws addressing this issue they are not enforced. As legislators we have done our job. It is time resources were provided, if they are not already in place, to ensure more enforcement. We are all aware of gardaí who are intimidated when they sit in patrol cars outside night clubs, chippers etc., and are afraid for their lives to get out of their cars in case they will be attacked. Enforcement is the issue.</P>
      <P>This House has a long and impressive record of debate on rural development. In light of remarks and media attention that has been focused on the International Fund for Ireland in recent days, I ask the Leader to provide for a debate on its annual report as we have traditionally debated it in this House. I take the opportunity to refute the points made by the American financial watchdog committee, a body similar to our Public Accounts Committee in that it investigates government spending. To suggest the International Fund for Ireland is a &ldquo;pork barrel&rdquo; initiative does grave disservice not only to Willie McCarter and the board of the International Fund for Ireland, but also to those who have received help and assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>America is the key donor to the fund and those of us who have had exchanges with American congressmen know of their strong support and <Col N="1323" />commitment to the continuance of this initiative that has helped to maintain, and in some cases restore, the fabric of life in the Border counties, North and South. American congressmen reiterated their commitment to this in their most recent visit here. I appreciate the Cathaoirleach's flexibility in allowing me talk about this in the context of seeking a debate. While President Bush is attempting to reduce the annual American donation from $25 million to $6 million, Irish-American congressmen have resisted this and wish to ensure that it is maintained at its current levels. I publicly acknowledge the debt the people of the Border counties owe to this fine fund and the donor countries of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope this is reported. It is an important initiative in the Border counties and the people who made these outrageous and inaccurate allegations should retract them in the interests of the IFI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This House recently debated the issue of crime, with particular reference to assaults in Dublin and other areas, with the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Regrettably for the Minister and his family, this was followed by an assault on his son that was publicised in the newspapers. I understand since then that the Minister has instigated an inquiry with the chief superintendent in order to establish where the leaked information that went to the press originated. At a time of scant resources it is unnecessary to embark on a witch-hunt on the paper involved. For a Cabinet that selectively leaks information when it is strategic to do so, to order an investigation such as this reeks of hypocrisy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>Without prejudice to the cogent case made by the two Senators Hayes on scouting, it is important to bear in mind that all traditions, including minority traditions, like to have some institutions that reflect their ethos while being open to others. Schools are the most obvious of these institutions. There is a fine line between desirable integration and respect for different traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with most that Senator Ryan said on the subject of benchmarking, with one exception. I believe the process was competently carried out. The proof of this is that it has been adopted and accepted, broadly speaking, by the trade union movement and other social partners. Statistics released yesterday showed that last year, our annual wage rises, having been at the top of the scale in 2001, had moved down the list quite a bit. <Col N="1324" />There will be a debate on social partnership next week. I also thank the Leader for organising a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points ably made by Senator Higgins regarding our difficulties with alcohol and support his call to bring the article he quoted to the notice of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We have a serious problem in providing an alternative to the pub. As Senator Ryan and others have said, excessive drinking is seriously impinging on our competitiveness. Even if the article is somewhat erroneous &ndash; sadly I do not think so &ndash; it provides a frightful perception and will adversely impact on foreign industrialists and others. Perhaps we could have a further debate on the matter in due course.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader inform the House when Committee Stage of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill will be taken? When will the Redundancy Payments Bill, published yesterday, come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Mansergh, I agree with what Senators Brian Hayes and Maurice Hayes have said. Respect for minorities who may want to maintain their identities should also be borne in mind. Whereas the motives of those in the majority church may be ones that we criticise, there may not be enthusiasm for this from all minorities. I would hate to think that they would have something imposed on them &ndash; in respect of the area of scouting &ndash; which they did not want. I do not know enough about the matter, but we should be sensitive about it.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan is correct that we should have a debate on competitiveness. This is an extremely important and relevant matter and, as Senator Higgins said, one of the most major ingredients of competitiveness is pay. Let us include in this executive pay. It is not just remuneration packages of &euro;1 million per year that are in question; there is at least one chief executive who is receiving nearly &euro;2 million per year. Senator Ryan is again correct when he says that people from the top of business and industry and IBEC should not lecture us about our pay when, without accountability, they award themselves such enormous amounts.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Education and Science to come before the House to discuss the fact that, within days, students will sit the leaving certificate examination and, as of now, they are uncertain about their future in third level? The Minister has flown many kites during the past six months with regard to his intentions. This has caused great concern among parents and students as to whether they will be capable of financing and resourcing their participation in third level education in the coming year. Will the Leader request the Minister to come before the House and indicate clearly his intentions on this matter and not to fudge it any longer? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coghlan raised the issue of Dúchas yesterday. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has done a great disservice to <Col N="1326" />the country by dissolving Dúchas, the agency which had been built up and which was beginning to have a currency with the public in regard to the built heritage. It would be a retrograde step if the Minister has yielded to pressure from the building construction industry to abolish this agency. I hope he will come before the House and indicate his reasons for the abolition of Dúchas.</P>

      <P>Over three and a half years ago the Minister for Finance announced that the decentralisation programme would focus on areas which had not previously benefited from it. The Leader promised a debate on decentralisation before Easter. Such a debate is urgent because the junior partner in the Government appears to be promising jobs. I hope those jobs will come to areas that have not already benefited.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, raised the matter of the merger between the Catholic Boy Scouts of Ireland and the Scouts Association and stated that this would provide a good example, particularly if the influence of the Catholic Church, which stated that it would not support such a move, was not brought to bear. It was interesting to listen to the various points raised by Senators. I share Senator Brian Hayes's view, namely, that it should proceed. This matter involves young people, public service and equipping them with life skills. I hope the bishops will rethink their position.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole said the equal status legislation is reinforcing discrimination. Everyone from County Westmeath was delighted when he raised the issue of Kilbeggan racecourse. As I said yesterday, it is not a matter for the Turf Club but rather for the Racing Board. I met the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, last night and had a lengthy conversation with him and he assured me he is attending to matter and hopefully there will be a positive outcome. I agree with Senator O'Toole about the rural resource aspect. Whatever about hotels, and Kilbeggan is in the vicinity of some very good hotels in Athlone and other areas, the racetrack brings much income to the town of Kilbeggan. Senator Glynn also referred to this matter, on which we are of one mind.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on competitiveness and the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. I hope to have that debate next week.</P>

    <P>Senator Higgins referred to the article about Ireland in <i>The Economist</i>.

      <P>She made a good speech yesterday in the United States. The Senator is correct in saying that the more we speak about it the more we highlight the problem. It is not that alcohol is bad, but rather that the abuse of alcohol is bad. We are all being led to be furtive about drinking a glass of wine or whatever. There is no need to be furtive about that. Alcohol in moderation is good for one. I am not a doctor, but I believe that to be the case. The abuse of alcohol is wrong and, as the Senator stated, it leads to a lack of competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes supported Senator Brian Hayes's call for a merger of the scouting organisations and referred to its potential for the development young people. He referred to the provision of public money under national lottery or youth funding. I could be wrong about both organisations receiving such funding, but I know that one receives considerable public moneys.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn said we are being tardy in regard to the implementation of the insurance directive. We hope to have the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, come before the House next week to debate the penalty points system and car insurance, for which he is responsible. I have made a request to have him present for the debate on Private Members' Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the enforcement of drink sanctions. He also decried what the watchdog body in the United State was saying or doing about the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane referred to the crime issue. I take issue with his remarks about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It was the Minister's son who was involved in the incident and what happens one's child is a very private matter. Any father or mother would wish to safeguard his or her children. I felt this strongly when I read about the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh said different religions need pockets of life in which they could preserve a distinct ethos. There is nothing wrong with that point of view, which was echoed in the House and is very interesting. We are hoping to have a debate on benchmarking next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan also mentioned the abuse of alcohol. The Redundancy Payments Bill will be debated next week while Committee Stage of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill will be debated the following week.</P>

      <Col N="1328" />Senator Ross said the question of respect for minorities was a sensitive issue. There is no doubt that it is. Schooling is one area where it has worked very well, despite the fact that community schools and colleges respect all religions. The Senator also asked for a debate on competitiveness, with which I agree. It is not true to say we awarded ourselves a pay rise. It was awarded to the public service by the benchmarking committee and it is up to anybody who does not wish to take the money to send it back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Foster care is the main form of alternative care provided by health boards for children in need of care and protection who cannot remain in their own homes. Over 4,500 children are currently in the care of the health boards, of whom approximately 4,000 are in foster care. These figures show the critical importance of the foster care services in our child protection and welfare service. Families and family life are very important to all children and the opportunity to experience the qualities of family life is one of the main objectives of the national children's strategy. For those children who cannot be looked after in their own families and need to be provided with alternative care, foster care provides the best way to experience family life. The challenge for us is to provide an appropriate response for the children of this vulnerable group. This response must respect their rights to a childhood in a secure family environment in order that they may fulfil their potential in adulthood.</P>
      <P>The importance the Government attaches to foster care was underlined by the publication in 2001 of the report of the working group on foster care, Foster Care: A Child-Centred Partnership. The report points the way forward to strengthening and developing the service and provides the guidelines to improve standards in foster care.</P>
      <P>This report noted that the foster care allowance was not adequate to meet the needs of children in foster care and it recommended that the allowance be increased. In August 2001 the allowance was substantially increased, alleviating the need for foster parents to apply to health boards for every extra financial need of their foster child or children. Before August 2001 the allowance was &euro;90.85 per week for a child under 12 years and &euro;108.88 per week for a child of 12 years and over. The current rates of payment are &euro;281.50 and &euro;308.50 per week respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to ensure the highest quality of care nationally, the report also recommended that national standards for foster care be established. <Col N="1330" />This is one of the most significant recommendations in the report and I was delighted to launch these standards officially on 29 April this year.</P>
    <P>The National Standards for Foster Care Committee was established in September 2001. The committee comprises representatives of the Department of Health and Children, the social services inspectorates in the Republic and in Northern Ireland, the health boards, the Irish Foster Care Association, the Irish Association of Social Workers and the Daughters of Charity. The wide-ranging consultation process, undertaken by the committee, played a vital part in the drafting process. This process enabled numerous groups and individuals with responsibility and an interest in foster care to make their views known. It ensured that the voices of everybody involved in foster care were heard, including the most important group &ndash; the children and young persons themselves.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the committee were to develop national standards on policies, practices and procedures in consultation with key stakeholders of the service which should apply to foster care, in line with the recommendations of the report and focusing in particular on the need to improve the quality and consistency of services for children and young people in foster care, standards and practices related to foster carers and providing guidance to health boards on how they can effectively meet their statutory obligations. The national standards for foster care, therefore, comprise three sections dealing with standards relating to the children and young persons in foster care, the foster carers, and the health boards respectively.</P>
    <P>The national standards aim to ensure that children and young persons in foster care are given the best possible care and are provided with the tools and knowledge to function fully in society as adults. The importance of this is highlighted in the fact that over half of the standards relate to children and young persons in foster care.</P>
    <P>One of the main concerns of children in foster care is that they are anonymous &ndash; that they have no say in their future and that no one listens to their concerns. As the House is aware, giving children a voice is one of the primary goals of the national children's strategy. The standards for foster care aim to address this issue. Indeed, the first standard states, &ldquo;Children and young people are provided with foster care services that promote a positive sense of identity for them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The standards ensure that children and young persons are involved when decisions about their care are being made. Standard 3, concerning children's rights, notes: &ldquo;Children and young people are treated with dignity, their privacy is respected, they make choices based on information provided to them in an age-appropriate manner, and have their views, including complaints, heard when decisions are made which affect them or the care they receive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These standards aim to address the difficulties experienced by those in foster care and to break <Col N="1331" />the cycle of children and young persons becoming &ldquo;lost in the system&rdquo;. To this end, the standards assert that there should be a designated social worker for each child and young person in foster care; an assessment of the child's or young person's needs should be made prior to any placement or, in the case of emergencies, as soon as possible thereafter; and each child and young person in foster care should have a written care plan. The child or young person and his or her family should participate in the preparation of the care plan.</P>
    <P>As well as ensuring that children and young persons in foster care are placed in a safe and positive environment where they are protected from abuse and neglect &ndash; standards 9 and 10 &ndash; the standards ensure that children and young persons in foster care receive the best of care regarding their health and education. The standards state that children in foster care should have their own medical cards and &ldquo;prioritised access to medical, psychiatric, psychological, dental, ophthalmic, therapeutic and other specialist services and treatment when required&rdquo;. The standards also assert that &ldquo;the educational needs of children and young people in foster care are given high priority and they are encouraged to attain their full potential. Education is understood to include the development of social and life skills.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After-care is recognised as being of the utmost importance in foster care as it acts as a stepping-stone between leaving care and entering into the adult world. The standards state that all health boards should have a written policy on after-care provision that outlines all aspects of support and entitlement for those leaving care.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been raised over the care of young persons with a disability who reach the age of 18. The standards aim to address these concerns and note that &ldquo;after-care planning for a young person with a disability involves consultation with the adult disability service in order to provide a seamless transition to that service for the young person on reaching adulthood.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Foster carers play a critically important role in the lives of children and young persons in care by providing a place in their homes at what must be a vulnerable time of the children's lives. The standards acknowledge the importance of foster carers and have developed standards aimed at providing them with support and training. The standards will also act to encourage and retain the services of existing foster carers who are currently undertaking such a valuable task.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been raised recently over the length of waiting periods before assessments of foster carers are carried out. The standards state, &ldquo;The assessment is completed within 16 weeks of their formal application unless more time is required. They are informed of the reasons for any extension and given a new completion date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The standards provide criteria on the provision of supervision and support to foster carers. They note, &ldquo;Approved foster carers are supervised by <Col N="1332" />a professionally qualified social worker. This person known as the link worker, ensures that foster carers have access to the information, advice and professional support necessary to enable them to provide high quality care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Implementation of the standards will enable the foster carers to carry out their role to the best of their ability by ensuring that they receive the necessary training. The standards state, &ldquo;Foster carers' reviews include an appraisal of their training needs and this forms the basis of the training programme for the following year.&rdquo; Foster carers' knowledge of their role is constantly updated and reviewed as their training is ongoing. The implementation of the standards should ensure that foster carers will not feel isolated in their roles as carers. The supports outlined will also encourage the recruitment of much needed new foster carers.</P>
    <P>The standards will ensure that health boards have effective policies and plans in place to promote the provision of high quality foster care for those who require it, and that effective structures are in place for the management and monitoring of these services. They also provide guidelines to health boards on the provision of special foster care for children and young persons with serious behavioural difficulties. They state that in these cases, &ldquo;The child's care plan identifies additional supports required for the placement and the health board ensures that these are provided.&rdquo; It is anticipated that this form of foster care would assist in the care of those children who may require a step-down service from secure or high support placements.</P>
    <P>The standards aim to make the foster care service more accountable and transparent. Copies of the health boards' plans and policies should be available on request to all interested parties and state that in regard to representations and complaints, &ldquo;Health boards have policies and procedures designed to ensure that children and young people, their families, foster carers and others with a bona fide interest in their welfare can make effective representations, including complaints, about any aspect of the fostering service, whether provided directly by a health board or by a non-statutory agency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am confident that these standards will serve to improve the quality and standards of foster care in Ireland. They will ensure that the standards of practice applied in looking after children in care and in supervising and supporting foster carers are of a consistent and high level.</P>
    <P>The Children's Book about Foster Care, which is aimed at younger children in foster care, was launched along with the national standards for foster care. I am glad we have acknowledged the need for children in foster care to understand and know their rights and have a say in matters affecting them. We must not forget that providing these children with information and listening to their views will add greatly to all our understanding of what needs to be done to improve the quality of our foster care services. I hope that we will be in <Col N="1333" />a position to develop similar children's versions in respect of the standards for children's residential care in the near future.</P>
    <P>I recently launched Counting on Foster Care, a study published by the Northern Area Health Board. I was heartened by many of the findings of that study, especially the range of motives of foster carers that encompassed altruism and personal aspirations. I was pleased to see that most carers surveyed found the experience of fostering enjoyable and that any concerns they had prior to fostering had been alleviated. The indications are that there are significant benefits to be derived from the fostering experience, for both the children and foster carer families. This provides us with valuable information for the future recruitment of foster carers, with fostering being promoted as having something to offer not only to the children in care but to the foster family themselves.</P>
    <P>The study also highlighted areas of concern in the foster care service such as the challenges inherent in caring for older children, foster carers' difficulty in gaining access to information and difficulty with agency service provision and delivery. I am confident that the national standards for foster care will go a long way to alleviating these difficulties and do much to improve the quality of the foster care service.</P>
    <P>The Counting on Foster Care study also indicated that in February 2001, up to 40% of foster care placements in the eastern region were with relatives. This is considerably higher than the percentage of relative placement providers in England and Scotland. It is a welcome finding because research has shown consistently positive outcomes for children fostered with relatives. The National Standards for Foster Care Committee paid particular attention to the unique requirements of relative foster carers and the children in their care when drafting the national standards.</P>
    <P>Many more foster carers are required. The health boards undertake local initiatives on an on-going basis to recruit foster carers. In 2002 over 300 new foster carers were recruited nationally. However, more work needs to be done to attract people to the area of foster care. In view of this, the standards emphasise the importance of recruitment strategies. Also highlighted is the importance of health boards responding promptly to fostering enquiries. Health boards are also encouraged, as mentioned previously, to undertake assessments of foster carers within a certain time limit. These measures will go a long way to ensuring that foster care applicants are not lost due to time delays in assessments or failure to respond promptly at the initial querying stage.</P>
    <P>Last March I obtained approval from the Government to begin a wide-ranging consultation on adoption legislation. I have been aware for some time that the existing legislation is out of date and cumbersome and I am delighted to have an opportunity to consult with all interested parties with a view to making significant improve<Col N="1334" />ments. One of the issues in which I am interested is the adoption of children in long-term foster care. At present only a small proportion of these children are adopted. I am keen to ensure that where adoption is the best option for children in long-term foster care, everything possible is done to facilitate their adoption.</P>
    <P>This will be a short and highly focused consultation process, which I intend will be finalised in the summer. A working document, which is being developed by an independent legal expert, will set out a number of issues for consideration and will soon be published. Written submissions will be invited from all interested parties and this will followed by an oral consultation. I hope this will result in workable proposals which I can bring to Government and lead to a new, modern and appropriate legislative framework for adoption focusing on the best interests of all children.</P>
    <P>The report of the working group on foster care states:</P>
    <P>The successful provision of a high quality service for foster children requires a partnership approach on the part of all those involved in the provision of the service. It also requires maintaining and constantly striving to improve the standards in relation to the delivery of services.</P>
    <P>The national standards for foster care will enable us to achieve this goal.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that already this year, the difficulties encountered with the foster care allowance have been resolved and that the national standards for foster care are now being launched. I am conscious, however, that more work remains to be done. Our attention must now become focused on ensuring that these national standards for foster care are met and on implementing fully the other recommendations of the working group's report on foster care.</P>
    <P>I am fully confident that the national standards for foster care will serve as a basis for consistently promoting quality of care in the foster care services. It is against these standards that inspectors will form judgments about the quality the services. They should also provide useful and constructive guidelines for health boards and foster carers alike, as well as a basis for those in foster care and their families to judge the quality of the services they receive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It was reassuring that he visited my county last Tuesday, where he is very popular. He is welcome back to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have come a long way since <i>Oliver Twist</i> and the Dickensian institutions of orphanages and foster care. Growing up as a young boy it was harrowing to see the emotional stress caused to orphaned friends who perhaps did not know they were orphans and were told of their position when they reached the age of 14 or 15 years. At that time foster care, as it is now called, was treated without emotion. In view of this, I wel<Col N="1335" />come the advances that have been made since then, including the national standards for foster care.</P>
    <P>Since the 1980s, parents have been recruited as long-term, short-term or respite fosters, but unfortunately the service today is in a state of crisis, with social workers having to resort to contacting foster parents to see if they have a bed available. It is a manifestation of one of the problems with modern society that people are not willing to foster.</P>
    <P>Matters have been compounded by the lack of funding and I therefore welcome the increase in the pre-August 2001 allowance from &euro;90.85 to &euro;281 per week for a child under 12 years of age and from &euro;108.88 to &euro;388 for a child of 12 years and over. The failure to increase the allowances was a major barrier to recruiting good people to become foster parents. The cost to the State of their absence would be enormous.</P>
    <P>There was a tragic case involving a 14 year old boy who was in residential care run by the Northern Area Health Board for three years because no place could be found for him. He was housed with five other boys ranging in age from six to ten years. They have been at the residential centre for between five months and three and a half years and have all been affected by a shortage of foster care places. Will the Minister of State indicate if there has been any change in harrowing statistics of this kind?</P>
    <P>There is a high turnover of staff and a high reliance on agency staff at some residential centres, which results in a lack of continuity and consistency for children. Furthermore, three quarters of carers are over 40 years of age, more than half of them are engaged in fostering on a long-term basis, four in ten are related to the children being fostered and 16% of all foster families are headed by a single parent. Some families derive great satisfaction from fostering and it is incumbent on us to understand the critical success factors which contribute to this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's emphasis on the need to improve the quality and consistency of services for children and young people in foster care and the standards of practice applicable to foster carers. With regard to the lengthy waiting periods before assessment of foster carers is undertaken, the Minister of State indicated that assessment is completed within 16 weeks of the formal application unless more time is required, at which point a new completion date is set. It has always been a problem that people have had to wait a long time before being given the green light. This initiative will help to alleviate this problem and will make people more aware of foster care.</P>
    <P>I am sure many people would be willing and suitable to engage in foster care, yet the system appears to be shrouded in secrecy. Until I started to research the issue, I would not have known where to look or how to become involved. In the past, were priests or members of religious orders <Col N="1336" />involved in placing children in foster care? Did a group exist which found foster carers? Perhaps an advertising campaign would help recruit more carers. While targeting through the health boards has probably been done, does the Minister of State have any other plans in this regard?</P>
    <P>Some nine residential centres have been found to employ one or more members of staff who had no record of Garda checks, while seven had employed staff on whom Garda clearances were obtained only after taking up employment. Has that problem been resolved? Inspectors said they were impressed with the overall warmth and care shown by staff in the major centres, to whom I pay tribute.</P>
    <P>I welcome the national standards for foster care. Children and young people need something with which they can identify and be familiar. They also need to be placed in schools and with families. The increase in funding available to families is welcome and will be of major benefit in ensuring that they will be able to provide help in this area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. It is only a few short hours since he was last with us and he has returned bright and early this morning.</P>
      <P>When I was researching material for this morning's debate, I looked, as always, to my health board, the North Western Health Board. I was a little surprised to learn the number of those in care. The vast majority of children in care are in foster care as opposed to residential care. When I came to Sligo from Offaly 20 years ago as a much younger woman, I went to Nazareth House on Monday evenings to help children with their home work. It was a huge institution which was full of sad children. I am glad that we have today moved away from residential care to the more emotional and homely setting of foster care. Today in the North Western Health Board there are between 96 and 103 children in care in the Sligo, Leitrim and west Cavan catchment area. In Donegal there are another 106 children in foster care. I am interested to see that children are cared for up to the age of 18 years after which they receive what is termed &ldquo;after care&rdquo;. Nowadays children may not finish their full-time education until they are 24 years and I am glad to see that the Department of Health and Children is funding that aspect of care for foster children. While the funding is adequate, it could be a little better. I realise it is hard to address everything but perhaps the Minister of State could examine the provisions in this regard contained in the Child Care Act 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned Nazareth House. There has been a wonderful turnaround in the services provided but if I was to pick out one organisation for praise, it would be the Irish Foster Care Association which is holding its annual conference in Bundoran which will be attended by in excess of 300 carers and 100 children. These figures are <Col N="1337" />suggestive of the type of programme the association puts together for carers and children alike.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing difficulty in obtaining placements for older children due to the social element associated with teenagers in general. As a mother of four, I am aware of the worry one has from the time teenage children go out on a Saturday night. One does not know what will happen to them before they come home. Many years ago when my children were small and I was running up and down the stairs to get them to sleep at night, my mother told me that I was experiencing the best days of my life with them. I told her that nothing could be more difficult than what I was undergoing but now I would love to have my four teenagers back at three and four years of age at which age one could put them to bed and know where they were.</P>
    <P>I have been hugely impressed by the level of care and the care plans worked out among foster parents, health boards and natural parents. As Senator Feighan said, there is no coldness anymore. Foster children are encouraged to maintain strong links with their natural parents which is very important. They grow up knowing they had to be placed in foster care due to circumstances outside their control and perhaps that of their natural parents.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in finding and retaining social workers who suffer from burn-out in the same way as primary and secondary school teachers. Dealing with children all the time is very demanding which is the reason we should establish and fund more places at third level. I stand to be corrected but my research for this debate indicates that places are available only at UCD, Trinity College and UCC. NUIG is seeking to establish a school and it might be an idea to introduce places at educational institutions like the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland which are medically or health care based. That would help to bring a larger number into the service. The Department of Health and Children has gone to great lengths to bring in social workers from outside the jurisdiction, particularly South Africa. South Africans have been working in the Midland Health Board. Recruitment of this sort is welcome and appreciated.</P>
    <P>The North Western Health Board has told me that its goal is to keep children at home and out of care. We have come a long way in 20 years from the terrible institutions of the past. I use the word &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; with my tongue in my cheek as those institutions were run by good people. While we hear harrowing stories, there were some positive tales which came out of those institutions also. The &ldquo;children first&rdquo; guideline, with which the Minister of State and his predecessor, Deputy Hanafin, are familiar, means that the welfare and protection of children are overseen by multidisciplinary teams. Principal social workers, public health nurses, gardaí, medics and schools all play a role to ensure foster care children do not feel vulnerable or isolated. What is almost a feeling of <Col N="1338" />normality is introduced as every area of the young person's life is catered for.</P>
    <P>There is a strong push to keep families together but it is difficult to keep two, three or possibly five children together. It is a huge burden on a foster family to have to take that number of children in. In my health board area less than one third of families are placed together. Perhaps we could examine this problem as it is very important to try to keep families together. The Minister of State will be well aware of the problems involved in getting families to take difficult children. I am aware of the good work which has been done in this area and ask the Minister of State to keep it up. Perhaps long-term as opposed to short-term stays for children could be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and Senator Feighan both mentioned the trebling of the allowance in August 2001. Those involved at the coalface are delighted with the increase and taking their hats off to the Minister of State. They are also delighted that from April this year the allowance will be directly funded by the Department of Health and Children, which is considered to be a much better system.</P>
    <P>We must look continually at special needs children and funding for them. It is much easier to care for a three year old than it is to look after a teenager. When I was researching my contribution to this debate, I was made aware that a high support unit was opened recently in Castleblaney. It is a sign of the commitment of the Government, the Minister of State and the Department of Health and Children to fostering. The unit caters for three health board areas. I am glad that three beds in the unit are available to my local health board when needed. The high support offered is highly funded and made available to young people with challenging behaviours. All of their educational supports etc. are available on site. This is certainly new in our area in the north-west and the Minister of State would be more familiar with it in Dublin and further south.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should bear in mind the issues of recruiting social workers, maintaining them and giving them the supports they need to carry out their duties. I was delighted to hear him say this morning that there is a need for many more carers and that, in 2002, we had 300 new foster carers. I do not have any experience in foster care or in fostering children but it must be the most wonderful and rewarding thing to do. To somebody like me, looking in from the outside, it is clear that people who take in foster children open up their hearts and their homes to those children and share their lives with them. The children are unfortunate and vulnerable and the foster parents have a very positive impact on their young lives.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Feighan, I welcome the national standards for foster care. I ask the Minister of State to keep his eye on the ball and continue to fund this very necessary and important area. I know this will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and his new booklet, National Standards for Foster Care. A great deal of work has obviously gone into compiling it and it looks on the child as an individual and tries to tailor the care of each child to his or her needs. Let us hope that we can live up to all that is in the booklet. I am quite sure that the Minister of State is determined to do so but, like Senator Feighan, I am very concerned about the shortage of social workers in this area and appreciate that it is a stressful occupation and that many involved in it leave after some years. We are not producing enough social workers in the universities and perhaps the Minister of State will talk to his colleagues in the Department of Education and Science to see if some of the relevant courses could be expanded.</P>
      <P>Foster families, as is said in the booklet, are either related or unrelated to the child and there are very many reasons why children end up in the care of the State and in foster care. Sometimes it is only for a short term because of illness in the family but in other cases, due to the breakdown of the family or the death of one or both parents, the children involved may be in foster care for a very long time. It is so important that we try to make sure that the individual needs of that child are looked after. Also, it is good to see so much emphasis being placed on what occurs when the child leaves foster care because we know of too many sad stories of children in residential units who were put outside the door on their 15th or 16th birthdays or whenever they reached the relevant age limit. They had very tough lives from then on.</P>
      <P>The booklet is a blueprint and let us all hope that we live up to what is in it. I compliment the Minister of State on the booklet he produced for children. I had a chance to look at it and thought it was very readable and a very good idea. I am quite sure I can see young ones standing with it in hand citing it to whoever is standing before them, telling them what they are supposed to do. It is a good idea because it gives children a sense not just of their rights but also of their responsibilities. This is no harm because they will know what is expected of them. I was glad to see that sort of thing spelt out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a big improvement in terms of increasing the number of children taken in by families. That is the most desirable option, rather than placing them in residential units. However, we still have a considerable number of children in residential units and many of them are there for years. I expressed concern during the passage of the Child Care Bill regarding the fact that these units do not have to be inspected on a regular basis. If one looks at the Act, one will see that where children have to be put in a residential unit because they run into trouble with the law, the unit has to be inspected every six months. If they are placed in a unit through no fault of their own, the unit need only be inspected periodically. One of the reasons for not having the units <Col N="1340" />inspected every six months, which was given to me by the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, is the shortage of inspectors. This could lead to residential units being inspected very rarely.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get staff. We know that there are frequent problems regarding the quality of staff in units but when one cannot get anyone to work in them it must be extremely tempting to get whoever one can to help. It takes an enormous number of people to run these units and I hope the issue of inspecting them is examined very carefully.</P>
    <P>I have been very interested in talking to people who work in residential units about how determined they are to try get children into the care of families. As they say to me repeatedly, children in residential care can breed problems between them. For example, it is all too easy for a child in a unit who has been abusing alcohol to encourage other children within the unit to get up to the same tricks as himself. When the child is dealing with perhaps 12 people per week in charge of him, it is much easier to bend things around than if he is in a domestic setting where there is a couple of parents to whom he has to report. They have a much better idea of what the child is doing.</P>
    <P>Everyone has praised the fact that remuneration for families was increased. The circumstances that obtained previously really were ridiculous and people who took in foster children must have been at a considerable loss. It is much more realistic now, but still must cost a great deal less than having children in residential care.</P>
    <P>There is still a huge shortage of families for children. The problem is to try to get social workers to run courses to train such families and give them backup when they are fostering. One finds that families do need backup, especially in circumstances where, perhaps, a difficult child is taken in. Bad experiences with one child might lead to people being discouraged from taking another.</P>
    <P>I gather that short-term fostering of very young children is not that great a problem but that there is still considerable work to be done in the area of getting places for older children. It is wrong for the State to put children into hospitals when they come into its care, be it on a short-term or long-term basis. For example, the Romanian child, who it was thought was brought into this country for an arranged marriage at about 12 years of age, was put in Crumlin hospital. She left it one morning and I do not know where she is now. It was not a suitable place to put a child.</P>
    <P>I know of children who have been in other children's hospitals because of violence, but they were not victims of violence themselves. They were, quite correctly, taken out of the family home but ended up in acute beds in one of our children's hospitals for up to two years. That is not right and must be avoided at all costs. I remember one child in particular who was trying to make approaches to anyone who came into the <Col N="1341" />ward by running forward to seek affection and establish some sort of relationship. The child was brought in as an infant and was, by this stage, about two or two and a half. This must be guarded against very much.</P>
    <P>The establishment of day care units in some residential establishments has also been good. Perhaps the children could partially be kept within the care of the family if there was support available during the day. I know efforts have been made to promote this sort of support because intervention to prevent us having to take children into the care of the State is also extremely important. I get letters and phone calls repeatedly from parents and people who are trying to deal with children with difficulties who say that the children might not have come into the care of the State if intervention had been earlier. If they get into trouble with the law, we hear about them in the courts. There are many, however, who have not yet got into trouble with the law. It is about these children that neighbours ask what must be done before somebody makes an intervention on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about and written to the Department of Health and Children repeatedly about the situation regarding child and adolescent psychiatric services in this country. I thank the Minister of State for the fact that I received the report that was written approximately two years ago and about which nothing has happened in terms of improving the child and adolescent psychiatric services. There are ten beds in the entire country for children and adolescents who are suffer from psychiatric illnesses, four in the eastern region and six in Galway. People, including psychiatrists, repeatedly contact with me about this matter. The situation must be very bad if they are obliged to contact me.</P>
    <P>These children then run into serious trouble and must be taken into the care of the State and the facilities we have to deal with them are inadequate. I have a three-page letter on my desk that I could show the Minister of State in which the words &ldquo;where is early intervention&rdquo; were used by a mother about half a dozen times. Nothing has yet been done for this.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Government is bringing forward the adoption legislation. As the Minister of State knows, I have been interested in this for quite some time. It is good to see developments being made in that regard.</P>
    <P>One other thing I would like to mention to the Minister of State is the fact that we have brought forward the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. I am the president of Cherish, which gives support and help to young women, or indeed any lone parent, who feels able to parent on their own. For a long period, however, adopting has not seemed an accessible alternative. I also chair an <i>ad hoc</i> committee within the Oireachtas of people who are interested in reproductive health. There are Members of all parties involved. We try to encourage UNICEF in the work it does abroad <Col N="1342" />but we have also been looking at the area of crisis pregnancies in this country.</P>
    <P>Ms Catherine Heaney of the Irish Family Planning Association told me about an open adoption agency in Chicago called the Cradle. It was established over 80 years ago but has only promoted more open adoption in recent years. Deputy Seán Power, when he visited Chicago, kindly went to look at the organisation for me. This is an area into which we really should put some time and thought because it makes the situation after the child has been born much more fluid than is often possible here. The Cradle organisation has a small institution where the mother can live with the child or the child can be cared for by a family. The child is not actually in the care of the state but still in the care of the mother, and somebody else just minds the child for her until she tries to decide what is the best thing she should do about her child.</P>
    <P>This is done in a much more open way than we are used to, but it is going to be introduced here because I have talked to the vice-chairman of the Adoption Board about it. A more open adoption situation emerges and the birth mother meets the parents to discuss the situation. It may be decided that adoption is the right option to proceed with. It is not envisaged, however, that the birth mother would lose total contact with her child; it is envisaged that she would have whatever contact is settled upon between her and the adoptive parents. This is the sort of initiative we should try to encourage here. Perhaps some short-term fostering parents would consider this because many of these sort of parents are extremely experienced people and might be a very good middle ground for such discussions to take place.</P>
    <P>I was also interested to hear the Minister of State say that he will look at and try to encourage adoption by long-term foster parents. That is very important, but will there be different standards for foster parents and adoptive parents? This is a difficult issue because age is a big factor with birth mothers, in particular, who may perhaps like to see their child going to a young couple. However, they must know that many people do not discover that they cannot have children until they are well into their 30s. An older child, in particular, might fit in quite well with older parents, so there is a lot be discussed in this regard.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister of State say that legislation will be introduced at the end of the summer. Having met some of those people who were adopted as children, I am aware of the urgency of their situation because they see themselves and their birth parents getting older and the possibility of meeting them receding. It is most important that some sense of urgency is brought to this situation. This legislation can come before the Houses of the Oireachtas and we can trash it out, line by line. Things do not have to be kept in the Department forever. As the Minister of State knows, the Seanad is a very sympathetic and receptive place in which to introduce legislation that perhaps needs less party pol<Col N="1343" />itical discussion. He has received nothing but encouragement this morning for what he is doing.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his initiative and look forward to seeing what happens with the legislation he intends to introduce. I hope he will consider the points I have made regarding a more open situation for a young women who has just had a child, a situation in which the child is not going to be in legal limbo and in which we now look at adoption in a different way and realise that contributions can be made from far more quarters than one thinks to the welfare of the child.</P>
    <P>I again congratulate all who were involved in bringing forward these standards. Let us ensure now that they are not just pious hopes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I welcome the publication of the national standards for foster care. It is interesting to note that, until the publication of this booklet, there were absolutely no proper standards for foster care. We have to say that this is a disgrace when one considers that foster care is a service that affects over 4,000 children. While we warmly congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies Brian Lenihan and Mary Hanafin, for their role in bringing forward the rights of children in foster care and indeed the service providers &ndash; the foster parents &ndash; we have to say that it is never too late to do the right thing.</P>
      <P>The ideal situation is that a child should be able to live in his or her own home in the care of loving parents. Nevertheless, it has to be admitted that, regrettably, this is often not the case. Whether it has to do with an alcohol or drug problem or just incompatibility within a marriage, very often the falls guys or fall girls are the children. That is very regrettable.</P>
      <P>It is very important to ensure that children in that situation will get a second chance, as it were, and that is why foster parents play a pivotal role in the context of a providing an important service to these children.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry and others who have more or less given the thumbs down to child care facilities in an institutional setting. That is the last option I would go choose. There are many sound reasons as to why one would adopt that particular thinking. When one considers that a child is the most vulnerable member of society, it is axiomatic that they should have the opportunity of benefiting from a situation corresponding to the most normal sense of everyday living that would pertain to other children in other settings. That is why foster parents have such a pivotal role to play in this area of child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As chairman of the Midlands Health Board in 2001, I had the honour of being asked by the Irish <Col N="1344" />Foster Care Parents Association to launch their conference in Tullamore. It was an eye-opener to speak to many of those in attendance.</P>
    <P>Previously in this House, I have referred to the difficulty of recruiting social workers. As everybody knows, social workers play a central role in foster care in terms of establishing the suitability of foster parents. The issue of recruiting social workers was brought to my attention in a very forceful way on that occasion. My health board had to go to South Africa to recruit social workers. Perhaps the Minister of State and the Department should advise career guidance teachers to encourage students to take up social work, which is an important area. Whether in the context of foster parenting or adoption, social workers play a pivotal role.</P>
    <P>Having taken a keen interest in the areas of fostering and adoption, ultimately adoption has to be the best option for which one could hope. Where the long-term possibility of children returning to their natural parents is not a realisable option, adoption has to be the preferred option and I would encourage it in so far as it can be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to what has been done in regard to allowances for this important service. This is <i>de facto </i>a recognition by the Minister of State and his Department of the service these people provide. As has been said in other fora and by many famous people through the years, the labourer is worthy of his hire. Rearing children is not a cheap option; it is an expensive and important part of everyday life. We are talking about the children who will be the adults of tomorrow and the leaders and pillars of society.</P>
    <P>I refer to the situation pertaining to care centres. There are children in care who exhibit difficult and challenging behaviour. They have to be looked after in a care setting. Rath na nÓg House in Castleblayney is one such location and it provides services for my health board, the Midland Health Board. Where possible, those centres should only be used for respite services. In the main, we must endeavour at all times to provide a home setting for children who come from difficult or broken homes.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the scheme. Under the revised scheme, the provisions of the orphan's allowance or pension were extended to all children in full-time foster care to ensure all our foster children are treated fairly and equitably.</P>
    <P>A committee was established in 2001 to develop national standards for foster care and it was the Government's aim to ensure that it would represent all the interests involved in foster care. One of the most important groups to be consulted was young people in foster care. Nobody is better placed to give chapter and verse about a service than a recipient of it. The Minister of State ensured that the optimum amount of information was gleaned from the consultations with the groups concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" />Children in care must be shown love and understanding which is what any home hopes to give to them. Foster homes provide a second chance for young children to make it in life &ndash; they provide them with a chance to see the other side.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the difficulties in regard to care centres. We would like to consign those difficulties to the history books but one important thing about history is that if one learns from its mistakes, one will never repeat them. That is why this book is so important. For the first time, it sets out the standards and the parameters for foster parents and for carees. I compliment the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Much that I would have liked to say has already been said and there is no point in repeating it. I welcome this report and look forward to its implementation. At long last, we have a bible outlining the performance we can expect from foster parents, who provide such an important service to the most vulnerable sector of society, our children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate. I welcome the fact that the Seanad has had a discussion on the subject of fostering because it is important.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan made a good point that there is still an air of mystery about this subject among the public and that people do not appreciate how important fostering has become in our child care system. Before the enactment of Child Care Act, it was on an informal footing. When children are taken into care, the ideal solution is to find a fostering placement. This has become important in our child care system. As Senator Glynn pointed out, it is remarkable that it has taken until now for us to formulate the bible of standards to which he referred. It is tremendous that we now have it at hand.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan drew attention to the fact there was formerly an unwillingness to foster but that the financial incentives are far greater now and they have created a much better environment in which people look at the options of fostering. It is important to stress that in addition to the financial incentives which have been fully agreed upon following the enactment of this year's Social Welfare Act, which provided for a unified payment and has deemed children who are orphans not to be orphans when in a fostering placement, there are important altruistic incentives which were highlighted in the recent study by the Northern Area Health Board. Those who foster children enjoy fostering and derive positive benefit from doing so. It is important to stress this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Senators, including Senators Henry and Glynn, mentioned adoption. Many Irish couples seek to adopt and find it extremely difficult to locate a child for adoption. In the majority of cases, a child must be found in another juris<Col N="1346" />diction. One faces an international complication, the movement of a child from one jurisdiction to another and an assessment procedure, which is required under our adoption legislation. One often hears heartbreaking stories and accounts of what happens in other countries in the pursuit of a child, yet in Ireland a great number of children are available for fostering. In our history, fostering was the preferred method of caring for children under the old Brehon Law. It is not something which is new to Ireland. That is one of the reasons I raised the question, which Senator Henry mentioned, in the adoption review of looking at the position of long-term foster care and whether it can lead on to adoption in certain circumstances. I am not prescribing it but it is an issue at which we have to look.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan also mentioned the need to shift from residential to foster placements. I agree with him. As the Senator is aware, foster care placements may not always meet the specific needs of a child, so there must be a broad spectrum of services from family support services to foster care placement to residential placements to youth advocacy programmes where there is a mentor-based approach in the community.</P>
    <P>There are a wide range of options in the health board system when children are at risk. Information from seven of the ten health boards indicates that 39 children in residential care were awaiting foster care placements at the end of 2002. The health boards are trying to provide placements for them. It is very important that we do so. One of the great developments has been the establishment of the social services inspectorate because it looks around the various residential centres and notes where there should be fostering rather than residential placements. In my work with the chief executives of the health boards I constantly remind them of the need to audit their residential placements and see whether fostering can provide an adequate alternative in any of those cases. Health boards, like other institutions, tend to build their own critical mass, and it is very important that one evaluates and audits that mass.</P>
    <P>Senator Feeney referred to the North Western Health Board, which is unusual in having very few residential placements, something the Senator noted. However, that is not the position in all the health boards. One of the difficulties with residential care is that, where a child remains in such care for a long time in his or her younger years, it becomes very difficult to foster him or her in the teenage years. I agree with Senator Feighan. I have constantly reiterated to the health boards the need to shift towards foster placements away from residential care. The Senator also raised the question of delays in assessments. I hope the standards, which have set a specific time specification of 16 weeks, will improve matters. There have recently been improvements in the recruitment of social workers, which we hope <Col N="1347" />will improve the rate of assessments and reduce the length of delays.</P>
    <P>There was also the question of inspection of residential centres, an issue also raised by Senator Henry. The social services inspectorate is up and running and has produced its second annual report. I am very glad to read in that report, which was launched on the same date as the standards, that it is satisfied that there have been real improvements in residential homes resulting from the inspection process.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Feighan on the importance of focusing on the recruitment of foster carers. The working group's report on foster care and standards called for the development of recruitment strategies to ensure a speedy response to queries. In 2002 over 300 new foster carers were recruited through local initiatives, and I hope that, with the implementation of the standards in health boards, there will be far more of what the Senator was talking about in terms of advertising positively for fostering and encouraging it through local initiatives. These can also often take place with the Irish Foster Care Association, which, as many Senators pointed out, does a great deal of good work in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Feeney mentioned the importance of maintaining links with natural parents. It is an important point that one of the great advantages of fostering is that it is an open arrangement without a rigid closure of identification between the child and the natural parent. The Senator mentioned the North Western Health Board. As I said, compared to other boards, in the North Western Health Board area a very high proportion of children are in foster care compared with residential care, and it is important that we work on this in other health board areas. The Senator also referred to siblings. The standards emphasise and highlight the importance of keeping them together.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about the shortage of social workers. The Minister for Health and Children is aware that the number of social workers being trained has increased. While I do not have any figures to hand, I know that the Department is very concerned about the problem, something also referred to by Senator Glynn, who has taken up the issue before. There has been an increase in numbers in training. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area there has been an increase in the numbers allocated. Senator Henry also raised the matter of children's hospitals. There were inappropriate social placements in the past but a directive has now been issued to the Eastern Regional Health Authority to stop this, and we have received assurances from it that measures are being taken to avoid such occurrences. I agree with Senators that it is most undesirable that it should happen.</P>
    <P>Child and adolescent psychiatric services are a cause close to my heart, and we really must <Col N="1348" />develop them. I have raised the matter with the Minister for Health and Children. I had to intervene earlier this year to keep one unit open which had been faced with closure, something which seemed ridiculous given our small national provision.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to adoption. While I do not want to pre-empt what will emerge from the consultation, the question of open adoption is already with us in the sense that the Adoption Board now often makes orders subject to conditions which preserve a degree of contact between the birth mother, the adopted child and the adoptive family. This is one of the issues which will have to be looked at in the consultation process. I hope Senator Henry and Deputy Power, whom she mentioned, will make a submission to the review in order that whatever legislative framework we put in place will be adequate to allow for such experiments. It is important that we look at different ways of encouraging mothers to bond with their children and address the problems that confront them in a crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also stressed the need to have residential units inspected, on which there has been a lot of progress. We have no immediate plans to put the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis but I am very happy with the extent to which it is conducting regular, periodic inspections of the various institutions. It is very important work because it sets standards in them.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn returned to the subject of social workers. I know that he is most anxious that we work on this issue. I agree with him that residential settings should be the last option. That is certainly my philosophy, which I have communicated to the health boards very strongly. He said adoption could be the best possible option. I am not entirely sure about this, though he raises a very interesting point. We must also stress the importance of fostering. As I said, there are many seeking to adopt who cannot find children, yet there is a huge pool of Irish children who wish to be fostered. The debate is very welcome, allowing us to promote fostering as a positive parenting option.</P>
    <P>It is also important that we look at the issues surrounding long-term fostering raised by Senator Henry. If we at least moved towards providing for adoption as an option, it might encourage more into fostering. Adopting a child of a marriage requires an application to the High Court under 1988 legislation and is very cumbersome and expensive. We must examine the issue in the consultation process to see how we can make matters easier in such circumstances for those who require adoption where it is in the best interests of the child concerned.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and the interest they have shown in this subject. I will bring the question of the provision of social workers to the attention of the Minister for <Col N="1349" />Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Seanad for this opportunity to report on the latest developments in the peace process. Members on all sides of the House have always expressed their overwhelming support for the Good Friday Agreement. I share the sense of regret and frustration that we have so far not succeeded in achieving the definitive progress that is essential to underpin the Agreement and assure the stability of the political institutions in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement was negotiated by representatives of all traditions on this island &ndash; Nationalist, republican, Unionist and loyalist. The Agreement truly belongs to all people and all traditions on this island. The pro-Agreement parties and both Governments have a fundamental obligation to uphold the will of the people and secure the Agreement. We all have a collective responsibility to make the Agreement work. This is not a policy option; it is the will of the people of both parts of the island, democratically endorsed in the 1998 referendum. I assure Members that this is what the Government has been seeking to do in recent months. I assure them further that this effort, despite the current setback, will continue.</P>
      <P>Following the suspension of devolved Government last October, Prime Minister Blair and the Taoiseach expressed their commitment to the full implementation of the Agreement. At that time, however, it was clear that devolved Government could not be made to work effectively in circumstances where there had been a breakdown of trust between those involved. We simply could not go on as we had done in the past. There was an obvious need to move forward decisively and bring completeness to all the outstanding issues if we were to guarantee the future. The issues can be distilled down to two points, namely, the necessity to remove concerns around the commitment to exclusively democratic and non-violent means and the need for each community to have confidence in the commitment of the representatives of the other to the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past six months, the two Governments and the parties made enormous progress in our effort to reach a solution. Throughout this period, the two Governments worked in partnership, and with the parties, to try and drive the process forward and to ensure finality and clarity in our work. However, on Thursday last, we had to acknowledge that this phase of our efforts <Col N="1350" />could not be brought to a conclusion at this time. Prime Minister Blair subsequently announced that he had made a decision to postpone the Northern Ireland Assembly elections that had been rescheduled for 29 May. The Taoiseach has stated clearly that the Government disagrees with the British Government on the postponement of these elections. He reiterated this view, which I know is shared by the vast majority of Members of the House, on this matter on several occasions directly to the British Prime Minister. Yet another postponement of the elections causes more problems for the process than it solves.</P>
    <P>While we do not agree with or endorse this step, the closest of partnerships between the two Governments is essential to achieving continuing progress in Northern Ireland. That partnership remains strong and will continue. It is of enormous value as we work to overcome the current difficulties. The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach met at Farmleigh on Tuesday and restated their commitment to the shared objective of completing the full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>The deficit of trust between the parties remains the crux issue. The two Governments will, in the coming weeks, focus their efforts and those of the pro-Agreement parties on remedying that deficit. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will meet shortly, and with the parties in the near future, to try and advance matters.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration and associated documents, published last week, indicate clearly the work that the Governments have been engaged in for the past six months. The Taoiseach has had a copy laid before the House. The declaration contains many elements which are not conditional upon action by others, for example in the areas of policing, criminal justice, equality, human rights and some aspects of demilitarisation.</P>
    <P>These will now be taken forward as part of the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to which both Governments remain fully committed. Progress will be reviewed, where appropriate, within the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The Joint Declaration is a document of considerable content and substance. It genuinely sought to bring completeness to a considerable range of issues, including effective demilitarisation of Northern Ireland by April 2005 as well as a resolution of the &ldquo;on-the-run&rdquo; issue.</P>
    <P>I regret that we did not manage to release the Joint Declaration in the context that was intended and understood by all the parties. Vitally, this would have included &ndash; from the very beginning of the negotiations last November it was understood by those concerned that it would have to include &ndash; a response from the IRA that there would be a definitive and unambiguous ending of all paramilitary activity. While the focus <Col N="1351" />has been on the IRA, it was always clear that what we want is an end to both republican and loyalist paramilitary activity. The negotiations throughout the six months from last November proceeded on this basis and with that clear understanding. The necessity for such clarity was as essential at the conclusion of the negotiations as it was when we embarked on this project.</P>
    <P>We were told that the IRA statement received by both Governments on 13 April, and which has now been published, was definitive and would not be further amended or elaborated upon by the IRA. We welcomed the statement at the time and said that it contained many positive aspects. We also said that it showed obvious progress and a clear desire to make the peace process work. However, as will be obvious from a reading of this statement, there are several fundamental aspects in vital areas that both Governments felt had to be clarified in the context of the completeness that we were seeking to achieve. The statement was not clear and unambiguous as has been asserted. If it was, we would have been more than happy to embrace it and move on. However, it was not and so we had to embark on a protracted process of clarification. We did this in a genuine attempt to advance matters.</P>
    <P>Specifically, we needed clarity regarding the circumstances in which the IRA would bring about the complete and final closure of the conflict. For example, was this in the context of a united Ireland or in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and other commitments? This is an important distinction which was not at all clear from the IRA statement. We also needed clarity as to whether it was the IRA's intention to put all arms beyond use. We needed further clarity that IRA activities of the type referred to in the Joint Declaration were at an end.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach indicated to the Dáil last November, these activities include military attacks, training, targeting, intelligence-gathering, acquisitions and development of arms and weapons, other preparations for terrorist campaigns, punishment beatings and attacks, and involvement in riots. Moreover, the practice of exiling had to come to an end and exiled individuals had to be free to return in safety. These were basic questions to which we needed clear-cut answers that everybody could understand.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately a great deal of time elapsed while the process of clarification was under way. Elections were also getting closer. Overall, the environment in which clarifications were being sought, and eventually being given, was deteriorating. I assure the House that we applied every effort to try to achieve a satisfactory solution. This involved our sustained and undiluted attention. It also involved a huge commitment by the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and their officials, and also by the Taoiseach and the Mini<Col N="1352" />sters for Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and their officials, who were actively and constructively involved at all stages in this effort.</P>
    <P>At every point we sought to support, encourage and bring satisfactory closure to this initiative. If the Taoiseach had thought for one moment that we had achieved the clarity essential for our purpose, he would have said so. So too, would the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. The two Governments are deeply committed to this project. We wanted this initiative to work. We wanted a successful outcome. We wanted a major act of IRA weapons decommissioning, which was in prospect. However, we knew also that, even though we were very close to success, we could not pretend that we were satisfied when we were not.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that obtaining essential clarifications to basic questions was so protracted and that clarity on alleged IRA activities, an issue of such fundamental importance to confidence and trust and on which everything ultimately rested was not forthcoming. I remind the Seanad that it was precisely the issue of alleged IRA activities that undermined and eventually brought down the Executive last October. It is not a case of being unrealistic in our expectations and needs. Such alleged IRA activities were the crux of the issue last October. Seven months later they remain central to the problem.</P>
    <P>The various statements by Gerry Adams were helpful and brought matters to a new level of clarity in respect of two vital aspects: first, the ending of the conflict; and, second, the decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons. This has been acknowledged by both Governments. However, it did not prove possible to have sufficient clarity to convince everyone that paramilitary activity, the third issue, was definitively at an end. This is an issue that must be resolved in a satisfactory way and in a manner that everybody can understand.</P>
    <P>If the significance of Gerry Adams's clarifications were obvious and clear to many, they were not so clear to many others, including to Unionists, who must be persuaded if we are to make progress together. Convincing the two Governments is the first imperative but convincing and assuring moderate and reasonable Unionists is clearly also essential. Without the support of moderate and reasonable Unionists, it is difficult to imagine how we are going to re-establish the devolved institutions and allow the Good Friday Agreement to reach its full potential.</P>
    <P>At the same time, Unionists need to assure Nationalists that they are fully committed to the full operation of the Agreement, particularly in terms of the sustained operation of all of the institutions. If the clarity required of the republican movement is forthcoming, it also needs to be clear that the phase of the stop-start operation of the Agreement has come to an end, that Union<Col N="1353" />ists will fully and comprehensively engage in all the interlocking institutions of the Agreement, including the North-South Ministerial Council, and that they will accord full respect and legitimacy to the democratic mandates of their partners in government.</P>
    <P>It is important that the dialogue on these issues, which had been ongoing, is brought to a point where any doubts that exist in this regard are dispelled. The Government welcomed the publication on Tuesday last of the IRA statement of 13 April as well as a further statement on the matter. It is helpful that this latter statement confirms that Gerry Adams's answers accurately reflect the IRA's position. The problem, however, is that Mr. Adams's answer to one of the questions was unclear, which means that this latest statement does not take the issue of IRA activities any further than Gerry Adams has done. This, therefore, remains an issue to be satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that the endorsement by the IRA of Gerry Adams's clarifications was not forthcoming at any stage during the period of 14 April to 1 May when these clarifications were being sought. Indeed, it was made clear to us that there was no question of asking or expecting the IRA to do anything or say anything of the sort. Its statement of 13 April was supposed to have said it all. An IRA endorsement would have been helpful, though I cannot say decisive, had it come earlier. It is important, however, not to now minimise its significance and potential.</P>
    <P>We embarked on this task knowing that it was going to be difficult and that it might prove protracted. In the frustration and disappointment of recent days there is a natural tendency for recrimination. I will not engage in any such recrimination. Yes, there is disappointment, but we have to move on. The work that we have done in recent months will have lasting value and purpose. The gains we have made &ndash; there have been gains &ndash; must not be lost.</P>
    <P>The Government also deeply appreciates the assistance of President Bush and his Administration, particularly Ambassador Richard Haass who has worked closely with us in recent months. The successful negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement was the first time in modern Irish history where, working together, the different traditions on this island managed to agree a fair and balanced accommodation worthy of everyone's support.</P>
    <P>As the two Governments reiterated yesterday, the Agreement is our template for future relations on this island; it will not be renegotiated. We know that politics in Northern Ireland can work. Despite people's frustrations with politics and the political process &ndash; I spent some time at the weekend on the streets of Armagh, took some soundings from people there and I fully concur with their sentiments &ndash; there is no alternative.</P>
    <P>We have achieved more than most people ever <Col N="1354" />imagined we would. The outstanding issues have now crystallised as follows: how can we ensure that the IRA will cease all paramilitary activity and how can we restore the institutions permanently?</P>
    <P>As we have done on many occasions since this process began, we will work with determination to resolve these difficulties. In the meantime, we expect all parties and groups to do their utmost to ensure a peaceful environment, particularly in the course of the forthcoming marching season. In itself, this would be a major contribution to achieving a restored climate of trust and confidence on which we can build. We urge everyone, from all communities, to continue to constructively focus on the visions and ideals of the peace process and on the attainment of the key objectives of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    <P>This process, in which we have been engaged for many years, is at the centre of the Government's political priorities. We have had our ups and downs. Last week was a temporary setback. However, rather than slacken the pace at this time, we now need to pick it up and finish the job. The Government is completely dedicated to doing just that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and thank him for his excellent contribution. He has put a very important statement on the record this afternoon. In terms of outlining the background to the situation that has developed in recent weeks and highlighting, in succinct terms, the efforts of the Irish and British Governments &ndash; who worked together in seeking additional clarification from 13 April to 1 May concerning the statement they first received from the IRA &ndash; what the Minister said is extremely important and I certainly welcome it. The Government has the support of Members on this side of the House in its ongoing efforts to break the impasse that has clearly been reached in the Northern Ireland peace process. Both Governments will continue to have our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is most important is that, despite the difficulties and lack of success at this point, one thing that has shown itself to be robust and strong <Col N="1355" />enough to ride out all the difficulties is the Anglo-Irish process. That is absolutely central. Whatever moves have to be taken between now and autumn to restart this process must be taken jointly, by both Governments acting together. That is the most important driver in the new relationship that exists between Britain and Ireland since 1986, when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was negotiated. That is the important aspect that I encourage the Government to facilitate it, as I know it will, as we move forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he visited Armagh at the weekend. I spent the last bank holiday weekend in Portrush and Coleraine getting, I suspect, a different perspective, given the terrain and the geography of north Antrim. There was a deep frustration among Unionists who occupy the middle ground and who want to see this process work. This frustration was caused by the fact that they were given a commitment by the Prime Minister of Britain, Mr. Tony Blair, in 1998 that the process would deliver on the issue of decommissioning and that it would also deliver a situation were the IRA would ultimately go away.</P>
    <P>We all know the commitment we entered into in the Good Friday Agreement and the Weston Park talks and that remains. We do not have to read between the lines of the Minister's statement. It is absolutely clear that the Irish and British Governments are frustrated, as are the people of Northern Ireland who want to see this process work, when they see a paramilitary outfit, elected by no one, still holding the process to ransom.</P>
    <P>I accept and welcome that the IRA has moved fundamentally on its position but when we voted for the Agreement, we all accepted that it would be no more. The Minister has made it quite clear that we need clarity from it concerning its activities, which invoke huge authority and power. It wants power in its communities to, in a sense, act as a republican police force. That cannot happen in the new Ireland and it has to understand this. We all know its past. I said recently that it was a very ugly past. It has no future in Ireland because what it offers is a repudiation of everything for which the Good Friday Agreement stands. I was very happy that the Minister expressed those sentiments in such clear and unambiguous terms.</P>
    <P>There was also frustration about David Trimble among the people I met. They felt he was not working the Agreement as he should. Many middle ground Unionists want the Agreement to work and are frustrated at the lack of leadership he has shown to his party at times. I concur with this. That balance has to be struck in all our remarks. Mr. Trimble has to lead his party in selling the benefits of the Agreement to Unionists as well as Nationalists. He has shown great courage in sitting down with Sinn Féin in government, something we will not do, on all sides. However, he has to sell the tangible benefits of the Agreement to his community, namely, that Articles 2 <Col N="1356" />and 3 of the Constitution have been diluted to such an extent that they express the principle of consent which is at the heart of the Agreement; that devolution had been restored to Northern Ireland; that he is the only Unionist leader who ever managed to get concessions from republicans, particularly the IRA, in terms of decommissioning, albeit two small acts. He has to sell this message in the same way that we, as democrats, in this assembly have to say clearly to Sinn Féin and the IRA that the IRA's days are numbered.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the elections. It was a very difficult call for the Government to make because the problem with advancing to the election stage was that the outcome was not guaranteed. In effect, people would not have been elected to an assembly because if the composition had been more difficult in terms of the extreme Unionist and Nationalist sides, it would have been virtually impossible to make a deal stick. The number of months we now have to make one final push at this effort, ultimately leading to an election, could give us the breathing space we need because I do not believe, were an election to be held at the end of this month, it would help the situation. I fully understand what the Government has said in this regard but there was no way out, the election had to be postponed because there was nothing to which people could be elected.</P>
    <P>The recent reports from the Stevens inquiry have been shocking but at least we know what has happened. Will prosecutions come from the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland of those individuals involved? For instance, we do not know this about many republican atrocities, or about many of those let out of prisons in Northern Ireland. We are all trying to come out of a very difficult situation where shocking things were done in our name and the names of loyalism and many groups on this island, from which we have to break forever. The way forward is to back the Government's efforts to support the process and go into the autumn trying to get it back on the road and the Assembly working again, while also delivering on the many other aspects of the Agreement that have yet to be delivered. As long as the Government continues to do this, it will have the support of my party.</P>

      <P>Contributions are not to exceed seven minutes. We agreed to this. I thank Members for agreeing to this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much welcome the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. There is no doubt that he has vast experience of this issue, living as he does <Col N="1357" />so close to the Border and having been acquainted directly with much of what has been happening in Northern Ireland over many years. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, will be present at 2.30 p.m. and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, at 3 p.m. I thank the Minister for coming and all the Members coming in to speak. There are many more whom I know our Whip was keen to bring into the discussion also.</P>
    <P>I very much agree with what has been said about the speech which the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has delivered. It was straightforward, to the point and painfully honest. In a situation such as this that kind of honesty is greatly to be recommended. There is no doubt that in the last two or three weeks we have all grown up to the fact that there is not going to be a fairy tale ending to this story. I do not suppose that any of us every really thought there would be but when people came home with the Good Friday Agreement and there was the euphoric vote, North and South, everybody was determined to make it work, to enhance life, work together and walk into the wonderful sunset that we saw on the horizon. In our heart of hearts, however, we knew that was not the way life worked out. It never does but we were determined to put might and main into making it work. That goes for all parties because it did evoke a very generous response across the political spectrum.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there has been quite an enormous set-back recently because the process went so near to the brink. The Taoiseach has briefed the Opposition parties very thoroughly on the matter but even without being intimately involved we all knew what was happening. I met people last weekend in my own town who would not be particularly political but they knew this was coming, that it was very near completion. This has led to a huge sense of disappointment but as the Minister rightly said, we have achieved a lot and now the question is how to restore the institutions, keep our optimism up and what we are going to do about it. As he said also, politics works in Northern Ireland, people are going about their daily lives in terms of housing, education, lighting and sanitary arrangements as well as the development authorities and North-South bodies. All of this has patently worked with vibrancy. It is not just a matter of thinking perhaps this will work out, it has worked strongly for everybody.</P>
    <P>We want a return to a normal way of living about which we know in our clinics and representations and meetings with Ministers and county councillors, as well as the North-South institutions. This has made a huge difference to the fabric of people's lives. Every so often Paul Murphy, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, takes the correct democratic approach when he <Col N="1358" />says he does not want to be making decisions for the people of Northern Ireland, that he wants the people of Northern Ireland to be making the decisions for themselves. Prior to the past two or three weeks we had made great strides. We covered a huge amount of ground and positions were clarified. People understood better the background from which others were coming and how far they had come.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that we are trying to overcome history of hundreds of years, not something that happened in the last ten, 15, 20, 50 or 80 years. We are trying in a true historic sense to overcome the events of many centuries. It was never going to be easy for people to give up their entrenched positions, generously welcome others in and openly say, &ldquo;Come in to my parlour.&rdquo; It was going to be hugely difficult as the last step proved to be but we have gained huge clarity about the position of the IRA, Sinn Féin, the republican movement, the middle ground Nationalist movement as well as about how the Unionist position has advanced. There has also been great generosity on that side which is not espoused and talked about often enough. There is still a need for further generosity, however. There is a need for David Trimble to go the last one-eighth or one-tenth of a mile.</P>
    <P>A tardiness has been exhibited so far <i>vis-à-vis</i> the IRA position and this matter needs to be addressed in more concrete terms. Nobody wants anyone to be humiliated. That is not how history is forged. Humiliation does not make for good feeling, it does nobody any good if people have to be shriven in public. That has been a great difficulty. I come from a background of teaching history at senior level and I have thought a great deal about this matter. I am aware that the public shriving of a body within the political system &ndash; abasement is too strong a word, but the complete confessional way of saying what will or will not happen &ndash; is a huge step for those on both sides in this saga.</P>
    <P>There is only one further step to be taken. We hope that we will have the opportunity to debate this matter on a more joyous occasion. However, we can affirm the good, strong, positive movements that have been made. We hope we can build on these and bring them to completion in the autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share a sense of frustration and feel the need to restrain my language at a time like this. Such a feeling is common to everyone and it was evident in the Minister's contribution. The Irish and British Governments made heroic efforts in this area and I do not want it suggested that any comments I make are bit meant to be party political. That is not the case; they are simply reflections that are part of a political debate that this country needs to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I used to be somewhat less careful in my language when discussing Northern Ireland. Some of <Col N="1359" />my most recent remarks have resulted in my being reprimanded by representatives of political parties &ndash; not the governing parties &ndash; who felt that I was impartial on the issue of Northern Ireland and that I had betrayed my impartiality by some of my remarks. It is rewarding to know that people at least hear what we say.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that people will read the record of these proceedings, I wish to state that I have listened carefully to the assertion by Sinn Féin, in particular, and others, of the need to look forward. Everyone would agree with that sentiment. Whatever else is involved, there is a problem of a lack of comprehension. Sinn Féin also needs to realise that it is dragging along with it a body which forces us all to look back. We are not seeking humiliation for anyone, we are merely asking if we can leave behind a body which was part of the conflict and which Sinn Féin accepts is not part of the future? That is the issue the Republican movement has failed to clarify. We all have our views about what this body did, and whether or not it should have done it, and no doubt everyone in this House has the same view. I simply want to see the organisation to which I refer being left behind. I do not want it obliterated, humiliated or dissolved, but I want it consigned to history. I want to see it definitively stated, in a way that makes sense to ordinary people, that the organisation in question is part of history.</P>
    <P>We must also have clarity that this is a defining issue, not just for the republican movement but also for mainstream unionism. The Unionists must see a decisive break with the past and when such a break is made &ndash; clearly, unambiguously and definitively &ndash; we must engage in normal politics from that point and leave this issue to history. That is what all of us want to do, but there must be an assurance that there is a body of unionism which will state that it is entitled to and has been given a commitment that the organisation to which I refer is part of the past. That body of unionism must then state that, having been given the commitment, it will exist and govern without seeking references to the past. That is a big effort to make, given the history of the past 30 years, but we are entitled to ask for it. We are also entitled to be frustrated.</P>
    <P>I accept that much progress has been made by the republican movement. To say, however, that the IRA is determined not to do anything which would undermine the process reserves for that organisation the right to make that judgment. What the IRA has stated is not adequate. It must state that it is determined to stop all paramilitary activity. It can use whatever language it wishes and I do not care if it dresses it up in wonderful republican rhetoric. That is not the issue. There must be an unambiguous assertion that a historic breaking-point has been reached and that one particular organisation &ndash; which everybody, <Col N="1360" />including the Sinn Féin leadership, accepts is part of history &ndash;  agrees that it is its role to be part of history. The members of that organisation can judge the content of such a statement as they see fit and we can judge it in a different way.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which we discussed Northern Ireland, I said that it is difficult to encourage people to fully accept that a ceasefire is permanent if, after almost ten years, there are still well-maintained weapons dumps. The latter appears to qualify the position. It is also difficult to get people to move forward if there are ongoing activities which suggest that there is a permanent renewal of preparation for the possibility of conflict &ndash; that is what targeting and surveillance are all about &ndash; or if they see that, rather than participating in a reformed policing service, a group reserves the right to act as the police service. It is particularly difficult to allow people to be liberated from history if we do not obtain a decisive statement that an organisation, which has been consigned to the past, has been parked in history. Otherwise we cannot move on in the way that Sinn Féin, in particular, believes we should.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and I express my appreciation for the ongoing critical bipartisan spirit coming from the Opposition parties, which has been helpful for many years. I am naturally disappointed that there has not been a breakthrough. I compliment the Governments on the determination, commitment and leadership they have shown. I had hoped, because the prize was so big, that perhaps we would get the breakthrough. In the Joint Declaration we can all see for ourselves the progress that was, and is, promised on policing, demilitarisation, decommissioning and institutional stability.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the stop-start nature of the process post-Agreement was not satisfactory, even if it was a vast improvement on what went before. Stability and momentum are badly needed. The Northern Ireland economy, not to mention the people, suffers from institutional instability. Indeed, the absolute primacy of politics over economics that obtains in the North has relatively few parallels elsewhere. Equally, the continued interruptions do not serve the momentum that most of us wish to see and that republicans, for as long as I can remember in dealing with them, have always demanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an understandable desire North and South that the process of democratisation should be completed, five years after the Agreement and nine years after the Downing Street Declaration. If one looks at paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration, inclusive political participation was the prize or trade-off for a complete and permanent end to violence &ndash; John Major and Albert Reynolds demanded this. Demanding <Col N="1361" />completion, as the British Prime Minister did last autumn with the support of the Taoiseach, obviously ran a risk of temporary breakdown. On the other hand, the prospect of further and recurring breakdown at regular intervals was not an inviting prospect either.</P>
    <P>I recognise the disciplined contributions made by the republican movement. It made it clear in its statements that it was prepared to go much further in effectively acknowledging what everyone can see for themselves that the war is over, and in decommissioning all weapons. At one point the movement had suggested that any decommissioning of weapons involved surrender, humiliation etc., and I am glad that it has gone far beyond that. Of course, decommissioning is nothing of the kind and the strong political position of Sinn Féin, particularly in the North, could not make that clearer.</P>
    <P>I will not personally criticise the IRA statement for being ambiguous; it simply does not go the full way. While I understand its reluctance to let go, I think and hope that over the next few months the realisation will come that it is essential. To adapt the phraseology of Terence McSwiney, those prepared to sacrifice the most will gain the most. There is no doubt that paramilitarism is winding down and this needs to be completed. The point has been made many times but it cannot be reiterated too often that punishment beatings, shootings, exile, etc., are not even remotely consistent with human rights.</P>
    <P>I accept that a lot is asked of unionism to work with those who sought to force their hand and killed many of their people. Unionism also needs to be self-critical. Unionist tactics over a number of years have driven many in the Nationalist community into the hands of Sinn Féin. To me, this cannot have been the intention of unionism. Unionism has not given the SDLP a chance and stability would be needed to have that. People now talk about an arrangement involving the SDLP and Unionists. That was available for the best part of 20 years from the Sunningdale Agreement, but unfortunately the opportunity was not availed of. Even if it is not in pole position in the Nationalist community, I am glad that the SDLP was prepared to fight the election and fight it with vigour. We all know that the party has made an immense contribution over the years and it is difficult to fault its analysis.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to understand the apparent reluctance and inability in moderate unionism to face Paisleyism head-on. Has any thought been given to the impact of a Paisley-led victory on the standing of Northern Ireland, not only in Britain but further afield? For anyone who has pride in the Protestant tradition in Ireland, as I do, I find it dismaying that someone capable of the sort of outburst we saw last week should be remotely in prospect of gaining majority support in the Protestant community in the North. I am sure some <Col N="1362" />of his DUP colleagues would have been embarrassed by the reappearance of the old Adam.</P>
    <P>The British Government deserves some credit for pursuing the Stevens report and needs to pursue it further. I think it should take as its model what happened in post-Franco Spain. I had the privilege of meeting Balthazar Garzón a couple of weeks ago. He has done a great job of bringing within the rule of law both agents of the state and agents of terrorism, ETA.</P>
    <P>There is obviously a danger of a vacuum developing over the summer. I appeal to all sides not to be defeatist. They are going to have to hold the ring and it will require considerable effort from all sides. This effort must be made for the sake of what is so clearly within reach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I thank the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for his thoughtful and important statement. There is no doubt that a climate of fear and distrust has existed. I largely concur with everything that has been said by other speakers. Members of this House, and all true democrats, are totally and exclusively committed to democratic means in politics. We all feel frustrated as, in the words of the Taoiseach, we came within a whisker of final completion and resolution.</P>
      <P>Like the Government, I disagreed with Prime Minister Blair's call regarding the election. In our political lives, while we may not always relish an election and may not want to face up to the results, I do not think we can turn the clock back &ndash; we are either constitutional democrats or we are not. Perhaps the situation in Northern Ireland is somewhat different.</P>
      <P>The Joint Declaration is a huge body of work and we all welcome it. As has been said by the Minister, there is much in it that is not conditional on action by others and I welcome this. Great credit is due to the two Governments, despite our differences with the British Government regarding its call on the election. It is great that the Governments have met so quickly and so fruitfully. As democrats we are committed to ongoing dialogue as the only way forward. Hopefully the Governments will have immediate talks with the pro-Agreement parties in the North. They will get on with much that can be done.</P>
      <P>Peace requires the total end of all paramilitarism and we need to see demilitarisation as well. I hope that among the items on which the Governments can agree, and on which the British Government can act immediately, would be the removal of the remaining spy posts and watchtowers, to which Senator O'Brien referred, that dominate the countryside of south Armagh. The presence of these installations has disturbed the playing of national games and other sports fixtures in that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the two Governments on working well together. They have they have to pick up <Col N="1363" />on the pieces despite the hiccup. There is no going back for anyone.</P>
    <P>I do not want to speak about republicanism, on one hand, and unionism, on the other. We must assist people on both sides to overcome their distrust of each other. As far as Nationalists and republicans are concerned, there is no going back. I believe and accept that assertion. Those whom we know well and who in recent years have been part of the democratic process in the Lower House have shown they accept that. Irrespective of anybody's past or anything in the past we all want to look forward.</P>
    <P>I accept that to some, perhaps not to us, there is a deficit of trust. The best guarantee we can have of a bright future is that both sides will continue to work together. Without wishing to be critical of unionism, though Senator Mansergh reminded me of it, I do not understand why moderate Unionists cannot stand up to Paisleyism and bury it once and for all. The best guarantees that Unionists and republicans can have is in working together &ndash; in an all-encompassing way &ndash; to make the peace process work. There seems to be more reticence at present on the part of moderate unionism, which makes me sad, than on that of republicans, who have shown greater commitment.</P>
    <P>We must bring to an end not just republican paramilitarism, in so far as it exists. Republicans have shown that, as far as they are concerned, that the conflict is over and that their arms are beyond use. However, we cannot afford to forget about loyalist paramilitary activity. It is as though too much emphasis has recently been placed on the activities of one side. Everyone in this House wishes to be helpful. I hope that more moderate people &ndash; Unionists and Nationalists &ndash; will develop even greater conviction in terms of wanting to make the peace process work.</P>
    <P>There have been arguments about words, but to most people the argument is about all other activities. To some the situation has been clear, but to others it has not been clear. Despite the hiccups, everything that has been said has been helpful, particularly on the republican side, and both Governments have openly acknowledged that. The Governments deserve our respect and support.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, gains have been made. In so far as the two Governments are concerned, they are committed to working together to ensure that those gains are not lost. We welcome that and wish them well in their future efforts with both communities.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his contribution. It has been echoed by virtually every speaker and I will also echo it. There is nothing wrong with that, as it shows a unanimity of view and purpose within the Oireachtas which is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" />Like the Minister, I share that deep sense of disappointment and frustration that we did not achieve completion of the peace process. The reason the frustration and the disappointment was so great was that we felt we were within touching distance of the finishing line and that we could look forward to a permanent peace and one in which the democratic institutions could be restored. It was understandable that in the previous debate on this matter, many Members vented their frustration at the lack of clarity which was evident within the so-called republican movement, although we all hope to be, and are, republicans in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The other matter was the frustration on the &ldquo;theology&rdquo;&ndash; if I can use that word &ndash; of terrorism, where Sinn Féin purports not to speak for the IRA. When it did speak, however, the IRA confirmed that what Mr. Adams had to say reflected what it stated. There appear to be interminable sophistries and tautologies at play. That is part of the frustration. There is also the thesaurus of Sinn Féin, in which words mean what it says they mean and not what they are commonly believed to mean. Our frustration should not divert us from the goal of a permanent settlement, one to which all can subscribe, where the democratic institutions will be re-established and where all will participate enthusiastically for the benefit of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I applaud the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister, the Secretary of State and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the resolution they have shown. It must have been difficult at times for them to continue to have faith that they would see the process through despite the disappointments and the frustrations which they must have experienced to a greater degree than us.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement has to be the template for all future relationships on this island and between the islands. It is simply not an option for it to be renegotiated. As has been stated, it was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people. It was not a question of giving a mandate but a democratic imperative. The message from that referendum was that it was a democratic imperative that the Good Friday Agreement should be the template upon which everything was based. That places an onus on the British and Irish Governments to maintain a unity of purpose, to implement the agreement in full and to achieve completion, notwithstanding the difference of opinion with regard to the elections.</P>
      <P>While it would be preferable for the elections to be held, and there should not be slippage in any democracy, I share the view expressed that there is some little degree of unreality in electing persons to a parliament that does not sit. On balance the elections should have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" />I am pleased that the work is continuing. The Tánaiste met the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party this morning and other meetings have been ongoing with the Taoiseach and others. Apart from the obligations on the Governments, those on the republicans and the unionists have to be stated explicitly. Northern republicans have to commit themselves exclusively to democratic and non-violent methods and to an end to paramilitarism, which has been the nub of the issue on that side. There is an obligation on Unionists to make the institutions work. It would be wrong to think that the presence of peace alone can be sustained without the accompanying presence of democratic institutions and the power sharing Executive because otherwise the whole edifice would crumble. We want the Assembly and the power sharing Executive restored without vetoes on their operation and when the completion comes, there will be no need for those vetoes. It is difficult to come to terms with people who do not appear to want to run their country.</P>
    <P>The Joint Declaration came close to completing the peace process. It would help if we knew what elements are agreed or, more particularly, the remaining elements that are not agreed in order that when we revisit the issue in the near future we will not have to restart, as we have done frequently in the past, arguments which have been recycled <i>ad infinitum</i>. Apart from that, I do not believe there is any need for that review system to operate. We need a definitive and unambiguous ending of paramilitary activities from the IRA. That applies not just to the IRA, but to all paramilitary organisations &ndash; republican and loyalist. We have an end to the conflict and decommissioning of weapons. The outstanding issue is the matter of paramilitary activities.</P>
    <P>We are back to the issue of the need for clarity. I note that in the Dáil yesterday the Taoiseach said it was not unambiguously clear that we had an end to paramilitary activity. It is important to re-establish trust and escape from the labyrinth of sophistry and words that mean different things to different people. We need simplicities. If we have learned anything about Northern Ireland, it is that simplicity and honesty are very much appreciated, particularly by those of the Unionist tradition.</P>
    <P>We have come so far in this matter that it would be unthinkable not to go the final step. We have heard the barbarisms catalogued time after time during the years. It is no good to say so and so was responsible for the atrocities of Darkley, Enniskillen or Bloody Sunday or cite the Stevens inquiry. While atrocities should be condemned, we should not use them as crutches for a particular point of view.</P>
    <P>Because we have come so far we can afford to wait a little longer in hope completion. The peace process is robust enough to withstand delay, not indefinitely but into the immediate future. I hope the work that has been done will continue and <Col N="1366" />that the resolve of the Governments will continue to give us the final peace for which we hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for what he said. I support what the Government is attempting to do and has been doing for some time, building on the work of previous Governments.</P>
      <P>It is important that we keep reminding ourselves that we have a peace process. I was elected to the Oireachtas in 1987 and on every occasion between that date and 1994 when we discussed matters north of the Border we spoke about bombs, killings and terrorist atrocities of the worst type. There has been dramatic progress which we should not forget. Matters in Northern Ireland are not yet perfect. The unacceptable face of paramilitarism is still evidenced in punishment beatings, kidnappings and exclusions. This cannot continue but we cannot ignore the fact that huge ground has been covered. Who would have thought in the autumn of 1993, not a full decade ago, the progress that would have been made ten years later? We must acknowledge that all Governments and all parts of the Northern equation have played their parts in that process. We must now turn the successful peace process into a long lasting political one. People have travelled many miles down that road and gone almost as far as is necessary. Everyone who has taken steps in that direction should be commended.</P>
      <P>If we were living in a perfect world, all of the paramilitary organisations would, some day, announce their surrender. However, that is not going to happen. This does not happen in any process throughout the world, it did not happen in the Ireland of the 1920s and 1930s and it is not going to happen now. We are not going to hear an official statement of surrender from any group. In a perfect world the paramilitary groups on all sides would tell us where the arms are hidden and those arms would be destroyed on one dramatic day. Because we live in an imperfect world that is not going to happen either. We must ask ourselves how do we get around these factors and put in place the mechanism to assure everybody that the war is over.</P>
      <P>The most recent IRA statement was very significant. Its language was significant. A short few years ago we would not have believed that such language would be put in print. I am not a wordsmith and do not know how the language can be tweaked further to bring about what is required. I readily accept what the Minister and Senator Mansergh have said. A little extra step remains to be taken. Let us encourage everybody to take it. To bring an end to the political vacuum and ensure there is no going back to where we have come from we must ensure the Good Friday Agreement is fully operative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my most recent visit to Northern Ireland some weeks ago, I spoke with politicians from the various parties. The issue of policing was stressed. <Col N="1367" />I recall the former deputy leader of the SDLP, Séamus Mallon, saying policing was the most important issue in the politics of Northern Ireland. What is good enough for Séamus Mallon is good enough for me. I welcome the fact that there has been progress on policing. I congratulate the SDLP on its courageous stance on the issue. That party signed up to something it knew was not totally perfect, as is the case with all such arrangements. I hope Sinn Féin can also walk the extra mile on policing and take part in a body which will preside over the policing of communities across Northern Ireland, whether Nationalist, Unionist, republican or loyalist. Policing is a crucial part of the long-term answer.</P>
    <P>I do not like to speak about long-term answers. When one is dealing with a difficulty that has been evident for generations, words such as &ldquo;final solution&rdquo; or &ldquo;final settlement&rdquo; can frighten people who live on the political edge. Those who have always been on the wrong side of the argument or in a minority can be fearful that the solution decided today may not be satisfactory. Our aspiration should be to have the Good Friday Agreement working fully and the political process restored. Our desire should be to ensure the present group of politicians in Northern Ireland will work together, the communities live together in peace and harmony and, in 25 or 50 years' time, the next generation will take whatever steps they deem to be necessary. I am not looking for a solution. I am looking for the Good Friday Agreement to be fulfilled on all sides, progress on policing and the creation of the conditions which will ensure there will be no going back to violent methods.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have always condemned the military activities of the paramilitiary groups. I have done so as much as anyone. They were and always will be wrong. However, we must ensure the conditions which allowed some to believe they were doing right when they were actually doing evil will never be created again. We must build fair play and justice across the communities. We must build trust and goodwill. We must talk about compromise and progress rather than surrender, about trust, not triumph.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way. In the past week some have spoken about tiredness and despair with the process. Let us remember from where we have come. If we had not had a ceasefire in 1994, there would probably be a thousand more coffins lying in the graveyards of Northern Ireland. We have made marvellous progress. I say, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to everyone who has played a part in that process. One or two further steps remain to be taken. If there is sufficient goodwill on all sides &ndash; it must be on all sides &ndash; North and South, progress can be made. I wish the two Governments well in their ongoing endeavours. Senator Brian Hayes has made the valid point that in all of the difficulties of recent months it is <Col N="1368" />notable that the Governments have continued to work effectively together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House and I thank the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for his clear, helpful and constructive statement. It was also a privilege to listen to the perceptive and thoughtful analysis of Senator Mansergh, who contributed so much in a previous incarnation to these activities.</P>
      <P>The important part of the statement is that the Governments are sticking together. Progress has been made over the years when the Governments have worked in double harness and it is important to maintain that approach. It is also important that the Government maintains its lines of communication and continues to have access to and be accessible to all parties while maintaining their trust. If that means acting as an honest broker, so be it.</P>
      <P>No one in the North has clean hands, no one has a monopoly of virtue. There have been remarkable acts of courage on all sides and there has been fallibility on all sides. We should not demonise or canonise anyone. We should look forward without recrimination from where we are now.</P>
      <P>It is, however, a pity that we did not go the full mile over the last few weeks. The IRA statement was a great advance on anything that had come before. Mr. Adams's serial expansions of it were extremely helpful and would nearly have satisfied me. What was lacking then and what is available this week is a single sentence from the IRA saying his statement represented what it had to say. It is a pity that was not available last week.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Unionist leadership, Mr. Trimble in particular, could not have been more graceful in accepting the extent of the advance the republican movement has made. We have now come to the stage, five years after the Good Friday Agreement, where the chips are down. The other parties to the Agreement implicitly believed they were doing a deal with the republican movement and were not particularly interested in the theological differences between one part of it and another. The people who voted for it voted for peace on that basis. It is now time for the republican movement as a whole to commit itself to the democratic process. That means not having a body outside that process that is not amenable or accountable to the ballot box. The important thing is not that one abjures interfering in the democratic process but that one does not retain the power or potential to do so in the future. Finality is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister paid tribute to the constructive contribution of Ambassador Haass. He has been entirely helpful and very thoughtful in relation to the process. We should think of this as a temporary hiccup. We should look at the progress that has been made and realise this is not a <Col N="1369" />time for despair or panic. We need, however, to use the coming weeks and months as constructively as possible.</P>
    <P>I accept that the arguments on the holding of an election were finely balanced. Personally, I think it was a mistake not to have an election because elections are important signposts in a democratic system and we remove them at our peril. It gives the impression that we will only have an election if the people we see as the good guys win. It destabilises those people who had been deeply sceptical about the political process but have been encouraged by politics and democracy if we say that we can change the rules when we feel like it. That was a mistake but I appreciate why it was done.</P>
    <P>The effect on the middle ground of nationalism should be thought about. There is a great sense of disillusionment and anger. There are people who are beginning &ndash; unfairly in my opinion &ndash; to doubt the validity of Unionist commitment to power sharing. They also wonder if there is anything the IRA can do that will satisfy unionism. Middle ground unionism needs to convince those people that its demands are not demands that cannot be met and that it will work the institutions once they are guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Policing is tremendously important. What do we get from decommissioning if the aspects of paramilitary activity on both sides, particularly the loyalist side, that impinge on the ordinary person are punishment beatings and vigilantism? The only way those can be dealt with is by having a decent community police force. There is no point in saying that we will wait until there is an ideal society and then join an ideal police force. There cannot be even a partially ideal society without policing. It is a key to making progress and it is a step that Sinn Féin owes to the process.</P>
    <P>Where are we now? The important thing is to keep the lines open, to encourage people to talk to each other and encourage those who are speaking not to do or say silly things in the middle of what is traditionally a difficult period in Northern Ireland. People are still working together in local government and I congratulate Councillor Alex Maskey on the excellent way he has carried out his functions as Lord Mayor of Belfast. The Government must stick to its line and I encourage all parties to keep the peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The deadlock that grips the peace process is a source of great frustration to all those who have the interests of this island close to their heart. The way in which the process stalled on the verge of an historic advance was a cause of particular concern for people in Cavan and Monaghan. The Border counties witnessed the many years of conflict at close quarters and they enjoyed the first fruits of the strides towards peace that were taken with courage and determi<Col N="1370" />nation by the political leaders, North and South, in recent years.</P>
      <P>This debate is an important opportunity for this House to state forcefully its support for the Taoiseach, who has devoted his considerable energy and skill to the ongoing dialogue necessary to bring this difficult process to the conclusion we all desire. The Taoiseach has worked hard and clung to the vision of lasting peace and security for the island, the ultimate goal of all those with influence to bring to bear on this situation. He has remained loyal and true to that vision in trying circumstances. He has not compromised the objectives he set out for himself as leader of this State. He has been consistent in the requirements he has laid down for progress to be made and has shown himself willing to listen and respond to all sides and to go the extra mile for peace. The Taoiseach has forged a productive relationship with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, and the leaders of the parties in Northern Ireland and has been clear and straightforward in his dealings with all sides. We should encourage and applaud him in his efforts.</P>
      <P>The deferment of the Assembly elections is regrettable, but they can be held if a formula can be found to give renewed impetus to the search for a workable peace deal. The revival of the devolved institutions should also be considered as a realistic target. It is regrettable that the IRA statement endorsing the clarification by the Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams, did not come at an earlier stage. However, it is significant and has the potential to move things forward.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement was an historic accomplishment and showed what could be achieved with determination, commitment, courage and imagination. These qualities are still required to ensure the full implementation of the Agreement. Reassurance is needed on all sides. All the parties involved must indicate their willingness to implement the terms of the Agreement in full. The historic institutions, provided for under the Agreement, must be made to work. This can only take place in an atmosphere where violence and the threat of violence has been permanently removed and where a high profile and obtrusive British military presence is no longer required and can be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The most painful aspect of the current situation is that the parties are so close to bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion. The willingness of all those participating in the talks to work long and hard has never been in doubt. With a great and historic conclusion to their efforts in sight, surely they can muster a renewed effort. Where clarity is called for, it can be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A magnificent peace dividend was promised when the Good Friday Agreement was implemented. Some of that dividend has been enjoyed by the people of the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. A good deal of progress has been <Col N="1371" />made to remedy the social and economic disadvantages with which they have had to live for many years because of the troubles in Northern Ireland. However, more benefits can be obtained, but these will not come about until the outstanding obstacles to a resolution of the difficulties lying in the way of the full implementation of the Agreement are overcome.</P>
    <P>There has always been a high level of cross-community co-operation in my constituency. The people have always been willing to come together to advance their local communities, share a neighbourliness and to span all religious and political differences. It is the wish of the people of Cavan-Monaghan that something of that spirit can be harnessed and put to productive use in the difficult but, I hope, final negotiations that lie ahead. Ultimately, it is about being good neighbours, getting along with one another and respecting each other's tradition. Much could be achieved in the weeks ahead if these principles were adhered to.</P>

      <P>A couple of years ago, the BBC broadcast an interesting television series entitled &ldquo;Endgame&rdquo;. While it may have been premature, recent events prove that we have reached the endgame. Sadly, there is another phenomenon unique to Northern Ireland is also ongoing, called &ldquo;wordgames&rdquo;. It is clear that in the last couple of weeks, culminating in the second statement by the IRA, we are involved in word games. It is regrettable that the second IRA statement was not produced a little earlier.</P>
      <P>It is time to look forward. I am glad there will be a period of reflection and that recrimination has been confined to words. It is a matter of rhetorical flourishes rather than riots in the streets. I compliment the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland, who feel deprived as a result of the deferral of the elections, that it did not take to the streets in the numbers in which they have done over the past 30 years leading ultimately to violence in many cases, which in turn has spread to loyalist areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we put on the record our absolute support for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am pleased to note the presence of the Minster of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. His father had a long, proud and illustrious record in bringing peace and reconciliation, not only between the two parts of the island but also in the context of the totality of the relationships &ndash; a term he coined in 1981 &ndash; between the two islands. I hope and urge that the two governments will not only sustain the momentum created by recent initiatives but that Sinn Féin <Col N="1372" />and the Unionists, especially the Trimble Unionists, will attempt to forge a consensus. It will be difficult over the summer because of the parades season, but a political season will commence in the autumn when there is a definite possibility that the deferred elections will take place.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach succinctly and rightly said we were within a whisker of achieving the end of a conflict that has been ongoing for 800 years. We were so close to a resolution that it would be unparalleled in the history of relations between the Unionists and Nationalists on this island and between Britain and Ireland if we were to deprive all the people of these islands of real and lasting peace because of an indulgence in word games. I commend the Leader for allowing this debate to take place.</P>

      <P>It is with a heavy heart that I participate in this debate. I have been overwhelmed with sadness since I heard the declaration by the British Prime Minister that the elections would not proceed. That was a serious mistake. However, my heart has been lifted by the cross-party consensus in the House. I thank Senator Brian Hayes, Senator Coghlan and Senator Ryan who gave a good example.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas is united in supporting the people in Northern Ireland. The Nationalist population in particular need to know of our steadfast support. They look to us for progress. Yesterday morning I called for the report of the Stevens inquiry to be followed up. The chairman of the Bar Council of England and Wales called for a public inquiry. On 24 April, <i>The Economist </i>magazine referred to the activities revealed by the Stevens report as Britain's dirty war and also called for a public inquiry. The army and police officers in Northern Ireland named by Sir John Stevens are suspected by him of collusion in the murders of Pat Finucane and the student, Brian Lambert.</P>
      <P>I was overwhelmed by sadness when the election was postponed as we are trying to push constitutional politics in the North. I am hopeful today having witnessed the empathy across the House. I would like the Minister of State to ensure the Government will pursue the putting in place of a public inquiry based on the Stevens report and the publication of the Barron report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. People are frustrated that there is no report which gets to the heart of the bombings. The Government should also demand that a date for elections is set. Apart from this, there is no point in repeating all that has been said already.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House again. The matter I wish to discuss today centres on St. Brigid's secondary school, Goresbridge, County Kilkenny. Notice was received by the board of management of the school recently that it is the intention of the Department of Education and Science to phase out education at St. Brigid's over the course of the next two years.</P>
      <P>I was present at a local public meeting on the issue on Tuesday evening. Parents, pupils, past pupils and parents of past pupils gathered in the town of Goresbridge to voice their concern at the prospect of the closure of the school. It must be acknowledged that the school is considered small by most standards. While there are only about 140 pupils on the roll, the numbers have remained pretty constant over the years and it seems they will continue at the current level for the foreseeable future. A constant problem for the school is the continuous bussing of children from its immediate area to other schools in Kilkenny city, Graiguenamanagh in County Kilkenny, Bagenalstown in Carlow, Borris in Carlow. A number of school buses operate to take people from St. Brigid's catchment area which does not benefit its enrolment numbers.</P>
      <P>There has been very little funding over the past number of years to upgrade the facilities within the school which is housed in a former convent the structure of which is quite old. We have not seen continuous maintenance of the school's buildings to keep them reasonably safe for school occupancy. Parents feel there has been a constant downgrading of the school and a lack of attention from the Department which is culminating now in the decision to cease education in St. Brigid's College, Goresbridge. It is a co-educational school and the only one in the town which is why people are genuinely and reasonably concerned to ensure that the facility should be kept open. A school is an important facility for any small rural town like Goresbridge and it is with that in mind that I raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to pre-empt the Minister of State's reply, but the constant problem for Goresbridge has been the erosion by other schools of the base of pupils in the catchment area. That has led to the current low number on the school's roll. While it may not be deliberate, the Department of Education and Science is partially responsible for the downgrading of the school and the dwindling numbers attending it. I am very interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say in reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may be interested in what I have to say, but I fear I do not bring him very good news. I welcome the <Col N="1374" />opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding St. Brigid's secondary school, Goresbridge, County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>St. Brigid's secondary school was built in 1825 and is owned by the Brigidine Order who ran it as a girls' boarding school until 1978. At that time, the nuns withdrew and the school was taken over by a local board of trustees and a local board of management who leased the buildings from the nuns and ran the school as a co-educational voluntary school. In April 1998, the board of management decided to phase out the operation of the school. The board's decision was strongly resisted locally and a community action group was set up to save the school. In June 1998, the board of management notified the Department of Education and Science that it had reversed its decision to close the school. Subsequently, in 2001, a group representing the various school interests made a proposal to the Department of Education and Science in which approval was sought for the implementation of various measures which it was considered would result in the development of St Brigid's as a viable school into the future.</P>
      <P>Following a thorough examination of the issues involved, including submissions to retain the school under the trusteeship of the VEC, the Minister for Education and Science has concluded that the major capital investment needed to sustain a school of this size cannot be justified. Since 1995 enrolments at the school have remained steady at a figure of approximately 130. The school has a current enrolment of 129 pupils and a long-term projected enrolment of approximately 125 pupils. This is an optimistic assessment in that it assumes full student retention through junior and senior cycles and 75% of all fourth year pupils taking the transition year option. It is also based on a pattern of enrolment where in excess of 60% of the total first year intake comes from outside the catchment area.</P>
      <P>As part of its strategy to increase enrolments, the interest group representing the school has sought adjustments to existing catchment boundaries and current transport arrangements. Any attempt to alter existing arrangements would be likely to provoke strong opposition from other providers in the area. It could also be argued that this strategy for increasing enrolments could be viewed as verification of the school's non-viability for the future. Even with the interventions mentioned, there will not be a sufficient base to justify major refurbishment or a new building. Consequently, the view of the Minister and the Department of Education and Science is that educational provision should be phased out over a two year period, with final closure in June 2005. The Minister has advised the owners and trustees in this regard. To facilitate an orderly closure, the school authorities are not accepting a first year intake in September 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any decision on the closure of a school, the concern of the Minister and the Department is to <Col N="1375" />ensure that there are sufficient pupil places to meet demand in a given area. The alternative choices for pupils who attend St. Brigid's are Borris vocational school and the Presentation de la Salle and vocational school in Bagenalstown. Pupils from the same primary schools that feed St. Brigid's also attend a range of other schools including Grennan College, Thomastown, Scoil Aireagail, Ballyhale and various post-primary schools in Kilkenny city as the Senator outlined in his contribution. It is to be expected that these would also be alternatives for pupils who would otherwise attend St. Brigid's.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" />The Department of Education and Science is satisfied that arrangements can be made to facilitate the placement of pupils from St. Brigid's in neighbouring schools as circumstances require. Arrangements are being made to accommodate the remaining pupils during the phasing out of the school through the provision of temporary accommodation. A senior departmental inspector will visit the school shortly to determine its accommodation needs for the next two years.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.45 p.m. until 2.30&nbsp;p.m. on Tuesday, 13 May 2003.</P>
