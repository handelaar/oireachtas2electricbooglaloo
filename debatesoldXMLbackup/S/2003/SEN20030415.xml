      <P>I have received notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline when the decision regarding decentralisation will be made for the combined decentralisation proposal for Newcastle West, Listowel, and Kilrush.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to review the tax implications in the recent budget for meal vouchers for the 30,000 employees who currently avail of them and to make this tax incentive more widely available.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Phelan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the position regarding access to the Luas park and ride facility located off the Red Cow roundabout on the Naas Road in Dublin and, specifically, if there is to be a flyover in place allowing the safe crossing of three lanes of traffic in order to access the said facility.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to outline the reasons for the discrepancies in the funding cutbacks to Longford Community Resources, which provides valuable services, projects and training for the marginalised in the community.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that where families continue to foster children over the age of 18 years and those children have special needs, those <Col N="1042" />families will continue to receive State support and recognition for their role as foster parents.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected those raised by Senators Finucane, Morrissey and John Phelan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Bannon and O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 3 be deleted and replaced by statements on the upsurge in crime.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong of the House to go into the Easter recess without an early statement from the Government and Senators on the issue. We are aware that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in the House some weeks ago, but now is the time for action and to see the colour of the Government's money in respect of whatever proposals it wishes to bring forward.</P>
      <P>As the Minister told the House two weeks ago, there has been a 22% increase in headline offences. Every day someone is kicked to death on our streets as a result of alcohol-induced violence and we now know that the Government's promise of 2,000 additional gardaí is nothing but a pipe dream. We would be in dereliction of our duty were we not to debate this important matter before the House rises tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael has today published a ten-point <Col N="1043" />action plan to deal with this issue. We have ideas which we want to debate on the floor of the House and we encourage others to bring their own ideas forward. It would not be right to go into recess without any debate on the specific actions that must be taken to stop this spiralling rise in crime in our society. This House needs to take a firm and definite stand on that matter. I encourage the Leader to accept our amendment in the spirit in which it is put.</P>
    <P>I asked last week for a short debate on Northern Ireland policy. We are aware of ongoing efforts on the part of our democratically elected Government and the British Government in attempting to bring the parties forward in their deliberations. Tomorrow is still a good time to hold such a debate. I find it disappointing that our democratically elected Government continues to haggle over words with an illegal organisation that has been responsible for murder and mayhem on this island for the past 40 years. Let this matter be brought to an end, let our people be freed of the tyranny of the IRA and their murder gangs and let there be support for our Government as it takes a firm stance against the IRA and every other illegal outfit in this country. It is time the IRA was confined to history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised before the question of a debate, inquiry or discussion on the auctioneering process in recent times. That matter has also been raised by my colleague, Senator Ross, on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter again because a new war has broken out over the past three weeks. Stockbrokers and those involved in the equity market are telling us house prices will soon go through the floor and auctioneers and agents are telling us prices will continue to increase. In the middle of this are young people who are struggling to get together enough money for a deposit on a house. They are being confused and misled and are being given wrong information. There are many casualties in this war among fund managers, equity managers, stockbrokers and auctioneers.</P>
      <P>Last week, Senator Tuffy sought further explanation of the Taoiseach's proposal for a constitutional amendment regarding the price of land and its ownership. That is a reasonable request. If what I understand the Taoiseach to mean is correct, then I fully support what he had to say. Most of the development lands in profitable areas are owned by five or six people. If they do not own them, they have options on them. People are being used as playthings. The market is being corrupted and perverted by certain amounts of land being released for development and housing on that land being released on to the market. That are ways of dealing with this matter. The new national agreement, Sustaining Progress, contains a proposal in this regard the matter which could, perhaps, be discussed when we come to that debate. We need to take another look at this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" />We also need full information on the regulation of auctioneering. I have asked for such a debate many times during the past three years. Every time I raised this issue people on the Government side agreed with me we should have such a debate &ndash; people who know they have been stung one way or another. I have heard all sorts of stories in this regard. While the vast majority of people involved in auctioneering are doing their job in the best way possible, there are others who are not.</P>
    <P>My next point may relate to that raised by Senator Brian Hayes on the issue of law and order. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently told this House he would bring forward a new licensing Bill within 15 to 21 days. That time has now elapsed. Many people wish to know what will be contained in that Bill, when it will be introduced and what is its intention. The Minister referred to the issuing of licences for small café type premises. The matter needs to be spelt out. We should have a discussion on this matter before the Bill is introduced. We are constantly losing out on such a discussion.</P>
    <P>We should try to identify the disloyal Fianna Fáil person who had a go at our Leader in the Drapier column on Saturday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I again want to raise with the Leader the need for an ongoing debate on the war in Iraq and the situation in the Middle East generally. I note the statements about Syria made by US figures only yesterday and how it is evident that a bigger project than the action on Iraq is under way as far as the United States is concerned. It is important that Ireland is to the forefront in making clear that any move on Syria or any other country is unacceptable and that we need to restore the primacy of the United Nations, both for aid and rebuilding Iraq and world affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that EUROSTAT recently published research findings that the risk of poverty for single older people in Ireland was twice as high than in the rest of Europe &ndash; 62% compared to 27%. I note that Age Action Ireland, of which I am a member, has called on the Government to face up the facts uncovered by EUROSTAT. Ireland spends only 25% of its social service budget on pensions, compared to nearly 50% in other Euro<Col N="1045" />pean countries. We should have a debate on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to the House as a matter of urgency to discuss waste management, the single biggest challenge facing Irish society today. As Members will be aware, in recent days reports have shown that there are serious infrastructural deficiencies in handling increased quantities of waste. At the same it appears that we are closing landfill sites throughout the country and that the lead-in time for planning permissions for either recycling facilities or incinerators is running at three to five years, which is clearly prohibitive. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to debate this most important issue immediately?</P>

      <P>I second Senator Brian Hayes's amendment to the Order of Business and his ref<Col N="1046" />erences to the spiralling rise in crime associated with alcohol. With increased regularity, unfortunately, there are appalling incidents taking place in many cities and some provincial towns leading to lives being endangered and, sadly, in some instances, lost. Everything Senator Brian Hayes has said is accurate and perceptive. It would not be right that we adjourn for Easter without discussing these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I pointed out that there was a threat that public health doctors would go on strike. We also had the problem of the SARS epidemic getting nearer this country every day. The Leader stated at the time that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was very good at sorting out such problems when I pointed out that public health doctors were in dispute with the Department and various other agencies for nine years. The strike is now taking place and the Minister says he cannot become involved. Will the Leader ask him to come here to explain the reason he cannot become involved in this very serious issue?</P>
      <P>One could not meet a less belligerent group than public health doctors. Nine years is a long time to wait for a resolution of a problem which they thought had been solved at the time. I would be glad if the Leader would ask the Minister to come and suggest a way forward. There are problems which could become very serious if there were many SARS cases here. It is because public health doctors are so good that we know so little about them. We do not want to have epidemics starting in this country and getting out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues who raised the issue of crime, on which it is important that we have a further debate following the recent upsurge in crime figures. On local and national radio stations, it is the topic of discussion morning, noon and night. People are genuinely concerned about crime and the problem needs to be tackled once and for all. I support the Leader in this respect.</P>
      <P>The war in Iraq is being blamed for the huge increase in the price of fuel. Since Christmas, the price of diesel oil and petrol has risen by 30%. It is important that we have a debate on this issue because it is driving inflation out of control. The Irish Road Haulage Association and many others in the haulage business are concerned about the possible consequences. As we speak, businesses are closing down. They have already had to deal with huge increases in insurance, tax and so on. It is important that we have a debate on this issue as soon as possible. People are concerned that their livelihoods could be devastated. It is not fair for us to stand idly by and let this happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Senator O'Toole said about the need for a debate on auctioneers, the construction industry and others involved in <Col N="1047" />determining house prices. The cost of houses is causing huge problems and, if prices fall, these will be even greater. I am glad Senator O'Toole has been reading my articles in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and I hope he also reads those on social partnership shortly because, if he does so, he might have more sense to talk on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the activities of those in a profession such as auctioneering which is not regulated should be monitored by the Oireachtas. As Senator O'Toole stated, No. 6 of the non-governmental motions on the Order Paper calls for an investigation by the Oireachtas into the auctioneering profession. When the property market is &ndash; as is the case at present &ndash; in a state of unreasonable euphoria, it should be realised that auctioneers are fuelling this furnace and that this will cause a great deal of difficulty for people in years to come. The problem is that to qualify as an auctioneer, all one needs is &euro;10,000 and the ability to bang a gavel; one does not need any professional qualification. It is an industry that is basically unregulated, does what it likes and misleads the public about prices. As a result, it has, along with the banks and others, put house prices at a level that is probably unsustainable and that makes them unaffordable for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on this issue. Senator Ross and others have raised this matter with the Leader on a number of occasions in recent months and we have had to listen to offensive remarks about a profession, the majority of the members of which act exceptionally well and do a fine job on behalf of many people. It is unfair to allow this slating of auctioneers on an ongoing basis. We should have a full and frank debate so that the suggestions we are hearing can be refuted with examples of the numerous cases of high quality work done by auctioneers. There is no concrete evidence for some of the charges that are being made. Much of it comes down to the fact that people cannot afford houses in particular areas and must move to others. That is not the fault of auctioneers. I would welcome a debate on this matter and I look forward to participating in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes's request for a debate today on the escalating crime figures in our cities. A conference of Garda sergeants and inspectors is taking place in Galway at present. Yesterday they expressed their anger about the failure of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to provide the 2,000 additional gardaí that were promised before the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that a young man is fighting for his life as a result of a violent attack on the streets of <Col N="1048" />Dublin on Saturday night, have we ever needed extra gardaí on the streets more than at present? The escalating crime figures are appalling and the Minister should come before the House today to listen to a debate on this problem, which must be tackled. The Government has failed to tackle it and the Minister has failed to implement any measure to deal with the appalling crime figures. I support the request of Senator Brian Hayes to have a debate on this matter instead of on No 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of SARS. I endorse the remarks of Senator Henry that vigilance is important. I have had some correspondence from the Representative Office of Taipei in Ireland concerning Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organisation, even if only with observer status. It is important that any country with a busy transport hub should be included in the WHO and I hope that will be considered by the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will have noticed during the week some figures that suggest the most dangerous road north of the Border is that which runs from the Border to Belfast. The most dangerous road south of the Border is in County Louth. Some weeks ago, Senator Brian Hayes made a proposal that the Minister should consider the unification of the penalty points systems, North and South. I ask the Leader to draw the Minister's attention to this. Having one penalty points system represents another area of co-operation that would bring benefit and save lives. The Minister would find ready acceptance of such a proposal north of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by my colleague Senator Brian Hayes to defer discussion on No. 3 and to introduce an emergency debate on crime. Anybody listening to Joe Duffy's &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme, now taken over by Derek Davis, could not fail to be horrified by the graphic evidence from ordinary people about the manner in which they have been attacked &ndash; during the day or at night &ndash; on the streets and the appalling deaths and injuries that result.</P>
      <P>We need to address this matter from several viewpoints. It is a fallacy to say there are 12,000 gardaí on duty. Some 4,000 of those are working in-house on desk duties. Another 2,000 are involved in ferrying prisoners to and from court or are on court duty themselves. In addition, a huge number of gardaí are on sick leave at any one time. When other security duties are taken into consideration &ndash; for example, driving Ministers &ndash; the actual number of people on duty is 393, or 19 per county, which is appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a debate on the fact that, at present, there are 360,000 drivers who have had provisional licences for more than three years and who are being ripped off by insurance companies. The Government is genuinely trying to tackle this problem by introducing outside testers. However, <Col N="1049" />that will not resolve matters. It will take a long time to eat into that number and the backlog will continue. We should seriously consider the possibility of an amnesty for anybody on a provisional licence whose record is accident-free. We did it before and it worked. The backlog will never be reduced in the manner in which it is being tackled at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon" hpid="Mr. Scanlon Mr. Scanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate, at any time the Leader finds suitable, on the problems on our streets. The young man who was so viciously attacked last Saturday night on Grafton Street is a neighbour of mine. In Sligo, there was also a spate of violence over the weekend with cars burned out. Apparently thugs set fire to a car, which must have belonged to one of their own group. The car rolled across the road and set fire to two more, one of which belonged to my brother-in-law. A suggestion was made at the Garda conference that the Minister was contemplating tagging offenders and it is not before time that this was done. A tough stand must be taken to put a stop to what is going on because people are very concerned.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator Henry has said about the SARS epidemic and the fact that public health doctors are in dispute. The Minister for Finance has made it quite clear to the Minister for Health and Children that if he wants funding, it will have to come out of his own budget because the Department of Finance will not provide an extra allocation. If the dispute drags on, it will put the Special Olympics, which are only about six weeks away, in jeopardy. Clonmel is due to host a large delegation from Hong Kong. A cloud of uncertainty hangs over the travel plans of that and other Asian delegations. Public health doctors should be in place to ensure this event is a success. I, therefore, implore those responsible to take prompt action. If the dispute drags on, it will place in jeopardy all the hard work done by host committees in every community which have been planning to welcome the visiting delegations <Col N="1050" />with great hospitality. The Special Olympics represent a huge event for Ireland on the international stage. I am, therefore, seeking a quick settlement of this dispute.</P>
      <P>I also wish to support the call for a debate on crime. Last weekend the Progressive Democrats held a successful conference in Galway but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was more concerned about the sexual implications of the Carlsberg advertisement than what occurred in Dublin when a young man from Sligo, Mr. Barry Duggan, was almost kicked to death in the street. How often have we raised in the House such matters which are an ongoing feature of society? As I said during statements on crime last week, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is remembered for Operation Hyphen last year concerning illegal immigrants. At the time, however, I described it as Operation Hype. The Minister promised to introduce over 30 pieces of legislation, yet not one has been enacted. It is time for action. It is grand for him to get his annual conference over with and have the troops re-energised but the country is calling out for leadership on his part which he should deliver.</P>

      <P>I join others in asking the Leader for a debate on crime. Hooliganism in the streets is not just caused by drink but also by drugs. It is a phenomenon that needs to be examined and dealt with. It is entirely inappropriate that people do not feel safe at night. It should be made clear that no-go areas will not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that an all-Ireland penalty points system should be introduced. I heartily agree that it would be appropriate. I ask the Leader to write to those responsible in order that such a system could be introduced in due course.</P>

      <P>I join my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in asking the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House to discuss the recently published crime figures, as well as the appalling events that occurred last weekend. Senator Finucane spoke about Mr. Barry Duggan, the unfortunate gentleman from Sligo who was brutally attacked on the streets of Dublin at the weekend. Such attacks occur far too regularly in many provincial towns also. Senator Finucane is right to say we have heard enough hyperbole from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; it is now time for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" />I also wish to refer to a point which arose this afternoon at the annual conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. A motion was passed at the conference asking the Government to cease the implementation of the penalty points system until the complete computer system has been put in place. Will the Leader to ask the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Transport to comment on that development?</P>
    <P>I support what Senator MacSharry said regarding the issue of waste management. This is an important matter on which a debate is required. I urge the Leader to ensure that when the Minister comes before the House to deal with this issue, he debates the issue and does not lecture us about his views on it.</P>

      <P>I am forced to rise to request a debate on crime. A number of recent sad and high-profile crimes seem to have catapulted the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform to the fore as the Minister to be bashed at present. I am not here to defend him; he is more than capable of doing so himself. This debate is going completely off the rails. Crime is at a serious level and the statistics are there to prove it. A debate that would have a dimension of comparative analysis with the 1980s, when law and order simply broke down, might put it into a proper perspective. There was no law and order here during the 1980s.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes put forward an amendment to the Order of Business calling for a debate on crime to deal with the many points he raised. I point out, not in a sense of retribution but as a matter of fact, that exactly ten days ago we had a three hour debate on crime. We had a strong debate on the issue and the Minister was present for entire three hours. I am not in any way referring to who was present or who was not; I am merely saying there was that debate and the Minister was here for the three hours during which it took place.</P>
      <P>I applaud the fact that Fine Gael published a ten-point action plan today. The leader of the party, Deputy Kenny, spoke on the issue on radio at lunchtime. It is an issue of the day, of that there is no doubt, but we had a strong debate here on the matter ten days ago. I fully appreciate the serious nature of this matter, but I cannot keep asking Ministers to come before the House to debate the same issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also suggested that we should debate the issue of Northern Ireland. However, as developments are at an extremely sensitive point &ndash; particularly today, tonight and into tomorrow &ndash; a debate on the matter might distort many of the sensitive issues being put forward. The Senator wanted to point out the tyranny of the IRA, etc., and he has every right to do so. In a debate on a sensitive subject such as Northern Ireland, however, it is vital and extremely important that we keep our cool for a day or two. There will hopefully be a proper resolution of the issue. It is moving forward in tiny incremental steps, but it is moving forward. Rather than distort the matter, we should leave it be. However, I recognise the Senator's right to raise the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned auctioneering and house prices. There is a commitment in Sustaining Progress to examine this issue, particularly in the context of property prices for first-time buyers. I am trying to make time available for a debate on this issue in the first week after the recess. Many other Senators referred to this matter.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1053" />Senator Bannon sought a debate on the crime figures. The crime figures were announced in the Seanad by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If the Minister was trying to avoid the issue it would be a different matter, but he debated the crime figures here.</P>

There is a debate on the elderly this evening and the Minister for State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, who has responsibility for this area, will be present.</P>
      <P>Senator MacSharry wanted the waste management issue to be addressed by the appropriate Minister. I want the Minister to attend a debate on this in our first week back after the recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to the strike by public health doctors which has started. That matter is being raised by way of special notice question in the Dáil today, so we will see what emerges from that.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross sought a debate on housing and auctioneering, which I hope to arrange. Senator Dooley also sought such a debate and was to the forefront in calling for such a debate some weeks ago. I hope to arrange to hold the debate during the first week after the House returns.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry supported calls for a debate on crime and inquired about the whereabouts of the 2,000 additional gardaí. Those gardaí were to be recruited in the lifetime of the Government and we hope it has many years to go yet.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kitt referred to the WHO and the view from Taiwan that Ireland would support its need to be admitted, with observer status, for debates there. Senator Quinn raised the issue of a linked road strategy between the North and the Republic in order that the dangerous stretch of <Col N="1054" />road through Louth to the Border could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins sought an emergency debate on crime, pointing out that the number of gardaí enlisted is not the number on the streets at any one time. He also referred to the need for an amnesty for provisional licence holders who have had a clean driving record for three years.</P>
    <P>Senator Scanlon mentioned that the librarian who was assaulted is from Drumcliffe, which is near the area in which Senator Scanlon resides. That was a very brutal crime and the circumstances are not as they were first described. More details are emerging.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane mentioned SARS and the fact that visitors from Asia will be come to Ireland for the Special Olympics. This problem needs to be solved as soon as possible. He also called for a debate on crime. Senator Hanafin mentioned hooliganism on the streets and the need for an all-Ireland points system, which was raised in the past.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan also sought an amnesty for provisional licence holders. However, he included the proviso that the person involved would have to have no points on their licence and have done nothing wrong. Senator John Paul Phelan mentioned penalty points and debates on crime and waste management.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald pointed out once again that the crime debate should take place in context and on a comparative basis, with figures and outcomes. I make no apology for the seriousness with which I view the issue. There is no doubt about this but I must balance it against the fact that we had the Minister here ten days ago. He attended the House for three hours and gave a very full account of himself, putting the figures on the table. Senator Quinn made the point when he spoke in that debate that in the end it comes down to personal responsibility. It is a matter of the person acting in harmony with society. That is a major point. However, I will bear the possibility of such a debate in mind. I hope we can have one as quickly as possible. I appreciate the right of Senator Brian Hayes or any other Senator to propose an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to appear before the Seanad today to discuss the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill 2001, the primary purpose of which is to ensure public safety at large-scale indoor events. The Bill is set out in three Parts. Parts 1 and 2 relate to the licensing system for indoor events while Part 3 relates to amendments to the Fire Services Act 1981.</P>
      <P>Like anyone else going out for an evening's entertainment, I want to be assured that my safety is a priority for those in control of the premises. The Bill aims to do this. When enacted, it will ensure public safety and crowd management will be taken into account when an event is going through the new licensing process. When taken with the Planning and Development Act 2000 and associated regulations on outdoor events, it will mean that we will have new and updated requirements covering public safety and crowd management issues for both outdoor and indoor events. The licensing system will apply equally to both public and private events.</P>
      <P>It may be appropriate at this point to recall the background to the Bill. A committee chaired by Mr. Justice Hamilton examined the question of public safety and crowd controls and reported in 1990. The committee examined in detail all safety aspects of entertainment such as concerts and concluded that primary responsibility for public safety should attach to the organisers and promoters of such events. It made a series of recommendations on public safety and crowd control, many of which have been implemented in the intervening years.</P>
      <P>The changing nature of events and venues has given rise to concerns about public safety in recent times, particularly where young people are involved. Following on the recommendations of the Hamilton report, two codes of practice &ndash; on safety at sports grounds and at outdoor pop concerts &ndash; had been published by the Department of Education and Science in 1996. A tragic death which occurred at a concert in the Point Theatre in the same year gave impetus to the development and putting in place of a third code of practice on safety at indoor events. My Department in 1998 published the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts which reflects the general principles of safety and the organisational parameters set out in the other codes, all of which reflect the recommendations of the report of the Hamilton committee on public safety and crowd control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The code provides advice and guidance on the matters involved in the safe organisation and running of an indoor concert. Its aim is to help all involved in the organisation of indoor concerts to plan and manage events safely. As indoor con<Col N="1057" />certs take place in a wide variety of venues and cover a wide range of events, the guidance is set out in broad functional terms. The issue of crowd control is central to the safe running of these events and detailed guidelines on these subjects are contained in the code which could not and did not address the issue of licensing of events to which it applies. Under the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill, such codes of practice will be put on a statutory basis. Applicants must show compliance with such codes and fire authorities must have regard to relevant codes of practice when deciding on licence applications.</P>
    <P>The Bill's new licensing system is modelled on the outdoor events provisions in Part XVI of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development (Licensing of Outdoor Events) Regulations 2001 which introduced a new licensing regime for the control and proper management of large-scale outdoor events. It will focus on issues of crowd control and safety appropriate to an event or type of event. An event is defined as &ldquo;. a performance which takes place wholly or partly in a building and which is comprised of music, singing, dancing, displays of entertainment or any activity of like kind .&rdquo;. The licensing system will be operated by fire authorities, with applicants having a right to appeal decisions to the District Court. There is also provision for the other front-line emergency services, the Garda and health board-ambulance services, to be involved at both the licensing stage and follow-up inspections.</P>
    <P>Enactment of the Bill will give full legal effect to the recommendations of the Hamilton committee on crowd control and fully implement the principle that the promoter has responsibility for public safety issues. The Bill will implement the recommendation contained in the report that all major indoor pop concert promotions where the anticipated audience exceeds 2,000 should be licensed. The provisions in the Bill will go even further and regulate classes of events with less than 2,000 people in attendance. The Bill will allow public authorities to prevent or control potentially unsafe concerts for the benefit of performers and the public alike. There is no adequate mechanism in place to regulate public safety at indoor concerts and events. The Garda, health boards and fire authorities have limited powers prior to an event. The Bill also provides a statutory basis for existing and any future codes of practice, a provision recommended in 2000 by the review group on public safety.</P>
    <P>The safe running of events is and will remain the primary responsibility of the promoters of such events. Those attending the event must also ensure their behaviour does not endanger the health and safety of others. The concerns of parents and guardians in relation to the new forms of entertainment and enjoyment in which our young people participate have been well addressed by Deputies in the Dáil. The Bill will allow parents to sleep easier knowing that the issues around managing crowd safety will be considered and <Col N="1058" />that such events will, when the Bill is enacted, require a licence from the fire authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill has benefited greatly from the debate and amendments process during its passage through the Dáil. A number of amendments, including minor technical amendments, have been carried out to provide for clarity and ensure the licensing system will be flexible and clearly understood by the licensor, licensee and members of the public attending events.</P>
    <P>The attendance number thresholds have not been included in the body of the Bill; the intention is to prescribe the appropriate thresholds in regulations to be made under it. This reflects the advice of fire authorities in relation to the operation of the licensing system. The thinking behind this approach is to provide for flexibility in the system for prescribing classes of indoor events within the approved thresholds into the future by the Minister as and when required. It will also enable the Minister to deal speedily with any deficiency identified in the licensing arrangements needing urgent remedy and which may be posing a risk to public safety.</P>
    <P>I have indicated in the Dáil that my intention in regard to the regulation of indoor performance events, as defined in section 2(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Bill, is to require licensing where the audience exceeds 1,000 adults or exceeds 750 and comprises mainly children under 16 years of age. I also propose to prescribe under section 4(2) of the Bill indoor sports events where the audience exceeds 1,000, and conferences, conventions, seminars, exhibitions, trade shows or trade fairs where the audience exceeds 2,000.</P>
    <P>Indoor events with an audience below the thresholds specified in the regulations as requiring a licence will continue to be regulated under relevant legislative provisions such as the Planning and Development Act 2000, Fire Services Act 1981 &ndash; ease of escape regulations and related codes of practice, Building Control Act 1990, building regulations and any other licensing controls which apply such as an annual dance licence, liquor licence or music and singing licence. As the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts acknowledges, there is a vast array of legislation which governs existing events and provides for safety generally at the great majority of such events. The Hamilton report indicated that smaller events were considered to be well controlled and adequately provided for by such legislation.</P>
    <P>With reference to licence application fees, the intention is that there will be a one-off application fee of &euro;1,000 in respect of an event being held mainly for profit or gain and &euro;1,500 for a multiple licence for any number of similar events within a particular class in a year being held mainly for profit or gain. The fire authority will, however, have absolute discretion to refund all or part of the fee payable in respect of a particular application where it is satisfied that payment of the full fee would not be appropriate and explicit <Col N="1059" />provision is made in the Bill for varying or waiving of the fee by the fire authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill has the subsidiary and equally important purpose in Part 3 of strengthening the enforcement procedures of the Fire Services Act 1981, as recently recommended in the report on the review of fire safety and fire services in Ireland. The opportunity has been taken, by way of amendment to the Bill made by the select committee of the Dáil, to provide a sound legal basis for a significant range of options for fire authority inspectors to deal with fire safety risks which they identify as needing to be addressed in premises inspected by them. This has been an issue of some concern to senior fire officers and is a welcome legislative recognition of the need for enforcement steps in the armoury of the fire authority between providing advice and the formal serving of a fire safety notice. The Bill also includes provision for a closure notice which may be issued by the inspecting authorised person in situations where they perceive grave and immediate danger to the safety of persons on a premises. This means that immediate powers will be available to fire inspectors for carrying out their duties under the Fire Services Act 1981. These proposed amendments, with the enforcement provisions proposed in respect of the new indoor event licensing system, will enable a more immediate response by fire authorities to situations requiring enforcement action.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, I propose to prescribe in regulations, at the same time as commencement of the Bill, the attendance number threshold for indoor events and classes of indoor event. It is intended that indoor events and classes of event will be categorised in a table in the regulations. This will provide the flexibility to adjust the threshold set if changing circumstances require this. Senators may be aware that the Commission on Liquor Licensing, in both its recent final report and its previous report on admission and service in licensed premises, recommend that the enactment of the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill be given priority to ensure an effective statutory framework is in place in relation to crowd control and safety.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill. Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, are standard provisions dealing with the Bill's short title and commencement, interpretation and expenses of the Minister. In section 2, the definitions section, &ldquo;building&rdquo; means any building, structure or erection of any kind, whether permanent or temporary, or of any materials of any part of such building, structure or erection. An &ldquo;indoor event&rdquo; is a performance which takes place wholly or mainly in a building and comprises music, singing, dancing, displays of entertainment or any similar activity and in respect of which members of the public may or may not attend. This includes events run in private clubs and other events prescribed under regulations made under section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains the key provisions of the Bill <Col N="1060" />and provides that an indoor event will require a licence from the fire authority and that it will be an offence to organise or run such an event without a licence. Section 6 provides for the procedures to be followed by fire authorities for determining an application for a licence. A fire authority will be able to impose conditions in the licence and those involved in the event will also be required to have regard to codes of practice such as the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts. Section 7 states a licence will not necessarily authorise the holding of an indoor event. Compliance with other relevant codes will still be required. Section 8 makes provision for those applying for a licence, if aggrieved by a decision of the fire authority, to have a right of appeal to the District Court. Section 9 makes provision for the issue of codes of practice, notice of which shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</P>
    <P>Section 10 outlines the general duty of care of persons involved in organising or attending an event. Section 11 will empower fire authorities or authorised officers in certain circumstances to serve a notice of cessation requiring those involved to stop the event or any preparations, remove any temporary structures or restore any building to its original condition where a fire authority has reason to believe an event is likely to occur without or in contravention of a licence. Section 12 provides powers of entry on land and powers of inspection for authorised officers and members of the Garda Síochána. Section 13 is a standard provision for limitation of civil proceedings against the Minister, fire authorities or authorised officers in exercise of any functions required under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 14 empowers the District Court to revoke a licence on application by a fire authority where a licensee has been convicted of an offence under the Bill. Section 15 deals with penalties and the prosecution of offences. Section 16 provides fire authorities with the power to prosecute any summary offences committed in their functional area. Section 17 provides that directors, officers or members of a corporate body may be liable when a corporate body commits an offence. Section 18 states any fines imposed by the courts in relation to offences under the Bill will accrue to the fire authority. Section 19 provides that fire authorities will be required to maintain a register of decisions and notices served and that the register will be open to members of the public for inspection during office hours.</P>
    <P>Section 20 makes provision for fire authorities to make joint arrangements to carry out the licensing function or provide assistance for other fire authorities. Section 21 deals with the appointment and powers of authorised officers for the licensing function under Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill. Section 22 is a standard provision relating to the service of notices. Section 23 relates to the procedures to be observed by local authorities for holding of an event.</P>
    <P>I now turn to Part 3 of the Bill which addresses more general amendments to the Fire Services <Col N="1061" />Act 1981, the basic legislation dealing with fire fighting and fire safety in Ireland. Twenty years have passed since the introduction of the Act. In that time much change has occurred in relation to fire safety and prevention which warrants recognition in a legal context. I am aware that a number of the provisions, particularly the penalty provisions included in the 1981 Act, have proved to be less than effective in practice and are in need of reform.</P>
    <P>I am not proposing a fundamental review of the Fire Services Act 1981 at this stage. My intention is to remedy difficulties, in respect of the enforcement provisions of the Act, which have been identified over the years and, in particular, following a legal challenge in the Supreme Court in 1993. The judgment in that case held that no provision is contained in the Fire Services Act 1981 which gives a specific power to any person or body to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for offences under sections 18(2), 20 and 37 or regulations made under section 37 of that Act. The only route open to prosecute such offences is the lengthy process of prosecution through the Circuit Court on indictment. This legislation will put beyond doubt that a fire authority may take summary proceedings for an offence under sections 18(2), 20 and 37 or regulations made under section 37 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill also addresses the issue of powers of inspection for fire authorities and fire authority inspectors under the Act. As stated earlier, the closure notice procedure is being introduced to the fire services legislative code. This procedure is already available to fire inspectors under the health and safety legislative code. Provision has also been made for the withdrawal of a fire safety notice. The Minister is also taking this opportunity to amend section 16 of the Fire Services Act 1981 to further strengthen the existing training and advisory role of the fire services council and to make provision for the council to specifically undertake new roles. Part 3 also updates the penalty provisions of the 1981 Act in respect of fines to bring them into line with current money values.</P>
    <P>Section 24 extends the definition of building in the Fire Services Act 1981 to include parts of buildings, structures or erections, thus providing the fire authorities with the flexibility to serve notices on parts of buildings, which will deal with difficulties which has arisen in issuing fire services notices to multiple occupancy buildings. Sections 25 and 26 copperfasten the power of fire authorities to prosecute offences summarily and updates the penalty provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981.</P>
    <P>Section 27 updates references to sections in the Planning and Development Acts 1963 to 2000. Section 28 expands the scope for the Minister to assign additional functions to the fire services council.</P>
    <P>Section 29 clarifies section 18(2) of the Fire Services Act 1981. It puts beyond doubt the duty of persons in control to make adequate provision <Col N="1062" />for the safety of persons, on the premises, whether or not an outbreak of fire has actually occurred. This section also strengthens the status of advice given by a fire authority, its inspection powers and underpins an extended range of options including the issuing of a warning that a fire authority could use in dealing with persons in control.</P>
    <P>Section 30 empowers fire inspectors to close down a premises on the spot if they identify a grave and immediate risk to the safety of persons on that premises. Section 31 makes provision for the issue of codes of practice and notice of the codes of practice shall be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</P>
    <P>Section 32 makes statutory provision for the withdrawal of fire safety notices. Up to now, there was no provision in the Fire Services Act to enable the fire authority to withdraw a notice once it had issued in respect of premises. This gave rise to considerable conveyancing difficulties for these premises. Section 33 updates provisions governing the service of notices. Section 34 repeals the exclusions in section 18 subsection (1)(<i>f</i>) of the Fire Services Act 1981 in relation to dangerous substances premises, explosives premises and oil jetties, which can be workplaces, to ensure this country's compliance with the provisions of the EU workplace directive.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that the enactment of this long awaited legislation should be accorded priority to ensure that audiences attending large indoor events can rest assured that there is a crowd control and safety plan in place to ensure their protection and safety. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate on its various provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and look forward to visiting his beautiful county of Donegal next weekend for the 20th annual Local Authority Members' Association conference.</P>
      <P>I strongly support this Bill, which has finally reached the Seanad following its introduction to the Dáil in 2001. This legislation is of the utmost importance, particularly in regard to the safety of young people who urgently need protection from the cowboys of the leisure industry. I refer to those who seek to exploit them for profit and gain, without due regard to their basic safety and protection.</P>
      <P>Current arrangements for indoor events are woefully inadequate to deal with public safety and crowd management. The Bill introduces a new licensing system for events such as rock or pop concerts and is primarily based on the recommendations of the Hamilton committee on crowd control. It will require promoters and organisers to demonstrate to fire authorities that they can safely run the event. If properly enforced, this should go a long way to safeguard those at concert or disco venues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, examined safety at major <Col N="1063" />indoor and outdoor events and its final report made 73 recommendations, many of which relate to indoor concerts. Among the key recommendations is that all major promotions anticipating an attendance in excess of 2,000 &ndash; I am glad the Bill applies to events at which fewer people will attend &ndash; should be licensed on an individual basis by the District Court and that two months notice should be provided for an application for a license for a major indoor or outdoor concert.</P>
    <P>A code of practice, based on the findings of the committee on public safety and crowd control, was published in 1998 and, almost five years later, we are discussing the legislation which has been a long time coming before the House. There is little point in harping back to what has and has not been done. It is essential that we look ahead and provide the greatest possible protection for the largest number of people. The code deals with fire precautions and safety, structural matters, electrical installations and communications. Other aspects provide technical guidance and advice for promoters on a wide range of parameters relevant to crowd control, such as panic planning and management, crowd management and the use of barriers, stewarding and emergency and medical facilities. As we know, the code of practice did not address matters such as the licensing of the events to which it applies, but the Bill will place its recommendations on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The new licensing system, as proposed by the Bill, is based on the outdoor provisions in Part XVl of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development (Licensing of Outdoor Events) Regulations 2001, which introduced licensing for outdoor events, which have relevance in respect of crowd control and which amended the Fire Services Act 1981.</P>
    <P>In light of tragic events here and elsewhere in the world involving fire and crowd control problems at leisure premises, this legislation is vital to ensure that such tragic accidents are not just waiting to happen, that proper precautions are taken and that the running of public events at substandard premises is eradicated, once and for all. The making of a quick buck at the cost of human life is repugnant and must carry the greatest possible penalty, but prevention must be our primary concern.</P>
    <P>The licensing system must apply equally to public and private events and the loopholes in existing legislation must be firmly closed in relation to crowd safety and control and fire regulations. The Bill provides for the strengthening of the Fire Services Act 1981 and places the onus on the fire services but what of funding and resources for the implementation of its provisions? Given local authority funding cuts and the extra cost in terms of the manpower and resources that will be necessary, how does the Minister of State expect the fire services to take on this extra workload? What of insurance? It is to be hoped the licensing of <Col N="1064" />indoor events and the subsequent guarantee of proper safety standards will be reflected in a lowering of insurance premiums to a realistic level. We all know insurance costs are astronomical and we must act quickly to address the issue.</P>
    <P>It is inconceivable that 21 years after the Stardust disaster there is no quality regulation in place in the leisure industry. Standards of safety differ greatly across the country with some very dubious venues operating without censure or control. Worldwide the picture is just as grim. Following what was recognised as one of the most horrific rock concert tragedies ever, The Who concert in Cincinnati in 1979 in which 11 people were crushed to death and numerous others were injured, a landmark report on concert safety was published in 1998 by the Cincinnati citizen task force. It contained many recommendations designed to make sure such a disaster could never be repeated. It also recommended that the international association of auditorium managers should develop crowd management standards for event promoters and that incentives should be put in place to encourage members to meet these standards. Unfortunately, promises to have such standards implemented were never fulfilled and an international code was never put in place with obvious consequences &ndash; lives have been and continue to be lost.</P>
    <P>Since the Cincinnati disaster, fires in international places of entertainment include Happy Land Social Club in New York City on 25 March 1990 in which 87 people died; a disco in Lima, Peru in which 28 people died in 2002; a nightclub in Jakarta, Indonesia in which 46 people died in 2002; Rhode Island Concert Hall in which 96 people died last February. There are many more. I do not need to continue with the list. Suffice it to say that the lives of many were lost due to a lack of proper legislation and enforcement. Crowd control experts say that when frightened people come together, they tend to push each other. They also tend to follow others, especially in emergencies, on the often erroneous assumption that those upfront know more. Where fire is involved, panic increases. We have all been told that had proper controls and exits had been in place such catastrophes would not have happened.</P>
    <P>Practices such as crowd surfing where a person is carried over the heads of the audience and stage diving, that is, diving head first into the audience, are familiar in catastrophes of this kind. Concerts of the nature primarily covered by the Bill are the preserve of the young who often function and operate blind following a particular band or solo singer. Often times more people than anticipated turn up at such concerts leading to chaos. Danger as might perhaps be perceived by others is not uppermost in their minds. Unfortunately, the young are at the mercy of many persuasive influences and often blind to the important issues of safety and safety standards.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to close any loophole, no matter how small, that could result in a tragedy <Col N="1065" />on a scale witnessed both here and abroad. This legislation which is imperative seeks to promote more effective crowd safety techniques and effective fire standards for events attended by young people and adults.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the Minister of State and congratulate him on the introduction of this Bill which received a positive response in the Dáil. I read some of the Dáil debate in that regard.</P>
      <P>Indoor and outdoor events, whether in the entertainment or sports industry, raise many questions regarding safety. I note from recent articles in the media that there is a question mark over the holding of the proposed concert at Lisdoonvarna, a very successful outdoor concert in the 1980s. There was concern about crowd control and safety matters, be it at indoor or outdoor events. For this reason, it was important a code of conduct was drawn up. It was imperative that this be done following events at the Point Theatre where a young girl from Cork lost her life. I am glad we will now go one step further and introduce a licensing process. I welcome the Bill in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke about licensing events where the crowd exceeded 2,000. He has also stated he now intends to go further and deal with concerts with fewer than 2,000 in attendance. Crowd control is important. Our front-line services, the Garda, local authorities, health boards and ambulance service, are to be involved in the licensing stage of the process. We are all aware of the injuries and fatalities which have occurred at indoor events. There was another tragedy in Hillsborough, Great Britain, following which the Hamilton committee made 73 recommendations in its report. Many committees have been set up to examine indoor events and it is hoped, through this legislation, we will be able to implement their recommendations as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>We have all experienced times when we felt uncomfortable at indoor events in theatres and halls. We are also concerned about safety at outdoor events. Croke Park has been hailed as a state-of-the-art stadium but I have experienced a great deal of scrambling for shelter on a wet day. People go to the top of the stand where they presume they will be better sheltered. I have seen the same thing happen at Lansdowne Road which has been the subject of much talk on many occasions in relation to upgrading or demolition. One sees a great deal of scrambling for better sheltered seats on a wet evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that at Old Trafford, Manchester United's stadium, one can see what is going on from any seat, people are obliged to sit very high up in the stand. There is not much point in having people in seats at a great height, particularly at a hurling game, for example, and this can also give rise to difficulties in evacuating a stadium in the event of a crisis. The way to deal with events, whether indoor or outdoor, is one of <Col N="1066" />the issues which should be looked at in the context of building a national stadium.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Minister of State's comment about the definition of an indoor event in section 2, I would always have regarded events at Croke Park as outdoor events but, following the recent development of corporate boxes and escalators to the premier seats, one would wonder whether one is at an indoor or outdoor event. In either case, the issue which should remain paramount is the importance of safety. While it may be seen as modern to have escalators in a stadium, it could be a good way of getting some spectators to seats which are located high up in the stands.</P>
    <P>The GAA authorities, I believe in 1998, believed that, on safety grounds, it should stop people coming on to the pitch, particularly after the All-Ireland finals. The 1998 All-Ireland final was the last, before the redevelopment of Croke Park, at which people were able to come on to the pitch. I recall it, in particular, because I happened to be there as a fan of the Galway team which won that year. After that, the practice was stopped, but of course that did not stop the Armagh fans from coming onto the pitch &ndash; which, incidentally, I was glad about &ndash; when they won the All-Ireland for the first time last year.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be a killjoy in respect of this matter. We should be able to go out and enjoy our sporting and musical events, but we must also be realistic. If the advice given to the sporting authorities or to the concert promoters is that certain action must be taken, we must live with it. This is prudent advice because in the past, before it was a question of introducing codes and licensing, people often took their lives in their hands when, for example, they were out in towns celebrating the return of a victorious football team. Members of the Garda could tell one stories of what happened on such occasions.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate about the new national stadium about which we keep hearing. There has been much debate about where it will be located &ndash; at Abbotstown or Lansdowne Road &ndash; but we should also consider the question of safety and crowd control and such issues.</P>
    <P>We have learned a great deal from the Stardust tragedy. Everyone remembers issues which arose at the time and we know families who lost loved ones in that awful tragedy. It happened on the weekend on which the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis was due to be held. However, the latter was postponed as a result of those terrible events. Issues were also raised on foot of the tragedy at the Heysel Stadium. These tragedies raised a number of questions regarding the structures concerned. In the case of the Stardust fire, question were raised about the type of materials used in the building, while, in the case of the Heysel Stadium tragedy, questions were raised about fans being too close to each other and about the violence which can break out at such events. These are all issues which must be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" />I am concerned about the rock concert industry. I have been to the Point Theatre on a number of occasions when some of the great names from the past, like James Taylor, have performed. I welcome the fact that Paul McCartney is coming to town, but I do not know much about the rock concert industry apart from what I hear younger people talking about. To put it bluntly, however, I believe that people in the business have not done much to promote safety. There is more concern about selling tickets and, in many cases, too many tickets are sold. I often wonder whether extra concerts could be arranged instead. I also wonder why concerts are not held at an earlier time because their being held late at night leads to more difficulties. In the aftermath, the promoters of these concerts blame the fans for the problems. There is a related issue of the price of tickets and the way they are sold, but that is a question for another day.</P>
    <P>Where pop concerts take place at well known venues, will a licence be required for each performance? It is not clear whether this is the case. In cases where, once or twice a year, well known stars come to Ireland, there is generally only one performance scheduled and then there are other very popular venues where concerts continually take place. While that is an issue, there is also the question of events in public houses, which are probably more common in rural areas. What is the position regarding licences where musical events take place each night in such venues?</P>
    <P>Will extra resources be made available to the fire services? We have a very good fire service, but we are continually looking for more training and better equipment and trying to get fire stations refurbished. We need a response from the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
    <P>It was important for the Minister of State to indicate that the licensing system will apply to both public and private events. That is also important in the context of public private partnerships which might be involved in the development of a national sports stadium. I am glad the Minister of State referred to that.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon referred to the question of crowd-surfing. Although I profess ignorance about this, I have heard many people raise concerns about such behaviour and state that some entertainers even insist on jumping into the crowd of spectators. There should be a complete ban on such behaviour. However, it continues to occur and receives a good deal of favourable publicity among some in the media who write about the music industry. Overcrowding, this crowd-surfing, the surging of crowds and crushes are issues which would certainly be dealt with under a licensing system.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that promoters have responsibility for public safety issues. That should be made very clear to promoters, particularly those who promote musical events. I am always amazed at how well the concerts in Slane are run and how successful they have been. The residents <Col N="1068" />of Slane have questioned such events, no more than their counterparts around Croke Park have questioned the number of concerts and the number of matches held there. Now that there are games at Croke Park on Saturdays and there are what are known as &ldquo;the qualifiers&rdquo; in football and hurling, naturally residents would be concerned. In the past, the residents around Lansdowne Road have also been worried about the number of sporting events and the number of concerts which have taken place there. We should take a common sense approach to this.</P>
    <P>I referred to the question of late night concerts earlier and we should also look at the question of summer concerts. For example, I recall that a number of years ago a concert took place at Leisureland on a fine day when people were visiting Salthill and the Connacht final was taking place in Pearse Stadium. It does not make sense to have so much activity going on in an area at the same time.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has not had a great deal to say about noise. We know that noise is an issue because performers refer to it. If the health effects are so serious for artists, they must also be serious for the fans who, time and again, attend these concerts. Promoters and managers of venues should be conscious of the fact that young people could suffer serious long-term effects because of the noise levels at some of these venues. I reiterate that I do not want to be a killjoy. This is very good music, but why does it have to be so loud? I am continually amazed by that fact.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the positive things he said earlier. I hope he will have full support for the Bill and that it can be implemented quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I have a daughter in America. Like many other parents, I felt a shiver go through me when I heard in February that there had been a fire at a nightclub in Rhode Island and that 96 people were missing. As Senator Bannon stated, those people had, in fact, died. Within a week, there was another fire in Chicago in which 11 people died. Senator Kitt mentioned the events of St. Valentine's day of 1981, which I remember well. We had a supermarket in that area of Coolock and I received a telephone call at 6 a.m. to say that many people were missing after the Stardust fire. As it turned out, a number of our employees were killed. The memory of the week of funerals and the tragic months that followed acts as a reminder of the Bill's importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the introduction of the Bill, I must express my overwhelming sense of puzzlement. What is it about disaster prevention that compels us always to put the issue on the long finger? If there is any activity in which time is of the essence, it is disaster prevention. As long as we dither and prevaricate, we run the risk of waking up one morning to find that people have died <Col N="1069" />because we did not take action in a sufficiently timely manner. As already stated, my views on this issue, like those of many other people, were formed by my experience of the Stardust disaster. More than 20 years after that tragic event, however, we have not learned all the lessons we should have learned. We have still not taken the steps that were recommended in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy.</P>
    <P>The Bill has its roots in the Hillsborough disaster of 1989. As so often happens, it is the horror of an actual disaster that concentrates minds and provides the drive to action. In this case, it produced the Hamilton report, which was published not long afterwards in 1990. The Bill is, incredibly, only now putting some of the key recommendations of the report into operation. More than a decade later, we are getting around to closing the stable door.</P>
    <P>What is it about disaster prevention that encourages this foot-dragging, this refusal to take timely action? It extends even to the way the Bill is moving through the Oireachtas. It was published in 2001, but it was not until the end of last year that it actually started its progress through the Lower House. What kind of message does that send about the priorities of the Government in respect of this matter? The licensing of indoor events, vital though it is, is only part of a much wider picture of safety. The tardy manner in which the Bill has been dealt with should encourage us to take the opportunity to consider the broader picture to see whether the same attitude prevails.</P>
    <P>The report of the strategic review of fire safety and fire services in Ireland has been gathering dust on the Minister's shelf since it was published more than two years ago. The report is a long and comprehensive document and contains a menu of urgent recommendations. In its own way, it is quite hard-hitting, although I recall that, at the time it was published, it was condemned as a whitewash by a number of chief fire officers. They argued that the report effectively covered up a number of key deficiencies in the system and that the Department had worked energetically to prevent its release in light of this.</P>
    <P>The report made a number of far-reaching recommendations and it went to some pains to stress the urgency of action. The key recommendation, a sort of umbrella under which much material was gathered, was for the establishment of a national fire authority. The report, which was published by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on 29 January 2001, states:</P>
    <P>Our primary recommendation is that a new National Authority for Fire and Civil Protection/Emergency Services be established. We believe that the new Authority should be brought into being through integrating and amalgamating into a single structure the functions currently discharged by [five different bodies].</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" />That was more than two years ago. The national authority was needed to provide for an integrated approach to fire safety, so that the issue could be properly approached from a strategic point of view, instead of using the over-localised, piecemeal system we had at that stage. As far as I can see, we will still have it after the Bill comes into effect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister of State could put my mind at rest about this matter. It seemed that the case for the national fire authority was convincingly made in the report of the strategic review. I was pleased, therefore, that the then Minister, Deputy Dempsey, gave a commitment to set up the authority within a six-month timeframe. That was in January 2001. It appeared that this matter was, at last, being approached with the sort of urgency it deserved. I looked forward to hearing about the establishment of the national fire authority. Since then, what has happened? I am open to correction, but, as far as I know, nothing at all has been done until today.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State outline his view on a national fire authority? Is the view expressed in the commissioned report being rejected? The six month period to which the then Minister referred has come and gone four times over and the report has continued to gather dust on the Minister's shelf until today. The Minister of State could put my mind at rest by stating that he has taken into account some of these recommendations. I note that he did not mention the national fire authority.</P>
    <P>Are we fooling ourselves that we are addressing all the issues by belatedly passing legislation of this nature or are we employing a piecemeal approach, taking one little bite at the problem and returning to it later? Are we congratulating ourselves for finally dealing with only one part of a much wider problem? Are we continuing to drag our heels on issues such as this when we should be making haste? I would welcome answers to these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the introduction of this Bill. My only regret is that it was not introduced earlier. As Senator Quinn said, it has taken a certain length of time for it to come before the Houses.</P>
      <P>I have a personal interest in the Bill. I was working in the Stardust at the time it burned down, but I happened to be off that night. My wife was not working there, but I lost a number of school colleagues. I know people who still react when they smell smoke or hear any kind of commotion on a night out, even after all this time. That is the effect of a tragedy such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is comprehensive, yet well balanced. It provides for an immediate response to incidents which arise through accident or, in many cases, neglect. It is a preventive and not reactive Bill. The many improvements in outdoor events that have taken place in recent years, including those as a result of the Planning and Development Act 2000, are very welcome and the extension of <Col N="1071" />these improvement to indoor events is a great step forward.</P>
    <P>Above all, the principle of promoter responsibility is crucial to the Bill. I welcome the Minister's statement that these measures will be put in place for events of 1,000 people or more. The input of the fire authorities is crucial and I welcome the participation in the licensing procedure of the Garda, health boards and the ambulance services, as well as the local authorities and fire services.</P>
    <P>The wide powers of access for officials and gardaí prior to an event are crucial. There is no use waiting until a tragedy occurs to take action. This Bill allows for action to be taken before an event. If an official feels that certain measures must be taken to prevent tragedies, he can ensure they are taken. I welcome the provision in the Bill dealing with the fire regulations, which gives legal recognition to the many changes that have taken place over time.</P>
    <P>More effective and appropriate penalties as well as their enforcement are also crucial. In the past the enforcement procedures available were totally inadequate, resulting in people walking away from their responsibilities. The 73 recommendations in the Hamilton report were designed to regulate an area of public activity, which until that time had had very little regulation.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes a long way to ensuring that every measure possible is taken to ensure the public can safely enjoy their chosen entertainment. The individual licensing of events puts the onus on the organiser as opposed to the statutory bodies to ensure safety. In Dublin for a number of years there has been a problem with what are called &lsquo;raves'. These are unofficially organised, unlicensed events where huge numbers of young people gather. They are very lucrative for the people running them. Sometimes they are held in buildings which do not comply with fire regulations and in some cases in derelict buildings. These have generated huge profits for unscrupulous individuals with the risk of the loss of many young lives. These risks, coupled with the misuse of drugs such as ecstasy, can be lethal. There is no use waiting until a tragedy occurs to deal with these problems. Because of the nature of the whole area of entertainment, there is a wide range of events and venues.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes a long way towards streamlining the rules and regulations on safety, particularly those concerning structural matters, electrical wiring, fire safety and other issues. I welcome section 18, which provides that the fines imposed by a court will accrue to the local authority and local fire service. These funds will assist in the enhancement of services provided by the authority, including the fire and ambulance services. I suggest these could be used towards the recruitment of more fire prevention officers.</P>
    <P>We all saw the tragic pictures of the event in the USA recently where a simple firework caused dozens of deaths. This can happen so easily. The <Col N="1072" />powers this Bill gives to the relevant authorities &ndash; the fire service, Garda, health boards and local authorities &ndash; will allow them to be preventive and not just reactive. I congratulate the Minister and his Department on the introduction of the Bill, which I support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on the legislation. I am sure this Bill will have the support of all Members of Seanad Éireann. Over the past 20 years we have been very lucky that no tragedies have occurred. It is essential for the health and safety of people attending such events that legislation be introduced. I compliment the Minister. The extra responsibilities given to the fire service will give it every opportunity to inspect these venues. Where work needs to be carried out, that can be done before the events take place.</P>
      <P>In so far as liquor licences are granted for such events there needs to be a framework for crowd control. I also support Senator Quinn's request concerning a national fire authority. Much information has been collected from local authorities on the fire services in each area. Many recommendations have been sent to the Department on this and it is essential that this be implemented in the future, separately from this legislation</P>
      <P>The Bill also strengthens the hands of local authorities as regards fees. I note that a waiver of fees in certain circumstances is also included in the legislation. I wish the Minister well and look forward to the passage of the Bill through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators from all sides for their very constructive contributions to this all important debate on the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill 2001. I appreciate it is some time since the Bill was originally initiated as it took a long time to get into the queue. It is almost complete and I have no doubt we will get the necessary co-operation from the House with a view to ensuring we can proceed with the Remaining Stages as soon as possible after Easter. Once enacted, the Minister will be able to sign the regulations to which I referred in my earlier contribution. It is in all our interests to have this implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>This Bill concerns fire safety and there is general consensus on the principle, even though there may be some questions on the detail into which we can go on Committee Stage. I thank the Senators those who contributed to the debate for the very constructive approach and support for the Bill. I am heartened by the consensus of the House on the importance of the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill 2001. I look forward to an informed and interesting debate on the detail of the Bill during Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Bill is to ensure public safety at large-scale indoor events and amend and update the enforcement of penalty provisions of <Col N="1073" />the Fire Safety Services Act 1981. While the Bill is about indoor events we used the <i>modus operandi</i> available to us in Part 3 of the Bill to amend aspects of the 1981 Act. In particular the section concerning the withdrawal of fire safety notices has been recommended by all the professionals who advised me on this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill bridges the safety gap to allow for the regulation of large-scale indoor events from the perspective of public safety and crowd control and management. It provides a statutory basis for the codes of practice that were in place. It will now provide public authorities with the necessary legislative backing to prevent or control potentially unsafe concerts, for the benefit of performers and the public alike.</P>
    <P>The legislation is workable and will clarify greatly the roles both of public authorities and promoters alike. The Bill is aimed at public safety and will put in place a licensing system to deal with crowd control and crowd management. The licensing system is specifically designed to ensure promoters will take account of crowd control dynamics by planning for and reacting to evolving situations.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt referred to the input of authorities, apart from the fire authority, including the Garda Síochána and health agencies. The licensing system provides for an input from the latter bodies. The fire authority will co-ordinate the process and decide to grant or refuse a licence, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon referred to the costs involved. The fees and fines handed down by the courts will be paid directly to the fire authority. The system, therefore, will be self-financing. I do not anticipate any additional cost. The fees and fines will be more than adequate to cover any additional costs.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for insurance. Promoters will be required to produce evidence of public liability insurance, not just for the day on which the application is submitted. If multi-licences are being sought, I will want to be assured that the period of cover is for the whole year. Even if the insurance year runs from June to the following June and the licence is from January to December, I will want an assurance that the insurance policy will be available for inspection or, if necessary, can be presented to the fire authority at any time after renewal. I am anxious not to allow a situation to develop whereby proof of insurance is only required at the time the application is submitted and processed. It would be somewhat foolhardy of us to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt referred to multi-licences and a number of similar events taking place in one venue. There will be no necessity to have a licence for each specific gig &ndash; it will cost &euro;1,000 per individual but it will be &euro;1,500 for a multi-licence, which is fair and reasonable. There will be provision for multi-licences for small, similar events in a particular class. For instance, it would be unfair to expect The Point to apply for licences for each event as there are so many such events <Col N="1074" />taking place there. The Point management can apply, as others can, for a multi-licence for a number of pop concerts where the audience comprises a maximum of 1,000 adults or 750 in the under 16 age bracket. The same will apply to large hotels, seminars and exhibitions.</P>
    <P>The question of attendance levels at conventions, conferences and exhibitions was raised. The maximum will be 2,000 but I do not think there are too many parties, apart from one, which would have 2,000 people attending such events.</P>

      <P>The legislation also covers churches, a subject Senators may wish to discuss at a later date. As far as venues are concerned, each event will require a licence as crowd management issues vary with the type of gig and audience profile. A rave gig with a teenage audience would require a high level of crowd control, whereas a classical concert would not. For example, a Daniel O'Donnell concert would only require a low level of crowd control.</P>

      <P>It can vary from time to time. Senator Quinn raised a question concerning the recommendations of the Farrell, Grant Sparks report on fire safety and services, including the proposal to establish a national fire authority. A number of recommendations are being considered by the Minister. We can all agree that there are many positive recommendations to improve the delivery of fire services. It does not follow, however, that it is essential to establish a national fire authority to implement many, if not all, of the recommendations proposed by the Farrell, Grant Sparks report. The Department is working with fire service stakeholders to develop an approach towards implementing the recommendations, many of which can be implemented without establishing a national fire authority. While no definite decision has been taken, I would be happy if the recommendations could be implemented without a national fire authority. Is it necessary to have another layer of bureaucracy? If it can be done otherwise, it should be.</P>
      <P>The recommendations include the development of community fire safety and a risk-based approach to fire cover. These recommendations should be examined more closely. I have no intention of delaying their implementation but before taking any further steps, I want to ensure frank and comprehensive discussions take place with the stakeholders concerned. That is the way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate for their strong support for the Bill. I hope after Easter the Leader of the House will afford time to debate Committee, Report and Final Stages which will ensure the Bill's early enact<Col N="1075" />ment. I can go into more detail concerning the regulations on Committee Stage. I have already indicated what the thresholds and fees will be but there will be other regulations also. As soon as the Bill is enacted, those regulations will be laid before the House. Parents whose children are attending such events will be in a position to rest more easily once the Bill has been enacted. The Bill is in the best interests of all concerned, including promoters and the many, both young and old, who will attend such functions in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. U. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to speak on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on issues relating to the provision of services for older people and to outline what the Government is doing to meet the needs identified for this group. Significant progress has been made in terms of the growth in funding available for this sector in recent years, which is indicative of the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of health funded services for older people.</P>
      <P>I want to demonstrate the Government's commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people. I am full of admiration and greatly impressed by the range of activities of older people networks, activities of which promote positive ageing in many different ways in our communities. I also wish to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution that older people make to society. While old age has been associated with dependency, the vast majority of older people are healthy and independent for whom mature age can offer a new lease of life. They are no different from other age groups in so far as we all need to have a sense of control over our lives and the means to participate in society.</P>
      <P>There has been an enormous sea change in the level and provision of services and additional resources made available in recent years. My priority, as Minister of State with responsibility for services for older people, is to ensure the issues facing older people are addressed with a view to providing improved services benefiting an older population whose contribution to Irish society is fully acknowledged by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister of State with <Col N="1076" />responsibility for services for older people, I am pleased to indicate to the House that I have established an interdepartmental group made up of senior officials whose objective is to ensure services for older people are delivered in an integrated and co-ordinated manner. It is my intention to engage in widespread consultation with all the key stakeholders in the area over the coming months with the objective of producing a mission statement which will define our approach to the topic for the future.</P>
    <P>I want to focus on the additional revenue and capital that has been allocated. Additional revenue funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from &euro;12.7 million in 1997 to an additional &euro;87.8 million in 2002, totalling &euro;100.5 million. In excess of &euro;270 million additional funding has been provided for services for older people from 1997 to date. This has resulted in over 1,000 additional staff being recruited. Between 1998 and 2001 over 550 additional beds were provided in new community nursing units while over 1,250 day places per week have been provided in new day care centres.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of over &euro;87 million made available in 2002 was allocated for the provision of the home help service; community support structures; support for carers; the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland; voluntary groups; improvements in staff ratios; improvements in the nursing home subvention scheme, and implementation of the new health strategy. Additional moneys were used for the improvement and enhancement of existing services. For example, additional funding was provided for community nursing units, day care centres, community services while a contribution was made towards improvements in home help pay and innovative approaches to the delivery of services for older people at local level.</P>
    <P>In 2003 a total of &euro;23.6 million in additional revenue funding was allocated to services for older people. This funding will be used for a variety of services, including the home help service; the nursing home subvention scheme; support for carers; commencement of the elder abuse programme which I am delighted to indicate; support for voluntary organisations; the opening of new community nursing units; aids and appliances; the development of dementia services; funding of day care centres, and the development of consultant-led services.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, there has been an unprecedented level of investment in the nursing home subvention scheme and &euro;5 million was allocated for the scheme when it was introduced in 1993. However, due to a range of factors such as demographics, increasing levels of dependency, economic circumstances, etc., the costs of the scheme have risen significantly. In 1994, the first full year in which the scheme operated, the cost was &euro;15.2 million. The total expenditure on the scheme in 2003 will be almost &euro;110 million. The most recent information available indicates that approxi<Col N="1077" />mately 455 nursing homes have been registered, with 7,580 people in receipt of subvention.</P>
    <P>In line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has also been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. The objectives of the review of the scheme were, <i>inter alia</i>, to examine the objectives of the scheme and the extent to which they remain valid and to assess the service delivered and to establish what scope, if any, exists for achieving the programme objectives by other more efficient and effective means. The review raises some key questions in relation to the scheme and it is intended to publish it shortly.</P>
    <P>A root and branch review of the scheme is underway in my Department. This review will look at all aspects of the scheme, including the allowances given for assets, assessment procedures for means and dependency and all other elements of the scheme. I am concerned that there seems to be ambiguity in the manner in which certain health boards and officials interpret the scheme. The interpretation and criteria should be more streamlined. There is scope for development of the scheme and we hope to give more details in this regard as time passes.</P>
    <P>My Department is also in the process of consulting all stakeholders with an interest in the scheme for their views on how it might be improved to benefit the most important person involved, namely, the patient. It is planned to bring forward proposals in respect of whatever additional measures may be necessary arising from the expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme and the Ombudsman's report, together with experience gained from the operation of the scheme since its inception in 1993. The review of the scheme will also need to be looked at in the wider context of how we, as a society, will fund long-term care in the future.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that there is insufficient provision of public long-term care beds to cater for our growing elderly population, with a resultant over-reliance on the private nursing home sector. The Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board areas are particularly affected because of a lack of public long-term care beds. This was acknowledged when my Department was preparing the national health strategy, which contains a commitment to provide 1,370 additional assessment and rehabilitation beds and 600 extra day hospital beds, with facilities encompassing specialist areas such as fracture prevention, Parkinson's Disease, stroke prevention, heart failure and continence promotion clinics. The strategy also proposed the provision of an extra 800 extended care/community nursing unit places per year over a seven year period that will include the provision of long-term care beds for people with dementia.</P>
    <P>Public private partnerships or PPPs are currently being piloted in the health sector. PPP is based on the concept that better value for money for the Exchequer may be achieved through the <Col N="1078" />exploitation of private sector competencies to capture innovation and the allocation of risk to the party best able to manage it. Initially, the focus will be mainly in the area of community nursing units CNUs for older people.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that 17 new CNUs will be created when the initial pilot programmes are complete, providing up to a maximum of 850 new beds in Dublin and Cork. The services offered in these units will include assessment/rehabilitation, respite, extended care and convalescence. If the PPP pilot demonstrates success, it is the intention to use it as a means of providing additional community nursing units in other locations throughout the country. The current position in relation to the project is that the two agencies involved, the ERHA and the Southern Health Board, have recruited business advisers who will assist in the development of the project. The next stage in the process will be the development of an outline business case.</P>
    <P>Indicative funding for services for older people under the National Development Plan 2001-2006 showed a sum of just over &euro;36 million to be made available in 2001 and 2002 combined. Just under &euro;55 million was actually spent and this funding helped to construct or equip new community nursing units in a number of locations. Substantial money was spent on facilities for older people at the Royal Hospital, Donnybrook, Mercy Hospital, Cork, and the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, Cork. The capital funding was also used to construct new day care centres in locations such as Killorglin, Finglas and Mallow. In addition, money was spent on badly needed upgrading/refurbishment of a number of community and district hospitals.</P>
    <P>Members will recall that, when I was detailing the breakdown of additional expenditure for 2003, I mentioned the commencement of the elder abuse programme. I will outline, in some detail, what this entails.</P>
    <P>The publication of the report, Protecting Our Future, towards the end of last year, was a momentous occasion for older people. They were being given a blueprint to deal with the scourge of elder abuse and a pledge that this blueprint will be implemented. Until recently, there was a feeling that elder abuse did not exist in Ireland. However, the report confirms what a number of us would suspect, namely, that a problem &ndash; the extent and nature of which remains to be identified &ndash; exists. This report, in starting with a definition of elder abuse and recommending the putting in place of structures to deal with suspected cases, will hopefully give older people who feel they are the subject of abuse in any shape or form, the confidence to report their anxieties, as appropriate, to a social worker, a public health nurse, a member of the Garda or indeed any professional or care worker.</P>
    <P>The report is a first, but important, attempt to deal with elder abuse. Abuse can come in many shapes and forms &ndash; physical, psychological, financial, or through neglect. I accept the need to <Col N="1079" />make the general public more aware of the problem of elder abuse. However, even more important is the need to target relevant service providers so that they become aware of the steps being taken to respond to elder abuse and the procedures that will be available.</P>
    <P>As the saying goes, &ldquo;prevention is the best policy&rdquo; and I hope that greater awareness of the problem will lead to a lessening of the incidence of elder abuse. I note the recommendation to establish a national centre for research and training and obviously such a centre will play a role in prevention. I will have to give careful consideration to where such a centre might be based. I also note the recommendation that a national implementation group be established.</P>
    <P>A number of the recommendations in the report are based on experience gained from two pilot projects. The outcomes of the pilot projects are not contained in the body of the main report. However, a separate evaluation report was commissioned and I understand that without any major publicity, sufficient cases, both in terms of numbers and seriousness, have come to light to justify this whole process. Financial abuse seems to loom large and this trend is corroborated by statistics produced by the National Help Line for Senior Citizens, which receives many of calls from older people in distress.</P>
    <P>I am determined to press ahead with gradual implementation of the report, starting in 2003. Despite the difficult financial situation we face, I have made &euro;800,000 available in 2003 to commence this process. I concur with the broad thrust of the report, which recommends that the response to elder abuse be placed in the wider context of health and social care services for older people. As Ireland's population of older people rises, we should not forget that they have been instrumental in building the State up to the level that we enjoy today. Their contribution to the economy is widely acknowledged, and the Government is fully committed to improving all aspects of their lives by focusing on issues that affect their well-being. I am pleased to tell the House that I have also met the Garda Commissioner to discuss the elder abuse report and have initiated consideration of structural changes to focus specifically on community support and appropriate liaison structures for older people.</P>
    <P>From a health perspective, the cornerstone of policy is to keep older people living in their own homes for as long as possible, and research has shown that to be the choice of older people themselves. Older people have a fundamental right to be treated with respect in their twilight years, and the implementation of the recommendations contained in this report will help bring that about. They are often reluctant to report abuse, and I urge the various voluntary organisations that represent them to encourage them to come forward.</P>
    <P>The starting point for making the changes called for in the report may well be for each of us to reflect on our individual attitude to older <Col N="1080" />people. I am in no doubt that, if we are to make an impact on the problem, it must involve major cultural change on the part of us all. We must begin to question our attitude to older people to satisfy ourselves that we do not harbour in-built negative feelings towards them, for they can often be the source of unintentional abuse of older people. We must now proceed on a journey during which we will have to absorb much and learn to cope with what may be considerable fallout.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to the House from what I have outlined that the Government's commitment to older people is undeniable. We acknowledge that we must continue to develop services to meet a growing need and that we cannot be complacent. While it cannot be denied that the Government and its predecessor can be proud of their records, there is no room for complacency and we must continue our efforts.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the contributions of Members of this House regarding what I have outlined, which is only some of the work that we have undertaken to date. I intend, as I continue in this office, to which I was appointed only in June 2002, to achieve a marked improvement in all that affects older people and in the provision of the appropriate services.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have set up the interdepartmental group, which focuses on older people's needs, and I believe that it provides an opportunity to bring positive influence to bear on the various services provided to them. The group is taking a cross-cutting approach to its work, with members speaking with authority on behalf of their Departments. To date we have met around seven Departments, and those who have participated have influence over their Departments' policies regarding services for older people. A number of agencies and interested groups have also made submissions to the interdepartmental group, and we have made great progress. Pilot studies are under way and, arising from their positive effects, I hope to roll out the interdepartmental group's beneficial work nationally.</P>
    <P>I hope that Members have found my contribution tonight enlightening regarding what we have undertaken in my Department. I would like to give much more detail, but I have given a broad outline. I look forward to contributions from Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his statement on Government policy and provision of services for the elderly. He has certainly given a broad outline of the services and the methods by which he intends to assist the home help service and the nursing home subvention scheme and support carers. Much has been done, but there anomalies in the report. Prevention may be the best cure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am involved in the county council, the VEC and adult education. My brief includes involvement with active age groups, which attempt to give back to older people a sense that they belong and have as good a purpose as that of any other <Col N="1081" />group. Over the years I have seen the local group provide self-sufficiency, self-fulfilment, self-confidence, self-esteem, self-reliance and, most importantly, independence.</P>
    <P>The budget has come partly from the VEC community education budget, but often it is up to the relevant vocational education committees whether to give those supports. In County Roscommon, supports are exceptional. It is incredible to see an elderly population being catered for, but unfortunately that comes out of a VEC budget. Some vocational education committees are not as active in providing the service, and that is one area in which we can make a difference. The VEC budget must be ring-fenced so that vocational education committees have to spend the money in the area, for some do not do so.</P>
    <P>The groups have annual magazines and the Bealtaine festival. They meet each other and are affiliated to national organisations. It gets them around the country, and I had the privilege of bringing my local active age group to Leinster House. They were not all supporters of my party, but they certainly enjoyed themselves. They would never have been together but for the VEC co-ordinating elderly people in the group. That is one area that we should examine.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the health boards. In my own area we had a problem with physiotherapists. The Western Health Board runs the Plunkett Home in my town, and it took a year and a half to appoint a physiotherapist there. The lack of physiotherapy for elderly people caused serious stress and many problems for them. Such cases are unacceptable breakdowns in the system. Thankfully, we now have a physiotherapist, who has come from South Africa, but the problem was not merely in Boyle but all around the country. Physiotherapists were not available to work for the health boards, and that was a serious problem for a year and a half.</P>
    <P>We must restore independence to older people at home who become ill or dependent, and we should encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours, voluntary bodies and in every way possible, also providing high-quality hospital residential care for older people. They need dignity and independence at home. Limerick Regional Hospital has separate admissions procedures for the elderly, and most hospitals around the country should consider that. It is unfair that elderly people should have to compete with younger people for admission.</P>
    <P>Younger people should have a separate admission scheme. Geriatricians need to be appointed to each acute hospital and existing welfare homes and long-stay hospitals for the elderly need to be redesignated as community hospitals in order to allow them to service a population of over 30,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know if active retirement comes under the Minister of State's brief, but more people are choosing to continue working after 65 years of age, often in a different capacity to that which <Col N="1082" />they previously occupied. My mother, who is over 70 years of age, still carries on our family business. Without working in the family shop, she would be a drain on health services. In the aftermath of the economic consequences of the Celtic tiger, it is almost impossible to hire part-time staff. There are many retired people who would like to work in shops for two or three hours a day or three days a week because it would get them out of their homes. These people represent a major source of prospective employees for employers. It makes good sense to bring them into the part-time workforce.</P>
    <P>The peak-hour ban on elderly people with free travel passes should be removed for those attending hospital appointments. An expansion of community access and travel initiatives &ndash; such as the active age initiative &ndash; should be promoted to allow elderly people to travel and the rules regarding those who accompany them should be relaxed. We should seek additional agreements with other member states in order to allow elderly people to travel through the EU.</P>
    <P>I welcome the rural initiative, but there was an anomaly with it to which I referred previously in the House. A pilot scheme commenced in rural areas, but elderly people who live there do not have the benefit of public transport. The scheme was good, but, unless the transport operator was registered, elderly people on free travel passes could not use the scheme. The scheme, which operated on a pilot basis, was doomed before it could take effect. Anomalies of this nature can only be dealt with by someone appointed to act as a liaison in respect of such schemes.</P>
    <P>In the area of IT, we need social partners for pre-retirement programmes for elderly people. Subsidies of &euro;500 to &euro;1000 could be given to elderly people to purchase home computers. It is a resource that is vast and could be used.</P>
    <P>Carers for the elderly are not getting a good deal. Approximately 85% of all care provided for dependent elderly people is provided by non-professional carers. Caring is often done on a 24 hours a day, seven days a week basis, with little help or respite. Carers should be receiving a better deal. If a son or daughter, a niece or nephew is prepared to care for an elderly person, it is much better for that individual and it provides better value for the State than would otherwise be the case if they had to be placed in a nursing home and a subvention had to be paid.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest achievements of the 20th century is the fact that people now live longer. By 2030, the proportion the population aged 65 years and over will have grown to 16% in comparison to just 11% today. The issue of an elderly population will not go away and additional resources must be provided. The major implication for the health services will be dependent ratios. We discussed health insurance &ndash; that provided by BUPA and the VHI &ndash; previously and I supported the equalisation initiative. If there are too many voluntary health insurance companies, some will be able to cherry-pick their clients. This <Col N="1083" />could be dangerous. I am happy with the new Bill, but we cannot allow cherry-picking to proceed because the elderly would be neglected as a result.</P>
    <P>In the area of promoting active retirement, there should be an emphasis on preventative rather than reactive measures. I have already referred to this matter in the context of the vocational education committees and the active age groups. The organisation Alone estimates that 88,000 people over 65 years of age spend Christmas Day on their own. That is a scandalous indictment of our society. Government services must lead the way in showing respect and support for older people.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting something we say at the active age groups:</P>
    <P>For age is opportunity no less</P>
    <P>Than youth itself, though in another dress,</P>
    <P>And as the evening twilight fades away</P>
    <P>The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day.</P>
    <P>The elderly built this economy and they deserve the support and resources we can give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and commend him on his excellent contribution, which says much about the kind of person he is and the amount of hard work he invests in his brief. I do not say that lightly, because I have heard similar comments from nurses and doctors who hold the Minister of State in high esteem.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan concluded with a quote and I will commence by doing likewise. I do not know who originally uttered the words, &ldquo;Those who drink the water should remember those who dug the well,&rdquo; but I rather like them. As the number of older people in Ireland rises, we should never forget the role they played in building the economy from which we benefit today. The Minister of State has recognised that contribution and is fully committed to improving their lot now that they have come to the autumn of their lives. He is determined to ensure that they enjoy their latter years.</P>
      <P>From a health perspective, the cornerstone of policy is to keep older people living in their own homes for as long as possible. Research has shown that this is the preferred choice of older people. When researching this matter, I spoke with a person from the North Western Health Board who referred to the CHOICE programme. The latter offers a choice to older people to decide where and how they want to be cared for. The North Western Health Board runs this programme very successfully and increasing numbers of aged and elderly people in its area are staying at home. There are not concerned about nursing homes or subventions. All they want is to be left in peace and quiet in their homes, whether they are large, medium or small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been found that these people are more independent and retain a greater sense of dignity <Col N="1084" />by staying in their own homes. What impresses me most is that the health board has built up the home base for elderly clients. Development money has been invested in the provision of home help and day care centres. We are all familiar with day care centres. I grew up in Tullamore in the midlands and each day we passed the county home on our way to school. One would dread seeing the high wall and being told that was where old people would end their days. However, the care administered in day care centres is second to none.</P>
    <P>Like everybody here, I have been at any amount of day care centre openings, particularly in County Sligo, from Skreen, Easkey and Tubbercurry to the one in my own town, Sligo &ndash; St. Anne's, which is a wonderful success story, about which I would like to tell the Minister of State. It is set up in St. Anne's Youth Centre in the middle of a corporation housing estate but the elderly have services of which they can avail every day. They can also walk to the church, the post office and the hospital. They have access to all the amenities that are important to them, which we take for granted, to which we can drive or walk or which we can visit every few months but to which they find it important to get to every few days, or perhaps on a weekly basis. They can now do this from the day care centre.</P>
    <P>While I recognise and appreciate the wonderful funding the Minister of State has provided for respite care, I ask him not to take his eye off the ball and continue to fund respite care for the elderly. I look at people who go into the day care centre and will then hear they are spending perhaps a week or two in hospital. The carer looking after them at home is getting the break and their problems are being picked up in the day care centre. They may not be picked up if they were left at home with somebody elderly looking after them.</P>
    <P>I received correspondence from the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal yesterday and was interested to see the figures for the essential repairs grant which can now cover up to 90% of the approved cost of the work to be done. The maximum grant currently stands at &euro;8,467 compared to a figure of &euro;1,143 in 1998. That is a wonderful incentive and great initiative. In 2000 we extended the special housing aids for the elderly to make provision for suitable heating for the elderly. These are administered from the community care section of the health board.</P>
    <P>Without ignoring another health board, I have great ties with the Midland Health Board. While I have to support my own in the north-west, I never forget where I came from. I was delighted to hear the Minister of State talk about innovative measures and ideas taken on by health boards. When I went home at the weekend, I had received a copy of <i>Senior Times</i> in the post, which I am sure all my colleagues also received. I was delighted to read an article about the Midland Health Board and Music Network, which operates out of Dublin Castle, which have come <Col N="1085" />together to plan for the future in what they see as an innovative way to provide not just health care but also social care for elderly clients. They do this through music, dance and art. When I spoke to somebody there today, they said theirs was a pilot scheme but they had now incorporated it into the day-to-day running of the service. This is the third phase of the scheme. We talked about elderly people suffering from dementia. Apparently, when they hear a piece of music, whether it be set dancing or traditional ballroom dancing, the men and women involved immediately get up, are activated and encouraged. The music brings them back. They may not have spoken or been active, yet something like a piece of music can trigger whatever it is in their minds that brings them back to where they might have been ten, 20, 30 years ago. There is nothing as emotional as to see an elderly person who may be confined to a chair wanting to get up and move. It gives them great dignity if they can enjoy something they enjoyed many years ago and which can now come back into their lives. While it enhances their lives, the right environment has to be created. I heard a lovely story, also about the Midland Health Board, in which Hugh Tinney came to Mullingar with a piano that cost &euro;75,000 and entertained, free of charge, elderly clients.</P>
    <P>I was particularly touched when the Minister of State talked about elder abuse. I say, &ldquo;Well done.&rdquo; I am glad the interdepartmental group has highlighted elder abuse and made it one of its key issues. I was very touched last week when, like many of my colleagues, I heard the Marian Finucane radio programme in which an elderly lady talked about being being duped by con men in her house. We are all very familiar with this. Those of us living in the west would be no different from those on the east coast. I am glad the Minister of State met the Garda Commissioner. These are horrible crimes against people who have served the State well and should be living their final years in tranquillity but instead are almost prisoners in their own homes because of people like this. I would like to think that the Minister of State will keep whatever it is going that will eventually get rid of such crimes.</P>
    <P>I liked the language the Minister of State used. He talked about &ldquo;positive ageing&rdquo;, &ldquo;maturity&rdquo;, bringing a &ldquo;new lease of life&rdquo;. That is very important and the message we need to send to the elderly. We welcome the allocation of &euro;100.5 million to date that the Minister of State has provided for services. While I hope I have many years to go before I will be elderly, I also hope the structures the Minister of State is trying to put into place today will still be in place for him and me when we are in the chair with a little blanket over us, and that wherever we might be we can enjoy some of this. Again, I say, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the Minister of State and the Government for the commitment they are making to the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to her recent election to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I understand Senators Feeney and Feighan began with a quote. I think it was Kofi Annan who said about two years ago, &ldquo;We will all be old some day, with a bit of luck.&rdquo; The elderly are a particular category to whom we owe a massive debt of gratitude for what they have done for us and for the way in which they have contributed to what we know now as a civilised society, one that obviously needs improvements in many areas. We would not have what we have today without them. They established many years ago the standards, fundamentals and principles of our health care and educational systems. It is particularly important that we, as legislators and public representatives, should not forget them.</P>
      <P>The population trends show that the number of older people in our society is increasing rapidly for which there are a number of supporting demographic figures. European figures show that by 2050 over half the population of Europe will be above retirement age. The Central Statistics Office estimates that by 2031 over 200,000 Irish people will be over the age of 80 years. All of these figures point to the need for immediate planning, not just for the present cohort of the elderly population but for future levels. This requires good planning and a long vision for which we can hope to prepare by putting in place systems that will be of assistance to elderly people in catering for their needs.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other issues to which we have to face up, apart from the ageing population. First, there is the fact that people are living much longer and, second, the number of full-time family carers is diminishing. The costs of long-term care are escalating at a rate which is alarming to say the least. It is also essential to bear in mind that serious staff shortages in the health service have a detrimental effect on the health of elderly people, in particular. When we mention waiting lists, for example, we tend to think of ourselves but we should not forget that these failings impact most seriously on our elderly population.</P>
      <P>I did some minor research, because this is not my area, and found some interesting articles and statistics in an insightful publication, <i>Ageing Matters,</i> published by Age Action Ireland. One of the more alarming findings came from a SIPTU nursing conference held recently in Limerick. It related to the Society of St. Vincent Paul paying for private medical care for a person in south Dublin. This person would have had to wait a long time for a public bed, but the local branch of St. Vincent de Paul came to the rescue and paid for this elderly person's private treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case involved an elderly person with gangrene and other ailments who had applied to <Col N="1087" />the local authority for a special bathroom. This person, whom I assume had a terminal illness, had a life expectancy at the time of one year, and was told by the local authority that the provision of the required bathroom would take at least 12 months. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul came to the rescue, and that was wonderful.</P>
    <P>These are very serious issues, reflective perhaps of the current financial situation and the priorities of the Government collectively in terms of where funding is going and where cutbacks are being made. We recently had a debate in this House on the carer's allowance, and I believe the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, was in the House that evening. The figures and statistics were there for all to see. There are over 200,000 carers in this country, and if the Government is seriously committed to services for elderly people, this is a fundamental area which must be looked at. My own party and other political parties have campaigned for the abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance. If it were abolished, potential carers would take up the role and help those who need their services. Some organs of the health service are being propped up by carers, and in order to maintain the numbers of those taking on the job, a root-and-branch reform of the scheme is essential. Innovative measures should be taken by the Government to ensure that older people have carers as they get on in years.</P>
    <P>One of the more interesting ministerial titles is &ldquo;Minister for Health and Children&rdquo;. The title speaks volumes. The Government might look at the idea of having a Minister for the Elderly. This would show it is seriously committed to this section of society and would also ensure that a special Department would be set up to look at their needs and put the provision of services for elderly people on a statutory footing. That is not an easy thing to do, but it would highlight a serious commitment by the Government.</P>
    <P>EUROSTAT findings indicate that Irish people fare worse than Europeans in terms of poverty among older people, with poverty for older single people the worst in Europe. The findings show that the general risk of poverty for single older people in Europe is 27%, while in Ireland it is 62%. During my research for this debate I found that, in particular, single older women were more likely to be poverty-stricken than single older men. That is a worrying feature.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the current situation in the health services. It is essential that when the people who built this State, who put together what we now enjoy today, need to call on health services, there is a decent service available for them. It will be a damning indictment not only of Government but of society in general if this is not the case.</P>
    <P>There have been many debates relating to levels of pension payments to elderly people and a watchful eye needs to be kept on the area. Elderly people need to be looked after by the State <Col N="1088" />and I urge the Government and the Minister responsible to continue this approach. The next time we are approaching a budget, let us dig in there. When Champagne Charlie wants to initiate cutbacks again, let the Minister of the relevant Department for once stand up and say that this will not happen, because these particular demands for funding are for the elderly people in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon" hpid="Mr. Scanlon Mr. Scanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his elevation. There is no doubt he is a hands-on Minister and is making improvements and changes.</P>
      <P>The policy of Fianna Fáil in Government is to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with the wishes of older people themselves, as expressed in many research studies. The policy is to restore to independence at home those older people who become ill or dependent, to encourage and support the care of older people in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies, and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.</P>
      <P>In Ireland there are more than 900,000 people aged 50 or over, 11,000 in county Sligo. In the past the growth in the number of older people has been referred to in negative terms. While old age has been associated with dependency, the vast majority of older people are healthy and independent. Our aim in Fianna Fáil is to provide improved services benefiting an older population whose contribution to Irish society is fully acknowledged by this Government.</P>
      <P>Additional revenue funding of more than &euro;26 million has been announced for 2003 for services for older people, including palliative care services. Between 1997 and 2001, total additional funding allocated was &euro;168 million, which has enabled over 1,300 additional staff being recruited for these services.</P>
      <P>From 1998 to 2001, over 550 additional beds have been provided in new community nursing units and over 1,250 day places per week have been provided in new day care centres. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Coughlan, recently announced that work on the development of pilot public private partnership programmes for community nursing units for older people has begun in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board areas. These developments will ultimately provide about 850 additional public long-term care beds for older people in such units and thereby take some of the pressure off the acute hospital sector where older people who are fit for discharge are sometimes inappropriately placed in acute hospital beds because of shortage of community nursing unit beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with considerable investment in health board facilities and community care, substantial additional resources have also been made <Col N="1089" />available for the nursing home subvention scheme. As Members will be aware, the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, under which subvention regulations were made, has two principal objectives: first to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered under the Act, and second to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care will have access to such care. Additional funding of &euro;87.8 million was made available in 2002 for further development of the services, including enhancement of the nursing home subvention scheme, provision of additional home helps, improving community based services and other services provided in community hospitals and day care centres, additional respite care and support for carers.</P>
    <P>It is expected that 4,500 people will benefit from changes in the carer's allowance coming into effect this week. Changes in income disregards will see 1,700 new carers qualifying for a payment and 2,800 existing carers receiving an increased payment. A single person can now have an income of &euro;210 per week and a couple can have &euro;420 per week, without affecting their payment. These improvements will make a real difference to carers. For example, as a result of the changes, a couple with two children and earning &euro;24,000 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. Such a couple, earning nearly &euro;40,000, will still get a payment, including the respite care grant.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the valuable and unheralded work done by carers whom this Government has committed itself to helping. In the programme for Government, it pledged to expand the income limits for the carer's allowance so that all those on average industrial incomes could qualify. These improvements are in line with that promise and are welcome. While any Minister would like to raise the income limits further, that has to be done at a rate the country can afford.</P>
    <P>The task force on special housing aid for the elderly, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has made an initial allocation of grants totalling &euro;11 million to health boards for essential repairs to houses occupied by elderly persons living on their own. In 1997, the allocation for the task force was a little over &euro;5 million, with approximately 3,000 jobs completed in that year. In 1998 and 1999, with allocations increased to over &euro;6.3 million and &euro;7.6 million respectively, a further 6,500 jobs were undertaken.</P>
    <P>As adequate heating was considered to be a key requirement for the health and well-being of elderly persons, the scope of the scheme was extended to include the provision of suitable heating systems in 2000 and, with an allocation of over &euro;10 million, some 3,600 jobs were carried out. In 2001, funding of &euro;10.99 million was provided and over 5,200 jobs were completed. In 2002, &euro;11.9 million was provided and, by end of June, the latest date for which figures are avail<Col N="1090" />able, over 2,500 jobs were carried out. Over 47,000 applicants have had repairs carried out to their homes under the scheme since its introduction. I am delighted with the effectiveness of the scheme in helping elderly people to continue to live in their own homes in as much comfort as possible.</P>
    <P>A few years ago, I had the privilege of being a member of my local branch of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. At that time, elderly people were being assaulted and robbed in their homes. There was a voluntary housing scheme, which I believe is still there, under which we applied initially for 12 houses and, a year later, 16 houses. In my home town, there are now 32 houses which were grant aided under that scheme to the extent of 80% for the first scheme and 90% for the second scheme. That includes 16 one bedroom houses and 16 two bedroom houses in this development, Cuan Íosa. Approximately 48 people are now living in this haven of peace. We were very fortunate in obtaining a site close to the local nursing home, church and railway station. The occupants of those houses were previously living alone, in terrible housing conditions in very isolated places. I believe that scheme should be more widely promoted. I know from experience the difference it has made to the residents of that estate. I invite the Minister of State to visit the estate whenever he is in Sligo. It is well worth seeing.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has always prioritised the needs of the elderly. It is our mandate to guarantee a decent quality of life for all of our people, but especially the elderly who built our country and to whom we owe so much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan" hpid="Mr. J. Phelan Mr. J. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am glad of the opportunity to make a few points on this important issue. As the Minister of State may be aware, there is no designated home for the elderly in Kilkenny city, although it is an issue which has been used by political parties over the course of many elections, with repeated promises being made. The last election was no exception, when outgoing Members on the Government side committed to the provision in Kilkenny city of a home for the elderly. Currently elderly people from that city are accommodated either in Castlecomer or Thomastown, in the absence of any facility within the immediate catchment area. That situation has dragged on for too long. It is an important issue which is liable to affect most people at some stage and it should be finally put to rest.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing, to say the least, that the Celtic tiger years have passed without provision being made for a home for the elderly in the city of Kilkenny. I urge the Minister of State, as a new man in the Department, to look at this issue with a view to having action taken on it as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the carer's allowance. It is disappointing that this scheme is still means tested. I believe the role of carers in <Col N="1091" />society is generally acknowledged. They provide a vital service in keeping family members at home rather than in hospital facilities, thereby saving the State substantial sums of money while caring for their loved ones. It is regrettable that better provision was not made during the boom period of the past six years. I acknowledge that improvements were made, as outlined by Senator Scanlon, but the situation is still not good enough. The opportunity existed for the Government to tackle that issue seriously, but it was passed up.</P>
    <P>Senators and other public representatives will be familiar with the grant systems available through health boards and local authorities for housing and other schemes. However, there is not enough money available in most local authorities to meet the demand. In Kilkenny, the list of applicants for the disabled person's grant stretches a couple of years into the future. Commitments were entered into last year in anticipation of this year's money, which was already allocated even before we received it. People were in urgent need of funding for essential adjustments to their homes. It is disappointing that funding for such a vital scheme was not beefed up to a much greater extent.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of other schemes, including housing aid for the elderly. They are good schemes and serve their purpose up to a point. A few weeks ago, I met a woman who had applied for the disabled person's grant. As she is in her nineties, much as I regret to say so, she may never live to see her grant come through, even though she urgently needs to have essential repairs carried out to her home. That case illustrates the reality and I find it extremely disappointing. No doubt the Minister of State is also disappointed. I urge that something more should be done in terms of allocating funds to those schemes. In the &ldquo;bread and butter&rdquo; aspect of politics, it is my view that we should not be in the positions we hold unless we can help people who cannot help themselves.</P>
    <P>Kilkenny city and its catchment area include some 20,000 people but there is no health board operated home for the elderly in the city. The issue is continuously booted around as a political football by all parties. I would like the elderly of Kilkenny city and surrounding areas to have a facility close to where they live. There are few public transport links between Kilkenny, Castlecomer and Thomastown. Therefore, it is not easy for relatives to visit elderly people in the homes. Public transport for the elderly must be prioritised. Other Senators have also referred to this issue. Great work has been undertaken by rural transport groups in conjunction with local authorities to provide improved public transport within villages and districts to local towns. There had not been a public rural transport service in recent years, yet it is vital for elderly people who do not have access to a car because it provides them with a facility whereby they can do their shopping, collect their pensions or meet their <Col N="1092" />friends. Good work has been done in Kilkenny which is important for the future of the rights of elderly people. While improvements have been made, I urge that continued efforts be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan" hpid="Mr. K. Phelan Mr. K. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on his speech and the excellent work he is doing in this area in such a short space of time.</P>
      <P>A number of ancient cultures held their elderly in great esteem. In times of difficulty it was the elderly of various communities who were asked to guide their people through. During the years the position of respect that the elderly occupied has been diminished in the eyes of society, which is to our shame. At times it seems that at least some aspects of society view the elderly as a burden. Instead of taking advantage of their vast skills and talents, certain sections of society are more likely to ignore them.</P>
      <P>Whether this section of society is ignored, the fact remains that, as a group, elderly people are going to increase as a proportion of society over the next few decades. As matters stand, there are more than 900,000 people aged over 50 years. With advances in medical science in the provision of health services, Irish society will soon have more elderly people than ever before. With this in mind, we can be thankful that the Government has not shared this negative view of the elderly. The present and previous Governments have rightly cherished the role the elderly have played in making this country what it is and the role they continue to play as it develops further.</P>
      <P>The Government has put more money than ever before into projects devoted to the elderly. Funding for services for older people increased from &euro;12.7 million in 1997 to &euro;87 million in 2002, including nursing home subvention. In addition, over &euro;270 million has been provided for services for older people during that period covering a wide range of services, including home help services, nursing home subvention schemes, support for carers and voluntary organisations, the opening of new community nursing units, aids and appliances, development of dementia services and funding of day care centres. Senator Scanlon referred to the successes of voluntary housing and housing for the elderly. In Rathdowney, County Laois, a 28 unit scheme, Cuan Bhríde, has been an enormous success and helped to sell the scheme throughout the county in Ballinakill, Portlaoise and Mountmellick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also been responsible for ensuring equal treatment for the elderly through the introduction of the Equal Status Act 2000. It is fair to say no other Government has been as concerned about the rights of the elderly and their place in Irish society as a whole. Senator Feeney described some of the more recent developments and initiatives taken by the Government in greater detail. The healthy ageing programme should provide an even greater level of support for those who may no longer be in the prime of their life but who are also adding considerably to <Col N="1093" />the State. The National Council of Ageing and Older People will also help to identify and address more of the problems that the elderly face.</P>
    <P>Under the Government, there has also been a change in focus from long-term care to community care which has had a huge beneficial effect on the lives of a large number of our elderly citizens, enriched their lives and boosted their esteem a great deal. This was only possible because of the extra funding made available, which facilitated aids and appliances for older people and allowed them greater freedom of choice. We need to respect the dignity of elderly people. We should not be content with those sections of society who would like to lock elderly people away in nursing homes, content to let them wilt away as age continues its relentless march. We must put in place even more measures that will ensure the elderly are maintained as pillars of our community and that we encourage their involvement in all aspects of society at every level. It is for this reason that I am glad the Government has put in place the measures it has. We have ensured more and more focus is put on innovative measures that will be of benefit not only to the elderly but also the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State and the Government for the work they have put into elderly issues and urge them to keep it up. The Minister of State is doing tremendous work. I have no doubt that his efforts alone have achieved great progress in the last 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am glad the Seanad has devoted time to discuss this important matter. The Minister of State will be aware that the Western Health Board area has the highest percentage of ageing population of any area in the State. This creates huge problems for the health board, in particular, which has to deliver services for the elderly and whose responsibility is greatest. The most important thing the Government could do is recognise &ndash; as the Minister of State suggested &ndash; that this is an interdepartmental problem and that all units of government must work together to ensure a decent quality of life for elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest problems elderly people experience is isolation. While we might identify isolation as a rural problem, it affects urban areas, too. Many in our towns and cities are terrified <Col N="1094" />and prisoners in their own homes. Likewise, in rural Ireland, gone are the days when relatives and neighbours provided transport for the elderly to town, the shops or the post office because society is geared up for the occupants of most houses to be working. Children are in care like the elderly.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties to which the Government must face up sooner rather than later is the fact that when relatives offer themselves to care for their elderly family member, neighbour or friend, no impediment should be put in their way to provide such care. The sooner we tackle this problem and all that goes with it in terms of carer's allowance the better. We must be conscious of the fact that many people who provide care in the community are doing so an a voluntary basis because they are afraid to accept payment owing to the fact that they will be taxed on it or it may render them over the limit in relation to other entitlements.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State must ensure that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rows in behind him on this. I pay tribute to the work of the Garda Síochána in rural areas in particular in providing a service to many elderly people on a community watch basis. No other scheme deserves more support. Elderly people who apply for alarm and safety systems should be granted them automatically. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Elderly people applying for alarm systems which would provide them with security and safety in their homes encounter a great deal of red tape in doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has changed the system of policing in rural areas in that there is no longer an identifiable presence of gardaí on the beat in the community. They are patrolling areas in cars and are not in the local Garda stations, something to which the elderly had become accustomed. That scheme needs the Minister of State's financing and support.</P>

      <P>I agree with the remarks made by Senator Ulick Burke regarding threats of crime in rural areas. This is a major issue. I visited an elderly person the other night and had to wait at least half an hour until they removed the barricades from the door to allow me into their house.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I received representations to go and see them. I telephoned to say I would be arriving half an hour earlier than expected. On <Col N="1095" />arrival, I had to wait for them to remove the barricades from the door in order to get into the house. They live this way because of the threat of crime in rural communities. There are fewer gardaí on the beat and elderly people are afraid in their homes. We have witnessed, time and again, elderly people being attacked in their homes. This situation is grossly unfair. No just society would allow this to happen. The Government should be called to order by everybody in the country.</P>
      <P>Those who worked through the awful years to build this State are now, in their declining years, forced to worry on a daily basis about the cost of living, repairs to their homes and the frightening level of service charges. Years of plenty, when Champagne Charlie&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not appropriate to refer to a Minister in that fashion. The Senator should take note of that. He is in the House of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take note of it. Politicians living their lives to the full did not do anything to make an impact on the conditions and lifestyles of these disadvantaged people. It does not take much to notice that the Minister continues to party while these people make up the shortfall.</P>
      <P>Society's most vulnerable are paying for the Government's wasteful mismanagement of the economy, which has led to the funding in the budget for essential community projects &ndash; such as day care services for the elderly who, in many cases, are effectively confined to their homes &ndash; being slashed. Shame on the Government parties &ndash; Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &ndash; which are not willing to take on the real issues of elderly and disabled people living in inaccessible or inappropriate surroundings.</P>
      <P>We cannot tolerate blatant discrimination against our elderly and disabled citizens. Exchequer shortfalls are not the problem of these people and should not be rectified at their expense. It is time that the Government stopped expecting the disadvantaged to bear the brunt of its mismanagement. It is a tragedy that there are considerable shortfalls in funding for essential repairs and disabled persons grants, which add to the lengthy waiting lists for nursing home subvention. I raised this issue three weeks ago and on the Order of Business last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many county councils have run out of money for the disabled person's grant and are currently, instigating reviews of the scheme, if they have not already done so. This means that people with disabilities are disadvantaged even further. What is happening is a blatant failure of the Government to cater for and properly manage facilities for our elderly and disabled. Carers are expected to work around the clock taking care of elderly or disabled relatives while the Government has the audacity to means test the carer's allowance. We were promised that allowance would not be <Col N="1096" />means tested yet it remains so. To allow this to continue is a shame on society. In a country experiencing cutbacks across the board, many of which impact on the elderly, is it not obscene that a steel spire has been erected at a cost of &euro;4.6 million? Where are our priorities? In a damning indictment of the Government &ndash; allied to the lack of care for the elderly and disadvantaged &ndash; that, seven days a week, there are more homeless people in Dublin than in London. Homelessness is at an all time high, with 6,000 people on the homeless list. Eradication of waiting lists is a priority.</P>
    <P>Following the recently experienced and most prosperous period in our nation's history, we should be able to say that the weakest and most needy benefited to the greatest degree. I plead with the Minister of State to do his best on behalf of the elderly and to rectify the situation whereby the Government is failing to allocated funding to local authorities. Directors of services are notifying public representatives that there is no funding available. This issue must be rectified.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Before I take any lectures on discrimination from any side of the House, I must state that other parties were given opportunities to increase old age pensions and to make facilities available to the elderly. They failed dismally when they had those opportunities. Let the record speak for itself, the facts are there and I do not have to reiterate them. Not only do I recognise that those parties failed dismally, but the Irish people recognised it also when they practically scuttled the total Opposition in the last general election.</P>

      <P>By 2020, one in four of all European Union citizens will be aged 60 or over. Sharp increases in life expectancy have been followed by substantial falls in fertility rates. This means that fewer people will be working to generate resources to meet the needs of an ageing population. This has caused panic and scaremongering in some quarters regarding society's ability to cope with the change.</P>
      <P>In developing any policy, we need consultation and education. There are concerns that people of all ages need to be aware of issues and policies related to ageing. We need to build a stronger older peoples' movement and recognise that people have competing priorities. In this regard, I congratulate the Senior Citizens' Parliament, representatives of which I have met on a number of occasions, on the work it has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" />Absence of consultation with older people by policy-makers and service providers is a recurring theme. Consultation should be considered an integral part of any service or policy initiative. This lack of consultation has had a serious negative impact on the quality of provision of services. In the process of consultation, providers of services need to be sensitive to the fact that older people are women but that most decision-makers are men.</P>
    <P>Older people identify good health as their top priority. The EU supports the importance of promoting preventative approaches, stating that it will minimise the need to expand clinical and care services and will be more advantageous financially than medical technologies, which paradoxically tend to increase overall spending. We need increased commitment for ageing well. Mental health of older people needs increased resources and further research, supporting the integration of mental health services and primary health care using a holistic multi-disciplinary approach.</P>
    <P>Carers have been mentioned and I too want to put on record how valued carers are in society. Carers need access to good quality information and advice as well as flexible support services and respite care. There is a perception among older people that there have been substantial reductions in the level of domiciliary care provision. That the perception may be explained in part by the fact that resources do not meet demand, even though real expenditure has increased in the last decade. With an ageing population the demand has also increased. The delivery of services by different health boards is uneven, and to maintain high standards of care in residential homes an even more rigorous inspection system is essential.</P>
    <P>Carers, as Senators stated, save the health service millions of euro each year, yet support for them is seen to be grossly inadequate. The burden of care has fallen largely on women who often receive little support from their own extended family. To promote the role of the carer, health services should work in partnership with families, the needs of carers should always be assessed at the same time as the person being cared for, and carers should receive appropriate support to develop stay-at-home care.</P>
    <P>It is commonly recognised that, for a variety of reasons, less family support will be available in the future. The issue of whether the State will be able, or willing, to compensate fully for such a change is of vital importance to succeeding generations of older people. Research and appropriate planning for such an eventuality are crucial.</P>
    <P>Available, affordable and accessible public transport is what members of the older community require and there is almost universal dissatisfaction with the present provision, particularly in rural areas. Greater partnership in identifying the transport needs of older people is required. Unused resources such as school buses should be looked at.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" />Senators have referred to the many worthwhile housing schemes for the elderly which are better in some areas than in others. Currently housing is not being designed properly for older people, giving them the right to retain the choice of where they live. Future planning needs to take account of the divorce rate, with its consequence of there being more single older people.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the area of security and of older people living in large houses, which are normally their main asset, when in effect schemes should be looked at to transfer this asset into a means for provision of care in their later years. I want to highlight an instance recently where an elderly person wanted to go into a type of sheltered housing. I could not get her on that housing list because she owned her own house, a substantial asset. She wanted to hand over the house to the local authority, which could have accommodated a large family. All she wanted was to be put on a list, but that could not be done until she sold her asset and went into some type of temporary accommodation. We must adopt a degree of flexibility in approach and we must be more serious and pro-active in facilitating people who have a substantial asset and who actually want security.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking aspects of the elderly was brought home to me while campaigning before the general election when I engaged in lengthy conversation with a woman at a doorstep. She was very proud of her family, and spoke about them all and how well they had done, and I of course asked where they were living, etc. She would not give away the game as she was so proud of them, but the reality was that these people were so busy with their own lives that she was lonely. The loneliness of elderly people is something which we, as a society, must face up to. It is not only politicians who must face this. This is about the principle of community, of neighbourliness and of supporting those around us.</P>
    <P>In some areas initiatives have been developed to provide both practical help and reassurance to older people and a range of possibilities exist such as befriending schemes, which I advocate, home safety information seminars, and identifying individuals who would benefit from regular checks or calls by the community or the police and arranging for these. Community associations should be encouraged to take on specific schemes to deal with the elderly. We must also provide further grants for safety items for the elderly and establishing neighbourhood networks.</P>
    <P>The opportunity to enrich their own lives and those of other people is a fundamental priority with many older people. Without volunteers the social fabric would be strained to breaking point, and many who work for and with the elderly are themselves older persons. While Government recognises this, this recognition needs to be translated into more concrete support. Volunteering should complement and support &ndash; not replace &ndash; statutory services. An agreement between <Col N="1099" />Government and statutory agencies and volunteer groups should be formalised to identify and clarify various responsibilities and obligations.</P>
    <P>Life-long learning &ndash; LLL &ndash; needs to be attractive, accessible, affordable and enjoyable for older people. Its value to the individual and for the wider community is unquestionable. Older people have considerable experience and knowledge, and this wealth of skills remains relatively untapped. Certain questions remain to be answered for LLL to be put into practice in any meaningful way. In the recent past, for example, the older community have been denied access to funding on the grounds that they are not economically active. Older people need to be represented directly on the various bodies which carry forward the LLL proposals such as colleges, third level institutions and institutes of technology. The provision of courses should be drawn up in consultation with the older community.</P>
    <P>We all touched on the issue of residential care and the greater demand, not only because of the increase in the numbers of older people but due to changes in our society. Modern living does not allow for families to provide full-time care for their parents. This is a cultural change in Ireland and it is something we must face up to. We have to refrain from promoting residential care for all and try to get a balance with adequate places and supports for those remaining in their homes.</P>
    <P>No one is in favour of openly discriminating against people on the grounds of age, as respect for older people needs to be the principle to guide our actions. Nonetheless ageism is a major problem, with many older people left with low self-esteem and a feeling of worthlessness.</P>
    <P>To be consulted is to be valued and consulting the older community makes practical sense. Ageing issues need to be reflected in the school curriculum. This would not only help to change attitudes but also alert people at an early age to the need to think and plan ahead. I would advocate that the Internet, for example, should be used to link students with older experts to facilitate problem solving, and to engage them and provide that sense of friendship and support, giving that sense of being worth something which young people want to communicate with them. Older people need to become more assertive because unfairness, misrepresentation and ageism must be challenged. In addition, the agenda of the aged must be put forward in any future proposed equality legislation.</P>
    <P>Greater help for the hospice movement is a cause I fully support. The philosophy of relieving pain in order that people can live until they die is one we should all support. Older people do not want to thrive at the expense of others. They want the opportunity of continuing to share their knowledge, skill and experiences to the benefit of all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his detailed statement to the House on <Col N="1100" />the many achievements of the Government in recent years. The cornerstone of all our policies is to keep our elderly people living in their own homes and within their own communities. I pay tribute to the elderly for the contribution they have made to the State and also to the carers whose voluntary work makes possible the standards in which our elderly live today.</P>
      <P>I am involved with two voluntary housing associations providing 40 units in my area. As many speakers have pointed out, there should be some flexibility in regard to the qualifications for these schemes. People's circumstances may change a number of times throughout their lives. The voluntary housing sector has been a success story over the last 20 years. A partnership between the Minister's Department and local government to deal with issues affecting elderly people living in voluntary housing associations would be welcome. There is a crying need to cater for those who came in at 65 years and are now in their 80s. Voluntary beds for nursing home care could be provided as part of those complexes. They already qualify for grant assistance from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the provision of these units. Grant assistance from the Department which provides those beds would make it possible for elderly people to live out their lives in housing associations. I ask the Minister of State to consider a pilot scheme in this regard.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members of the House for their contributions which were very much appreciated. I greatly appreciate the kind sentiments expressed by a number of Members about my own commitment and level of work. I am taking my brief very seriously. I have hit the ground running and those speakers who listed issues of concern to them should watch this space. As I mentioned, there has been a sea change in the provision and delivery of services for older people in my Department. My outlook is very positive. I have begun to look at elderly people in a different light than heretofore, when they may have been considered a burden on society. We should acknowledge that older people have a tremendous amount to give to society. I also acknowledge that the current economic climate we enjoy in Ireland today was built in no small measure by the people concerned. They have given a full contribution to the country and it is, therefore, appropriate that we ensure support services are in place when they may require them.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the attendance in the House of Mr. Duggan, my principal officer, Mr. Brady, my assistant principal officer and Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Phelan from my office. This indicates the level of interest in the contributions of Senators and the level of commitment in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Brennan was quite right in that there has been a lot of progress. The issue of voluntary housing is one on which I am working with the <Col N="1101" />Department of the Environment and Local Government and my interdepartmental group. I would like to see more progress in this area. As time passes Senators will be impressed with our progress.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan made a number of suggestions that should be considered. These matters are under consideration: a number of the schemes he mentioned are already under way. The Senator also referred to an incident in which an elderly person wanted to return a house &ndash; a valuable asset &ndash; to the local authority in lieu of senior citizen accommodation. There is a scheme in place that would meet the needs of the person concerned. If the Senator wants more information, I will be happy to give it to him. He also mentioned the area of transport. The Department of Transport has a number of schemes in which the Senator would be interested. Again, if he would like more information, I would be happy to provide it.</P>
    <P>I echo the Senator's sentiments in regard to the need for consultation. A number of the elderly network groups now introduce me as the Minister who has been here before to meet with us. My approach since my appointment has been to engage in widespread consultation and meet every single group. I started with the voluntary sector and moved on to statutory groups such as the NCAOP and then to professional groups working in the area of older people. I have undertaken widespread consultation across the board.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon mentioned a number of issues. I do not want to be political about this but he seems to have a lot of incorrect information. If he wishes to have factual and correct information, my officials will be happy to brief him fully on the tremendous progress made in the delivery of existing and additional services. It is something of which we should be proud. This and the previous Government have been very progressive in the amount of additional services put in place. It is regrettable that there are people who are not aware of how much good work has been done. I offer the Senator an invitation to ask for clarification on any issue. I will be happy to arrange it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to a number of issues. The security of the elderly is an issue I have taken up with the Garda Commissioner as recently as this week, when I had a very fruitful meeting with him. I do not want to pre-empt what my officials and his will come up with but when I report back to the House, the Senator will be quite impressed. Areas mentioned by him such as community policing will be included. I also remind him of the rural initiative undertaken by my colleague, the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>Senator Kieran Phelan is correct that there has been a change of focus from the institutional setting to the community. This is of great benefit to the elderly as they can stay in their communities with the appropriate supports and it ensures they are integrated in the manner they desire, most of the time keeping their dignity in their own homes. This is the manner in which I wish to advance, <Col N="1102" />with additional supports for older people. The Senator is quite correct in the number of developments he mentioned.</P>
    <P>Senator John Phelan may be aware that I had planned a visit to Kilkenny in the past two or three weeks to undertake part of my consultation process. Unfortunately, because of the death of a senior and long-standing public representative on the day in question and after consultation with some officials I thought it appropriate that the trip should be cancelled. The visit to Kilkenny will come back on the agenda as soon as my officials arrange it.</P>
    <P>The rural transport issue was mentioned and earlier I referred to the rural transport initiative. The disabled person's grant for a woman in her 90s is a matter for the local authority, which needs to ensure an appropriate mechanism is in place to deal with priority cases. In answer to a point raised by Senator John Phelan, I have checked with Niall Crowley, chief executive officer of the Equality Authority, who has indicated that discrimination, whether positive or otherwise, should not exist. In the case referred to by Senator John Phelan, it may be appropriate for a statutory authority to have positive measures in place whereby priority can be given to an older person. I would be appalled to think that a local authority would not prioritise a lady in her 90s who requires appropriate alterations to her home and needs to avail of a disabled person's grant. I invite the Senator to bring the case to my attention if he feels it can be of benefit to do so.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the kind comment Senator Scanlon made about my hands-on approach to my Department and the additional resources. I will take up the Senator's invitation to visit a voluntary housing scheme. I would ask him to make the necessary arrangements with my office and I look forward to seeing him on his home turf.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy referred to the disabled person's grant and skills shortages in the health services. Great progress has been made by my interdepartmental group, which is considering streamlining all the grants and looking at areas where skills shortages exist as well as the current process of applications. We are considering innovative and creative ways to remove those obstacles.</P>
    <P>Senator McCarthy also paid tribute to the Government for appointing a Minister of State with responsibility for children, an office which has been in existence for a number of years. The good news for the Senator is that, for the first time, the Government has appointed a Minister of State with responsibility for services for older people whose brief spans a number of Departments. What the Senator sought is already in place and much progress has been made.</P>
    <P>I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Feeney, for her kind comments, which are much appreciated. I particularly welcome her comments about respite care and day care. I concur with her view that tremendous work is being car<Col N="1103" />ried out by the providers of care at various levels throughout our community. I am delighted to hear the comments about the hospital to which she referred. The points she raised about the essential repair grant and the elder abuse will be considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan referred to a number of issues, particularly those relating to transport, that are under consideration. I am pleased to note his comments about employment, a matter on which I have strong views. It is wrong to tell a garda of 57 years of age that he can no longer continue to work on the force. It is wrong to tell people at 60 or 65 they should not participate further. Of course we should be cautious and indicate that we will accommodate those who wish to continue, at whatever level, to participate in the labour force on reaching normal retirement age.</P>
    <P>I intend to consider the feasibility of removing what might be seen to be financial and other obstacles preventing people who may have pensions or secondary benefits from taking up employment which might bring them above the relevant level and result in their losing some of their benefits or bring them into a tax net and result in their being penalised. These matters will be considered by my interdepartmental group. Some progress has been made, but more needs to be done. The good news is that the employment aspect is being actively considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Feeney also raised the issue of respite care and I share her concern. We should continue to ensure that adequate respite is in place at all levels. As she stated, it is vital that older people are supported in the home and the carers of older people who occasionally require breaks are able to tap into respite care.</P>
    <P>The issue of carers was mentioned. I work closely with a number of the carers' associations. I am also putting in place appropriate funding. As far as I am aware, I have met every group representing older people. I have asked them to work with me in the most appropriate fashion. It is my desire, and that of my officials and the groups we have met to date, to bring about the sea change I mentioned with regard to the provision, delivery and availability of services.</P>
    <P>I am looking at demographics and the current age profile. I recognise that the vast majority of older people who have made a tremendous contribution to the country's economic success are independent and have very positive attitude towards ageing. They continue to make extraordinary contributions to our society. There are a number of people who, as they age, may periodically require appropriate supports.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to point to the Bealtaine festival organised by the Age and Opportunity network group, which is all about active participation in the community. I support many of the other active retirement associations' participation programmes and projects. While we can focus in a positive way on that aspect, it is important to remember the facts and figures I presented earl<Col N="1104" />ier which indicate the level of support we are putting into the appropriate services when they are needed and called upon.</P>
    <P>I hope to be able to return to the House at some stage to give a further statement on the Government's policies on the provision of services for the elderly.</P>

      <P>Well over a year ago, on 31 January 2002, I raised in the Dáil the issue of decentralisation for Newcastle West, Kilrush and Listowel. At the time the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, indicated that he was not in a position to state when decentralisation would occur. In his Budget Statement of December 1999 he announced that he would embark upon a new and radical programme of decentralisation, thus transferring the maximum number of jobs. In the mid-west region towns such as Nenagh and Ennis have benefited from decentralisation. Like Newcastle West, they are both about 25 miles from Limerick city. The people of Newcastle West are entitled, therefore, to be disappointed as decentralisation has not happened. During the years there have been job losses in Giro, Neodata and Kostal. In addition, the town lost its Objective One status which acted as a disincentive to potential industrialists. Although it has developed as a satellite town of Limerick city with a consequent dramatic increase in housing &ndash; in many cases, much of the town's population commutes to outside areas &ndash; there is a strong feeling that it has not benefited as much as it should in attracting appropriate industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recent decision of Shannon Development to establish a business park which should help to attract industry in future. Newcastle West submitted an original proposal for decentralisation which was supported by the community council, Limerick County Council and business interests. In order to enhance the submission, Shannon Development supported a proposal which included not only Newcastle West but also Kilrush and Listowel. I am aware that officials in the Department of Finance were impressed by the submission which pointed out the good community, education and leisure facilities in the area. There is easy access to railways, airports and universities, in addition to the Limerick and Tralee institutes of technology. I am confident the submission which embraced the three communities of Newcastle West, Kilrush and Listowel was an excellent one. It made a strong case for decentralisation which would provide a strong economic stimulus to these areas. I <Col N="1105" />appeal to the Minister of State to ensure favourable consideration is given to this submission and look forward to his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Decentralisation is an issue of keen interest to many Members of this House. I, personally, have always been an advocate of decentralisation and I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to address the issue on the Adjournment. The Government's commitment to introducing a new programme of decentralisation is evident in the commitment made in An Agreed Programme for Government in which we undertook to move forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies, taking into account the national spatial strategy aimed at ensuring all regions develop to their potential.</P>
      <P>It has been clear from the outset &ndash; this is something the Minister for Finance has reiterated in the Dáil on many occasions of late, in reply to parliamentary questions put by a number of Deputies &ndash; that there is a wide range of important issues which must be taken into consideration before arriving at a decision. I appreciate that a new programme of decentralisation will be a matter of great significance and trust that this House will, therefore, appreciate the reason the Government is determined that a decision should be taken only after proper deliberation. Given its importance and the level of interest in the issue, it is unfortunate that consideration of the many and varied issues involved has taken longer than had originally been anticipated.</P>
      <P>Some 120 urban centres in every county have expressed interest in being part of the new programme, with each and every case receiving consideration. It has been necessary to consult widely with staff, departmental management and other interests. I share the Minister's concern that the deliberations which precede a major decision such as this should reflect the genuine concerns of all those who will be affected by a new and comprehensive programme, be they staff concerned about their future or departmental management concerned about the delivery of public services for which they have responsibility.</P>
      <P>There are important lessons to be learned from previous experience of decentralisation. There is a clear determination that those lessons must not only be learned but also applied. Towns and cities to which departmental offices have previously been decentralised were selected having regard to the desire to promote regional development, economic growth and the creation of a more even spread of public service jobs around the country. These criteria are equally applicable in the context of a new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is also conscious of other issues which may impact on the success of a new programme such as proximity to third level education facilities, convenient access to Dublin, the scale of particular offices being relocated and availability of services. The Government is particularly determined that any large-scale pro<Col N="1106" />gramme should do nothing to compromise the efficient delivery of public services. To that end it invited the SMI implementation group to contribute its views as to the most efficient way to proceed. These views will be of considerable use and assistance in informing the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious of the calls being made upon him, and other members of the Government, to use the vehicle of decentralisation to address job losses in various parts of the country. Like many others, I appreciate the concerns of Senators in this regard but know that Members of this House will realise that the influences on a Government decision are many and varied. It is not as simple as listing off a series of qualifying criteria against which the merits of various towns can be measured. The case for the inclusion of Newcastle West, Listowel and Kilrush has been well articulated. A huge effort has gone into the preparation and presentation of a number of cases in respect of various towns throughout the country. The efforts of so many in this regard deserve appreciation and I wish to pay tribute to all those concerned. Unfortunately, what I cannot and will not do is confirm that any one town or area will be included as a definitive part of the programme. The Government is committed to developing a coherent and comprehensive programme and to make any announcement at this time would only serve to undermine this approach.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator for having raised this topical issue which is of great interest both inside and outside the House. I am pleased to have had this opportunity to restate the Government's position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1958 a tax was introduced on benefits-in-kind but at that time canteens were excluded from the provision. However, because employees earning less than £1,500 at the time were not liable to benefit-in-kind tax, employees on an ordinary wage were not affected. As inflation increased, however, the £1,500 limit did not and, therefore, more ordinary workers became liable to pay the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1965 the Revenue Commissioners introduced a practice whereby meal vouchers up to a limit of three shillings were, by concession, not liable to the benefit-in-kind tax. This maintained an equity between employees in organisations which had canteens and those which provided meal vouchers instead. The terms of the concession for meal vouchers ensured the voucher was non-transferable, used for ready-to-eat meals <Col N="1107" />and generally available to employees. This prevents any abuse of the concession. However, as neither the limit of three shillings &ndash; which became 15p with decimalisation and 19 cent when we changed over to the euro &ndash; nor the £1,500 limit was adjusted for inflation, the treatment has become more unequal. An employee who is able to get a meal in a canteen has gained substantially over one who is provided with a meal voucher.</P>
    <P>This unequal treatment will be made worse by the provisions in the Finance Bill whereby it is proposed to introduce PRSI on benefits-in-kind, as employees provided with canteens will still remain exempt. It is almost certain that employers, both in the public and private sectors, currently using meal vouchers will cease to provide them in future. This inequality is borne by employees in smaller companies or those who work unsocial hours where it is uneconomic for an employer to provide canteen facilities. I will now provide a list of countries showing when their relevant laws were last updated, with the relevant exemption limits.</P>
    <P>Austria last updated its law in this area in 1994 and an exemption limit of &euro;4.40 applies, Belgium increased the exemption limit to &euro;4.44 in 1998, the Czech Republic increased it to &euro;1.52 in 2002, France increased it to &euro;4.60 in 2001, Germany increased it to &euro;3.10 in 1999, Greece increased it to &euro;2.70 in 1995, Hungary increased it to 80 cent in 2002, Ireland increased it to 19 cent in 1965, Italy increased it to &euro;5.29 in 1998, Luxembourg increased it to &euro;5.60 in 2001, Poland increased it to &euro;2.30 in 1998, Portugal increased it to &euro;5.93 in 2000, Slovakia increased it to &euro;1.71 in 2002, Spain increased it to &euro;7.81 in 1999, Switzerland increased to &euro;4.74 in 2004 and Turkey increased it to &euro;4.44 in 2002.</P>
    <P>One can note from that list the ludicrous position in Ireland in regard to these vouchers, with the value of one voucher being only 19 cent. The law providing for these vouchers has not been updated since 1965. In addition, injustice will now be heaped on those 30,000 people who benefit from these vouchers by categorising them as a benefit-in-kind under the budget. I ask the Minister of State to seriously examine this matter and to readjust the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Senator is referring to the announcement by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2003 in connection with benefits-in-kind. In this regard, the Finance Act 2003, together with corresponding provisions in the Social Welfare Act 2003, provides for the direct application of PAYE and PRSI to benefits-in-kind with effect from 1 January 2004. The effect of this measure is that employer-provided benefits such as cars, loan accommodations, subscriptions to health insurance schemes and sports clubs and vouchers &ndash; including luncheon vouchers, bonus bonds, etc. &ndash; which are all currently liable to income tax, will, from next year, be brought within the PAYE system and, therefore, <Col N="1108" />be subject to employer and employee PRSI and health levies as well as income tax. The application of PAYE and PRSI to benefits-in-kind is the norm in most EU countries.</P>
      <P>This treatment of benefits-in-kind from 1 January 2004 will be in line with the procedures for charging tax, PRSI and levies on normal wages and salaries. The measure will serve to reduce the effect of salary substitution schemes which may be introduced to avoid or reduce the payment of tax or PRSI. Evidence that this practice was growing was part of the reason the Minister for Finance announced this change in the budget. It will make the system fairer because it will ensure that remuneration, from whatever source, will be treated the same way for the purpose of income tax, PRSI and levies.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners will draft the necessary administrative regulations for employers in respect of the practical implementation of this change. Publication of these regulations will occur well in advance of the January 2004 introductory date and will, therefore, facilitate those involved in updating payroll systems.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue raised by the Senator, the strict legal position is that the value of luncheon and other meal vouchers is chargeable to tax. However, an administrative concession was agreed in 1965 to exempt the value of luncheon and other meal vouchers provided by an employer for his or her employees where the value of the vouchers did not exceed three shillings for each workday. For all years up to and including 1986-87, where the value of the voucher exceeded that amount per day, the full value of the voucher was chargeable to tax and not just the excess. Following representation made in 1987, the concession was extended to provide that where the value of the voucher exceeded that amount per day, then only the excess was to be regarded as taxable in the hands of the employee.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made over the years to increase the amount, now 19 cent in euro terms. However, it was not considered desirable to extend the concession any further because to do so would give employees in receipt of luncheon vouchers an unfair advantage over employees without such benefits. It should be noted that the benefit for the employee of not taxing such vouchers fully is, at most, 8 cent per day.</P>
      <P>With the application of PAYE to all benefits-in-kind from 1 January 2004, it may be necessary to review this particular concession as part of the detailed consideration and discussion with employers and others on implementation measures. Whereas the use of vouchers in 1965 was limited, their usage today is widespread and covers a broader range of items. Any extension of the concession in respect of luncheon vouchers could lead to request for similar concessional treatment for other vouchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is aware that canteen facilities provided by an employer for employees are exempt from benefit-in-kind tax, however, a move now to enhance the exemption for lunch<Col N="1109" />eon vouchers is inappropriate in current budgetary circumstances when the emphasis is on base broadening and protecting the tax base. A concession on luncheon vouchers is likely to lead to other such concepts evolving over time at the expense of the State's tax revenues. As stated earlier, the growth in such practices was part of the reason the Minister for Finance introduced the changes in the treatment of employer provided benefits in the first instance.</P>

      <P>My Adjournment Matter concerns recent media speculation about the Luas flyover facility at the Red Cow roundabout. It was originally proposed that a flyover for motorists to gain access to the park and ride facility on the Naas Road would be provided as part of the programme. Recent media speculation seems to suggest that the planned flyover will not now be built and that in its place there will be a filter traffic light to divert traffic across three lanes of the Naas Road into the park and ride facility.</P>
      <P>Those who are familiar with this junction will be aware of how chaotic it is at the best of times. It is probably the busiest junction in the country. In many respects it is unfortunate that the Luas line is crossing the Naas Road and not part of a flyover. The possible decision not to provide the planned traffic flyover for the park and ride facility would make what is a bad situation much worse. I tabled this matter to inquire from the Department the exact position regarding the provision of the park and ride facility on the Naas Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister wishes to thank Senator John Phelan for raising this important issue and for providing me an opportunity to advise the Seanad on the progress on the Luas to date and in regard to the facility at the Red Cow roundabout.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment at the end of 2001, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, has taken over statutory responsibility from CIE for the Luas project, which involves the provision of a light rail system on lines from Tallaght to Connolly State and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green. The development of light rail schemes is currently undergoing a rejuvenation with the construction of a number of schemes underway in mainland Europe and in a number of UK cities. In Dublin, major progress is being made on the construction of Luas and at this stage we are confident that it will compare very favourably with the rest of the current systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luas is the first light rail system to be constructed in Ireland. It is also the first major public transport infrastructure to be constructed in Dublin since the DART some 20 years ago. The Minister has no doubt that it will prove as popular and attractive to Dubliners as has the DART. It will <Col N="1110" />also reintroduce the people of Dublin to a tram network that was so familiar to many generations.</P>
    <P>The introduction of Luas alone will not solve all our congestion problems, but it is an integral part of the plans to revitalise Dublin's public transport system. Other initiatives under the national development plan such as the DTO's Platform for Change and the recently published strategic rail review have been and will continue to be put in place in our efforts to attract more people to the public transport system.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made on the construction of both Luas lines. First, the depot at the Red Cow is complete and has been fitted out. Second, the 26 trams for the Tallaght line have been delivered and are being tested and commissioned at present. Third, construction of the depot at Sandyford is also complete and fitting out is taking place. Fourth, the first four 40 metre trams for the Sandyford line have been delivered and the ten remaining trams will be delivered during the coming months. Almost all the utilities and enabling works have been completed and the RPA's property acquisition programme is at an advanced stage. Over 50% of track work has been completed to date and the test tracks at the Red Cow and Sandyford are in place. Structures such as bridges are in the course of construction on the Sandyford line, in particular, and evidence of progress is to be seen right along the line.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there has been some slippage in the projected completion times for Luas. The Minister has urged all the companies involved, in both the public and private sectors, to do all in their power to ensure there are no further delays in order that the earliest commencement date is achieved.</P>
    <P>The RPA has projected commencement dates of August 2004 for the Tallaght to Connolly Station line and June 2004 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line. These dates allow for a period for trial running, testing, commissioning and staff training. The Minister has asked the agency to provide detailed monthly briefings on the timetable and the implications for the overall budget as the project progresses.</P>
    <P>When operational, Luas will form part of an integrated public transport system for Dublin. Provision of suitable park and ride facilities is an essential feature of the success of the light rail project. Parking for approximately 2,400 cars will be provided at five locations at strategic points on both lines. A major park and ride and bus interchange facility will be provided adjacent to the Red Cow stop.</P>
    <P>The application for the light rail order for the Tallaght to Abbey Street line envisaged that the entrance to the Red Cow park and ride facility would be from the existing road network. The matter was discussed at the public inquiry and the findings recommended that the access arrangements should be agreed between the body responsible for Luas, then CIE but now the Railway Procurement Agency, and the local auth<Col N="1111" />orities. Failing agreement between the bodies, the matter was to be determined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the grant of the light rail order, studies were carried out by the State agencies involved to consider options for access to the park and ride facility. Consideration was given also to the National Roads Authority plans to upgrade the M50-Naas Road junction and all the bodies involved agreed that the solution arrived at should both minimise the impact on traffic at an already busy stretch of road, as the Senator pointed out, and facilitate bus interchange as well as park and ride facility access. Without compromising these objectives, the bodies have also been examining the solution that provides best value for money.</P>
    <P>The Minister is conscious of the need to put in place as a matter of urgency a cost-effective structure that provides easy access to cars and buses without adversely impacting on traffic in the Red Cow area. Therefore, he has appointed <Col N="1112" />an independent adviser to work with the State bodies involved, the RPA, the NRA, the Dublin Transportation Office and South Dublin County Council, and to report to the Department with options for progress within a number of weeks. The Minister is confident that the proper approach will be taken to providing access to the Red Cow park and ride facility and that this will contribute to making Luas the success we all expect it to be.</P>
    <P>Once again, I thank the Senator for raising this issue. Luas will make a positive impression on the lives of those who use it and contribute towards solving the traffic problems we are now experiencing. We are confident that the RPA and all the relevant State bodies will take all necessary steps, in conjunction with its contractors, to ensure the Luas services are up and running at the earliest possible date in 2004.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.55 p.m. until 10.30&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, 16 April 2003.</P>
