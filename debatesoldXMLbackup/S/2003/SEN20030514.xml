      <P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to outline the up-to-date position on the Clondra sewerage scheme, County Longford, with regard to early approval of the design review report submitted by Longford County Council to the Department on 19 February 2003 in order to facilitate commencement of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, Redundancy Payments Bill 2003 &ndash; all Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business until 4 p.m. and, if not previously concluded, to resume after Private Members' Business at 8 p.m. and conclude not later than 9 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time; No. 2, Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 4 p.m. and conclude at 6 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time, the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage at approximately 5.50 p.m.; and No. 13, motion No. 30, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <P>As we informed the Leader in private discussions, the Fine Gael group is in favour of taking all Stages of the Redundancy Pay<Col N="1442" />ments Bill today and has provided the latitude the Government requires to get the Bill through the House. The amendment tabled by my colleague, Senator Coghlan, the only substantive amendment proposed by either side of the House, would extend the rights provided for in the Bill to at least four other companies. Given the degree of flexibility we have shown, I ask the Government to consider accepting the Fine Gael amendment as it would greatly improve the Bill. Will the Leader make this point to the relevant Minister when he or she speaks to the Bill later? </P>
      <P>I draw the attention of Senators to the Local Government Bill, on which the House had a substantial debate around a month ago. I understand the Bill will clear all Stages in the Dáil later today and may come back to this House at a later stage due to a small technical amendment. The Leader is well aware of the balances established in the Constitution on the rights of the Dáil, Seanad and President. The President has, within our constitutional framework, a right to refer Bills which are suspect, either in part or in whole, to the Supreme Court for a final determination. Given the degree of doubt concerning the Government's plans to abolish the dual mandate in the Bill, I ask the President, through this assembly, to consider&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear precedent in this area by which any Member of the Oireachtas can make a request that the President consider referring a Bill to the Supreme Court to determine its constitutionality. There is no difficulty with my request. It would make sense for all concerned if a final determination on the constitutionality of the Bill was to be made by the Supreme Court, should the President so determine. She has shown tremendous latitude and expertise and I am sure she will show the same in this and future cases.</P>
      <P>I support and welcome a proposal made during the teacher union conferences to extend an allowance already available to teachers working in the Gaeltacht to teachers working in disadvantaged communities. I ask the Leader to take up the matter with the Minister for Education and Science. It is difficult for communities to stem the haemorrhage of teachers from disadvantaged schools. We must consider a special allowance for teachers in those communities to ensure a large number of qualified and trained teachers stay. There is an allowance for Gaeltacht areas which should also be available in disadvantaged communities. I ask that this proposal be put to the Government.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is agreeable to us. I suggest that the Leader take note of what Senator Brian Hayes said about Senator <Col N="1443" />Coghlan's amendment to the Redundancy Payments Bill.</P>
      <P>The summer is upon us and the fish kill season will start before we know where we are. However, nothing has happened about the nitrates amendment. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the House to discuss this serious issue? I gather that Commissioner Fischler has said there will be a problem getting agricultural payments because of the delay in bringing forward this amendment. The earlier it is brought forward the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business. However, when we agreed to it, we were under the clear impression &ndash; it was not the Leader's fault &ndash; that the Redundancy Payments Bill would be retrospective and apply to a few cases of recent redundancies. I want to make it clear that the Leader did not behave in any way other than impeccably. We would not have agreed to the Bill being taken with such urgency if we had been as clear as we are now about the breach of promise by the Tánaiste and the clear and deliberate deception she entered into with the workers in Castlecomer in which she told them one thing but has now done the exact opposite. That is not the way to do business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that to the Government, not the Leader who behaved impeccably in this matter.</P>
      <P>There was an appalling atrocity in Riyadh yesterday. All democratic Governments must do two things. We must deal with the problem of terrorism but we must also ensure the response to it is not so ham-fisted, clumsy and disproportionate that it encourages further terrorism. That is the reason I want the matter discussed here. Many of us are beginning to realise that the consequence of each military attempt to suppress terrorism, whether in this country or worldwide, is to generate further terrorism. Some of the issues which fester in the world and on this island are not justifications for terrorism. However, if we want to deal with the type of popular feeling which encourages terrorism, we must deal with injustice in the world. I would like to have a debate in the House on what is driving people to the type of extreme activity we saw yesterday, which is reprehensible and wrong. Putting civilians at risk, whether deliberately or as collateral damage, is immoral and wrong. I would like to discuss the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Government for clarification of its position on public private partnerships. In my home city a major educational project, the Cork School of Music, is being held up allegedly because of difficulties with the concept of public private partnerships, yet on radio this morning I <Col N="1444" />heard the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform talking about building a prison using public private partnerships. I do not have any problem with the proposal to build a detention centre for young people because it is long overdue. However, I do have a problem with the reason it is not possible to build the Cork School of Music using public private partnerships, particularly if it is possible for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to say he will build a prison less than one week after I heard the Minister for Education and Science explain the problems. I would like the issue of the Government's position on public private partnerships debated and clarified in the House once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the last point made by Senator Ryan, as the Senator is aware, that matter was discussed by the Joint Committee on Education and Science. It was made clear by the Minister that the problem related to the terms of the growth and stability pact, not public private partnerships. I asked that question at the committee and the Senator was present when the Minister made those remarks. I am surprised he commented in the way he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard exactly what the Minister said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>My other point relates to a request which might be made to the President with regard to the constitutionality of a Bill. It is normal for Members during the passage of a Bill through the House to make comments on the constitutionality or otherwise of various sections or the Bill as a whole. However, it is still the sole prerogative of the President.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate for the House to call on the President. In addition, if she decides to refer the Bill, you, a Chathaoirligh, as a member of the Council of State, will be involved in that decision. I am sure you will be able to convey whatever views are made in that regard.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Dardis: That is not what I gathered from what the Senator said. I stand by my remarks.</P>
    <P>As regards the nitrates directive, certain local authorities have delayed introducing guidelines. However, it would be wrong to suggest that nitrates are responsible for fish kills. As an angler, I am aware that it is more likely to be phosphates or sources of pollution emanating from the agricultural industry and local authorities. However, that does not take from the point Senator Henry made.</P>
    <P>It would be desirable for the House to mark the Special Olympics by a debate or some other means. I was surprised by the report that the Irish Nurses Organisation had stated nurses would require payment for the work they would do during the Special Olympics. Given that they are based on a huge national voluntary effort, I am surprised by that decision. Perhaps an inquiry could be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Mr. Finucane: As regards the bombing of several compounds in Riyadh, expatriates live in the compounds, including an Irish population of 1,500 in Riyadh alone. There are 2,000 Irish people in Saudi Arabia. Some 15 of the 17 suicide bombers who participated in the atrocity on 11 September 2001 came from Saudi Arabia which appears to be an al-Qaeda hotbed. What is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Consulate in Riyadh doing to ensure the 2,000 Irish people in Saudi Arabia are protected? Are there contingency plans because of the increasing turbulence in the area? When the bombers bombed the compounds, they did not discriminate against American, British or Irish citizens. Their actions were against the expatriate population in Saudi Arabia. What precautionary measures are being taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    <P>Mr. MacSharry: Would it be possible to ask the Tánaiste to come to the House for an urgent debate on the insurance issue? While I appreciate that we will have an opportunity to discuss motor insurance this evening, I would like a debate on insurance generally but particularly public liability insurance. It has come to my attention &ndash; I am sure other Members have heard about it from constituents &ndash; that many important community based festivals and activities are in jeopardy this summer due to prohibitive public liability insurance costs. It would be appreciated if the Tánaiste could come to the House without delay for an urgent debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported wholeheartedly the Local Government Bill which was intended to abolish the dual mandate. I was entertained by the squawks from some who, even when they grudgingly accepted the abolition, wanted to be able to hand on their seat to their spouse. That is an amazing feudal system in a republic. As regards the legality and constitutionality of the Bill, the President is a fine lawyer. Among her other qualifications, she was Reid Professor of Criminal Law at Trinity and practised at the Bar and is well able to determine whether a Bill may contain constitutional flaws. It is my understanding that any Member of the House can make such a suggestion and, under the Constitution, if two thirds of Members of the House &ndash; in concert with the Dáil &ndash; oblige her to do so, she must comply. I respectfully suggest that the Seanad has a role to play in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>While what happened in Riyadh was an appalling catastrophe for the people and families involved, it was only too predictable in light of what happened in Iraq. In that context, No. 13, motion 29, in the name of the Independent Members, refers to the moral obligation of the so-called allies to provide medical and rehabilitative aid to the members of the civilian population they injured in the course of the war. I was advised yesterday that there is a legal obligation to do so under the fourth Geneva Protocol. I support Senator Ryan's view that as long as there is injustice in the world, there will be this kind of festering sore and inappropriate violent expression of unease at injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Brian Hayes in respect of teaching in disadvantaged areas. I am aware that there is an ongoing turnover of staff in that area and this is, for many reasons, unsatisfactory. Will the Leader provide for a debate on disadvantage in education? Many of the issues to which Senator Brian Hayes referred might be discussed in such a debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Members will be aware that yesterday, the High Court decided to refuse the application for costs by the McBrearty family in respect of their presence at the Morris tribunal. The High Court judgment is one of the most sympathetic I have ever read. The judge said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>. . . I do this with great regret, as nobody could but have sympathy for the parlous position in which the applicant and his family find themselves. . . . If there was any way in which a point could be stretched in relation to the various issues I have had to decide, so as to find that the position of the applicant and his family was so different as to not require me to follow the decisions to which I have referred, I would have been prepared to do so, not just in the interests of the applicant, but in the interest <Col N="1447" />of the Tribunal itself. I say this because it seems to me that if the applicant does not have the benefit of the services of solicitor and Counsel for the duration of the Tribunal&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Senator, but it is not in order to read long quotations on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. I will merely read the final line of the court's judgment into the record. It states:</P>
      <P>. . . However, the Government has refused to assist the applicant, the legislation does not permit the Tribunal to assist ahead of making findings, and the case-law does not permit of an exception in the applicant's case. . .</P>
      <P>The judge is quite clearly stating that while he and the tribunal do not have the power to award the kind of costs sought by the McBrearty family, the Government does have such power. Previous Administrations did so in respect of the Stardust tribunal and the blood tribunal. It has also been done by the UK Government in respect of the families who went before the Bloody Sunday inquiry.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to before the House, as a matter of urgency, in order that we might re-examine this matter? Our Constitution guarantees equality of treatment for all, but there is no equality of treatment in how this family is being treated.</P>
      <P>Most Members will welcome yesterday's decision by the regulator to overturn the decision by An Post to foist roadside letterboxes on communities throughout the country. The company has obviously lost sight of its remit in respect of its social agenda. The postman is often the only person with whom elderly people in rural areas come into contact each day. The arrogance of the company was underlined by the fact that it proceeded, without permission from the regulator, to purchase 500,000 letterboxes at a cost of &euro;10 million. It is clear that, for a company that is so cash-strapped, it has obviously lost the run of itself. There is a need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come before the House to outline if he, as the main shareholder, was consulted in respect of this daft decision.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Leader of the Opposition in respect of the Local Government Bill and I fully support Senator Dardis in terms of his reply in that regard. If there is a shadow of doubt regarding the legality of the Bill, I am sure <Col N="1448" />the President, in her wisdom, will refer it to the appropriate authorities.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Norris regarding the spouses and families of locally elected representatives throughout the country. Such families have represented the electorate, on a voluntary basis, with distinction. I resent his remarks and ask that he withdraw them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Higgins's plea to the Government to look closely at yesterday's High Court judgment on the McBrearty affair. I refer, in particular, to the specific point he raised in respect of the Government's responsibility and duty to ensure that any citizen who finds themselves in the same position as the McBrearty family can be guaranteed the right to be supported in terms of engaging legal representation.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Dardis raised the issue of the Special Olympics and how we should mark the occasion. The most appropriate way we could do so would be by bringing forward the Disability Bill as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only should we bring forward that Bill, we should ensure that it includes a rights-based approach to disability. Those with disabilities, whether physical or intellectual, must be guaranteed a legal right of redress and should not, as was the case in the original legislation, be left exposed or vulnerable. I look forward to the publication of that Bill. I ask that the Leader inquire, on behalf of the House, as to when it will be forthcoming. It is appropriate that we should deal with it before the commencement of the Special Olympics.</P>
      <P>On the Local Government Bill, we should be clear in our support for the principle that we, as Members of the Oireachtas, should have the right and the entitlement to put a plea to the President, through our contributions in the House, to consider examining an item of legislation. We have done so on more than one occasion; we did it in respect of the freedom of information legislation. While it is entirely at the President's discretion to decide how to deal with such a request, the principle of our making it is important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for the Seanad to mark the Special Olympics and I agree that the introduction of the Disability Bill would be an appropriate way of doing so. It is important, in symbolic terms, to stress that the Special <Col N="1449" />Olympics are about more than games; they involve allowing people to express their full potential and encouraging others to develop a consciousness of the needs and dignity of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>On Senator Higgins's point regarding the payment of costs, there is no question but that the court has decided the position and that the tribunal is correct in stating that it cannot award costs until the end of the process. I was involved in such a tribunal in the past. There is nothing to stop the Department undertaking to pay those costs. That would not require any great change in the law. The problem could be solved if the Department was prepared to accept it could award costs because the people involved are central to what is happening.</P>

      <P>It is seldom the Department of Health and Children receives an offer of $4 million. The latter is a rare occurrence. In light of the current crisis in health, will the Leader intervene with the Minister for Health and Children and Comhairle na nOspidéal and seek a response in respect of this matter? Professor Patrick Kelly has, for three years, been waiting for a response from the Minister for Health and Children in respect of his magnanimous gesture to pay $4 million towards the cost of providing equipment and the installation of a neurosurgical unit in Galway. This offer cannot, in the current climate, be rejected. I ask the Leader to plead with the Minister to issue a quick response. We have only two such units &ndash; one at Beaumont Hospital and the other in Cork. Good practice necessitates that two hours is the maximum overland journey for which this service is appropriate. All areas in the Western Health Board lie within two hours travel of Galway city.</P>

      <P>I share Senator Higgins's concern about An Post services. However, as a member of the Communications Workers' Union, and that union's nominee to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Seanad I believe it is important that we get the full picture in terms of what is happening. I ask the Leader to contact the regulator in order to ensure that there is a level playing pitch. At present, a European company could establish operations here and deliver post in urban areas. However, An Post is expected to deliver to all rural locations. All that is requested is a level playing pitch which will allow people to trade on similar terms. As matters stand, that is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Higgins in complimenting the communications regulator in not allowing An Post to provide roadside letterboxes. There is a genuine fear and a feeling of inconvenience in rural communities with regard to the safety of people's post in such boxes. What concerns me greatly, however, is the proposal to introduce two-tier postal charges. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come before the House to assure Members that a two-tier system of postal charges will not be introduced. The Minister should also take action regarding the closure of approximately 500 rural post offices. The latter is being achieved by stealth in many counties. Since Christmas, I understand that six rural post offices closed in County Longford. Action must be taken on this matter. There is no other provision made for elderly people who depend on the rural postal service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the current peace process in Northern Ireland has reached somewhat of an impasse, the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement still prevails. There is enhanced political and cross-Border communication at local and business levels. However, there is one impediment to enhanced cross-Border co-operation at business level, namely, the &ldquo;roaming&rdquo; mobile telephone charges that are incumbent on business people. If we are to discuss gateway status between Derry and Letterkenny and the establishment of a linear business park there, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should intervene with his counterpart in Northern Ireland in the interests of reducing the charges to which I refer. By travelling five miles and crossing the Border, one can incur extra charges. We must facilitate a more harmonised economic baseline for the type of co-operation to which I refer.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Redundancy Payments Bill, I agree with Senator Ryan's point, specifically because of the situation with the assurances given to the workers of the Comerama plant in County Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>In regard to the matter raised by Senator Higgins, it would be both discriminatory and anti-rural if what Mr. Hynes proposed in respect of a two-tier pricing system in regard to postal services in urban and rural areas. I do not believe anyone in the House wants that to proceed. I am sure the Leader will take that on board.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, the Leader promised that she would, if possible, arrange a debate with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance regarding the proposed sell-off of surplus State assets. It is important that we pursue this matter in terms of the chronic shortage of land for local authority housing, particularly where local authorities can show that the transfer of such land to them would help reduce their waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the horrific explosion in the compound in Riyadh, the Department of Foreign <Col N="1451" />Affairs needs to take urgent action. I spoke to one Irish citizen &ndash; an airline crew staff member &ndash; last night who was injured in that explosion. She had to be moved to hospital and was lucky to escape with her life. As Senator Finucane stated, the mad people who perpetrate these acts do not care who are in the buildings they target. There may be American citizens there, but there may also be Irish citizens present. We need to take action immediately because these people are not safe.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the sentiments expressed by Senator Higgins in respect of An Post and the provision of postboxes and the discontinuation of traditional deliveries by postmen or postwomen. With regard to post offices closing, it has been my experience that two situations obtain: first, in many circumstances people did not support their local post offices by using them to obtain their pension payments, television licences or postage stamps and they did their business elsewhere; and, second, no one would take over the operation of post offices. With regard to the latter point, for example, when a post office approximately four miles from Mullingar closed down, I could not find anybody who would show an interest in taking it on. That is the other side of the coin.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced that he is considering the establishment of a reserve Garda force, which would be made up of approximately 1,200 voluntary people, to patrol the streets. We have heard many proposals from the Minister recently. On each occasion the Angelus bells ring, he seems to get divine inspiration. I again ask that the Minister come before the House to outline his proposals on this reserve force. A few weeks ago, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, suggested he would set up a special traffic corps, only then to discover it would be unconstitutional. Has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform investigated his suggestion properly to discover whether the reserve Garda force would be unconstitutional?</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister should come before the House to debate these matters and also the situation in prisons. Yesterday, the Prison Officers' Association said that the timeframe for the Minister's proposals for reform is unacceptable and unmanageable. It is important that this matter be dealt with or we will have a crisis in our prisons.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senators Brian Hayes and Ryan on the Redundancy Payments Bill. As the only Kilkenny man in the Seanad, I wish to make special reference to the Comerama plant in Castlecomer to which Senator Coghlan also referred. I was present at a number of meet<Col N="1452" />ings where commitments were entered into which, apparently, will not now to be honoured. Castlecomer has been an unemployment blackspot since the closure of the coal mines there in the 1960s and 1970s. With the closure of the Comerama plant, it is imperative that commitments entered into by the Tánaiste should be honoured by the Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to ask the Leader about a report in today's newspapers by a Garda review group which seems to suggest that the number, currently 44, of 24-hour Garda stations in Dublin will be significantly reduced as the review progresses in the coming years. It is highly inappropriate that, at a time when such public order problems exist, any review of Garda resources would seek to close any existing 24-hour Garda stations in the capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the spokespersons of the various parties who have agreed the timeframe for dealing with the Redundancy Payments Bill. Senator Brian Hayes spoke about the amendment which his colleague, Senator Coghlan, has tabled, which I note and have read. I am sure Senator Coghlan will make a spirited espousal of the amendment during the debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also expressed his personal view, as I accept he has every right to do, that the President should refer the Local Government Bill to the Supreme Court. Interestingly, this morning I was reading a 1959 review of the Seanad in which it was stated &ndash; a point later taken up by Senator Norris &ndash; that two thirds of the Members of this House had the right to request the President to undertake a particular course of action. I have no doubt that the President has the ability and acumen to be able to deal with matters as they come to her or to him.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also brought up the extension of the special allowance payable to teachers in the Gaeltacht area to teachers working in disadvantaged areas. I think this came up at the INTO conference over Easter. Senator Fitzgerald also brought up the matter. It is a very good point.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned that the fish-kill season was upon us. She also talked about the nitrate directive and other harmful chemicals which in overabundance can lead to dramatic fish-kills. It is very a fair point.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the atrocities in Riyadh which made awful and tragic viewing. There is no doubt that violence breeds violence. While that has always been the case, it is horrific the way violence occurs with such regularity. We should endeavour to organise a debate on foreign affairs in the light of what is happening and will clearly continue to happen in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan also brought up the question of public private partnerships and I was glad that my colleague, Senator Dardis, referred to it. I was interested in the debate which took place which I listened to and watched on the in-house television service, and there is no doubt that finance in gen<Col N="1453" />eral is the problem, along with sticking to the stability pact parameters. We were led to believe, however, that the difficulty lay in the public private partnerships, on which, taking Senator Ryan's main point, there should be a debate. It has become the mantra, &ldquo;Everybody is in favour of them&rdquo;, but no one knows much about them. We should have a proper structured debate on the issue and I will seek to have one. I thank Senator Dardis who was also at the meeting of the joint committee for his comments on the matter. We understand the point made by Senator Brian Hayes who was speaking for himself in a public forum which is perfectly understandable.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane mentioned the 1,500 Irish people living in Riyadh &ndash; there are some 2,000 expatriates in all living in Saudi Arabia &ndash; and asked what arrangements were being made for them. We will try to get the Department of Foreign Affairs to brief us on the issue next week.</P>
    <P>Senator MacSharry asked that the Tánaiste attend the House to discuss the general issue of public liability insurance, a matter which comes up all the time. Everybody one meets has the same story. There are loads of events planned for the summer and autumn which cannot be held, and when one inquires as to the reason, one is told that the cost of insurance is huge. We telephoned the office of the regulator this morning.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris rightly said the President was both learned and eminent in law. He also brought up the events in Riyadh and the need for a debate on foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald agreed, for which I thank him, on the matter of an allowance for teachers working in disadvantaged areas and called for a general debate on disadvantage in education.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins referred to the McBrearty family. Is that the matter before Judge Morris?</P>

      <P>Senator Higgins also raised the issue of post boxes in rural areas. I was thinking about the regulatory issue, of which the Senator is well aware, also this morning as Cathal McCoille put the regulator under intense pressure but she held her own, on which I say, &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; to her. I agree with the Senator. I want to know who paid for the post boxes. Have they been paid for? Can one send back 500 or 5,000 boxes, or whatever the number was? I doubt if one can because they were made to measure.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris said it would not be egalitarian to bring in one's spouse or a relation to represent one if the dual mandate was abolished. However, Senator Brennan made the very fair point that it was the members of one's family who answered the telephone and door, took notes and looked after all the various matters associated with being a representative. In many cases they could very fairly represent the person retiring.</P>

      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes also wanted to mark the Special Olympics. He also said &ndash; I think he is right &ndash; that the relevant Department could intervene in the non-payment of fees to members of the McBrearty family to enable them to attend the tribunal.</P>

    <P>Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the offer of &euro;4 million for a neurosurgery unit. I am indebted to Senator Mansergh who used the phrase that we should fear Greeks bearing gifts. He even gave me the Latin version, <i>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.</i> I wonder if there are ties to such an offer. <Col N="1455" />No matter in what Department I served, I was never lucky enough to meet a benefactor who was willing to give me &euro;4 million to underpin some part of my Department. It would be fine if the offer came with no ties and if there was no other agenda &ndash; perhaps it has given that a neurosurgery unit is involved &ndash; because, as Senator Ulick Burke pointed out, there are two centres of excellence in Beaumont and Cork. It sounds like a very noble donation but I imagine there is an underlying reason for it. Perhaps I am just being miserly about it but I will ask the Minister the reason he is refusing it.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin defended An Post, those who work for the company, the members of the Communications Workers' Union and stressed the need for a level playing field in regard to its activities. He also referred to the two-tier system. It is part of the directive that a universal service should be provided. I do not know, however, if the directive stipulates that there should be a universal price. Perhaps that would be a separate matter. Bearing in mind that John Hynes is on his last hurrah and that he departs his position next month, he defended himself well enough this morning.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon agreed with Senator Higgins in regard to An Post and the closure of rural post offices, and asked me to invite the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to come before the House. Senator Glynn also referred to this matter and stated that that people in rural areas must support such post offices in order that their revenue will rise and they will, thus, be made more viable. There is no policy which states that certain post offices will be closed. If the person who operates a post office dies or wants to retire, their position is advertised, but, if nobody comes forward, the post office must close. The point is well taken that people should collect their pensions from or do their daily business at post offices, which also offer many additional services.</P>
    <P>Senator McHugh referred to the differential between the cost of &ldquo;roaming&rdquo; telephone charges, North and South. If we are to bring businesses closer together, we should seek to have parity in terms of such charges.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan also raised the two-tier pricing system in An Post, with which he does not agree. He asked that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, come before the House. We are hoping to have a discussion on the disposal of property. It is hoped that the Minister of State will come before the House next week to discuss decentralisation, a topic which should fill the House with clamour. However, we may also seek a debate on the matter to which Senator Coghlan referred. The Senator also raised the subject of the expatriates in Riyadh and the issue of violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be in the Seanad to propose this important legislation. The Bill provides for the implementation of the enhancements to redundancy payment levels and other improvements to the operation of the redundancy scheme that are provided for in the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, and the report of the redundancy review group. It will also amend the insolvency payments legislation to allow employees of insolvent companies to claim their minimum notice entitlements under the insolvency payments scheme through a liquidator or receiver without first having to obtain an award from the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
      <P>In April 2002, the Government established a review group, in the context of social partnership, to examine the operation of the statutory redundancy payments scheme so as to ensure the scheme best meets the requirements of employers and employees. The group, which reported back to me and the Government in July 2002, agreed a range of changes to the redundancy scheme, including: a simpler method for calculating service; changes in the treatment of absences form work; treatment of service abroad; simplification of application forms; and a new IT system, which includes an e-government aspect. The group did not reach consensus on issues such as an increase in the level of statutory redundancy payments and size of rebate to employers. The partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, endorsed the changes agreed by the redundancy review group and provided that, in addition, the distinction between service under and over 41 years will be removed, there will be two weeks pay for every year of service, the bonus week will be retained and the rebate of 60% to the employer will also be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 18 February 2003, the Government approved the drafting of a Bill, on a priority basis, to give effect to the new enhanced redundancy payments scheme. The Government decision also approved the provision of a sum of around &euro;1 million, to cover the cost of supporting IT, the funding of administration costs and operational overheads &ndash; including the enhancement of supporting IT &ndash; to be made from the social insurance fund, with arrangements to be put in <Col N="1458" />place with the Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs. The Government also agreed to amend the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Acts 1984 to 2001 to enable employees of insolvent companies to make claims for minimum notice entitlements under the insolvency payments scheme without having to obtain an award from the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>On 30 April 2003, the Government approved the text of a Bill to give effect to the new enhanced redundancy payments scheme and the amendment to the insolvency payments scheme. The Government decision of 30 April 2003 also approved the presentation of the Bill to Seanad Éireann and its circulation to Senators. The Bill was published on 7 May 2003.</P>
    <P>When the improved statutory redundancy payments come into operation, it is estimated that a full year's cost of payments from the social insurance fund, based on the 2002 level of redundancies &ndash; approximately 24,000 &ndash; will be in the region of &euro;149 million. This is an increase of &euro;96 million in the annual cost to bring the new enhanced rates into effect.</P>
    <P>An amendment of the redundancy IT system will be required to implement the full range of changes set out in the Bill at a cost in the region of &euro;1 million. It is anticipated that the new system, when it is fully operational, will simplify administration especially for employers. It will also bring improved efficiencies in administration by the Department.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill provides that the administrative costs of redundancy and insolvency will be met from the social insurance fund by means of an appropriation in aid to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This will provide greater accounting transparency, in that all costs &ndash; payments as well as administration &ndash; will be funded by the SIF. Detailed arrangements to implement these changes have been agreed between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance and Social and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General is that as the payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is a legal requirement on employers, it could not be imposed on them with retrospective effect. In fact, employers are entitled to due notice of the intention to legally require them to pay enhanced rates. The new redundancy Act has to be brought into effect by ministerial order after enactment by the Oireachtas. This cannot be made retrospective.</P>
    <P>I hereby give notice to all employers that it is my intention to make best endeavours so that the new redundancy payment levels will come into effect on Sunday, 25 May 2003, or as soon as possible thereafter. This will require swift passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas. Employees who are issued with notice of redundancy on that date or later will be entitled to two weeks pay for each year of service, plus a bonus week.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that when this Bill has passed <Col N="1459" />through both Houses of the Oireachtas and is enacted, a commencement order will be made so that most sections of the Bill will become effective, including the increased payment amounts. However, section 10 will be brought into effect on 30 January 2004, while sections 8, 12 and 13 will not come into effect until well into 2004 when the new IT system will become fully operational. A commencement order giving effect to these three sections will be made at that time.</P>
    <P>I will now outline in detail the main provisions of the Bill, which are as follows. Section 1 is a standard provision, which provides for the Short Title of the Act and the collective citation of the Act with other relevant Acts and the standard commencement provisions. Section 2 provides definitions of terms used in the Act. Section 3 provides that the social insurance fund may cover the administration costs of the redundancy and insolvency schemes. Section 4 provides for the amendment of section 2(1) of the principal Act by inserting up to date definitions of &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo;, &ldquo;employee&rdquo; and &ldquo;employer&rdquo;. These definitions are similar to those given in the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001 and other labour legislation such as the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Carer's Leave Act 2001.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 4 of the principal Act, which deals with the insurability of an employee. The purpose of amending this section is to add clarity to the insurability requirements in line with the Social Welfare Acts and the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001. Section 6 provides for the amendment of section 7(2) of the principal Act. The Employment Appeals Tribunal, when dealing with redundancy cases, has long been of the view that redundancy is impersonal. According to the tribunal, in St. Ledger <i>v.</i> Frontline Distributors Ltd., UD56/94, the statutory definition of &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; has two important characteristics, namely &ldquo;impersonality&rdquo; and &ldquo;change&rdquo;. This section is designed to provide certainty in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the amendment of section 9(1)(<i>b</i>) of the principal Act to include fixed purpose contracts. When the fixed purpose contract ceases there is redundancy. Section 8 provides for the amendment of section 17 of the principal Act. The position, at present, is that the three forms RP1, RP2 and RP3 are the main forms used for statutory redundancy. They contain much repetition and will be amalgamated into one form when the new IT system is available later next year. This one form will be the basis for any rebate or lump sum claim.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the amendment of section 25 of the principal Act to include an employee who started work in an employment abroad, is transferred to the company or associated company in this jurisdiction, works here for at least two years and is subsequently made redundant while working here. Such employees <Col N="1460" />will be entitled to statutory redundancy for their entire service from the date of commencement of their employment in the company abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the amendment of section 39(2) of the principal Act so that vice-chairmen of the Employment Appeals Tribunal must have been practising barristers or solicitors for at least five years. The existing service provision for the chairman is seven years.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the amendment of paragraph 1(a) of Schedule 3 to the principal Act by substituting &ldquo;two weeks&rdquo; for &ldquo;one-half&rdquo; and subparagraph (b) by inserting, after &ldquo;product of&rdquo;, &ldquo;two weeks of&rdquo;. These amendments are known as transitional arrangements which will allow for the payments of increased statutory redundancy levels as soon as the Act comes into force, following minor changes to the existing IT system. These arrangements will cease to have effect on the commencement of section 12. Section 12 provides for the amendment of schedule 3 to the principal Act by substituting new paragraphs for paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 to allow for enhanced redundancy payments of two weeks per year of service, plus one extra week's pay. Any &ldquo;excess&rdquo; days will be credited as a proportion of a year. These arrangements will come into force when a new IT system becomes fully operational.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that continuity of service is preserved even when there are certain breaks in employment. It also provides that certain breaks in service are reckonable in the calculation of a lump sum, except breaks occurring in the three year period prior to the date of termination of employment. These arrangements will come into force when a new IT system becomes fully operational. Section 14 provides for penalties that may be imposed on people who defraud the system. Section 15 provides that the minimum rates of pay laid down in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, as updated, will be taken into account when calculating a statutory redundancy lump sum.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the amendment of section 6 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 to 2001. At present, where a worker in an insolvent firm has not received statutory notice, it is necessary to take the case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to determine the minimum notice entitlement. In order to streamline the process and relieve pressure on the Employment Appeals Tribunal, it is proposed to allow these employees to submit claims to the liquidator or receiver without having to go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, thereby diverting these cases from the tribunal and ensuring a better service.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the repeal of section 17(4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. This section exempted the existing calculation of a statutory redundancy lump sum &ndash; which differentiates between service under and over the age of 41 &ndash; from the provisions of the Employment Equality Act 1998.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge the work done by the <Col N="1461" />social partners within the redundancy review group, which reported to me last autumn. That group proposed several improvements to the operation of the scheme to make it more intelligible for employers and employees and to streamline the system. These improvements are included in the Bill and will improve efficiency and customer service. In the negotiations for Sustaining Progress, all social partners reached agreement to increase the level of statutory redundancy payments. This ability of the social partners to reach consensus shows the strength of our social partnership process.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to bring this Bill before the House today. The method of calculation of the statutory redundancy lump sum and the level of payments have not changed, except for the ceiling on the weekly wage, since the redundancy scheme came into operation in 1968. This is timely legislation which will give a reasonable level of increased statutory payments to employees who are unlucky enough to lose their jobs through redundancy. It is hoped that the increased lump sum payments will help to alleviate the financial hardship caused by redundancy until these employees find alternative employment. I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste to the House with this Bill. I join her in acknowledging the work of the social partners within the redundancy review group. I agree this shows the ability of the social partners to reach consensus, as they have done in the negotiations on the document, Sustaining Progress.</P>
      <P>The Bill is somewhat like the proverbial curate's egg &ndash; it is good in parts. Before I become critical, I wish to list some of the things I welcome. The increased statutory payments to employees are very welcome, as is the provision for two weeks' statutory redundancy payment for every year of service, regardless of age. Equally, I welcome the abolition of the distinction between service under or over 41 years of age. The retention of the provision for payment of an additional bonus week is also welcome. The Tánaiste spoke of matters being simpler, speedier and more effective. That is welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill amends the insolvency payments legislation to allow employees of insolvent companies to claim their minimum notice entitlements under the insolvency payments scheme through a liquidator or receiver, without having first to obtain an award from the Employment Appeals Tribunal. That is an important and welcome provision of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Tánaiste will be aware, I have a problem with the retrospection element in the legislation. I heard what she had to say on this matter but I understand that it runs contrary to assurances that were given by her or on her behalf, although I was not a party to that. I am relying on what I have heard and I know some of the companies involved, including Comerama in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. If firm assurances were given <Col N="1462" />about redundancy payments, I wonder why the State could not pick up the cost, as there were very few such instances. Perhaps there is a way around that problem, which we will be able to discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the current sorry state of the economy has led to a situation where we have to discuss the protection of employees who are being made redundant. The Government was forced into taking this action on foot of the serious difficulties experienced by employees who were let go from the Irish Glass Bottle Company and Peerless Rugs, among others, including Square D in Ballinasloe and, as I have already mentioned, Comerama in Castlecomer.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that for many years there was a lack of foresight on the part of the Department, which did not anticipate a situation where employees would be made redundant frequently with a poor level of redundancy payments. This approach by the Government is not in keeping with the spirit of the legislation, which was intended to alleviate hardship caused to workers and their families as a result of redundancy and possible subsequent unemployment, compensate them for rights they had built up in their jobs, and reduce resistance to economic and technological change.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that this legislation is an attempt on the part of the Government to increase the statutory redundancy payment from low levels to two weeks pay per year of service. A worrying feature of the Bill, however, is that there has been no attempt to include provisions which place an obligation on an employer to see if there is any suitable employment for an employee in the enterprise before that employee is declared redundant. Furthermore, there is no provision for a period of retraining for the employee prior to the redundancy taking effect. In other words, both management and trade unions should have some obligation in the workplace, not only to look after an employee's financial needs as best they can but also to look after his or her future so that they are kept up to date with all technological change.</P>
    <P>There is no point in having detailed, technical legislation which has no spirit of true protection for the employee. Undoubtedly, such employees need financial assistance but they also need training appropriate to their skills and abilities.</P>
    <P>The working group of the social partners on the Redundancy Payments Acts, which reported last year, published a table which showed that the social insurance fund was in surplus from 1997. I would be grateful if the Tánaiste could advise us in detail where these surpluses have been used in the 1997 to 2002 period.</P>
    <P>The redundancy payments legislation comprises a large corpus of work affecting all aspects of protective employment legislation. I wonder when the Tánaiste will provide a restatement of this legislation in accordance with the Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Tánaiste did not see <Col N="1463" />fit to examine the statutory notice periods in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment legislation where the periods of notice for employees are very low. I would be grateful to hear her comments on that matter.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that the Tánaiste has attempted to depersonalise the definition of redundancy, in that a position will now be made redundant as opposed to an individual. While that is most welcome, it would be useful if the parliamentary counsel could revisit this definition as it appears to be excessively cumbersome.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about section 9 of the Bill, which contains an attempt to protect an employee who has worked abroad for an employer. It would appear that there could be an attempt on the part of an employer to avoid redundancy payment to an employee if he or she was not employed in the State for the two years prior to being made redundant. In other words, an employer could deliberately place an employee abroad for a period of time prior to redundancy, thus placing that employee in a very awkward position, to say the least.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the improvements the Tánaiste is making to the legislation are to take place. They are overdue because redundancy payments legislation has become outdated and difficult to apply. I welcome the measure in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to provide for the amendment and extension of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, the amendment of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Acts 1984 to 2001, the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, and the Employment Equality Act 1998, and to provide for related matters.</P>
      <P>The Bill partly stems from the conclusions of the redundancy review group, which produced a number of areas of agreement. The group considered that increasing the upper age limit would not be a priority in the short term. It recommended that consideration should be given in the medium term to removing or raising the age cap in conjunction with similar changes to unfair dismissals, equality, social and family affairs legislation, as recommended in the recent report by the Equality Authority.</P>
      <P>The group also agreed that insurability should continue to be a condition of eligibility for the redundancy scheme. The group endorsed the current criteria which are as follows: now or at any time in the past four years the person was in employment which is fully insurable for all class A benefits; now or at any time in the past four years the person was in employment which is not fully insurable for all benefits because his or her earnings are below the threshold for class cover, that is class J; and directors and other self-employed persons &ndash; class S &ndash; are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group was of the view that the ceiling should be adjusted by statutory instrument at <Col N="1464" />fixed intervals of three years for employers and two years for employees, in line with the transportable goods industries' index. Increases would be in discrete amounts, following consultations with the social partners, with the first revision to take place with effect from 1 April 2004. The group agreed that any extra resources should go to benefit people with two years' service, so that reducing the qualification period to one year would not be as high a priority.</P>
    <P>On the issue of determination of pay, the group recognised that the use of the P60 form had many practical merits for clarity and the administration of the scheme. Nevertheless, it was generally felt that the loss of weekly earnings for an employee was too high to balance the practical merits. The group agreed that non-reckonable service should only be taken into account in the three years prior to redundancy, consistent with the provision in section 25 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, which deals with the retention of employees' records by employers.</P>
    <P>On the issue of redundancy payment for working part of a year, the group agreed that if the total amount of reckonable service was not an exact number of years, the excess days would be credited as a proportion of a year to one decimal place. The group agreed that an employee's service working abroad for a company should be taken into account, provided that the two years immediately prior to redundancy were spent with a company in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The group agreed that form filling should be minimised and that the use of e-government should be maximised. The group was also of the view that penalties under the Minimum Notice Act were sufficient. However, penalties must be provided for those people who defraud the system &ndash; the level to be decided following legal advice in the preparation of resulting legislation.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that a new computer system would be needed to give effect to changes in the redundancy legislation and to enhance administrative efficiency and customer service. The group recommended that FÁS and other relevant agencies should continue to focus and give priority to retraining workers who have been made redundant for alternative jobs.</P>
    <P>There has been comprehensive preparation for this Bill. The suggestion that it be brought forward was made in Sustaining Progress, the partnership agreement that was reached by the public and private sectors. The section of the agreement which deals with redundancy payments states:</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Payments Acts will be amended to implement the recommendations that have been agreed in the Report of the Redundancy Review Group. In the context of this Agreement, it is agreed by the Government that it will enhance statutory redundancy terms to provide for 2 weeks pay per year of service, with the abolition of differentiation by age and to retain the bonus week in the calculation of payments. The rebate of 60% of the statutory redundancy payment from the Social <Col N="1465" />Insurance Fund will apply to this revised level of statutory payment. It is acknowledged by the parties to this Agreement that the above adjustment is intended to provide a basic statutory minimum redundancy payment for all workers covered by the Acts. It will not be used to increase the cost of redundancy payments as may be already provided for by agreements at enterprise level. The parties agree that no repercussive claims related to or following on from this adjustment to the statutory minimum provisions for redundancy payments will be made by trade unions or employees. Where a dispute about the appropriate level of redundancy payment arises directly from this adjustment of statutory provisions, both parties will refer the matter for interpretation by the Labour Court and be bound by its recommendation on the matter.</P>
    <P>We can see, therefore, that a second support for this Bill is provided in Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation before the House, which makes a number of important reforms in an effort to improve consistency, clarity and certainty on the subject of redundancy payments. Employment legislation in Ireland has developed considerably over the last 30 years, in response to economic development, social reform and membership of the European Union. In the area of redundancy payments, it has been argued that the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-91 dealt with an economy very different from that which exists today and that major improvements are needed to meet the demands of a modern economy.</P>
    <P>The aim of this legislative reform is to strengthen the rights of employees while maintaining a competitive labour market. In response to the demand for reform, the Government established a review group to examine the operation of the redundancy payments scheme and to ensure that the scheme best meets the requirements of employers and employees. The review group's results were incorporated in the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. This Bill will introduce a simpler, speedier and more efficient system of redundancy payment. A number of important changes has been proposed.</P>
    <P>The economic downturn has increased competition in the labour market. An improvement in redundancy payments is required in the wake of such economic uncertainty. One of the partnership agreement's key commitments is to increase the level of statutory redundancy payments. This Bill will provide for two weeks' statutory redundancy payment for every year of service. This is an improvement on the current requirement of one week of redundancy payment for every year of service for those aged 41 or over and half a week's payment for every year of service for those aged under 41. The substantial increases in redundancy payments represent a clear illustration of the Government's commitment to social inclusion and protection.</P>
    <P>The vice-president of SIPTU, Jack O'Connor, pointed out that the measures provided for in the <Col N="1466" />new Bill will improve the circumstances of working people at one of the most vulnerable times in their lives &ndash; when they are faced with redundancy. The current legislation has been criticised as going against the spirit of the Employment Equality Act 1998, which outlawed discrimination on the basis of age. As section 17(4) of the 1998 Act specifically excludes the age-related provisions in the redundancy Acts, the distinction between the service of those under the age of 41 and those over that age is being abolished. This reform marks a positive and progressive step to support all those faced with the uncertainty of redundancy and unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government has a strong commitment to maintaining a high level of employment and to ensuring that the rights of employees are protected. It has increased the minimum wage, introduced regulations aimed at safeguarding employees' rights when ownership is transferred and committed to a Bill that will give employees the right to fixed-term contracts. In an effort to bolster support for those facing redundancy, the existing provision for the payment of an additional bonus week is being maintained.</P>
    <P>This Bill will amend the insolvency payments legislation to allow employees of insolvent companies to claim their minimum notice entitlements under the insolvency payments scheme without first having to obtain an award from the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The rebate of 60% to the employer will be maintained. This allows employers who have paid their employees their correct statutory redundancy lump sums to apply to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for a 60% rebate within six months of payment. If employers have failed to pay employees their statutory redundancy entitlements, employees can apply to the Department for direct payment from the social insurance fund.</P>
    <P>The system of redundancy payment will be fundamentally reformed by the simplification of calculation methods and application forms, the introduction of a new and more efficient IT system and the tweaking of definitions in line with labour-related legislation, such as the Social Welfare Acts and the Protection of Employees Acts. The Government's commitment to safeguarding employees' rights is illustrated by improved redundancy payments provision, the elimination of age discrimination and enhanced functional operation of the scheme, as introduced under this Bill. The reforms that were agreed in the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, improve the simplicity, efficiency and consistency of the redundancy payments scheme. I welcome the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>When I addressed a large demonstration outside Buswell's Hotel last November in support of the Irish Glass Bottle workers, redundancy was a huge issue. I gave a commitment at the meeting, on behalf of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to make redundancy a key issue during any new negotiations. In welcoming the <Col N="1467" />Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House this afternoon, I did not fully expect that such progress would have been made in such a short period. Arguments are often made about people being on the left or the right of politics, but on behalf of Congress and on my own behalf, I would like to make clear that there is always room for partnership and that people can always find a coincidence of objectives and do business on that basis.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents the outcome of long days and late nights of seemingly intractable argument. I would like to put on the record that the Tánaiste has shown an interest, an involvement and a commitment in relation to this issue in the course of the discussions. Negotiations were not easy &ndash; they never are in these situations &ndash; as we were debating a key issue for the trade union movement. Some people ask if the labour movement can do business with the Tánaiste and, without a doubt, the answer is that we can and we do, not just on this issue, but regularly in relation to many issues. Those of us who deal with her have found her to be honourable and committed in our dealings with her. We very often have disagreements which cannot be sorted out, but that is in the nature of solid relationships. Having finally reached a position on this matter late one night in Government Buildings, the Tánaiste shook hands on it. Today she has delivered on the promises she made.</P>
      <P>This Bill is record-breaking in many ways. It has proceeded from conception to delivery in the shortest time I can recall. It represents the greatest increase in redundancy payments in the history of these payments. This legislation either doubles or quadruples the entitlements of workers at a vulnerable stage, when they are being laid off from companies. Huge issues relating to redundancy have to be looked at and avoided, of course, but this Bill is superb in the interests of reaching that point.</P>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for bringing this Bill through so quickly and congratulate her officials for bringing it forward with such expediency. She made a commitment to seek Government priority for this legislation and she achieved it. More importantly, this Bill is a huge confidence-boosting measure. Every journalist who telephoned me during the negotiations presumed that I was having great difficulty with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. I said on every occasion that I was not having any particular difficulty with the two Ministers and felt that I could do business and negotiate with them.</P>

      <P>No. As I said here last night, I am prepared to go on the record as honestly as I can in relation to issues. That is the position. As I said to the Tánaiste, if this was Boston, we could <Col N="1468" />do with a little more of it. If we can double or quadruple payments to workers at any stage, I am prepared to consider this whether it comes from Boston, Berlin, Brussels or otherwise.</P>
      <P>I have been a constant critic on many issues. All that I ask in regard to business is that the Government does the business and delivers. Many awkward union meetings around the country in the last seven months, and also long before, reached a point &ndash; we have all done this in the context of our political parties &ndash; where somebody at the back of the hall said: &ldquo;Can you trust those people to deliver?&rdquo;  In such cases, one has to take one's heart in one's hand and say: &ldquo;Yes, I trust those people to deliver until such time as they do not.&rdquo;  That is the reason I go on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Senator will put this in another context when he gets the opportunity, and will be quite right to do so. There is a huge imperative to get this legislation through the House as quickly as possible, to which I realise Members have today committed. This is a confidence boosting measure in regard to Sustaining Progress. It is the first legislative measure to come from it and there will be others. It is the first clearly defined outcome under which we can draw a line and, in that sense, was required.</P>
      <P>We should also address the reasons we find ourselves in such situations. With regard to the case of the Irish Glass Bottle Company, for example, it is appalling that it should be left to the Government to pick up the pieces. The holding company has made a huge amount of money from the closure and sits on huge assets. While I welcome what we are doing today, it is a disgrace and unacceptable that we are spending taxpayer's money while those who unnecessarily closed this company and failed to provide for the workers despite having plenty of money &ndash; the holding company, not the operating company &ndash; made tens of millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, in the context of how we have done business over the past 35 years, this Bill is progress, particularly for those in the trade union movement who put huge pressure on its leadership and said this was an issue on which progress must be made. Another was trade union recognition, on which we have made progress, not as much as I would want but more than has ever been made previously. It is a positive and welcome development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas redundancies are something we seek to avoid, they are not always a negative reflection on the economy. With a quickly modernising economy in which workplaces, work practices, products and services are changing, and with the recognition that people will no longer spend their whole career in one area of work, there will be increasing change. It will increasingly be found that because of age, geographical location or fam<Col N="1469" />ily situation, some will not be able to take the opportunity of retraining or re-employment. In that sense, the Bill is a very important part of a modernising economy and a requirement in that area.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Bill cannot be made retrospective in the way I would have wished but that has not proved possible. Nonetheless, it is a good day's work when I can walk out of negotiations having doubled or quadrupled the input to the workers. For this, I thank the Tánaiste for delivery on her commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste in circumstances where there has been a significant leap forward in terms of providing adequate protection for those unfortunate enough to lose their jobs. I note that there will be a fourfold increase in entitlements for those under 41 years of age, from half a week to two weeks, and a twofold increase for those over 41 years, from one week to two weeks. By any standards, that is a quantum leap forward and one to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I wish to comment, as Senator O'Toole did, on the speed with which this measure has been implemented. It is characteristic of the Tánaiste's understanding of the difficulties in the area and the need to act quickly and effectively to deal with them. I note that the Bill was approved for drafting by the Government on 18 April, the text was approved on 30 April, the Bill was published on 7 May and it is intended to bring it into effect on 25 May following early signature by the President. By contrast with the timescale of the legislative process to which we have grown accustomed in the Houses, that is close to breaking the sound barrier or, perhaps, going to Mach two. It is extraordinarily speedy for the passage of legislation.</P>
      <P>The review group made certain recommendations but did not reach consensus on the increase in the level of statutory redundancy payments and the size of the rebate. It was through the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, that the changes agreed by the review group were accepted. However, in addition, as the Tánaiste explained to the House, the distinction between service under and over 41 years of age would be removed, there would be two weeks' pay for every year of service, the bonus week would be retained and the rebate of 60% to the employer retained. All of these measures are to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It saddens me that these measures were not available to the workers in Peerless Rugs in Athy or other companies who suffered redundancy and received minimal payments and protection. The workers at Peerless Rugs were badly treated by their employers, particularly in circumstances where they had given many years of service. I regret that the protection and statutory payments for them were not adequate. I regret also that when they went to the Labour Court, its recommendation, which would have improved their <Col N="1470" />payments from the company, was not accepted by the company.</P>
    <P>There is a wider dimension with regard to the rights of employees in the event of liquidation. In the case of Peerless Rugs, workers with mortgages had money deducted from their wages by the company for payment on their behalf to building societies. That was a sensible approach from the workers' point of view as the money routinely went to the building society. However, when the company went into liquidation, the cheques sent to the building society were no good. It is to the Tánaiste's credit that on several occasions she spoke to the relevant parties and was ultimately successful in getting the company to honour the cheques. In addition, weekly deductions from wages were being made by the company towards a holiday fund, which was also prudent financial management on the part of the employees. They lost everything they had saved. We must look at the law with regard to such matters, in terms of how employees rank with other creditors when it comes to liquidation.</P>
    <P>We must also look at situations, perhaps also with regard to the Peerless Rugs case, where companies have various arms or branches. It is easy, from an accounting point of view, to show a bad scenario in one aspect of a company's activities and have it as a stand-alone subsidiary company. That company can then be folded and the machinery moved, and business continued in another location. If there is evidence of this sort of activity, there must be strong legislative measures to prevent it taking place.</P>
    <P>I would like to see, as I am sure would the Tánaiste, retrospection with regard to several of the companies in which people lost their jobs but I accept the reality of the legal position that it is not possible. I thank the Tánaiste for the time and effort she put into dealing with the problems in that particular company. I am sure she has done the same in many others throughout the country and it is a measure of her commitment in the area. In the spirit of what was said on the Order of Business over the past two days, we now ask her to move on from there and provide us with industry in Athy. Everybody wants some office to decentralise to their particular town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not Senator McDowell. He does not want anything decentralised to Clontarf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Athy is a prime candidate for decentralisation. The chamber of commerce and the town council put together a very good package arguing their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the fundamental obligations of employers to their employees are honoured and that there are no loopholes in the legislative framework that can be used to escape from fulfilling those obligations. I particularly welcome the fact that people are no longer required to go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal and that section 16 deals with that referral aspect under the Protection of Employees (Employers' <Col N="1471" />Insolvency) Acts 1984 to 2001. We all appreciate the trauma of someone losing their job. Additional bureaucratic burdens have to be avoided to ensure people do not have to do unnecessary form filling or fulfil other obligations imposed upon them. I note what the Tánaiste said about the rationalisation of the forms in that three will now be reduced to one and there is capacity to complete them by electronic means.</P>
    <P>It is evident, and Senator O'Toole touched on this point, that society is changing rapidly and that what might have appeared to be reasonable and desirable protection ten years ago needs to be reviewed now. Legislation of this nature must be kept under constant review. As recently as ten years ago it would have been regarded as normal practice for somebody to take up a job in their mid or late teens and remain in that job until retirement at age 65, but people are now retiring earlier. The classic cycle of growth and decline in companies is much more rapid now than ten or 15 years ago and people have to be mobile within the workplace and even within the country in terms of moving to employment. There is evidence of that in the greater Dublin area, particularly in Kildare where people have moved in significant numbers over recent years.</P>
    <P>Given all the changes taking place with regard to age profile within industry &ndash; the age at which people retire, the rapidity with which economic circumstances change, the change in classic company cycles and the need for simplification &ndash; it is important that legislation of this nature be kept under review. It is an important step forward, however, and I commend the Tánaiste for the quick and decisive action she has taken in this area because it will mean a great deal of help to many people. I hope the Bill will pass through both Houses, that it will receive early signature by the President and that it will be possible to implement it by the end of May.</P>

      <P>I will not say anything about that. I will start by stating the obvious. The position of people who lose their jobs will be improved once this Bill is enacted. The fact that we have not reviewed the major provisions of the 1967 Act in 36 years is remarkable because it has been calling out for revision for some time.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Senator O'Toole has left the House. I sometimes think his vision is clouded by a residue of the smoke that fills the rooms in which he does these deals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is appropriate to say there has been a significant improvement in the <Col N="1472" />Bill before the House, it by no means does all that Congress has been looking for over a number of years, and Senator O'Toole knows that better than most. Even in terms of the timescale, my current party leader, as our party's then spokesperson on enterprise and employment, dealt with this issue over a number of years with the Tánaiste in the other House. It is over a year since the redundancy review group was set up by the Tánaiste. It was set up in April of last year and reported in October last. It will have taken over a year to get it on the Statute Book and a significant number of groups of workers will have lost out by virtue of that fact. I will deal with that aspect later.</P>
      <P>The redundancy review group, which the Tánaiste set up largely as a delaying mechanism before the election, did not reach agreement on many key issues. It reached agreement on a number of issues. I am reading from the press release the Tánaiste issued which states that agreement was reached in terms of non-reckonable service, service abroad, which I welcome, computerising the system, which everybody would welcome, the number of forms used and the upper age limit. It did not reach agreement at that stage, and this is the important point, on the amount of the payments to be made, the refund that will be made to employers at a later stage and a number of other important matters.</P>
      <P>On the amount of the payment, it had become ludicrous and risible that workers under the age of 41 got half of one week's payment per year of service. Nobody could stand over that and we have been aware for many years that that needed to be revised. It is now two years of service, irrespective of age. That is a four-fold improvement for those under the age of 41 and a two-fold improvement for those over 41 years of age. The fact remains, nonetheless, that it is dwarfed by severance arrangements typically made by companies in reasonably good financial standing and dwarfed more spectacularly by the arrangements made in recent years by semi-State companies, many of which have gone to six or eight weeks' payments for years of service. Some of those arrangements made by semi-State bodies were excessive. The important point about a redundancy payment is that it is intended to tide people over while they are between jobs and to give them a lump sum, particularly in later years, with which they might be able to set up in private employment in terms of giving them the seed capital to establish an enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to some of the semi-State companies, people walked out of a job on Friday with a substantial body of money from the taxpayer and started a new job on Monday. I found that close to obscene on occasions and it is not something for which I would argue. I do argue for a generous payment for people who will find difficulty in getting another job, either because of their level of training, their age, the number of years they spent in the particular company or the indus<Col N="1473" />try they worked in which may have become out-moded.</P>
    <P>Most of us would agree there is a clear argument for the need to modulate these payments in some way to take into account the circumstances of the workers concerned. Two weeks pay per year of service, irrespective of the job, the industry or the circumstances of the individual, is very cruel. After 36 years' experience of redundancy payments, perhaps it is time to examine that in more detail to see if we can develop some method whereby we would take into account the needs of individual workers or workers in particular industries. The Bill does not seek to do that.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party published a Bill some time ago which sought to increase the statutory redundancy payment to three rather than two weeks, which would have been an even more considerable increase. I will not quibble with the deal that has been done between the Minister and Senator O'Toole and his colleagues in the trade union sector because it will not be undone at this late stage. It does not matter very much whether we go on about it at length.</P>
    <P>I refer to the distinction between people aged 40 years and over and those aged 40 years and under. I understand the reasoning behind the elimination of the distinction but the logic to it was that older people who lost their jobs were likely to have greater training needs and more difficulty in getting a job. Whatever the Employment Equality Act states, it is still more difficult for people made redundant in their forties or fifties, having worked for a company for 20 or 30 years, to get a job. They are more legitimately in need of a significant payment to tide them over or give them a seed capital boost. There was, therefore, a logic to the age distinction in the previous legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated she has been advised that legally the distinction does not sit with the Employment Equality Act. I am not persuaded that is the case but can see how some might see it runs against the spirit of the Act. However, I am not at all convinced, from a legal perspective, that it could not have sat reasonably comfortably with it. I regret its passing. That is not the view of everybody in the Labour Party or the labour movement but the distinction was meaningful and should have been retained. I am sorry the Minister is getting rid of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the acknowledgement of fixed purpose contracts. People sign contracts to do particular jobs and when the contracts end because they have been breached and terminated prematurely or their purpose has been fulfilled, the people concerned find themselves frequently caught out under the provisions of the current Act. The clarification of this issue in the legislation is helpful.</P>
    <P>The issue of retrospection will dog the Minister for the next few days and beyond. The two questions in this regard are whether it is possible to make payments retrospectively and whether the Minister made a commitment to workers in Com<Col N="1474" />erama, for example, that she would do so. I am not persuaded by the Attorney General's argument in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if we take that as a given, it must be possible for the Minister or the Government to make payments on a non-statutory basis that would be equivalent to redundancy payments and backdate them six or 18 months to meet the commitment she made. A similar payment has been provided, for example, under the taxi licence hardship arrangements. No legislation governs that scheme and I do not know whether it is intended to place it on a statutory footing. Legislation is probably not necessary because payments can be made on the basis of regulation. Even if it is accepted that the legal argument holds, the Minister could approach the Minister for Finance and say she has given commitments to a number of workers over a period that need to be fulfilled. It will not be a great cost to the Exchequer but, in terms of good faith, I am sure the Minister would acknowledge privately that the commitments should be met.</P>
      <P>I refer to a number of memoranda that deal specifically with the Comerama case. The Minister, undoubtedly, will recall a meeting she had on 12 December with a large number of people, including representatives of the workers&mdash;</P>

      <P>The departmental report on the meeting stated, &ldquo;The Tánaiste said that talks were ongoing in relation to the statutory redundancy issue. She gave an undertaking that if the legislation is changed she would do everything she could to ensure that the Comerama workers would be included in any amendment.&rdquo;  The Minister has put a spin on this. I have no doubt she will say she has done everything she can and it is not possible to make the legislation retrospective. Nonetheless, those who attended the meeting and the workers who relied on the word of those who attended were under the impression that the Minister had given an explicit and unambiguous commitment to make payments retrospective and ensure those workers would receive the additional payments which everybody at the meeting, including the Minister, accepted they should get. Whether she says she has done her best, she is seen by the workers in Comerama as having breached her word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The comment was made on 12 December 2002. Deputy Aylward, a member of Fianna Fáil and one of the Minister's Government colleagues, stated on 15 January 2003, at which stage the social partnership talks were well advanced, that he was satisfied and had checked that an unambiguous commitment had been made. Deputy McGuinness of Fianna Fáil wrote to the representatives of Comerama workers on 20 January 2003 and stated the Minister had given &ldquo;a commitment at our meeting on 12/12/02 to ensure the workforce of Comerama are included in any new deal which would be agreed.&rdquo;  He went on to welcome this saying it was positive news.</P>
      <P>The Minister is saying she did her best and retrospection is not possible. Given the commitment made and the number of workers involved, natural justice demands that if the Minister and the Government cannot make payments within the statutory framework, there is an obligation on them to find another way to do so. The Minister is seen by the people of Kilkenny to have given her word on the issue and it is important that she should deliver on it. If the Attorney General is telling her that she cannot make retrospective provision under this legislation, she needs to find another way to do so soon. This is only one case. There are other cases in which she has been less directly implicated because Government backbenchers have given commitments on her behalf which may have been authorised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The line certainly had not been drawn before 12 December last when the Minister made a commitment to the 160 workers in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny and that must be met.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision that a number of factors that meant one broke service are no longer reckonable provided they took place more than three years previously. Most of the causes of breaching reckonable service should not have been included in the first place and, while I accept three years is an improvement, it could be reduced to one year because the principle would hold equally well.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it represents an improvement for workers who are in a vulnerable position. However, we need to re-examine how we deal with redundancy and find a way to gear the payments made to the needs of workers in particular industries. We are not doing this as the Bill does not set out to do so. However, it is something we need to examine. I plead with the Tánaiste to make good on the undertakings she is seen to have made last December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste. In fairness to her, she had the good intention of endeavouring to achieve retrospection, if possible. Where do we draw the line as far as legislation is concerned? The Tánaiste expressed her concerns about the issues which apply to most constituencies where industries close. Can anybody say what date should be applied in terms of retrospection or that we should go back two or three years or six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We must go back to the point where the Tánaiste told the people concerned they would be looked after. That was about six months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste clarified the matter. She tried to find a way out of the situation and assist workers made redundant over that period. I recall situations where <i>ex gratia</i> payments were <Col N="1477" />made. The Talbot workers in Dublin were well looked well, before the Senator's time. Also, in the Minister of State's constituency &ndash; I welcome Deputy Michael Ahern &ndash; Irish Steel had special arrangements.</P>
      <P>In regard to retrospection, I accept that it would be almost impossible to impose the requirement on employers who could not be legally responsible for financing it. Under the law, there is a 60:40 divide as between the Government and employers. We cannot impose this responsibility retrospectively on employers but we may not be tied to the same extent and could make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of our percentage if required. I make that point to the Minister of State and his officials.</P>
      <P>I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State and the Tánaiste. Senator McDowell will accept that if one was addressing a group of workers affected by a difficult redundancy situation, one would endeavour to assist them in any way possible. I concede the difficulty and accept the situation but from my experience the Government could make <i>ex gratia</i> payments in difficult circumstances. In the taxi drivers case there was hardship involved arising from the sale of taxi plates. A forum has been set up to establish a compensation fund from which <i>ex gratia</i> type payments will be made.</P>
      <P>Between now and Committee Stage in the Dáil, I ask the officials to look at the arrangement agreed for the Talbot workers, which was unique and satisfactory in the resolution of a major issue, and also at Irish Steel. In a redundancy situation in my constituency I pointed out there might be some way of coming up with an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>
      <P>The new legislation will come into force on 25 May. This is fast-tracked legislation. On a technical point, Senators may recall legislation to introduce the representative allowance for members of local authorities, from which I benefited. That allowance was made payable from the date the Bill was published. It was funded by the State whereas 40% of redundancy payments are funded by employers. The Attorney General advised the Tánaiste that the Bill would only come into force, as far as payments were concerned, when passed by both Houses and signed by the President. The earliest date is 25 May.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Tánaiste and the Minister of State came to the House today to cover this important legislation. I hope the media will recognise the work and contribution of the Tánaiste, the Government and the social partners in bringing forward the Bill. The social partners, including Senator O'Toole, president of the ICTU, played an important role in this development. There has been a radical change from a figure of half a week's per year to two weeks per year plus a week's bonus. The Bill also dispenses with the criteria relating to those aged over and under 41 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original motivation for introducing new legislation in this area arose from the increased <Col N="1478" />number of redundancy claims since the initial conception in the 1960s. Nowadays the needs of employees and employers have changed to which the Government has responded as well as to calls to improve legislation in this area. My opinion, like that of many others, is that the key focus should be on job protection and creation. I know the Minister feels the same way. Legislation is certainly needed, especially when we consider that there was an almost 50% increase in the number of redundancy claims during 2001 compared to 2000.</P>
    <P>It was in this setting that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment carried out an internal review of the redundancy payments scheme early last year. It reviewed the operation of the scheme from an administrative efficiency and a customer service perspective. The purpose was to examine its rationale and continued relevance. It examined whether the delivery of the scheme could be made more customer-friendly or make greater use of information technology. It also suggested ways in which its operation could be streamlined. It aimed to develop a vision of an improved scheme which would involve appropriate, yet affordable, payments to redundant workers to meet the principles of the original Act, be simple to understand and provide administrative arrangements which would maximise the use of e-government to deliver the scheme quickly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>I have come across a situation where if an employee does not sign, the employer does not receive the refund. If an employee is disgruntled by the redundancy arrangement, he or she could prevent the employer from receiving a refund by refusing to sign. Will the Minister check this arrangement? It is reasonable to expect that if a redundancy payment is issued, the employer will get the 60% refund. Nobody should be able to prevent the employer from getting this.</P>
    <P>The review group was established, in the context of social partnership, to examine the operation of the redundancy payments scheme so as to ensure it best met the requirements of employers and employees. It was from this 12 month process that the Bill arose. It has been fast-tracked in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is a credit to the Tánaiste, the Minister of State, the Department and officials that they have brought the Bill so quickly through the process of consultation between all the social partners. It is an enormous breakthrough and will give tremendous support to employees facing redundancy. I suffered myself when I was made redundant from this House in 1993. It is important that anyone facing redundancy has some cushion to help him or her overcome his or her difficulties until he or she is in a position to find alternative employment.</P>
    <P>Many will be disappointed on the question of retrospection, which I am aware presented difficulties for the Minister. The Labour Party probably promised the sun, moon and stars without regard for the coffers of the State as it will not <Col N="1479" />have responsibility for the matter during this Administration. Many promises were made by the Fine Gael Party to which Senator Ulick Burke belongs. I recall its promise to compensate Eircom shareholders&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for stopping Senator Leyden in his tracks before he could pursue that line again. While I welcome the Minister of State, I regret the Minister had to leave. As in the case of undertakings given in the case of the company in Kilkenny which has been mentioned frequently, similar, less forthcoming undertakings were given with regard to another company. It is ironic that the lights went out as the Minister left the House, given that when she visits east Galway on errands, the lights usually go out after her departure.</P>
      <P>I previously raised the sad cases of AT Cross in Ballinasloe and, more recently, Square D, an excellent employer in an excellent industry in which 385 people unfortunately lost their jobs. As I am unable to ask the Minister directly, I ask the Minister of State to seek clarification regarding the date of 25 May on which the provisions concerning redundancy payments will take effect. Only a skeleton workforce will remain in the Square D manufacturing outlet on that date. Will the Minister of State indicate whether workers who remain in the company after 25 May will benefit from the provisions of the Bill, while many others who will have already left by then as part of a process of downscaling agreed by workers at all levels will not? Will the Minister take special notice of this case in which an agreed procedure of staggering closure will leave some who are still working in the company eligible to benefit from the new provisions, as they are not due to become redundant until mid-June, while others, who left at an earlier stage, will not? This is a unique case which demands her special attention, regardless of commitments given.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State ask the Minister to provide me with information on the commitments she made to take urgent action during her various visits to Ballinasloe following the terrible news, which broke on 15 January, that Square D was to cease production and close? The closure was followed by an action programme to replace a task force, established following the closure of AT Cross, which failed miserably, despite the many undertakings given by the Minister at the time regarding replacement jobs, none of which has materialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the measure to eliminate the distinction between workers under and over 41 years which I never understood. In traditional and long-<Col N="1480" />established companies such as Square D the majority of the workers displaced as a result of the closure will probably receive the redundancy package as a golden handshake, as they will, given the current climate, probably find themselves unemployed indefinitely. Many who have given upwards of 30 years of service will go into retirement. It appears the Bill will not cater for the ongoing and unusual case of Square D and may result in discrimination against one group as a result of choices made earlier. I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
    <P>I noted the Minister carefully set out the phased basis on which the Bill will come into operation. I have seldom heard a Minister, in a Second Stage speech, outline in such detail the progressive implementation of a Bill &ndash; I appreciate the fact that Senator O'Toole welcomed it given his involvement. It appeared to be an effort by the Minister to cover her tracks with regard to the undertakings allegedly given in the case of the workers in Kilkenny referred to. This would be unfortunate if it was the case.</P>
    <P>Was the Minister aware of the Attorney General's advice when she met the Kilkenny workers and allegedly gave them an undertaking? She must have been aware of it. She made the statements in question, which appeared to indicate strong support for the workers in their tragic loss, to get out of a difficult position. Closures are always very traumatic for the workers affected. In fairness, at the time of the AT Cross closure in Ballinasloe, I was present when the Minister indicated she would make available whatever resources and agencies were necessary to help the workers in the company get over the traumatic position in which they found themselves by helping them to apply for redundancy and retraining. She promised to call in additional resources from FÁS for a retraining programme, which was difficult to understand given that most of the community employment schemes in the county were being severely cut at the time. No such structures have been put in place since. Why?</P>
    <P>I specifically request that the Minister inform me, in writing and at the earliest convenient date, of the progress she has made on the undertakings she gave to workers, management and the public representatives of east Galway at the time. I am certain all the workers in Square D would have remained in the company until 25 May had they been aware they would not benefit from the provisions of the Bill by taking redundancy beforehand. The terms of reference of the Bill were in place on 15 January. I cannot sufficiently emphasise the importance of the Minister giving special attention to this case in which redundancies are ongoing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to discuss four points &ndash; the national minimum wage, insolvent companies, rebates paid to employers and severance packages. I know from listening to Senator Ulick Burke on many occasions that he articulates extremely well the trauma faced by people who <Col N="1481" />lose their jobs. I agree with him that it is a traumatic experience. Senator McDowell seems to think there is a conspiracy among companies to go out of business. There is a myth that companies gain something by doing so. However, companies want to continue to trade.</P>
      <P>I have experience of business and I have dealt with people who have been unemployed for periods of time. A work ethic is like a gift from God or Allah, depending on one's religion. People want to work to survive and to pay their way in society. We started our business in 1987 when there was 18% unemployment. People came to our company on the East Wall Road who did not have a job. Young people who get a job are transformed after a year or two when they settle down and get some money. They are able to buy nice clothes and to have a decent standard of living. Their self-confidence improves when they take up employment.</P>
      <P>Companies do not want to go out of business and they cannot survive without their workers or staff. Employers, management and workers work together to grow a business and to increase profits. If companies do not get sales and cannot make profits, they will not survive and jobs will be lost.</P>
      <P>We spoke earlier about Ireland being a small open economy with a population of four million people. We need trade and sales to get employment. We must be able to sell out of Ireland. There are not enough sales in the country to grow business. We must increase trade from outside the country which will enable us to create jobs.</P>
      <P>There was an increase of almost 50% in the number of redundancies during 2001 compared to 2000. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment reacted quickly and set up a review group to study the existing redundancy legislation from an administrative, efficiency and customer service point of view. I was impressed when I read in the review group document that the person losing his or her job was seen as a customer rather than a number who must be looked after by the Department. That is part of what Sustaining Progress is about. We must ensure that the public service improves and lives up to the public's expectations. I commend the language used in the review group document. It is critical that we deal quickly and efficiently with people who experience the trauma of losing their jobs.</P>
      <P>GDP was 10% in 2000, but it contracted to 6% in 2001. The United States economy and all industry stalled during 2000 and 2001. That was the reason there was a 50% increase in the number of redundancies between 2000 and 2001. Everything stalled because there was a slow down in growth. The average European growth is 1.9%, while our growth is twice that rate. We are still doing well, although we have contracted. If there is a contraction, business will slow down and people will be laid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the Tánaiste to compliment her when she introduced the national minimum wage in 2000. Section 15 of the National Minimum <Col N="1482" />Wage Act 2000 provides that the minimum wage rate must be taken into account when calculating statutory redundancy lump sums. That is a positive step.</P>
    <P>If a worker in an insolvent firm does not receive statutory notice, it is necessary to take the case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal to determine the minimum entitlement. I compliment the Department because in order to streamline the process, it is proposed to allow employees to submit claims to the liquidator or receiver without having to go to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, thereby diverting these cases from the tribunal and ensuring a better service for the person who is made redundant. That shows common sense. I want to draw attention to that issue rather than repeating the old issues of age, etc.</P>
    <P>I am sure that 99% of the public do not realise that companies receive a 60% rebate when they make redundancy payments. That is a significant figure.  </P>
    <P>The statutory redundancy payment is two weeks for every year of service. People do not realise that many companies give multiples of the statutory payment. Every company does not make only the statutory payment. The food, drink and tobacco industries give two to four weeks' payment in addition to the statutory payment. People who work in the computer and electronics industry do not receive only the statutory payment; they also get four to six weeks' payment. When people who work in the financial services industry are made redundant, they get packages of between three to four weeks' payment in addition to the statutory payment. The two weeks' payment is given by many traditional companies.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about the way the management of Irish Glass treated its staff. I had a pain in my heart when I saw the workers having to march in the street to get that company to pay them a proper redundancy package. It was appalling. We spoke at the parliamentary party meeting about IFI. The Minister of State defended it, but the workers did not seem to understand what redundancy they were getting or when they were getting it. As an employer, our company would not be able to employ 50 people today unless there was mutual respect between us and our staff. Companies do not succeed unless there is mutual respect. I detest the macho management style between workers and management.</P>

      <P>In 1980 my husband won an award to carry out a study of what industry Ireland should focus on in the future. Fortunately, the American fund paid for me as well. We spent three and a half months studying many big international electronics companies in the United States. I wrote to my colleagues in the National Building Agency where I had previously worked stating that there was more socialism in American <Col N="1483" />companies than we, in Ireland, dreamed about. The management of these fast growing companies realised one had to communicate with one's staff if one wished to go forward.</P>
      <P>Our staff in East Wall, many of them local, worked hard to build up the company, though it remains small. There has always been a tremendous work ethic in East Wall as a result of the availability of jobs, casual or permanent, in the port. Many of those employed in our company are those we started off with. We work together. I dislike the coldness of the approach used in Irish Glass.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the introduction of this legislation. It is not always that I concur with Senator White, who made a good contribution. This is important legislation. I referred earlier on the Order of Business &ndash; many Senators have previously referred to this &ndash; to a particular aspect which may be the nub of any problems that may arise with this legislation, namely, retrospection.</P>
      <P>Castlecomer is a unique part of the country in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan" hpid="Mr. J. Phelan Mr. J. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Mansergh is aware of that. Long ago, there was an established tradition of coal mining in north Kilkenny and the greater Castlecomer area in particular. However, the mines in that district became redundant in the 1960s and 1970s. As a result there is no longer a coal mining industry in the Castlecomer area. The population in that corner of north Kilkenny is quite large. I was recently told by the local council that it is the most densely populated rural part of Ireland. It has unique settlement patterns and is a unique community primarily made up of working class Church of Ireland people who came to the area when the mines were operational. That is unique when one looks at it in the context of a 26 county Ireland. Such communities are not found in many areas.</P>
      <P>We were informed before Christmas that Comerama, a factory set up in the area when the mines closed, was to close. The loss of that factory in an area which traditionally has a higher level of unemployment than the rest of Kilkenny, and considerably higher than the national average, was particularly hard. Following that announcement, I attended a meeting in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Aylward &ndash; a Member of the Dáil representing Carlow-Kilkenny &ndash; Deputies John McGuinness, Phil Hogan and Seamus Pattison, Senator Fergal Browne, two local councillors, representatives of the workers of Comerama and officials from that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was my understanding from that meeting that this Bill would apply retrospectively to the <Col N="1484" />workers in Comerama. That view was clearly spelled out at the meeting. I understand Deputy McGuinness circulated a letter to the workers of Comerama &ndash; I hold up my hands, I should have done likewise &ndash; stating that this legislation would look favourably on their predicament and would apply retrospectively. He did so on the clear understanding that what the Minister said would hold. It now appears that does not hold. I find that extraordinary.</P>
    <P>I have often pointed out that people have a cynical attitude towards politics and politicians. People will quite rightly be cynical of politics and politicians if, following publication of relevant legislation, what was promised is not to be delivered upon. I am in complete agreement with Deputy McGuinness's understanding of what was promised. I am concerned that the Minister appears to be back-tracking on what she said at that meeting.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Senator White's remarks in relation to the Irish Glass factory in Dublin and the predicament in which workers there find themselves. I have never had the experience of losing a job and I hope I never do. It is a stressful time for all concerned. Commitments entered into following that stressful period should be honoured. For the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as deputy leader of the Government, to give an understanding at a meeting and then to renege on it is completely wrong and unjustifiable. I stand four-square behind the workers in Castlecomer who feel aggrieved that their legitimate claims are to be ignored.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech referred to legal advice she had received from the Attorney General's office. That advice may be accurate and true but why was it not sought prior to the meeting in question? To build up people's expectations and to cut them down shortly afterwards is not a nice thing to do, to say the very least. I regret that retrospection will not apply. I appeal to Government Senators to look favourably upon the amendment in the name of my colleague, Senator Coghlan, which deals with this issue. It is not too much to ask that some leeway be given on such a sensitive issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation as a step forward but we must look seriously at the issue of retrospection with a view to improving the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's speech. I also welcome the Minister of State to the House. For the purposes of moving the debate, I wish to pick up on some points made by Senator John Phelan. As I said earlier, Castlecomer is an attractive place. Any time I want to avoid the main Dublin-Cork road I go through Castlecomer and Athy. Senator Phelan made some interesting points about Castlcomer's history. However, he is being unfair to the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every elected representative is in the position where they have to listen sympathetically to cases where serious difficulties have arisen. One often <Col N="1485" />undertakes to look into something, to do the best one can and to give sympathetic consideration to a proposition. To be fair to Senator John Phelan, he used the word &ldquo;appears&rdquo;. It is quite clear that if the Tánaiste had made a commitment, she would have said so and the Senator would be able to document and prove it. However, it is clear from the language he is using that the Tánaiste did not make any such commitment.</P>
    <P>I would be sympathetic, <i>in abstracto,</i> to Senator Coghlan's amendment about retrospective payments. I wonder, apart from the legal advice, whether, even in a practical industrial relations sense, it would be practicable. What point in the past would one select? In some cases, companies may have dissolved or disbanded and, in such circumstances, would responsibility revert to the State? If one adopts different dates or different places, difficulties of equity would arise. Unless the Government can persuade me otherwise, I would have thought a start-up date is the best basis on which to operate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation, which I see as one of the fruits of social partnership and, in particular, the most recent social partnership agreement. There is a pre-history to this matter because, as redundancies started arising, the statutory minimum payment was becoming increasingly out of line with reality. Employers always had the option of returning to the minimum requirement, but the statutory redundancy payments given in the vast majority of cases were way above that requirement.</P>
    <P>I recall having a considerable number of discussions on this matter with the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Tom Kitt, when the Fianna Fáil manifesto was being drawn up. The manifesto stated that the statutory redundancy scheme would be comprehensively reviewed with a view to implementing key improvements. Great though the temptation was to include the term &ldquo;two weeks&rdquo;, the latter was not actually done. Opposition Members occasionally claim that all sorts of specific promises were made which, in fact, was not the case. This is an illustration of an instance where a degree of due caution was exercised.</P>
    <P>If that was cautious, the programme for Government was even more cautious because it stated that, under the section on improving the conditions of employment, &ldquo;the recommendations of the review of the statutory redundancy scheme will be examined with a view to implementation&rdquo;. Everyone understood that this was something that had to be negotiated between employers and trade unions. The outcome is a real and satisfactory achievement.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, more jobs are likely to be lost now than was the case two or three years ago when the Celtic tiger economy was at its height. It is important that when tragic events &ndash; tragic for the individuals involved, in any event &ndash; such as plant closures occur, the situation should not be made worse with industrial relations disputes over redundancy payments. As sure as hell that <Col N="1486" />is not an advertisement for a particular location for which replacement industries are being sought. That is the situation in many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to Ballinasloe, while Senator John Phelan spoke about Castlecomer. I am going to refer to Tipperary, where two thirds of the jobs at the PAL factory were recently lost. When we went to the factory after the announcement was made, a trade union representative &ndash; a Labour Party councillor who worked there &ndash; told us that at least the redundancy payments were reasonably generous and that they would not be an issue. That is important because the objective in these situations is for communities and workforces to pull themselves up on to their feet as quickly as possible. It is also important for the State agencies concerned to come together to find promptly replacement employment for Ballinasloe, Castlecomer, Tipperary and other areas. Messy situations should be avoided.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a much better floor than previously existed. Senator White has said that, in a large number of cases, it is a bit like the statutory minimum wage. Employers in general pay their workers far more than the statutory minimum wage. Similarly, most of them will pay more than the statutory redundancy allowance. Nonetheless, it is important to have a more realistic floor than exists at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a vindication of the social partnership process. It is difficult to see whether, in the absence of that process, we would necessarily have obtained the agreement that makes this legislation possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely legislation. I also welcome the fact that all Stages are being dealt with in the House this week. I hope the Bill has a speedy passage through the Houses because sensitive redundancy negotiations are taking place in Letterkenny at the Unify plant, where 250 workers were laid off three weeks ago.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh asked where the cut-off point in terms of retrospective redundancy allowances should be located. Perhaps we could start with Castlecomer, where people were made redundant before Christmas. In light of those recent redundancies and the fact that the legislation could have been before the House two to three weeks ago, I support Senator Coghlan's amendment on retrospective payments for people who were made redundant at the beginning of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members are being very parochial by referring to counties Tipperary, Kilkenny and Galway. People in County Donegal are suffering from serious difficulties as a result of the decline of the traditional textile sector. This is the situation which we have been faced with over these last five or six years, even during the so-called Celtic tiger period. The Celtic tiger did not arrive in County Donegal. Perhaps it visited Bundoran on <Col N="1487" />one of the hot days during the summer, but it did not come to the county during the boom years.</P>
    <P>We set up a task force under the leadership of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. The document produced by that task force outlined how we would face the challenges ahead of us, how we would develop more sophisticated and new products and how we would move away from sectors &ndash; such as the textile sector &ndash; which were in decline. That document is collecting dust on a shelf in the county council office in Lifford. Donegal suffered tremendously during the years of the Celtic tiger and it is mired in quicksand in terms of the provision of jobs in the future. That is not to mention retaining the employment that exists in the county at present.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste must take this situation seriously. We must sit down with our local authorities, possibly using the forum of the Seanad, to consider the possibility of providing alternative industries in County Donegal. We must look at high-tech and high-value industries and also at the tourism product on offer in the county. We need to tap into existing resources and move away from the declining traditional sectors of employment.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to speak only in bleak terms. Opportunities exist in County Donegal. For example, a 144 kilometre stretch of the county lies adjacent to the North and a number of cross-Border opportunities exist. There are business opportunities and investments that can be made through the peace process. I referred to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement on this morning's Order of Business, which is very much in evidence in County Donegal through its working relationship with Derry. However, we must explore fresh opportunities.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation, so fundamental for people losing their jobs. As Senator Mansergh said, it is a sensitive and delicate area and we have to be sympathetic. I would like this Bill to go through the other House by next week and to be signed off as quickly as possible, because there are people depending on it.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern): I thank all the Senators who have contributed to the debate this afternoon, especially the Opposition Members welcoming this legislation. It is recognised by all Members of the House and the social partners that there is a need to update the statutory redundancy provisions, which is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of questions were raised by speakers. The first, by Senator Leyden, related to the repayment of the 60% should an employee refuse to sign the document. The Department will repay the amount provided that the employer can demonstrate that the amount was paid. For example, if one had the returned pay cheque &ndash; which one would now have to request from the banks since <Col N="1488" />they have changed their system &ndash; that would be proof that the money was paid.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke asked when the Bill would come into effect. For the employees to qualify for the changes in the Bill, the date is 25 May, and employees issued with notice of redundancy on that date or later will be entitled to the enhanced payments, i.e. two weeks' pay for each year of service, plus the bonus week. Senator Burke also raised questions regarding retrospection. It has been explained by the Tánaiste that the legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General is that the payment of statutory redundancy lump sums is a legal requirement for employers and could not be imposed on them with retrospective effect. Employers are entitled to due notice of the intention to legally require them to pay enhanced rates. The new Redundancy Act has to be brought into effect by ministerial order after enactment by the Oireachtas, and this cannot be made retrospective.</P>
    <P>Senator John Phelan referred to the meeting with the public representatives from Kilkenny. As was eloquently noted by Senator Mansergh, Senator Phelan said the &ldquo;impression&rdquo; he got was that the Tánaiste promised retrospection. According to the minutes, what the Tánaiste actually said was that she would use her best endeavours to get the best possible deal for workers. The impression being given by some people that there was a cast-iron commitment to retrospection does not hold water. Otherwise I am sure that Senator Phelan and his colleagues would be declaring that from the mountain-tops.</P>

      <P>Gremlins crept into the works at the printers. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I should explain that I too was somewhat remiss, because I meant that date, and cannot propose an amendment to my amendment. For the record, the date I had intended, and was asked to insert, was 28 November, the date on which the workers at Comerama signed their RP1 form.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal in the Bill to simplify the application form process. At the height of their distress on being made redundant, workers had up to three forms to complete; now there will be only one. Workers signed the form on 28 November, following which a meeting was held with the Tánaiste, to which I was not a party but of which I have been made aware, which was attended by the elected representatives of the people of Kilkenny and some worker representatives. I am not making any personal allegations but workers understood that an assurance had been given. That is the only reason for my call for retrospection.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Mansergh said in regard to this being one of the fruits of social partnership. The fund was quite large and I would like to know what happened to it. Perhaps the State could pick up the tab in this instance because of the assurance given. I am reliably informed that a Government Deputy present at the meeting wrote to every worker and apparently gave a guarantee in this regard. While I have not seen his letter, I accept what I have been told. There was a belief in regard to this assurance, the reason I move the amendment.</P>
      <P>People feel strongly about this matter. Perhaps there are other instances, although I am not saying that is the case.</P>

As I said to her, where does one draw the line in regard to this matter? While the date of 28 November affects the employees in Castlecomer, there are employees in Roscommon and elsewhere who have also been made redundant over the past year or so who will not qualify under the Bill.

      <P>There were great difficulties and then other issues arose. The State can legally make <i>ex gratia</i> payments. The representative allowance for local authority members dated from the day the Minister published the Bill &ndash; that was retrospection &ndash; not the date on which it was actually passed. In this case, the Tánaiste has outlined that 25 May is the soonest date on which the President can sign the Bill. To put matters in context, one cannot legally impose a liability on employers to provide for retrospection. That is a fact, on which we should be clear. The Tánaiste's goodwill lies with the workers. She tried to do her utmost for them but was advised by the Attorney General that it was not possible. I hope there will be some way of resolving this issue and that workers will receive some form of <i>ex gratia</i> payments, particularly where employers did not pay above and beyond statutory redundancy payments. Let us be quite clear about this &ndash; if they paid above and beyond statutory redundancy payments, there are no grounds for an <i>ex gratia</i> or back payment. We will, I hope, do this. I accept that Senator Coghlan should revise the date to get it right but we will not accept his amendment.</P>

      <P>Obviously, we would all like if we could do something in regard to retrospection because we all know areas of the country where jobs have been lost. To be fair, as has been pointed out by Senator Leyden, in many cases retrospection would not make any difference <Col N="1493" />because the terms are above the new threshold which has been raised to a more realistic floor, similar to the position with regard to the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>The reason I am intervening now is what was said by Senator Ulick Burke and other Fine Gael Senators threw some light on the political discourse of recent months. If there is any spin doctoring, it is on the part of those converting goodwill and sympathy into cast iron commitments and then alleging that those commitments have been broken or that there have been U-turns and so on.</P>

However, in the debate Senators have alleged that something much more concrete was promised. I welcome this discussion as it throws some light on the political debate. There has been gross exaggeration of what was promised or committed. This is being used as a stick to beat the Government. That is a good illustration of what has been going on.</P>

On Second Stage, I asked the Minister of State to request the Minister to address the anomaly in regard to the staged closure of a particular activity, whereby some workers opted to go early while others would remain past 25 May. There is room for a special investigation to address this matter. Had the workers known that the changes would be made they might have decided other than they did. I will not refer specifically to the issue as it affects workers in Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State take special cognisance of this? The Tánaiste was in the presence of public representatives, workers and management when she gave an undertaking. She gave an undertaking &ndash; not in terms of a redundancy situation &ndash; that she would help in every way possible. She did so and I acknowledge <Col N="1494" />that. She recognised the need of people, the trauma they were experiencing and the fact that this problem had revisited Ballinasloe for a second time after the original task force had failed to deliver anything.</P>
      <P>I asked that the Tánaiste would report on the matter in person so that there could be no misinterpretation. If we are at a loss for an interpretation, we can always call on Senator Leyden for his particular interpretation in support of the Tánaiste.</P>

      <P>In view of all the undertakings given and the support from other agencies, I am requesting that the Tánaiste give an up-to-date appraisal of all progress, or the lack thereof, since 15 January, when the town experienced this blow. The latter is directly related to the amendment in that people are caught in a catch-22 situation. That is one instance where the overlap will differentiate between, on one hand, workers who remain on &ndash; after 25 May in this instance &ndash; by choice and in support of the company, which has been a good employer over many years, and, on the other, those who left early, thereby easing the difficulty. There is a dilemma in that regard which has to be addressed and I would appreciate if the Minister of State would do so.</P>

There were no cuts until after the election &ndash; it was all a matter of adjustments. At this stage, even the Government recognises the extent of the cuts which have been made in practically everything. Even the manifesto has been cut at this stage.</P>
      <P>As one who personally experienced redundancy &ndash; having worked for 22 years with one company and received statutory redundancy of less than &euro;6,000 when it closed &ndash; I welcome the Bill as an advance on the dark ages in terms of redundancy payments. I appeal to the Tánaiste to take retrospection into consideration, if possible, in this instance, having regard to her statement &ndash; I will not even say &ldquo;commitment&rdquo;&ndash; to do the best she could, as interpreted from the other side of the House. I ask that she do the best she can. Senator Leyden said that an <i>ex gratia </i>payment can be made by the State to the workers. If that is possible, I urge the Tánaiste to do so on a retrospective basis.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment, having regard to legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. First, as the payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is a legal requirement on employers, it could not <Col N="1495" />be imposed on them with retrospective effect. Employers are entitled to due notice of intention to legally require them to pay enhanced rates. Second, the new redundancy Act has to be brought into effect by ministerial order, after enactment by the Oireachtas. This cannot be made retrospective. It should also be noted that, in discussions on the new programme, it was accepted by the parties that retrospection would not be introduced in the Bill.</P>

The Senator's colleague, Senator John Phelan, who attended that particular meeting, stated earlier this afternoon that he was under the impression that the Tánaiste may have said she would apply retrospection.

I am simply suggesting that the Tánaiste and her Department advisers should look at every <Col N="1496" />possible aspect in every file in respect of past payments. I am not saying the Tánaiste can, in this legislation, make provision for retrospective payments to the workers in Castlecomer. It was her good intention that if she could achieve that, she would have achieved it. She has to stand by the law and adhere to the advice of the Attorney General. Why detract from the goodwill of the Tánaiste and her support for the provision of alternative employment in the area concerned? Why try to undermine her efforts?</P>

    <P>Mr. U. Burke: She was a dab hand at that in her day.</P>
    <P>Acting Chairman: Please, Senator Burke.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: I thank the Chair for its protection. If the Tánaiste did not have the goodwill to offer support and hope to those concerned, she could easily have said that under no circumstances could she consider such a system. The position is clear. If anybody present at the meeting interpreted it in terms other than a goodwill gesture to the workers, subject to checking with her Department, they are simply under a misapprehension with regard to the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh has dealt with the point in respect of our manifesto, which is very accurate. The Fine Gael party is fortunate that it did not get into Government. It would have had one hell of a job&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. U. Burke: The Government had to clean up its own mess this time, for a change.</P>
    <P>Mr. Leyden: &mdash;to actually deliver. Candidates representing that party gave a commitment, as I will remind them regularly. They were going to compensate me for the few&mdash;</P>

    <P>Acting Chairman: I do not consider it relevant.</P>

    <P>Mr. Leyden: No, I am just trying to be helpful.</P>
    <P>Mr. Coghlan: I appreciate the Senator's suggestion and I was about to offer to withdraw my <Col N="1497" />amendment in favour of a proposal which could, perhaps, have the same effect for those who believed they had a commitment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern): I welcome the supportive comments of the Senators who have spoken. We all want to achieve a reasonable level of increased statutory payment to employees who are unlucky and lose their jobs through redundancy. As well as giving increased payments to redundant employees, the Bill will, when enacted, amend the insolvency payments legislation to allow employees of insolvent companies to claim their minimum notice entitlements through a liquidator without having to obtain an award from the Employment Appeals Tribunal. As I said, the Bill will come into effect on Sunday, 25 May 2003, or as soon as possible thereafter, for employees declared redundant on or after that date. The date on which an employee is declared redundant is the date on which notice of the proposed redundancy is issued to him or her. I thank Senators for their help in ensuring the Bill was passed speedily by this House.</P>

I omitted to mention that the Bill, which I described as being like the proverbial curate's egg, was in gestation for a short period. While I outlined its negative aspects, I welcome it in an overall sense as a measure that takes us out of the Dark Ages, as someone else said. It is a worthwhile improvement. I explained on behalf of my colleagues, rather than as a result of any personal sense of upset, that certain commitments appeared to have been given. I thought that Senator Leyden <Col N="1499" />might make a proposal or suggestion in relation to <i>ex gratia</i> payments that would have taken me and perhaps all Senators out of a hole.</P>

I thank the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, for bringing it forward. This absolutely wonderful legislation will be most helpful for those who face difficulties in the future. I hope the Government, which should be very proud, will receive recognition from the media for bringing the Bill forward in conjunction with the social partners. The Government, which has been courageous in this regard, does not receive enough recognition when it implements its policies. This legislation is welcome and worthwhile. People are affected when grants are withdrawn; for example, they may have benefited if their applications had been made by a certain date.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea): Joint investigation teams have, for many years, been a feature of international co-operation in investigating cross-border crime, especially organised crime. They have generally been set up on the basis of understandings between the responsible competent authorities, without an internationally agreed framework for establishing and operating the teams. This Bill will enable effect to be given in Irish law to an agreement at European Union level which attempts to ensure that international boundaries are not used by criminal gangs to their advantage.</P>
    <P>Organised criminal groups exploit modern day phenomena such as globalisation, an increasingly border-free world and rapid technological advances in computers and communications. They traffic illegal drugs, women and children for forced labour and sexual exploitation, and launder huge amounts of money arising from these activities. Their operations inflict harm on citizens and societies worldwide, as well as threatening economic and social stability.</P>
    <P>Crime does not respect national borders. Organised criminals are increasingly more sophisticated and regularly use EU-wide or international networks to carry out their activities. Faced with this reality, EU governments are aware that they cannot effectively tackle international organised crime by relying solely on national law enforcement agencies. At the heart of the European fight against organised crime is better and closer co-operation between the national law enforcement agencies and, in particular, between the national police services. In Vienna, in December 1998, the European Council agreed an action plan on how best to make the Union an area of freedom, security and justice for its citizens. The Tampere European Council took this further in October 1999 by deciding on a comprehensive approach to reinforce the fight against serious organised crime.</P>
    <P>This included a number of new initiatives designed to foster practical police co-operation. A European police college, for example, was set up to train the next generation of senior police officers, to enable them to get to know their counterparts in other European countries and to enable them to become familiar with working in <Col N="1501" />a European context. The college has opened initially as a network of national police colleges.</P>
    <P>Other Tampere initiatives included the creation of a task force of European police chiefs. This has helped to create personal links between the heads of national police services in EU countries. The chiefs are probably now more willing and able to lift the telephone to discuss practical problems and joint operations with their opposite numbers in neighbouring and nearby countries. The regular meetings of the police chiefs should result in a more spontaneous input, and in closer co-operation, between national police services in the EU member states. Both the training and police chiefs' initiatives should help considerably in the practical implementation of joint investigations of serious crime as envisaged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The European Council was anxious to ensure that maximum benefit should be derived from co-operation between the member states' authorities when investigating cross-border crime in any member state. The Council called for joint investigation teams, as foreseen in the treaty, to be set up without delay, as a first step, to combat trafficking in drugs and human beings as well as international terrorism.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in Article 13 of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between member states of the European Union for the establishment of such teams. That convention was signed in May 2000. Following the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the Council of the European Union considered that joint investigation teams should be set up as a matter of priority in order to combat offences committed by terrorists and organised crime generally and that a specific and legally binding instrument providing for such teams should be adopted at the earliest opportunity. Accordingly, the text of Article 13 of the mutual assistance convention, together with Articles 15 and 16 which make provision for criminal and civil liability, were brought forward in the form of a framework decision.</P>
    <P>All member states agree on the particular need to tackle organised criminals. The European Union has a co-ordinated action plan to cover the years 2000-04. It is designed to put more emphasis on prevention and on reducing drugs demand. However, it also aims to reinforce the fight against organised crime and to strengthen police and customs co-operation. The establishment of joint investigation teams, as necessary, is an essential element in this fight.</P>
    <P>Trafficking in persons, especially women and children for sexual purposes, is also an odious crime. Unfortunately, it is widespread and growing. Recent tragic experiences in this country show that we are not immune from being targeted in this respect by organised criminal gangs. Recent successful prosecutions abroad show also the value and the benefit of international co-operation in this area. The provisions of this Bill also interact with a number of the recommendations of the Patten report on policing in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" />The full text of the EU Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 is contained in the Schedule to the Bill. The framework decision provides, by mutual agreement of the competent authorities of two or more member states, for the setting up of joint investigation teams for a specific purpose and limited period, to carry out criminal investigations in one or more of the member states setting up the team.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill defines some of the key terms used throughout the Bill. Section 2 provides that the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána will be the competent authority for the State for the purposes of the council framework decision, except where a judicial authority is required by another state for the making or receiving of a request, in which case the Minister, not the Commissioner, will be the competent authority.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the establishment of joint investigation teams by the State where the Irish competent authority is satisfied that an offence has been committed, or that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been committed, in the State and the investigation of the offence or suspected offence has links with another member state or states; that conduct which would constitute an offence if it occurred in the State has occurred, or there are reasonable grounds for suspicion that the conduct has occurred partly in the State and partly in another member state; and that where there are reasonable grounds for believing that it would be in the public interest to establish a joint investigation team because it is anticipated or is the case that at least some part of the investigation will be conducted in the State and the investigation requires co-ordinated and concerted action with another member state or states, it may request the relevant competent authority or authorities of the other member state or states to establish a joint investigation team. Section 4 provides for the establishment of joint investigation teams on receipt of requests from other member states and contains provisions which are similar in nature to those contained in section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains provisions relating to the establishment and termination of joint investigation teams and in relation to the agreement governing the establishment of such teams. A joint investigation team can be established for a specific purpose and for a limited period which can be extended for such periods as are agreed by the competent authorities concerned. A team can operate for as long as is necessary for the purpose of conducting the investigation concerned and parts of the team can operate in more than one member state at the same time. Provision is also made for member states to join a team which has already been established. The agreement to establish the team can be amended to reflect changing needs in relation to any of these matters. The final subsection of this section allows a joint investigation team to be terminated when the purposes for which it was established <Col N="1503" />have been achieved or when there is no further benefit to be gained from its continued operation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with membership of a joint investigation team and the terms and conditions of such membership, including remuneration and allowances. National membership can be drawn from the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise, the Revenue Commissioners, other Departments and persons who, in the opinion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have experience or expertise relevant to the investigation concerned.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána and civil servants will continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions of employment as they were subject to immediately before they became members of the team. Provision is made for the removal of members from the team by the Commissioner in the case of members of the Garda Síochána, or by the Minister, at the Commissioner's request, in the case of other team members. Members of the Garda Síochána and officers of Customs and Excise will continue to be vested with and can exercise their Garda or Customs and Excise powers while operating as members of a team.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the operation of a joint investigation team. A team will perform its functions in accordance with the law of the state of operation. In Ireland, a team will operate under the control and general superintendence of the Garda Commissioner who will make the necessary organisational arrangements, including the appointment of a team leader. Team members, including seconded members, will perform their functions under the direction and control of the team leader.</P>
    <P>While Article 1.6 of the framework decision provides for discretion as to whether or not seconded members of a joint investigation team are to be entrusted with the task of taking certain investigative measures in the host state, it is not intended to provide for such an option in the case of a joint investigation team operating here.</P>
    <P>Section 7(4) contains the necessary prohibition. This is in line with the practice being adopted in other member states in respect of the role of seconded members in joint investigation teams. Seconded members may be present, however, when investigative measures are taken, unless otherwise decided by the team leader. Evidence obtained during the course of an investigation will remain in the possession of the Garda Síochána or, if not already in its possession, will be taken into its possession.</P>
    <P>Section 7(7), (8) and (9) provide for one of the more innovative aspects of the Bill in that where investigative measures are required by a joint investigation team in one of the member states involved in the team, seconded members can request their own national authorities to take such measures. This means it will not be necessary for the member state of operation to submit a formal request for mutual assistance to another <Col N="1504" />member state. The relevant measures sought will be considered in the member state in question in accordance with the conditions which would apply had the measures been sought in a national investigation. In order to give effect to this, subsection (7) provides that evidence which is obtained directly by a seconded member operating in the State from his or her competent authority of appointment will be considered as if it had been obtained on foot of a mutual assistance request made under section 52 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. Provision is also made in subsections (8) and (9) for a member of the Garda Síochána who is operating as a seconded member in another member state to make a request, on behalf of the team, for mutual assistance under section 51 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 or for a search warrant authorising entry, search and seizure under section 55(4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</P>
    <P>Another innovative measure is provided for in section 7(11), which allows a member of a joint investigation team operating as a seconded member in another member state to provide to that team information which is available in the State and which is relevant to the investigation being conducted by the team. This will only be possible where it can be undertaken within the scope of national law and within the limits of the team member's competence.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the written agreement for the establishment of a joint investigation team and lists the provisions which must be included in any agreement &ndash; the parties to the agreement, the purpose for which the team is established, the identity of the person or persons to be investigated, if known, details of membership of the team and financial arrangements. Provision is also made for the agreement to be amended to allow for issues such as the extension of the period of operation, changes of membership, etc.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for additional assistance and expertise to be provided to a joint investigation team by appropriate persons, or participants, from EU bodies or from authorities of countries other than member states. Participants can be drawn from Europol, bodies established under Title VI of the European Union such as Eurojust, the European Commission or other institutions of the European Union and from authorities of countries, other than member states, which have been designated by the Minister. The role of participants is similar to that of seconded members and like seconded members, they will not be permitted to take investigative measures.</P>
    <P>Section 10 amends the Garda Síochána Act 1989 in order to allow the Garda Commissioner to assign a member of the Garda Síochána as a member of a joint investigation team abroad. It also provides for the making of regulations to allow for the registration of his or her death, or of the birth or death of a member of his or her family, while serving in that capacity outside the State.</P>
    <P>Section 11 is concerned with the use of infor<Col N="1505" />mation lawfully obtained by any member of a joint investigation team which is not otherwise available to the competent authorities of the member states that established the team. Such information can only be used for the purposes for which the team was established. It may be used in other circumstances, but only where the prior consent of the member state in which such information became available has been obtained or where the member state has been informed. Consent to use of the information for the detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences other than those in respect of which the team was established may be withheld where it would be likely to prejudice criminal investigations being conducted in the State or where a request for mutual assistance or co-operation could be refused under the international co-operation provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 12 makes provision for criminal liability in respect of offences committed by or against seconded members while they are operating in the State as part of a joint investigation team. Specific provision is made for seconded members who are also members of a foreign police force in that they will be deemed to be members of the Garda Síochána for the purpose of criminal liability.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the satisfaction of civil claims which may arise from operations carried out by members from another member state operating in the State as part of a joint investigation team and also by Irish members operating abroad. The State will reimburse another member state in full for any amount paid in respect of injury, loss or damage caused by our national members in the performance of their duties as seconded members. The State will also pay compensation or damages or provide any other appropriate remedy for any injury, loss or damage caused by seconded members in the State in the same way as would apply with regard to injury, loss or damage caused by national members. The State may seek reimbursement of any compensation or damages it has paid or other loss incurred from the member state which appointed the seconded members or from third parties who may be liable for injury, loss or damage caused.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides that the Act is without prejudice to any other agreements or provisions that exist regarding the establishment or operation of joint investigation teams. Section 15 is a standard provision providing for the payment of expenses out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 16 repeals section 5 of the Europol Act 1997 as a consequence of the provisions contained in section 10.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a standard provision dealing with the short title and commencement. As far as commencement is concerned, it would be my intention, and I am sure it is the wish of this House, that the Bill will be brought into effect as quickly as possible, on enactment. That completes my <Col N="1506" />detailed statement on the purpose and main provisions of the Bill which I commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State for the debate on the Bill. I will make a number of points about it and I would like the Minister of State to comment on them.</P>
      <P>I would welcome any Bill to tackle the problems of organised crime and terrorism, but this Bill makes few changes to the criminal law. It simply provides a statutory basis for the way in which the joint investigation teams will be set up and operate. I wonder whether this has come about as a gesture, internationally, to tackle terrorism, particularly since the awful events of 11 September 2001.</P>
      <P>Under current legislation, it is already possible to do what is set out in the Bill. There is nothing stopping our police force investigating matters in another country and forces in other countries can investigate matters here. That co-operation still exists and the Europol system has worked well in that regard. Will the Minister explain how these investigation teams will operate differently from the current system under Part VII of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and the Europol Act of 1997? I understand that the Bill is not being driven by the Government, but that it came about on foot of a directive from the EU Council framework decision with which we have to deal. I wish to criticise the way the Government has chosen to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Section 2 designates the Garda Commissioner as the competent authority. We are all aware of the crime statistics currently available, particularly in respect of violent street crimes. Nobody can deny that Garda resources are over-stretched. That problem was not helped when the Government reneged on its pre-election promise to provide an additional 2,000 gardaí.</P>
      <P>This legislation does nothing to address the problem of Garda resources. No provision is made for the allocation of additional resources to enable the Garda to discharge the considerable burden placed upon it by the Bill. Day in, day out, Senators call for measures to be put in place to enable the Garda to carry out its duties more efficiently. The most frequent call is for the recruitment of additional gardaí. What pressure will the legislation put on Garda resources, which are overstretched?</P>
      <P>I refer to the duration and cost of investigations. Operationally, the Bill has the potential to result in a proliferation of lengthy, joint investigations consuming considerable Garda time. There is complete flexibility for extending the duration of investigations under section 5(1). The period of extension should be limited to one further term or longer in consultation with the Minister because the Bill could give rise to excessively lengthy investigations. Garda drug operations are fully costed prior to sanction. There are good reasons to provide a costing mechanism under the legislation. I would like the Minister of State to comment on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1507" />Under section 2(1) the Garda Commissioner has been designated as the competent authority but under section 2(2) the Minister shall be the competent authority for the purpose of making requests to competent authorities in other jurisdictions. I cannot understand this. If the Commissioner is capable of being the competent authority, why is he not allowed to be the competent authority for all aspects of the legislation? Does this reflect a rift between the Minister and the Commissioner or a mistrust of the Commissioner? An explanation is needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not mention that this policy was supposed to have been implemented by 1 January 2003. How strong is his commitment to the Bill? Is it the correct mechanism for dealing with investigation teams? Perhaps they would be better dealt with under the proposed Garda Bill. Given that the legislation is late, should we not wait another few months and deal with investigation teams in the correct context?</P>
    <P>A significant portion of the explanatory memorandum, particularly sections 3 and 4, reads more like the heads of a Bill and is difficult for ordinary people, including myself, to read. The Law Reform Commission states the text of legislation should not be cited in the explanatory memorandum and that layman's language should be used. Those are the points I have to make. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. As Senator Terry mentioned, he is a frequent visitor to the House which is indicative of the number of Bills emanating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This Bill is to be welcomed as it gives effect in Irish law to the requirements of the EU Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 which resulted from the call at the 1999 European Council for the establishment of joint investigation teams, as envisaged under Article 30 of the Treaty on European Union. Joint investigation teams can be set up by mutual agreement for specific purposes over a limited time by two or more member states.</P>
      <P>There has been harmonisation in many areas since Ireland's accession to the European Union which has benefited citizens throughout the Union. There are many fine examples of this such as the Common Agricultural Policy. While farming is going through a difficult period, the harmonisation of agricultural policy has benefited farmers throughout the Union. Harmonisation of competition and consumer legislation has benefited citizens as well as free trade and the free movement of people. Labour law and environmental controls have also been harmonised. Co-operation in law enforcement is welcome while harmonisation of laws within the Union and the protection of citizens are moves in the right direction, which I hope will be fully supported by the Minister of State and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation is eminently sensible. The crimi<Col N="1508" />nal fraternity does not allow national borders or boundaries to curtail its activities. Therefore, if law enforcement agents are not allowed to operate on a level playing pitch, they will be seriously disadvantaged. There have been many debates on crime in the House recently and it has been acknowledged by the Garda Commissioner that organised crime is presenting a major challenge to many societies. Ireland is feeling the effects of such crime because of its newly found affluence.</P>
    <P>Drugs, for example, are the scourge of many societies, particularly among young people in urban areas. Those involved in the drugs trade are extremely well organised and police activity is often directed at addicts and low-level drug pushers. It is not easy to catch the godfathers, although the Criminal Assets Bureau has provided a role model for other states. The bureau has been effective and I hope there will not be a judicial decision that will hamper its positive activities. Officials from other EU member states have visited Ireland to examine its establishment and operations with a view to employing a similar body within their jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>Organised crime operates at international level and all the gangs have strong connections to the drugs trade. The violent nature of the crimes committed is anathema to most and there have been many debates on the issue. Life is a cheap currency in the eyes of those involved in organised crime. There have been gangland murders in Dublin and Limerick, yet members of the drug gangs and their hitmen are free to walk the streets and pose a hazard to ordinary law abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>If we compare the reaction to the murder of Veronica Guerin, which was the spur to the setting up of the Criminal Assets Bureau, with the low-level outcry to the assassination of Brian Fitzgerald in Limerick who was playing his part to try to protect young people from the scourge of drugs, it raises questions. One hopes the loss of his life will be treated equally as a milestone in tackling this kind of organised crime.</P>
    <P>It is important that the State recognises that its first duty is to protect its citizens. Any legal constraints must not be so tight as to obstruct investigation or detection. In a democracy we must balance this duty against the rights of individuals. Sometimes one feels the pendulum must be reset to cope with the current climate of crime.</P>
    <P>We have also seen trafficking in people, to which the Minister of State referred. The problem is continental-wide. In my area, Wexford and Waterford, we have seen the adverse effects of trafficking with the loss of human life when people suffocated in containers. This shows the gay abandon of criminals towards the protection of human life. This issue must be tackled on a cross-border, cross-community basis. The remit and provisions of the Bill will facilitate better targeting.</P>
    <P>We have seen recent reports on the burgeoning sex industry where girls, particularly from eastern bloc countries, have been lured abroad to various <Col N="1509" />western European countries, including Ireland. Organised crime is strongly involved. The collapse of the communist regimes in the eastern bloc, while welcomed by all who espouse democracy, has had the adverse effect of involving people, particularly some who were involved in state security, in organised crime. The Russian and eastern bloc mafia present a significant challenge to the European Union. With the accession of countries in that region this problem will require priority and the attention of the Community to ensure mafia tentacles are not strengthened as a consequence of accession.</P>
    <P>The events and atrocities of 11 September 2001 shocked the whole world. In response politicians looked to see what they could do. One of their best efforts is absolute co-operation between security forces. The European Union will expand to 25 countries and seek co-operation between police forces. I am concerned that some of the eastern bloc countries were part of left wing socialist totalitarian regimes. It is imperative that the culture which might have pertained in the past and which perhaps the transition has fuelled is not allowed to continue and grow in the future. Any links with crime must be stopped.</P>
    <P>We had a discussion not so long ago on the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill which implements the cross-Border aspects of the Patten report. The Bill, for which there was broad support in the House for the measures contained in it, facilitates personnel exchanges between the two police forces and a pooling of investigative teams after major incidents with a cross-Border dimension. It also allows PSNI members to apply for senior positions within the Garda Síochána and the converse. It is part of the ongoing co-operation taking place, an arrangement, I am sure, it will enhance.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on recent public disclosures of events in the North involving the security forces. We have seen part of the Stevens report which shows evidence of collusion between members of the security forces and paramilitaries. The recent reports in regard to an agent called Stakeknife raise fundamental issues regarding the role of the state in the maintenance of law. Some would regard this as better left unsaid, a view to which I do not subscribe. We are at a sensitive stage in the peace process but if we build that process on sand, its sustainability into the future would be in greater danger than it might otherwise be.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the events in which the British state, in particular, was involved will be admitted. There have been many calls for co-operation with the Barron inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. While there is a perception that there is a concealment of illegal activity by the state, it undermines the whole process of law enforcement. We must try to reach a situation where people can concede and admit the wrongs done, make the appropriate apologies and then move on, but let us not do so in a vacuum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" />I raise these points, particularly what happened in the well developed British democracy over many years and the illegal activity in which that state was involved, and the activities which now present a major challenge within the eastern bloc countries, to see how they can be best addressed in the European Union context. Perhaps the Minister of State will consider a situation where the European Union would establish a regulatory authority which would have an over-arching role with regard to the compliance of enforcement agencies within member states with proper ethical standards and criteria applying. There is a role for the Community to play in that regard. It might obviate some of the points I have made in this debate. In particular, it would obviate the illegal activity and behaviour that should have no place within the law enforcement apparatus of any democratic state. It is important that member states gravitate towards the highest standards of law enforcement across the Community. Where we do not eradicate areas where there is less than that standard pertaining, there is a danger of the whole process falling to the lowest common denominator.</P>
    <P>The impact of the Bill will be positive. It will provide a formal structure which will facilitate further police co-operation in criminal investigations. It will assist in improving crime detection, investigation and prosecution of offences. It will also have the effect of ensuring boundaries do not militate against effective co-operation. To be effective, law enforcement must not be unduly inhibited in scope or resources or geographically. I heartily welcome the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill, to which Senator Terry has given careful consideration. I look forward to hearing the answers to her questions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as an effort to highlight the fact that criminals should be dealt with through the rule of law, not the rule of force. We have come to a bad stage in world history. In recent months we have seen an attempt to use the rule of military force rather than the rule of law to deal with terrorism, the disastrous and foreseeable consequences of which we can now see.</P>
      <P>The invasion of Afghanistan led to nothing other than an increase in the production of drugs in that region. Apart from trafficking in human beings, drugs are apparently the most lucrative business nowadays. To see it promoted is truly dreadful. Unfortunately, all countries, including Ireland, will have to take account of trafficking in human beings, as people are being brought through this country to get to more lucrative markets in other parts of Europe. Anything that will encourage co-operation between police forces to prevent this appalling practice must be applauded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Bill provide for the establishment of teams drawn from various international police forces to investigate the abduction of children? While this is a private matter, it is surely in the <Col N="1511" />public interest not to allow such episodes to take place. Will the Minister of State indicate his views on the issue? </P>
    <P>The war on terrorism was followed by the illegal invasion of Iraq by the United States of America and the United Kingdom, which I bitterly regret. The words of President Mubarak of Egypt have been brought to fruition in the suicide bombings in Riyadh and Chechnya in recent days, which are a continuation of what has been happening in Israel. As the House will recall, President Mubarak said the invasion of Iraq would create 100 bin Ladens. The attacks were to be expected. I very much regret that one Irish national is apparently among those killed in the dreadful outrage in Saudi Arabia.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the rule of law is supported internationally. It worries me when I hear President Bush state those who collaborated with the suicide bombings &ndash; the bombers are all dead &ndash; will be subjected to American justice. Unfortunately, American justice to date has involved sending people to Guantanamo Bay or issuing instructions to catch people dead or alive, as was the case with the soldiers who received the pack of 55 cards distributed in Iraq. Even the President used those words. Fortunately, the people featured on the cards have apparently decided to give themselves up, a much more sensible option than being hunted down.</P>
    <P>We must aim to introduce measures to bring police forces together in order that people can be brought before courts. In Europe we have been doing well in rounding up suspects from the various terrorist organisations. The only person convicted in association with the atrocity on 11 September 2001 appeared before a German court, while others have been brought before courts in Spain, the Netherlands and Great Britain. This is the only way to proceed or to try to gain control of world order. Shooting down people who have nothing to do with the various atrocities only breeds more terrorists.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of experience in this area. Despite going backwards and forwards on occasion and the current problems we face, the Governments of both the United Kingdom and the Republic have shown extraordinary courage in much of what they have done. The news that emerged recently, which has been most unedifying in terms of the methods used in some cases, has not been clarified.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill because any measure that reinforces the superiority of the rule of law over the rule of force is to be commended. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply to Senator Terry's questions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and this valuable legislation which will be a major asset in strengthening the rule of law in the fight against organised crime. As the Minister of State and my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, outlined, the purpose of the Bill is to give effect in law to <Col N="1512" />a Council framework decision to establish joint investigating teams. Teams will be set up for a specific purpose and a limited period to carry out criminal investigations with a cross-border dimension where one or more member states are involved. This initiative will lend much greater cohesion and co-operation to the concept of fighting international organised crime and send a clear message to those involved that the European Union and its member states, including Ireland as of today, are serious about tracking those involved in terrorism and the trafficking of drugs and human beings.</P>
      <P>The events of 11 September 2001 resulted in a new focus on terrorism. America has shown by its actions in Iraq that it is focused on the issue and will tackle it wherever and whenever it raises its ugly head. I hope Europe's commitment in this regard will be seen as serious.</P>
      <P>In countries with borders there is always a probability that smuggling will take place. The smuggling of alcohol, petrol and various other commodities, when profitable, has been a feature of our Border between North and South. In the current economic climate trucks containing some of these commodities have started running in the opposite direction. Money laundering and VAT fraud have been a feature of cross-Border criminality here in recent years.</P>
      <P>The scale of the problem, particularly drug trafficking, was highlighted late last year when a haul of drugs valued at &euro;25 million was intercepted on its way from Belgium to both parts of this country. The shipment in question was bound for a cell of an organised gang based in both the North and the South which, I understand, had links to both Nationalist and loyalist paramilitaries. Some time after the find I read an article which stated two paramilitary organisations in the North were earning in the region of &euro;8 million and &euro;12 million respectively from organised crime, which gives us an indication of the type of mountain we have to climb.</P>
      <P>In giving effect to this Council decision, the Government and the European Union are sending a clear message that we take this matter very seriously. Closer co-operation between police forces, customs authorities and the intelligence services will play a major part in the combined effort. As the Minister of State said, the measures will allow two police forces to set up a joint investigation team for a specific period and with specific terms of reference to carry out a joint investigation in either participating country. In addition, the member of an outside police force working in a second country is given the official status of its police force while investigating a crime. This is a unique and far-sighted measure which will bring about greater co-operation between police forces.</P>
      <P>Instead of just talking to someone on the other end of a telephone line, people will now form bonds and friendships. This will create a better cohesive working unit and be a positive step in fighting crime across borders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" />The idea of transfers between police forces is not unique to Northern Ireland. I am led to believe there are 40 police services in the United Kingdom with broadly similar terms of reference and conditions of service. Members of such forces can be seconded or arrangements can be made for transfers. They will find it different to move to a strange country.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of this initiative in terms of personnel exchanges will depend on the way it is effected. The organisations or authorities which represent the volunteers must be considered when arrangements are made for their transfer. It is important that people transferring to another country know their terms of reference and what to expect and are fully aware of all the elements of their new life. I do not have any doubt that this will lead to greater understanding and appreciation between the two forces, North and South. I know the situation has improved dramatically in recent years but there was a time when friendships were not great. There are personal friendships between members of the police forces, North and South. I hope this measure will help to forge better friendships which would bring about better policing.</P>
    <P>Illegal immigrants are a new phenomenon. It is only in recent years that this country has become an attractive destination due to the fact that it is economically viable. The first legislation we considered in relation to these issues was introduced in September 2000 to deal with offences relating to the trafficking of human beings. The discovery of subsequent networks meant we were probably late in trying to catch them or find out how they operated. We were caught on the hop with the level of immigration. At the time we had only a handful working in the immigration section of the Department. We now have in excess of 200 working there with all the necessary infrastructure. The growing number entering the State in articulated trucks is a cause of concern. We remember the tragedy in Wexford when women, children and men, who had had their money taken from them and were shoved into the back of an articulated truck, were forgotten and left to die.</P>
    <P>This is good legislation which complements other good legislation in this area. I wish it a speedy passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for being in the Chamber and his presentation. The Labour Party broadly welcomes the Bill, which is based on co-operation in criminal law rather than harmonisation of criminal law. It is the right approach to leave intact as much as possible our sovereignty as regards criminal law and the principles which underpin it, while maximising measures at European level regarding criminal investigations. It is important that the courts remain an important part of the picture. Section 11 seems to limit how information obtained by the joint investigation teams can be used. That is a good principle of legal practice. While it is <Col N="1514" />important to be tough on crime, it is also important to respect good legal principles, including fairness, etc.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and Senator Terry have pointed out that we have the ability to set up joint investigation teams. However, it makes sense to set up a legal framework for this. It is necessary to do so in accordance with the EU decision which requires specific and legally binding instruments to underpin the investigation teams. I note that this decision by the Council predated the EU scrutiny Bill. It is important that such Council decisions are previewed by the Oireachtas before they are made. I know this is outside it. The Minister recently attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to bring to our attention proposals to amend the European convention in relation to the setting up of Europol. It is important that such scrutiny is carried out as much as possible.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Terry that we must ensure resources are given to the Garda Síochána to do its work under this legislation, which I welcome. Like the Europol Act and other initiatives at European Union level, this measure is necessary. As the Minister of State and other Members said, crime does not respect national borders. Senator Terry raised a number of questions to which I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's response. Having dealt with the Bill on co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, it seems this legislation does not deal with misdemeanours by members of police forces involved in the joint investigation teams in the same way as the other Bill, although I may have missed the appropriate reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the thrust and purpose of the Bill which no sensible person could oppose. As has been said, crime does not know any boundaries. Large-scale crime is increasingly organised on an international basis and, with international terrorism, must be dealt with. I do not have any difficulty commending the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>Like other Members, I have some concerns with which, I am sure, the Minister of State will be able to deal. It is appropriate to raise them on Second Stage. It would help if the Minister of State could describe the prosecutorial context in which the legislation will operate. When the investigation takes place and there is sufficient evidence produced, will those concerned be prosecuted in Ireland, or will the Irish investigation assist the prosecution elsewhere, or will there be a single composite international authority in the lead country? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if section 3 is unnecessarily limited where it relates to the setting up of a joint investigative team in jurisdictions where a crime has been committed. I am not in favour of pre-emptive strikes but there is strong reason to believe a policeman in other places would act in <Col N="1515" />cases where a crime was about to be committed or where people who had committed a crime elsewhere were about to enter this country, either to take refuge or commit another crime.</P>
    <P>I am a little worried about the designation of a single individual as a competent authority without providing for some form of reporting mechanism or scrutiny. Senator Terry pointed to the interesting dichotomy whereby the Garda Commissioner is the competent authority for one purpose and the Minister is the competent authority for another. It is one of those areas which yearns for a police authority or policing board. There is merit in considering how the exercise of this function could be tied into reporting to a committee of the Houses. Otherwise, there is a danger that <i>ad hoc </i>forces, about which we will not know too much, will be created.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, too, about what will happen when one of those involved in such matters causes an offence. We will shortly address the issue of a Garda ombudsman. While I do not wish to anticipate that debate, the Bill relates to the Garda, customs officers and others. It might be sensible to include accountants, forensic experts and police officers from other jurisdictions. A person taking up the position of police officer in this country should be subject to the same regime as the Garda. I wonder whether the logical extension of what we are talking about is adherence to or an extension of the Schengen <i>acquis.</i> I know there are particular difficulties as long as the United Kingdom refuses to become part of it.</P>
    <P>If one is co-operating with somebody, one needs to be sure who it is one is co-operating with and that he or she has the same standards and procedures. My colleague suggested that standards, principles and codes of practice should be drawn up at European level which is to be welcomed. It is interesting that at a meeting dealing with conditions for the setting up of joint committees matters such as pen rations and so on were dealt with but not much was said about the methodology and standards required.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom national serious crime squad includes intelligence services, rightly so. It is those sorts of skills that are required because international criminals generally do not give themselves up. There will be a need for covert activity and infiltration to gain information one way or the other. If even a fraction of the allegations currently being made are true, it would cause one to pause for one moment. This could be met by ensuring the protocol for each of the investigations clearly sets out the standards expected, the extent of covert activity, the way in which accomplice evidence is to be dealt with and the dangers of entrapment. It is important we meet the highest standards in this regard.</P>
    <P>This is not an appropriate time to talk about resources. That is a debate for another day but it might be a good idea to provide for such an exercise by way of a separate subhead in the Vote in order that ordinary policing is not distorted when <Col N="1516" />an enormous international investigation takes place. Implicit in all this is the ability to share and move information. The development of IT systems for the Garda must be compatible with that for other police forces. I am deeply concerned about the provision of appropriate protocols to minimise the possibility of matters going wrong in covert investigations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is the only way to go. Crime threatens us all and we need to deal with it in a way that ensures we follow the rule of law and, where a citizen has cause to complain, there is a means for doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I am against crime in most of its manifestations. I accept international boundaries are used by organised crime and that with the globalisation of crime, it is inevitable there will be globalisation to match it on the part of police authorities. I understand this and the difficulties imposed by international criminal organisations confronting isolated national jurisdictions. In principle, I completely accept a degree of internationalisation. I do, however, have some hesitations about aspects of the Bill which I will share with Senator Maurice Hayes, who rightly said there should be an independent person involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the establishment of a police school, which I welcome, although I do so with certain qualifications or additions. A number of years ago I accepted an invitation to be a gadfly at an international police gathering in Dublin Castle. I did not concentrate on all the wonderful things the police did, rather I concentrated on areas of concern in terms of the way in which policing impacted on the local population and its behaviour. I was able to cite instances of sexual harassment, not only of women but also of men, and the brutalisation of suspects on a racial basis in France and other jurisdictions. Not alone did the police organisations not co-operate, they also actively supported members known to be engaged in criminal acts against innocent members of the public.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister of State to make representations to the appropriate quarters that such a police school, if established, should deal not only with the mechanics of policing and the transmission of information but also with the interface with the public, recognition of human rights and an indication that a severe view will be taken of the violation of citizen's rights while in police custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the adoption of decent standards by police forces across the globe. By and large, we have such standards in this country or, at least, on this part of the island. However, I share the concern which, I assume, has been expressed by other Members. Although I welcome co-operation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the kind of recent revelations about the apparent co-operation between police authorities and criminal elements of a politically subversive nature &ndash; including connivance in the <Col N="1517" />murder of innocent citizens &ndash; are a matter of grave concern.</P>
    <P>This Bill was has been advanced on foot of the growing feeling that the western world, in particular, is confronting a problem of terrorism. This stems from the early entry into force in the EU of the provisions of the mutual legal assistance convention relating to joint investigations teams. I presume it is from this convention that much of this material derives.</P>
    <P>The mutual legal assistance convention was agreed in June 2000 after five years of negotiations and its entry into force requires ratification by 15 national parliaments. At yet, no parliament has formally ratified it but the procedure is being pushed ahead. On 16 November last, the permanent representatives of the four member states behind the proposal declared that the framework decision should correspond to that of the original article 13 of the MLA convention which would remove any limitation on the scope of the offences. That is a concern on my part. In light of his detailed knowledge of the workings of the Bill, will the Minister of State indicate if there is a limitation on the scope of the offences contained in the Bill? The phrase used in the MLA convention is &ldquo;criminal offences that require difficult and demanding investigations having links with other member states&rdquo;. However, during the discussion on the drafting of this prior document &ndash; the mutual legal assistance convention &ndash; there was much confusion about its scope. The United Kingdom Home Office, in response to this kind of concern, clearly stated that the convention could, as described in the words of the 1959 convention, cover &ldquo;any crime however minor&rdquo;. I am not sure if this is the situation in the Bill or if there is a limitation on the scope of offences. Whereas I agree with the Minister of State in terms of the kind of crime to which he referred in the early part of his contribution, I would be concerned if these relatively minor areas could be trawled, perhaps for the purpose of political harassment of figures in other member states.</P>
    <P>I received a letter this week from someone who lives not too far from the Minister of State's constituency. I have no knowledge of the author, but he seems to be an intelligent person. He alleges that the Garda are placing gay people under surveillance in his area &ndash; it is a rural, not an urban, area &ndash; for unspecified reasons and that they appear to be collecting information. He is concerned that such information would be permanently placed on the computer network. If this is happening and if it was to occur on a Europe-wide basis, then there is some cause for concern.</P>
    <P>Members of joint investigation teams working in a member state other than their own will be regarded as seconded to that force by their national authorities. They can be entrusted to undertake certain investigative measures such as being present at interrogations, etc. Any intelligence seconded agents lawfully come across during the course of investigation in a foreign jurisdiction may be used for any purpose whatsoever, <Col N="1518" />with the consent of the authorities of the member state in which it originated. However, going along with that and referring back to what I said earlier, there seems to be no explicit provision for this to be covered by international data protection law. Will the information gathered by these joint investigation teams be covered by both domestic and international data protection law? It may be that it is and that I have not noticed it, or will it simply be by virtue of the superior enactment of this law that all our legislation will be covered?</P>
    <P>There seems to be a provision under the MLA convention not just for European police forces but also &ndash; this is specifically mentioned in the discussions, although it is not in the Bill &ndash; for similar arrangements and co-operation with the police forces of the United States of America. I am concerned about this because we have seen the way America behaved with regard to international law during the recent Iraq war. We know, for example, that the US is violating the Geneva Convention in its treatment of the prisoners at Guantanamo. The US is probably exporting certain of these prisoners to third countries where they can be properly tortured. We must be careful about the police forces with which we involve ourselves. I referred to the British in Northern Ireland and the French and I now mention my concern about the police forces of the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I wish to end by quoting from a statement made by a commentator, Tom Bunyan, on this matter. He says:</P>
    <P>&nbsp;It is one thing to allow these provisions on joint teams to come into effect to investigate terrorist offences. It is quite another to introduce it without any limitation on the scope of offences. One has to wonder how seriously the EU is taking its national parliaments and whether the EU intends to bring any other of the convention provisions into force early, using this simplified procedure.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the war against crime, I believe it is appropriate that we raise specific concerns about the possible infringement of the rights of individual citizens in this country. We look to the Minister of State to provide answers to these questions. He may be well able to provide them and I accept that my interpretation of particular matters may be wrong. Alternatively, we may seek to place safeguards in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea): I thank all Senators for their learned and instructive contributions. A number of points were raised and I will try to deal with them as best I can.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry made the point that there were little or no changes in the criminal law in this Bill. The intention of the Bill is not to change criminal law. There is a raft of legislation before both Houses which has the intention of changing, updating and modernising the criminal law. The purpose of this legislation is to provide, as <Col N="1519" />Senator Tuffy said, a legal framework for the establishment of joint investigation teams. It is true that there is co-operation between police forces of different states at present. However, what is lacking is a statutory basis and a legal framework. It is believed that it will operate more efficiently if a legal framework is put in place and if the parameters are set out in law. Senator Tuffy correctly pointed out that this is part of our legal obligations. Ireland, like other member states, is legally obliged to introduce this legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of the 2,000 extra recruits to the Garda was raised. I emphasise again that the commitment in the programme for Government is to provide 2,000 extra gardaí over the lifetime of the Government. The Government has another four years to run. A caveat was also put in place that this would be done if resources permit and let us hope that this proves to be the case.</P>
    <P>The point was also made that the Bill may put pressure on Garda resources. Crime has to be investigated. Crime which occurs in this country and which has an international dimension, must be investigated in the same way as that which occurs exclusively within our borders. This is simply a mechanism to facilitate such investigations and, I hope, bring them to successful conclusions.</P>
    <P>I can see situations where money will actually be saved as a result of what is being put in place in the Bill. If some of those involved in this kind of crime, mainly in this country, originated from another country and had connections in other countries and if we had a mechanism whereby we could bring in the police forces of other countries to assist the Garda, investigations could be speedier and more efficient.</P>
    <P>There are a number of innovative provisions in the Bill. For example, seconded members, that is, those coming from in outside, can make requests for information, or request their own national authorities to do something, without having to go through the bureaucratic procedure under the mutual co-operation provisions of the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes said a situation of major importance might arise where a number of police or customs officials were tied up for a considerable period and that as a consequence provision should be made in the Bill for a separate sub-head. That is a sensible suggestion which will be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry asked about the cost of joint investigation teams. It is not possible at this point to give an estimate of the cost of establishment of such a team or involvement in it. The cost will vary depending on issues such as the nature, size and length of investigations into offences, conduct or suspected conduct. This question will be addressed by the member states involved in the agreement setting up the joint investigation team. However, everyone will agree that the benefits to be gained from the establishment of such teams and the fight against terrorism, in particular, will largely outweigh any cost involved.</P>
    <P>Senators Terry and Maurice Hayes raised the <Col N="1520" />issue of a dichotomy, as to the reason the Garda Commissioner was the competent authority in one situation and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the other. Where member states specify their judicial authorities rather than chiefs of police as the competent authorities for the purposes of the legislation giving effect to the framework decision, those states will not send or accept requests from the Garda Commissioner. That is the difficulty. It is for this reason that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also been designated as a competent authority for the purposes of the Bill. Other states may designate judicial authorities in accordance with their legislative or constitutional arrangements. If so, they will not deal with the Garda Commissioner, and someone else will have to be appointed as the relevant competent authority, namely, the Minister.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Terry's question about the deadline, 1 January, the framework decision on joint investigation teams is a relatively recent one, approved on 13 June 2002. Since its publication, work has been ongoing in my Department with a view to preparation of legislation to enable this country to make a decision as quickly as possible. However, as can be seen from the text of the Bill, the establishment of joint investigation teams within member states is not a straightforward matter. Despite the fact that it is already happening in practice, trying to provide for it in law and set parameters is not straightforward. As the framework decision is silent in this regard, many of the practical and procedural matters must inevitably be dealt with in legislation. Extensive consultation was required with the Attorney General, the Garda Síochána and the Revenue authorities, as well as with other Departments and Offices which could be involved in the establishment of joint investigation teams in order to determine the framework which would allow such teams to be established and operate most efficiently. Given the heavy workload in the law reform division of my Department and the office of the parliamentary counsel of the Office of the Attorney General, and the busy Dáil and Seanad schedules since June 2002, it has not been possible to bring the legislation before this House any earlier. I apologise for this.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry made the point that some of section 3 was difficult to read. I accept this but if one looks at the range of issues which need to be covered before a decision to establish a joint investigation team is finally taken, the section does not lend itself to easy drafting.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry also inquired how the revised structure would result in improved policing. One benefit, as I said, will be increased speed and efficiency, as is clear in section 7 in the reference to seconded personnel being able to request their own states to do things which need to be done quickly, or get information from their states at short notice. We have specifically excluded seconded members who have been involved in particular investigations. They will be present <Col N="1521" />only as backup, to provide assistance and information. The same will apply to other experts attached to joint investigation teams such as forensic experts or accountants, or even those seconded from other European institutions such as Europol or Eurojust.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh outlined some of the issues arising from perceived wrongdoing by states or state agencies. He will be aware that there is a police inspectorate Bill currently before the Oireachtas which will beef up the complaints system. We will be establishing an ombudsman to replace the Garda Síochána Complaints Board which everyone now accepts is not operating very effectively. This will be a much more robust operation, and we expect the legislation to be brought before this House shortly.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Jim Walsh's comments and agree with his views. The legislation should assist us in a very significant way in a co-ordinated fight against drugs in an international context, as well as trafficking in people, another crime with a large international dimension and unfortunately a growing crime with which we must deal urgently.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to the drugs problem. There is an EU drugs action plan being prepared. It is not appropriate for me to go into detail at this stage but suffice it to say we are party to it and will do our best to advance it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Henry's point on the investigation of child abduction cases and Senator Norris's query about restrictions on the type of offences that can be dealt with, my Department has considered these matters and the view is that the scope of the Bill should not be restricted in any way. Sensible decisions will have to be taken as to whether a joint investigation team should be set up. A decision to set up such a team, involving police forces, customs services and revenue commissioners from different countries, cannot be taken lightly and will not be taken for petty offences. However, international crime is not limited in its scope, neither should the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to predict at the outset of an investigation, particularly one with an international dimension, exactly what offence or range of offences may have been committed. It would be wrong, therefore, to provide legislation which would preclude participation in a joint investigation team because part of the offence lay outside the scope of our legislation, or to terminate the operation of a joint investigation team for a similar reason. It is for this reason that the legislation goes beyond the minimum requirements set in the framework decision &ndash; Senator Norris is correct in that minimum requirements have been set &ndash; and permits the investigation of any offence or conduct where there is a cross-border dimension.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy raised the issue of whether misdemeanours would be dealt with. Section 12 makes provision for criminal liability in respect of offences committed by or against seconded members who are members of a foreign police <Col N="1522" />force while operating in the State as part of a joint investigation team. The officials concerned will be dealt with in the same way as national team members. They will be considered to be members of the Garda Síochána for the purposes of criminal liability. Civil claims are dealt with specifically and clearly in section 13.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy also inquired about compensation arrangements. Members of the Garda Síochána will fall to be compensated under the Garda Síochána compensation Acts. Members of other police forces will be compensated under whatever arrangements are in place in their own countries.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked how certain prosecutorial matters would be dealt with. I have dealt with this.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes raised the question of where prosecution would take place. It will take place in the country which takes the initiative in establishing the joint investigation team. We envisage that that will be the country mainly affected by the crime. If there is evidence of offences having been committed in other countries, what will happen in practice is that the seconded members from the countries concerned will be prepared to attend court to give evidence of these offences to reinforce the prosecution's case.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes and one or two other Senators raised the issue of standards, an issue of which we are very much aware. The disciplinary group on organised crime has agreed a standard agreement for joint investigations which will be used in every case when joint investigation teams are being established. The issue of standards between member states participating in such teams will be addressed in that context.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the question of whether the data protection legislation would apply to information acquired in the course of a joint investigation. The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, it will apply.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their valuable contributions which have certainly given us food for thought. One or two matters have been raised which I intend to discuss with the Minister. I look forward to coming back shortly to take Committee and Report Stages. We need to have this legislation passed and up and running as quickly as possible. I thank Senators for their co-operation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the Government's initiative on the penalty points <Col N="1523" />system and the associated measures regarding learner drivers, provisional licence holders, and motor insurance, and requests the Minister for Transport to outline the future strategies to strengthen these measures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan. Of all the occasions he has come before the House, this is by far the most important motion he has had the opportunity to discuss with Members. Since taking office, he has been responsible for many initiatives in his Department, including rail, aviation, bus and infrastructural projects around the country. Road safety is undoubtedly the most important issue for a number of reasons, primarily because the strategies which have been put in place are concerned with saving lives. That is certainly the most important aspect of the entire initiative.</P>
    <P>I had expected a balanced debate on this motion. However, in light of the amendment that has been tabled, it is obvious that the Opposition will not engage in what I would have anticipated as some sort of consensus and recognise the huge volume of work the Minister and the Government have undertaken. The Opposition appears to be quite critical and has failed to recognise the success achieved in such a short period. Its amendment highlights what has not been done, including elements about which the Minister has spoken and which, no doubt, he will bring forward in the near future. I expect he will outline his plans in this regard later. The Opposition's attitude reflects the &ldquo;half empty glass&rdquo; approach and I have no doubt we will see more of that. It seems that the Opposition is trying to give the Minister penalty points for the haste with which he is making changes and the speed with which lives are being saved.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the penalty points system has been a hugely successful initiative from which some figures are worth noting. Over the first six months after the introduction of the system, there were 143 deaths on the roads &ndash; a reduction of 32% on the same period in the preceding year. That represents 68 lives saved. Up to 30 April 2003, there were 98 deaths on the roads, a reduction of 36. At 98, the number is still too high, but it is most important that so many lives have been saved.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of last April, some 17,000 drivers had received penalty points. The system is clearly working, despite suggestions by some critics that levels of detection are down and that offenders are not being caught. The remarkable number of drivers affected by penalty points over such a short period gives testament to the work of the Garda, which has shown great enthusiasm for this initiative despite the difficulties associated with starting up the programme so quickly.</P>
    <P>However, the programme is not only about saving lives. There has also been a huge reduction in the number of accidents. In reducing the incidence of fatal accidents, one also reduces the incidence of non-fatal accidents which can result in <Col N="1524" />serious injuries. Road accidents increase the pressure on accident and emergency units at hospitals. The situation in A&amp;E areas at any weekend demonstrates the difficulties which are being imposed on our health services in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another immense benefit from the introduction of penalty points will be, it is hoped, a reduction in the cost to insurance companies, which should ultimately lead to a reduction in premia. The latter will come about as a result of insurance companies not having to pay out large amounts of money associated with serious injury or death.</P>
    <P>The programme introduced by the Minister is not just about penalty points or penalising drivers, it is about changing an attitude of careless disregard by certain drivers, both for other road users and for the privilege of holding a driving licence. Fines have not worked in the past, but the fact that people can now lose their driving licences through the penalty points system has helped to focus their attention on showing due care on the roads. This change in culture among drivers will be further enhanced by the expansion of the programme the Minister intends to introduce. From 1 June, uninsured drivers will attract a high number of penalty points. When that aspect is taken in conjunction with driving dangerous vehicles and a failure to use seat belts, drivers could find themselves being put off the road after just two offences. That is the way to indicate that driving in a manner that puts lives at risk will no longer be tolerated.</P>
    <P>While enforcement is necessary at this stage because it is a way of assisting the introduction of this attitudinal change, I have no doubt that the new culture will diminish the need for such rigorous enforcement. Over time, therefore, there will be less of a burden on the Garda Síochána because, given a change of mind-set, one would hope that drivers will begin automatically to respect the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has identified some valid issues in its amendment, but these were also identified by the Minister in the past. I have no doubt that he is working on these issues and that he may refer to them in his contribution. For example, the Minister has taken steps on testing, particularly for learner drivers, and he intends to introduce further changes in that regard. Such moves will help to bring about a change of culture on the roads.</P>
    <P>While certain measures are aimed at experienced drivers, we also need to cater for young people by ensuring that those who are just beginning to drive have the necessary skills and training, as well as having respect for other road users. We also need to examine the legislation governing the regulation of driving instructors and I am sure the Minister has some ideas on that matter. Driving licences should not be based merely on passing a test, but also on demonstrating due respect for others using the roads.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies have said that they would <Col N="1525" />like to establish a database of all those who have accumulated penalty points and the Minister has outlined, in the strongest terms, how he intends to deal with that issue. I am sure he will allude to this matter later. We need to see genuine premia reductions for those with clean driving licences. The idea of weighting premia levels for offenders and repeat offenders is good because it will reward good and responsible drivers. We need to be careful about this process in the early stages, however, because the Minister is still reviewing speed limits in certain areas. We should not consider penalising drivers with increased insurance premia until that review has taken place because there are anomalies in certain parts of the country. We should also examine the possibility of introducing a sliding scale under which those with more penalty points will attract higher insurance premia.</P>
    <P>A threshold will also be required so that someone with, for example, only two penalty points would not be unduly penalised. The Minister has already stated that he does not wish to see insurance penalties brought to bear on such people in the early stages of the scheme. The idea of having a year free of penalties has been proposed, which would allow drivers to enjoy the benefits of the no claims bonus system.</P>
    <P>Speed limits are of major importance, particularly in metropolitan areas. Some dual carriageways on the edge of urban areas carry speed limits of 30 or 40 mph and these should be reviewed in advance of any changes in the traffic laws.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider a practice used in the United States whereby a driver who is about to reach the disqualification stage &ndash; whether it is at 12 or 14 points &ndash; must undertake an advanced driving test programme. Offenders who sit such a two-day test successfully can be credited with two points. Although there is a high charge associated with the test, it leads to improved driving techniques as well as giving people a second chance. That American model might be worth examining.</P>
    <P>I will now pass over to my colleagues, who have further issues to discuss in what is a wide-ranging, useful and fruitful debate. I congratulate the Minister on the tremendous work he has done, not just in the area of road safety area but throughout his departmental brief.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;condemns the Minister for Transport for his failure to adequately fund the penalty points system and his inability to address the huge driving test failure rate;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the irresponsible attitude of the Minister for Transport in announcing <Col N="1526" />changes to the provisional licensing system without providing adequate resources to address the current backlog;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the Minister for Transport has failed to meet his commitment to introduce interim licensing measures;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;condemns the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his withdrawal of resources to the Garda authorities to enforce the penalty points system;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;notes the failure of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish a dedicated traffic corps;</P>

    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;condemns the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for her inaction in tackling the rising costs of motor insurance and her failure to act on the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report which was published over one and a half years ago; and</P>
    <P>calls on the Government to:</P>

    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;bring to the end the blatant discrimi<Col N="1527" />nation being experienced by young people when securing motor insurance;</P>
    <P>&ndash;&nbsp;explain why motorcyclists are three times more likely to die on Irish roads than anywhere else in Europe; and</P>
    <P>finally, to publish the figures for those who are found guilty of having caused accidents on our roads (including such details as age, gender, type of vehicle driven, cause of accident, etc.).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister. Unfortunately, we did not see him during the previous session due to his busy schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>Where was the Senator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister can come before the House more often in this session because transport is an area that affects everybody from those who use cars for private use to those involved in the heavy goods transportation sector. In addition, transport impacts hugely on our quality of life and that is why we care so much about its development.</P>
      <P>When I saw the wording of the Fianna Fáil motion, I wondered where I could begin to reply to it because it is so open-ended. As an Opposition spokesperson, there is no way I can agree with the motion. However, the Minister should be commended for some of his initiatives. To use a golfing analogy, he may look well teeing off and may have a beautiful set of golf clubs but we must also analyse his follow through. Unfortunately, the Minister and his Government colleagues have been found wanting in the area of transport. The penalty points system has been a success, but it was only introduced in the tenth month of the final year of a five-year road safety programme. I cannot blame the Minister personally for that because he has only recently been appointed to the job, but it is an indictment of the previous Government. Senator Dooley mentioned the good qualities of the Government, but he has missed that point completely.</P>
      <P>Serious issues concerning the penalty points system remain to be teased out. The Minister is planning to introduce extra penalty points for driving uninsured vehicles and failing to wear seat belts. However, we have not seen any additional resources being made available for this despite the fact that, as we have heard, the administration of the current system is under severe pressure. I look forward to hearing the Minister explain how he intends to provide the back-up resources required to ensure the full implementation and enforcement of the penalty points system.</P>
      <P>We have to learn from other EU countries where the penalty points system is in place. The novelty will wear off after four or five months if the public is not constantly reminded of the need to be vigilant in terms of penalty points. We must learn from the experiences of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the Government's apparent decision to <Col N="1528" />abandon the idea of a traffic corps. This suggestion seems to have died a death, just like the promise at the last general election to recruit 2,000 extra gardaí. A dedicated traffic corps is needed. I put it to the Minister that those involved in such a unit do not necessarily need to be members of the Garda. I am aware that traffic wardens have the power to issue summonses to those who do not have tax or insurance for their cars. Perhaps there is scope to negotiate with the relevant Departments about giving them powers to stop traffic on the road. This idea needs to be teased out as it might free up Garda resources. I ask the Minister or others with the relevant qualifications to consider it.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss briefly the issue of penalty points being imposed on those involved in transport businesses. Grave concerns have recently been expressed to me about the system. If one goes to court after being given penalty points, the award of double points by the judge is mandatory if one's appeal is unsuccessful. This seems a little harsh, as one is not given the opportunity to explain any mitigating circumstances. The Minister should examine this area once more, as it seems to fly in the face of the civil rights of those affected. There may be confusion about the identity of the driver of a car, for example. The person in whose name the car is registered may be given penalty points even though he or she can prove that somebody else was driving the car. The Garda is now judge and jury, in effect. If one goes to court to contest the award of penalty points by a garda or explain one's case, the judge will come down on the side of the garda. This is a dangerous precedent to set and we need to examine the issues involved. The issue of redress needs to be examined in the cases of those involved in the transport business.</P>
    <P>We need to have sensible speed limits. It was pointed out to me today that trucks could overtake on single or dual carriageways but were not allowed to overtake on two-lane motorways. I will clarify this matter for the Minister and my Fianna Fáil colleagues and friends. If one is travelling from the west to Dublin, one can overtake in the section from Newbridge and the Curragh to Kildare. One cannot overtake between Kildare and Johnstown but one can overtake again between Johnstown and Dublin. This is a cause of confusion and needs to be rectified. People who genuinely think they are adhering to the speed limits may not be aware of the existence of the motorway section. We need sensible speed limits. I recently heard of a case of a woman who received penalty points for driving at 31 mph in a 30 mph zone. This would not have happened under the old system which provided for some latitude. There are dangers when the system is stringently applied.</P>
    <P>Questions also need to be asked in relation to public services and those involved in public transport. A Bus Éireann employee may start to drive a bus in the morning when everything is working perfectly but the bulb in the front headlight may <Col N="1529" />suddenly go during the day. Is the driver liable to be given penalty points on his or her own licence in such circumstances? Will the company be penalised? These are big issues.</P>
    <P>The question of passing information to insurance companies is also a massive one. I am suspicious of insurance companies because of their past records. I have a terrible fear that they will punish drivers who receive penalty points with harsher and higher premiums. We need to ensure this does not happen and that good drivers are rewarded. Those with no or very few penalty points should have cheaper insurance premiums than those with many points.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to learn recently that the rate of deaths in Ireland as a result of motorcycle accidents is three times that of the European Union as a whole. I ask the Minister to explain this statistic at a future date.</P>
    <P>The Government's policies in the insurance area have failed. We waited three years for the MIAB report, which was published over 18 months ago. The report's 69 recommendations have not yet been fully implemented. We have not seen a reduction in insurance costs. A 20 year old recently explained to me that he was quoted &euro;3,000 to insure a car worth £1,000, which is crazy and defies logic. Good drivers should be rewarded by the insurance system. I have asked the Minister, in the last part of my amendment, to &ldquo;publish the figures for those who are found guilty of having caused accidents on our roads&rdquo;. It is important that we are given the real figures, rather than the generalisations we often hear from insurance companies. We are often told that young people, especially males, are involved in car crashes but I would like figures to be published. Perhaps research could be conducted into the liability ascertained during court cases in which people have been found guilty or innocent. Such statistics, which would be very interesting for Senators, may be useful as backup when arguing that insurance companies should decrease premiums.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's idea to enforce the law in relation to provisional licences from 1 January was laudable, it was not backed up by adequate resources. The enormity of the problem faced by him is demonstrated by the fact that 124,000 have a first provisional licence, 149,000 have a second provisional licence, 54,000 have a third provisional licence and 28,000 have a fourth provisional licence. We need to put more resources into this area. It seems fine to announce changes but there is no point in doing so if extra driving testers are not put in place to clear the backlog in this area, or if a new system is not put in place.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ease back on the press releases as I am finding it difficult to keep up with recent developments in the Department of Transport. I would rather see him follow through on his initiatives.</P>

      <P>It is like golf &ndash; one needs to follow through on one's swing. I would like to see achievements and further progress. I have not spoken about all aspects of Fine Gael's detailed amendment to this motion but I am sure my colleagues, Senators Bannon and Brian Hayes, will do so. I ask the Minister to deal with some of the issues I have raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the Fine Gael amendment and welcome the Minister for Transport to the House once more.</P>
      <P>Nobody disputes the fact that the penalty points system has saved lives. A grey area remains, however, as many lives will be lost if adequate resources are not provided by the Government. The penalty points system can be effective in its present form and extensions have been proposed. The Minister has failed to provide the resources and funding needed for the enforcement of the system. The reduction in Garda manpower since the beginning of the year has had an adverse affect on the Garda's ability to operate the system effectively and is eroding the life-saving potential of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Government must accept blame for its inefficient planning, especially in the area of road infrastructure. We have been told time and again that the national primary and secondary routes, the bypasses needed in the main towns and the bottlenecks will be taken care of under the national development plan within 20 years. There is no evidence that this will happen following recent Government cutbacks. The Government has failed miserably to address the situation in relation to carriageways and motorways. We have allowed the great years of the Celtic tiger to bypass us with regard to funding. The Government has allowed an opportunity to put a proper road structure in place to pass. There has also been a failure to provide sufficient resources for the effective operation of the penalty points system. The Garda should be given the manpower and resources to operate the system effectively.</P>
      <P>An initiative aimed at improving driving standards should be introduced and the failure rate in the driving test tackled. Many have spoken about the driving test system. The Minister spoke about doing something about this, but there has been very little action. What plans has the Minister to reform the driver training system? The driving test failure rate currently stands at 52% to 53% nationally, whereas other EU countries have a much higher pass rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a threefold increase in the number of people waiting for driving tests in recent months. In County Longford, people must wait almost four months for a test, which is unfair. In their current form, the tests seem to be failing the drivers who pass them and who are let loose on our roads and other road users who are at the mercy of these apparently inept individuals. The most dangerous drivers on our roads are those who have just passed their driving tests. This begs the question as to the flaws in driver <Col N="1531" />training and whether the Minister is prepared to take the necessary steps to review and amend the system, particularly in light of the stranglehold the insurance industry exerts on motorists as it continues to charge exorbitant premiums in the absence of checks by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a choice of high-quality, safe and affordable public transport options available to serve businesses and leisure users alike. The national development plan refers to &ndash; I will be somewhat parochial &ndash; the Dublin-Sligo rail route which passes through County Longford. The plan indicates that substantial upgrading will take place during its lifetime. While I accept that some improvements have been made, I have received numerous complaints about the length of time it takes to get from Longford and Mullingar to Dublin. This subject is close to my heart. There have been several recent breakdowns on this route and rolling stock needs to be upgraded. Journey times seem excessive and this reflects the poor quality of the track, which operates as a barrier to people using the rail lines from various locations.</P>
    <P>The national development plan refers to the objectives of the rail sub-programme which are: to improve the safety of the network; to increase the physical capacity of the railway; and to improve speed and reliability. This is moving forward at a very slow pace. The time for talk is over; people are crying out for action.</P>
    <P>Another group of drivers unfairly affected by the penalty points system is the membership of the Irish Road Hauliers Association. The law on penalty points, as it currently stands, is unbalanced because the right to redress of road hauliers is reduced and, in some cases, eliminated. They cannot comply with certain aspects of the law. For example, large areas of the network do not allow for their vehicles to stay inside the white line. If, however, their vehicles cross the white line, drivers can be given penalty points. Infrastructure in terms of road markings is not in place and funding has not been given to local authorities to amend markings to accommodate such vehicles. There is no other profession where penalty points received in the course of their work would also affect people's private and social lives to the extent that is currently the case with professional drivers, particularly if the Minister hands over files to insurance companies. This will have serious repercussions.</P>
    <P>Many matters need to be addressed. I would appreciate it if the Minister would take my views on board with regard to the issue of public and private transport.</P>

      <P>I welcome the new initiatives brought forward by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan. The introduction of the penalty points system has brought about a revolution in the thought process of all motorists in this country. Surveys carried out since the introduction of penalty points for speeding show that there has been a 72% decrease in the numbers exceeding the speed limits. When one considers that almost 350,000 on-the-spot fines were issued by gardaí for excessive speeding last year, this reduction is hugely significant. It shows that fear of being caught is one of the major influences on motorist behaviour.</P>
      <P>The programme of installing speed cameras should be extended, particularly in urban areas where there are problems with speeding vehicles. It would be more beneficial to reallocate money from some of the traffic calming schemes, particularly where they are installed at locations where there are already bottlenecks due to traffic volumes and speeds rarely exceed 10 mph, as in one town I pass through on my way to and from Dublin.</P>
      <P>The penalty points system cannot be taken in isolation because there are other Government initiatives which have led to safer roads. The Government's five year strategy on road safety saw the number of serious injuries reduced in 2001 to a figure over 40% lower than that which prevailed prior to the launch of the strategy. The low cost accident reduction schemes, funded by the Government, have been very successful since their introduction some years ago and I am delighted they are to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The signing, lighting and cats eyes programme recently announced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will also play a major role in the safety of our roads. As we all <Col N="1533" />know, there are not enough road signs. One of the major difficulties facing drivers is not being sure whether the speed limit is 40 mph or 30 mph when entering and exiting towns. In many cases, there are no signs to indicate the speed limit while, if there are signs, they are often too small to be seen.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister is considering the metrication of speed limit signs. I ask him to give due consideration to the provision of additional warning signs in Border counties and to state clearly that the signs refer to kilometres, not miles, per hour.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to speed up consultation with the authorities in the Northern Ireland so that drivers from that jurisdiction can be included in the penalty points system. It is a disgrace that while cars registered in the South do their best to obey the speed limit, they are being overtaken on our roads by cars registered in Northern Ireland, driven by those who know that the most that will happen is that they will be given a fine of &euro;80 and sent on their way. The sooner this scheme is extended to include drivers from Northern Ireland, and <i>vice versa</i> in that jurisdiction, the better for road safety.</P>
    <P>The operation of the penalty points system has reduced the number of speeding offences but an individual I know very well received a letter in the post on 7 May stating that on 18 February he was doing 37 miles per hour in Cabra. It is not acceptable that it took from 18 February to 7 May for that person to be informed of this. I realise there are difficulties with the computer system but they should be sorted out as a matter of urgency. A person should not have to wait any longer than ten days to be informed that he or she has incurred penalty points. He or she may already have lost his or her licence. This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>On a positive note, I commend the Minister on the national car test which is now in its fourth year. There is widespread acceptance that it has real benefits in terms of better maintained cars which are safer and contribute to better air quality. I welcome the public consultation paper on school bus safety, and the recommendation on the use of daytime running lights should be implemented immediately. Perhaps the Minister will include this in his next list for penalty points.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his provisional licence initiative and commend him on his announcement that there will not be an amnesty for those who have not sat and passed their test. While I welcome the fact that it is intended to introduce credit card size licences during the course of this year, I ask the Minister to bear in mind the difficulties this will cause for the farming community. Perhaps we could think of some way of helping them in that regard.</P>
    <P>In my county of Cavan and the neighbouring county of Monaghan the Garda reported recently a significant reduction in the number of cars speeding on national primary and secondary <Col N="1534" />routes which it attributed to the penalty points system. I congratulate the Minister on his work in the Department of Transport, particularly the work he is doing on the penalty points system. Whenever he feels like a game of golf, I will have no difficulty in going along with him.</P>

      <P>I must confess to a certain degree of surprise at the way the motion has gone because when I spoke to Senator O'Toole in the corridors about it, I felt a certain indifference to it because I thought it would be, as is normal in the case of Government motions, a lap of honour for the Minister. Everybody in the House knows that when the Government takes this time, it congratulates the Minister on something fairly innocuous, an extremely dull debate follows, a vote does not take place and that is the end of the matter.</P>
      <P>To my astonishment the motion is opposed by the Opposition but the penalty points system is the finest measure the Government has introduced since it came into power.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Wilson that the Minister is a breath of fresh air in the Government in that he has introduced measures which others feared to introduce and did not introduce when they were in power. What is going on? </P>
      <P>The penalty points system is a great success for the Government for one reason only &ndash; it saves lives and we cannot criticise any measures which save lives. The measure has succeeded. There are fewer people in our graveyards as a result of it. That is a success for which I congratulate the Minister. I wish his Cabinet colleagues would allow him to tackle some of the other problems he is facing with the same speed and decisiveness but I have no doubt that in time he will be able to make decisions which affect our lives beneficially in other areas of his stewardship.</P>

    <P>It is no use coming into the House to condemn the Minister on certain aspects and then suggest various measures to fund this, that or the other, of which we are all in favour.

      <P>I will. If members of the Opposition wish to produce the funds and tell us from where they are coming, that is fine but to talk about funding this, that and the other in isolation is apple pie and ice cream because they made a dog's dinner of funding initiatives when they were in power. Let us be honest about it. They were put out of power because they were not so good at managing Ireland's finances as the Government. I say this as someone who was a member of the Fine Gael Party at the time. They let public spending get out of hand. The motion is a nonsense. The Opposition would have been better to say, for once, that this initiative is something of which it approves because it has saved lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard that the penalty points system was to come into effect, I was appalled to hear that the internal Garda report had been leaked to RTE. It stated it could not be done. Nobody knows who leaked it but we can be sure that it did not benefit the Government. It benefited those who were calling for the delay of the system. We need more decisiveness from the Government from time to time. I do not know what happened behind closed doors but having said the system was too difficult and the computers did not work, the Garda came back and stated it would implement what the Minister wanted. We need more of this because it is very easy to obstruct, delay, object and obfuscate by saying something cannot be done. That is the way the Civil Service operates when it does not want something to happen. That is the way the Opposition operates when it finds the Government is on to a good thing. There are several Ministers who are decisive. The Minister for Finance does not take too much notice of his civil servants or the servants of the State when doing something they do not like. I applaud the Minister for Transport for coming out and saying the system was going ahead. I applaud him for not accepting the funding argument as presented. I also applaud him for ignoring the Garda objections at the time <Col N="1536" />that the computers would not work because they have. All the other rhubarb in the motion is irrelevant because it has worked.</P>
    <P>There is plenty wrong. Motor insurance is a problem. I do not know how the motion got through as it refers to motor insurance, which falls within the portfolio of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, not the Minister's. Penalty points should be used to increase or decrease the cost of motor insurance but, even though motor insurance is a problem, it is not relevant to the motion. I hope penalty points not only contribute to saving lives but also to reducing motor insurance costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. Road safety is an issue and the fact that, on average, more than one person a day dies needlessly on the country's roads is without doubt unacceptable. All of us have a moral obligation to seriously address this issue as a matter of utmost priority and the Minister has shown and is showing the leadership needed to effectively tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>Without doubt, the application of penalty points for speeding by the Minister last October has had a dramatic and long lasting effect on driving standards. The penalty points system has assisted significantly in a change in driver behaviour and increased the level of safety on the road for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians alike. Most significantly, since its introduction, the number of fatalities on our roads has reduced by 32%. Provisional Garda figures show that 379 people lost their lives in road accidents in 2002, the lowest recorded since 1965. No one can deny this fact. The introduction of the system has been successful because it has saved lives.</P>
      <P>Penalty points are a worry for drivers because they are personal. Fines alone are not that much of a deterrent but the fact that someone can lose his or her licence if he or she collects enough penalty points has had a serious and positive effect on driving standards. However, an overwhelming number of drivers are still being caught speeding. Recent figures show that 18,000 motorists have been issued with penalty points since the system was introduced six months ago and this figure is expected to increase to more than 20,000 by the end of the month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the reduction in the number of deaths is a welcome development, comments on the reduced number must be tempered with regret and sadness as the number losing their lives on our roads remains unacceptably high. I encourage the Minster in his endeavour to introduce more offences under the new system for this reason. As speed is the major contributory factor in road traffic accidents, it made sense that it was targeted as the first bad driving habit to incur penalties. However, there is a danger that we could slip back into our old ways unless all those involved, including the Garda, the Government, insurance companies and motorists, keep up the <Col N="1537" />same level of commitment. It must be ensured the momentum is not lost.</P>
    <P>The Government, for its part, is to embark on a major road safety campaign in the coming weeks to warn motorists that they run the risk of losing their licence if they collect penalty points. I welcome this development. The Department of Transport is to replace 500 road signs across the State which list the number killed on the roads with more effective warnings about penalty points. This move has been prompted by evidence that shows penalty points have changed driver behaviour more than other road safety warnings. Is it not strange and sad that drivers are more fearful of incurring penalty points than of dying on the roads?</P>
    <P>In addition to the new advertising campaign, nine more offences will be added to the penalty points system in the next 12 months, including driving without insurance and not wearing a seat belt. I wholeheartedly welcome all these initiatives and I am sure they will be equally effective in further reducing the number of road accidents.</P>
    <P>Although there is a need for the other players in this equation to get into gear and act, the onus should be on insurance companies to take action to tackle this problem, preferably by rewarding motorists who do not incur penalty points with lower premiums. Earlier this year the Irish Insurance Federation stated it had received a commitment from all motor insurers that they would reward motorists who did not incur penalty points in this way. However, it is disappointing that this commitment has evaporated and, once again, insurance companies are refusing to co-operate with us in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not understand their logic in refusing such a concession. When it is considered that insurance policyholders have always been under an obligation to disclose road traffic convictions and penalised for such breaches in the form of higher premiums, it is logical that insurance companies could easily redistribute revenue saved under this system to drivers who incur no penalty points. This does not even take into account the &euro;130 million that departmental officials estimate the reduction in the number of accidents has saved insurance firms. Without the concession to reward drivers, it would not be fair or worthwhile to provide insurance companies with access to a penalty points database.</P>
    <P>Currently, offers from major insurance companies have fallen well short of the Minister's 15% target and centre largely on redistributing savings in general, without specifying a reward for individual policyholders. Once again, insurance companies are not playing ball. They need to show more vision and should make an investment in saving lives but, instead, they are focusing on profits. This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to approach the issue of road safety in other ways. For example, there needs to be a major publicity campaign to inform the public that the speed limit on any minor road is the maximum safe speed at which a vehicle can <Col N="1538" />travel on that road. At the same time, we need to take cognisance of the fact that many of our roads are governed by inappropriate speed limits. I encourage the Minister to tackle this issue by way of review without delay. It is not sensible that on narrow roads of poor quality such as that between Sligo and Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, in my constituency, one can drive at 60 miles per hour, while on roads such as the Galway ring road and the Lucan bypass, cars are restricted to limits of 30, 40 and 50 miles per hour, roads similar in standard to international airport runways.</P>
    <P>I refer to the issue of infrastructural deficiencies in some areas of the State. It is important to take into account the fact that a considerable number of accidents occur on our secondary roads as well as on poor quality national routes. While there are proposals under the national development plan to upgrade many of these roads, the timeframes outlined in the national roads needs study are in many cases prohibitive. I am discouraged when I drive along the N5, one of the BMW region's main arteries. It is in a chronic state of disrepair and general inadequacy. According to the NRA's recommendations, it may not be upgraded in full for another 15 years. This route is hazardous to motorists and pedestrians alike. By improving it, the number of road accidents and deaths could be further reduced. The N56, N61 and N16 are equally hazardous but, again, improvements are well down the priority list for the NRA.</P>
    <P>There have been positive developments in this area, aimed solely at improving the quality of roads nationwide. For example, the M4-M6 Kilcock-Kinnegad road project represents the NRA's first major inter-urban public private partnership scheme. The PPP mechanism has introduced significant private sector funding, ensuring earlier delivery of important national road schemes and increasing the scale of road construction activity above that which would be possible through reliance on Exchequer funding alone. Whether it is through this mechanism, the National Development Finance Agency or other means, I urge the Minister to find the necessary funds to improve the general quality of these roads, which will further reduce the number of road deaths.</P>
    <P>All those involved in road safety and all responsible citizens have welcomed the introduction of the penalty points system for speeding. It is still early days and there are teething problems, which are being overcome, but the success of penalty points to date is evidenced by the number of lives saved and injuries averted. While this reduction is welcome, we must not lose sight of the families still being devastated by the loss of a loved one. I encourage all those involved to continue their good work in this area and not lose momentum for this reason.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the penalty points system and all his work in this area. At the same time, I encourage him to swiftly introduce further offences under the scheme to ensure we <Col N="1539" />continue to further reduce the number of deaths and accidents on our roads. I ask him to take into account what I have said regarding appropriate speed limits and infrastructural improvements and appeal to him to ensure insurance companies are finally made to face their responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I address the motion, I refer to the nonsense uttered by my good friend, Senator Ross. He has a remarkably selective view of the Government and its predecessors. If Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Finance, had behaved with the same level of irresponsibility as the current Minister for Finance in the two years prior to the 1997 election, the Government parties would never have seen the inside of Government Buildings. If the rainbow coalition parties had let the public finances run for two years with the same abandon as the Government parties, they would have won the 1997 election and presided over a boom with considerably greater skill than the Government elected. They would also have been re-elected last year. However, the price paid by them was to lose an election.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that the rainbow coalition lost an election, the current Administration inherited the most remarkable set of figures at a stage when 50,000 to 60,000 jobs a year were being created. In a short period of five and a half years, it has managed to get rid of that. Senator Ross's belief that rectitude in public finances is a characteristic of the current Government is based more on romance than reality. His continuing romance with the Minister for Finance has more to do with his judgment on this than reality ever had.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister introduced the penalty points system. Not a single Member of the Oireachtas would say otherwise. However, I will not congratulate a Minister for taking a decision. The reason Government Members are so keen to do this is because it is a rarity that someone in the Government should take a serious decision which might go wrong. It might not have worked. The Minister received advice from many alleged experts that we were not ready for the system. However, he took responsibility and did something. I thought Governments were supposed to accept responsibility and take action. Now we are being told it is a shining example because it is such an unusual event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can go through a list of Departments &ndash; starting with the Department of Health and Children &ndash; where people pass everything on to study groups. The Houses have a study group, the all-party committee on the Constitution, which is looking at an issue we have been debating for 20 years, namely, the Constitution and building land. If we cannot take a decision after umpteen studies, advice from umpteen Attorney Generals etc., I will not stand up and cheer someone who found another excuse to propose a decision. I expect Government Ministers to make decisions. I am <Col N="1540" />glad that the Minister, unusually for a member of the Government, made a decision. It has worked.</P>
    <P>If we had the same level of road safety here as in Britain, there would probably be approximately 200 to 220 deaths per annum. If we had Scandinavian levels of road safety, I do not have the exact figures but I believe our road deaths would total approximately 150. I have been driving for roughly 40 years and, if the level of road safety in Scandinavian countries had held sway here, there would be approximately 12,000 people alive who are now dead. That figure is equivalent to the population of a large provincial town. The countries to which I refer are not totalitarian states. They had a commitment, once they reached a moderate level of affluence, to develop a decent infrastructure. We do not have that and will not have it as long as the Government insists, for ideological reasons, that borrowing for infrastructural investment is something to be done reluctantly or incoherently and without a strategy. It will be the first to borrow to pay for bits of things, but it will not have a plan, a philosophy or a timescale and that is a matter of great regret.</P>
    <P>It is a also matter of great regret that other priorities took over in the past five years and money which could have been used on infrastructural development was otherwise frittered away. We are paying the price now. I have driven on nominally national roads which are of the standard of a road on which I drove in Tanzania 15 years ago. That road had been built with international aid, but had not been maintained and was developing a magnificent collection of potholes.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government has one member capable of making a decision. Perhaps he should have a word with his colleagues. He made a decision, but he has been let down. I have had to drive the road from Cork to Dublin weekly for the past six or seven months. On perhaps 20 return journeys, I have seen one Garda car enforcing the speed limit. It is one of the busiest roads in the country, but I have seen only one Garda car. Perhaps they are doing a wonderful job elsewhere. The Garda Commissioner took exception to the statistic of one in&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must be taking the train.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Senator Dooley has a limited opinion of my abilities, but I know the difference between being on a train and driving a car.</P>
      <P>I have begun to believe that statistic of one in 1,400 is a fact. My journeys have been speedier than I expected. I thought that once the penalty points system was introduced everybody who needed their driving licence to do their job would be particularly conscientious. I thought all the heavy goods vehicles would travel at 50 mph, the legal limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some reason, however &ndash; perhaps they do not know, they do not care or they believe they <Col N="1541" />will not be caught &ndash; there is not a truck on the Cork-Dublin road which drives at the legal speed limit on any day of the week. The limit is 50 mph, yet they cruise along between 58 and 65 mph. I am glad because it does not slow me down, but they are not observing the limit. I am astonished that people whose jobs would be on the line if they lost their licences are ignoring the law. Does somebody in the truck driving profession know something I do not know about the enforcement of the law?</P>
    <P>I received some figures from the NRA a few years ago. Only 3% of all vehicles registered in Ireland are heavy goods vehicles but they are involved in 10% of fatal accidents. That is a serious issue. Will the Minister, instead of basking in the congratulations of his own party, consider asking the Garda Commissioner if the law on speed limits for trucks is being enforced with the same vigour the Garda Commissioner seems to believe the law on speeding in general is being enforced?</P>
    <P>The Minister did something good in introducing penalty points. However there is a lot more to be done. It has not been done because the Government is populated by people who cannot take decisions. I will, therefore, enthusiastically support the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Transport on his performance in regard to road safety. His initiative in bringing in penalty points has been an outstanding success. It has saved lives and prevented injuries. It has made our roads safer for all those who use them. The introduction of penalty points is an excellent example of Government working for the people. Many people put forward various arguments as to why it could not be done, or why it could not be done yet, but the Minister persevered. He took a tough decision in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Penalty points were initially introduced for speeding offences. They are now being extended to cover other offences such as not wearing seat belts. The sooner they are extended to cover the whole range of offences that cause accidents the better. It is particularly important to bring drink driving offences within the scope of the penalty points system. Together with excessive speed, drink driving is the major reason our road safety record is so bad. There has been some change in attitude to drink driving over the past ten years or so but we still have a long way to go. It is remarkable that we can get worked up about the health dangers, real or imagined, from things like mobile phone masts and incinerators, yet all over the country people are still driving around our roads with dangerous levels of alcohol in their system. A complete change of attitude is needed. I hope that penalty points can help to bring that about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that there may be short-term problems in the administration and implementation of the system, but I am sure that we will get over those difficulties as gardaí become more familiar <Col N="1542" />with the system. The purpose of penalty points, of course, is not to penalise people or to put them off the road; they are aimed at changing driver behaviour. The early indications are that we are seeing a change in driver behaviour. People are beginning to observe 30 mph and 40 mph speed limits. They are now less prone to speeding on the open road and generally driving more carefully, which shows the system is beginning to work. As well as helping to save lives and prevent injuries, the real objective of the initiative, the system is helping to bring down insurance costs for motorists. The Minster is working closely with the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Justice, Equality and Law Reform on an overall Government plan to reduce all insurance costs, including motor premiums. I wish him and his colleagues well in that endeavour and hope we begin to see their efforts pay dividends before the year is out.</P>
    <P>The Minister has displayed commendable political courage in moving forward with the penalty points initiative. I ask him to apply a similar degree of political courage to another major problem confronting us, namely, traffic congestion in our capital city. Progress is being made, for example, the Dublin Port tunnel will open in 2005, the M50 will be completed in the same year, provided we can sort out the cock-up in Carrickmines, the network of quality bus corridors wilI be extended significantly, as the Minister announced earlier this week, and the Luas will open from the middle of next year.</P>
    <P>Great claims have been made about what the Luas system will do for public transport in Dublin. It is the biggest single public transport project in the history of the State and will cost between &euro;700 million and £800 million, depending on which report one reads, a massive investment by any standards. Public transport is all about capacity. However, I am not certain Luas represents good value for money in capacity terms. I understand the project secured Government approval on the basis that each line would be able to carry about 7,000 passengers per hour in each direction. However, recent statements by the Rail Procurement Agency indicate the capacity of each line will only be around 3,000 per hour and that increasing it to 7,000 could only be achieved if the trams were to be run at such a high frequency as to cause huge disruption to road traffic flows in the city. It is important to put in context a capacity of 3,000 passengers per hour. This is the same as can be achieved on one high frequency quality bus corridor, which costs about one twentieth of a Luas line. Clearly, therefore, Luas does not represent good value for money for the taxpayers of the country or the people of Dublin.</P>
    <P>We must also be cognisant of the impact the Luas will have on traffic movements in the city generally. One does not have to be a transport engineer to see that the junction of the M50 and N7 is a mess &ndash; even the Minister has accepted this is the case. The Red Cow roundabout is now <Col N="1543" />known as the &ldquo;Mad Cow&rdquo; roundabout. The junction was under-engineered from the outset and we are now paying a huge price in appalling traffic congestion. It is about to get even madder because &ndash; some may find this unbelievable &ndash; two level crossings will be placed across two slip lanes of one of the busiest roundabouts in the country. While I sincerely hope this piece of engineering does not cause massive traffic congestion in the whole west Dublin area, I find it hard to see how this will be avoided. Its impact on traffic movement could be chaotic.</P>
    <P>Luas will not only affect cars. Dublin Bus estimates that the light rail system is already causing serious disruption to its services, even before it is formally commissioned. The company recently stated the running time on the number 51 route had doubled because of the Luas works, while journey times on routes 39, 68 and 69 had been seriously affected. Those who use these routes will not benefit from Luas because they live in Clondalkin, Rathcoole, Newcastle, Castleknock and Blanchardstown, parts of the city which will not be served by the system.</P>
    <P>While I accept we must complete the two Luas lines currently under construction, I strongly disagree with the DTO's strategy document, Platform for Change, which envisages a network of Luas lines covering the city. Dublin's future transport needs will be best served by a metro delivered to Madrid standards, which is, I understand, an option the Minister is investigating. I hope this is the route we take. I wish the Minister well and hope he returns to the House to discuss other transport projects such as the metro before we embark on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House. Late last year, on one of the previous occasions he was here, we had an excellent debate on the penalty points system. Like Senator Ryan, I will briefly address the rather intemperate outburst by Senator Ross and his astonishing attempt to rewrite history during the first part of his contribution. In his efforts to ingratiate himself with the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, the Senator fails to draw the attention of the House to the fact that public spending between 2000 and 2002 went completely out of control. When compared to the expenditure of the Government in office between 1995 and 1997, the current level of public finances is abominable. Whereas two years ago we had a budget surplus of nearly &euro;5 billion, in the first three months of this year an additional &euro;1.7 billion had to be borrowed to pay for the various projects the Government is pursuing. From time to time, the Senator's pinpoint economics take a rather selective view of history. He should prepare more comprehensively for debates such as this, rather than making ingratiating statements, as he sometimes does, towards the other side of the House. He could be described as the &ldquo;Continuity&rdquo; Fianna Fáil Party sitting on this side of the <Col N="1544" />House. I am sure the Minister is happy to see him in our midst.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a good start on a number of the proposals he has brought to bear. However, Senators on the other side of the House should note the penalty points system was not his initiative but was produced by the Government in 1998. The Government's response to Dr. Bacon's report on the issue, outlined by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, former Deputy Molloy, promised the penalty points system would be operational by 2000. It is a matter of fact that the system came into operation two years late.</P>
      <P>When the penalty points system was introduced in the latter part of last year, a major effort was made by the Garda Síochána and all the relevant authorities to make it work. This had a dramatic effect on driving behaviour, particularly in the three or four months after October. Unfortunately, the position has since deteriorated as the old, pathetic driving habits, which caused carnage for many years, returned to the roads, precisely because we do not have the same level of high profile enforcement we had in the final three months of 2002. The Government must take direct responsibility for this &ndash; the issue at the heart of Senator Browne's amendment &ndash; and Senators on the Government side should address it in the course of their contributions.</P>
      <P>During the six day period of the most recent public holiday some three weeks ago, 19 lives were lost, the worst figure for a long time. Other Ministers, notably the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, share responsibility for this issue. A co-ordinated effort at ministerial level is required. Widespread enforcement, not just by the Garda but also through the Minister's idea of a traffic corps, is the only way to make the system work. What has happened to this idea? It is only sensible to have a dedicated corps of officers directly responsible for constantly enforcing the penalty points system on the highways and byways. What are we doing to implement this proposal, which is one aspect of the amendment and an issue to which Senator Browne rightly referred? If we are serious about enforcement, we have to consider the fact, revealed in the other House last week, that just three speed cameras are operating at any one time in the country and a total of 20 boxes are in place in four counties around Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of giving each other pats on the back for our handling of the issue, which is the direct responsibility of the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than the Minster, we should be enforcing the system. The evidence since January has been poor. We should take cognisance of this. Instead of tabling ritualistic motions congratulating the Minister, the issue <Col N="1545" />should be taken more seriously than in this debate.</P>

      <P>Enforcement is the issue, an area on which we are falling down. We are also falling down on the areas of the traffic corps, the number of speed cameras and the number of gardaí on the streets. We made a huge difference in the latter part of last year and need to redouble our efforts to ensure the penalty points system is fully operational.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister for Transport (Mr. S. Brennan): I thank Senators for their kind contributions. I have circulated a script which they can read. I wish to make a few comments about the matters raised which are at the heart of this debate. I thank Senator Dooley for taking the initiative and tabling the motion.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senators who warned against complacency. It will take the combined efforts of the Government, the Garda, the insurance industry and motorists to ensure the start of a good project does not fade away because of complacency. There is no doubt that the penalty points system has saved lives. It has resulted in a reduction of one third in the number of road deaths, substantially reduced injuries, lower health bills and hospital costs and a lot less personal tragedy. I would like to be here this time next year to say the second six months were as good as the first six. However, I share the concerns expressed by Senators. The system has delivered substantial results and can do so again provided there is full enforcement and 100% attention from everyone charged with making it work. While I appreciate the efforts of the rank and file gardaí who have worked hard on the project in recent months, I encourage and urge them to keep the pressure on and keep up the level of enforcement to which they have committed themselves. It would be a tragedy, not for me politically as I have overcome many such difficulties from time to time, but for the people in terms of the sadness they would feel if the system did not have a second six months as good as the first six.</P>
    <P>The reason the penalty points system works is that it deals with the individual driver. If a truck driver gets a fine, it cannot be sent to head office in Cork any more. If a high-powered executive travelling on the road to Galway gets five speeding tickets, they cannot be sent to head office to <Col N="1546" />be paid. That day is gone. The points go on the individual's licence, not the company's books. This means a person will lose his or her licence once he or she gets 12 points. If a person who has lost his or her licence is caught driving, he or she could go to prison. It means a truck driver will lose his or her job. People have realised that the system is personal. It is not just a fine of &euro;80 with which head office can deal. This is different and that is the reason it is working. Everyone needs to know that the level of enforcement is such that a person will get caught and lose his or her licence. This means a person will be in trouble socially and perhaps from an employment and family point of view.</P>
    <P>As regards insurance, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I have formed a Cabinet sub-committee to deal with a range of insurance issues relating to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are considering a range of initiatives.</P>
    <P>As regards motor insurance, I am still unhappy with the level of response from the insurance companies. I received a letter dated 8 May from the Irish Insurance Federation in response to my request that, in return for loading motorists with penalty points, it would give a specific reduction to those without penalty points. It stated that whatever money it received as a result of loading motorists with penalty points would be passed on to those without penalty points. That is not what I asked it to do. One does not need to be a mathematician to figure out that the amount of money taken in on extra premiums as a result of loading a small number will not pay for the cuts which the large number without penalty points will get. I want the insurance companies to realise that the reduction in the number of road deaths and injuries has already saved them hundreds of millions of euros in six months. At the end of another six months, if we keep the pressure on, it will result in another few hundred million for them. I want them to pass this money on to those without penalty points because it rightly belongs to them. They should agree to do this.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the industry doing that deal, I propose to proceed to make such an arrangement with individual companies. Insurance companies require data relating to the numbers and names of those with penalty points. I am prepared to make this data available but only on the strict understanding that if a person does not have penalty points, he or she will get a cut in his or her insurance premium. I am not trying to reduce insurance costs out of a wish to be populist but because one of the main deterrents to speeding and penalty points is the certainty that not only will people lose their licences but that their insurance premium will increase. I have a family in their twenties and they are paying &euro;2,000, <Col N="1547" />&euro;2,500 or &euro;3,000 for motor car insurance. A 10% reduction would be a fantastic attraction. They would slow down and be twice as careful if they got such a cut in their premium. By slowing down, they would save their lives and perhaps someone else's also.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are trying to have it both ways. I appeal to them to take a different view. They are saying it is a good scheme but want to see how it works and how much money they make before they will consider giving some of it back. That is not good enough. I want them to engage and invest in the scheme now in order that we can make it successful. If they do not do this, they will miss a great opportunity. If they stand back from this, as long as I am in political life, I do not want to hear them complaining again about their difficulties, the number of road deaths and the efforts to reduce them. This is an opportunity for them to get on board and help me to reduce the number of road deaths.</P>
    <P>As Senators said, this is about changing driver behaviour, not penalising motorists. When the full system is rolled out, there will be 67 offences. Many are already offences but do not attract penalty points. I confirm to Senators that from 1 June it will be an offence not to have insurance. That offence will attract five penalty points, which is serious. On 1 July the offence of not wearing seat belts will be added. Only 20% in the rear seats of motor cars wear seat belts. That figure is disastrously low. Penalty points will help in that regard.</P>
    <P>I propose in the next couple of weeks, if I can clear some legal issues, to bring forward random testing by the Garda for alcohol. This is another initiative in the legislation which I am required to introduce. At present a person can only be tested for drink driving if a garda forms an opinion that he or she is under the influence of drink. The phrase, &ldquo;forms an opinion&rdquo;, is highly charged from a legal point of view. If a garda formed a wrong opinion or failed to form an opinion, he or she would be in difficulty with the judge. The requirement that a garda form an opinion is one of the reasons our drink driving laws are under pressure and challenged. I propose to sign this regulation which means the Garda can test at random for motor offences. That is what the law currently states. A motor offence is anything from double parking to parking on double yellow lines to a broken tail light or a wiper which does not work.</P>
    <P>When the regulations are in place, a breach of any one of those laws will allow the Garda, without having to form an opinion, to randomly seek a breadth test from the individual concerned. I am informed by the road safety organisations that this will have a dramatic effect because current testing for alcohol is severely limited. I intend to move on that front fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" />Many Senators referred to the number of people caught speeding in areas where the 30 mph limit applies. The National Roads Authority will shortly publish a survey which illustrates that 99% of people in Ireland do not adhere to the 30 mph speed limit. This means that only 1% of drivers adhere to the speed limit. We need to take a real look at this and decide whether we want to have a 30 mph speed limit. Some people will say it is hard to adhere to such a limit because it is too low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One third of fatal accidents on Irish roads occur in areas to which the 30 mph speed limit applies. Such fatalities usually involve pedestrians &ndash; such as children running out of gates on to the road and people walking late at night &ndash; and cyclists knocked down by cars. A different view of this is taken on the Continent, where 20 mph speed limits are in operation. I do not propose to introduce such a speed limit here, but we are going to reconsider this issue.</P>
      <P>I agree that some of our speed limits are daft. I have driven on roads with 40 mph speed limits that could easily be upgraded to 50 mph zones and roads with 30 mph speed limits that could easily be upgraded to a 40 mph zones. I have also driven on roads in the middle of nowhere with 60 mph speed limits which should be reduced to 50 mph because the roads in question are very dangerous. People are becoming aware of speed limits. Somebody told me the other day he had only just realised that speed limits in particular areas were signposted. He had not noticed the signs before due to the fact that he was not affected by them because if caught, he only had to pay a fine. The person concerned felt road safety was something advertised on television and did not relate to him.</P>
      <P>I propose, in the context of going metric over the next year or so, to revise all speed limits and make them realistic. We cannot expect people to adhere to unrealistic speed limits. The statistics in relation to areas were 30 mph speed limits apply are interesting and we must face up to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also propose to tackle issues in respect of motorcyclists. Quite a high number of fatalities involve motorcycles. I recently came across statistics &ndash; I should have got them earlier, I am staggered by them &ndash; which illustrate that 70% of motorcyclists do not hold a full licence. This means that only 30% of all motorcyclists on the road have a full licence. Some 70% of them have no training, have not taken a test and have not received a single day's instruction. They simply buy a bike and obtain a provisional licence and off they go. Many deaths on our roads involve motorcyclists. We also need to tackle the issue of pillion passengers. I am informed by the <Col N="1549" />insurance companies that pillion passengers account for 90% of fatalities on motorcycles. It is illegal for someone with a provisional licence to carry a pillion passenger on a motorcycle. Insurance companies are paying out in such circumstances. I am not suggesting that they should not do so. I plan to tackle that issue in the next couple of weeks. I am looking in particular at the introduction of a compulsory test or course for motorcyclists before provisional licences are granted. I intend to examine the age at which a person is allowed to drive a motorcycle. I consider 16 years of age to be too young. I am aware that the age limit rises to 18 years of age in respect of different sizes of motorcycles. We must take a serious look at this area. The statistics also state that more than 10% of those killed on motorcycles were not wearing helmets.</P>
    <P>We cannot lecture or congratulate ourselves on road safety and not tackle some of these issues. Some 300,000 drivers hold only provisional licences. I received a call from a Member of the Dáil at the height of the debate on provisional licences stating that a constituent who, for 12 years, had an important job in the factory five or six miles down the road could not put up with my silly ideas in regard to limiting the number of provisional licences a person could obtain. I was told that such a provision would interfere with the man's job. On reviewing the case, I discovered the person concerned had held a provisional licence for 12 years, had only applied for one test and had duly failed it because he had not taken any instruction. That person held down a job which required a significant degree of intelligence and could easily have applied himself to obtaining instruction and passing the test. It begs the question that has been put to me many times, namely, &ldquo;What if I fail the test five times, how do I get to work?&rdquo;  A person who fails the test five times should not be permitted to drive.</P>
    <P>That is what we, as politicians, will have to tell our constituents when they come to see us on Saturday mornings. One cannot simply promise to have a word with the relevant Minister to see what can be done, that will not work anymore. We will have to tell our constituents the reality of the situation. I am increasingly annoyed by the fact that legislation is passed by the Dáil and Seanad and the President goes to the trouble of signing of it and yet, none us actually ensures the laws are enacted. Politicians are often the worst in the world because they encourage people in this way.</P>
    <P>Road safety is not something I dreamed up. Some 42,000 people across the 15 states in the European Union die each year as a result of road accidents. There are those who talk about the number of people dying in Iraq, in world wars and from SARS. If that figure of 42,000 related to anything else, there would be an absolute rev<Col N="1550" />olution and some really serious action would be taken. We must not be soft on this issue.</P>
    <P>Many Senators asked about speed cameras. I will shortly put a proposal to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that the provision of speed cameras be put out to the private sector. If the infamous clampers we all love to hate could deal successfully with this issue we would have a great deal more action in that area. Senator Wilson asked whether penalty points are reciprocal in Northern Ireland. That is a good idea. I have spoken to my colleagues in the North and we are planning to do so as soon as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>My script refers to many more issues such as our future in Europe, our advertising campaigns, the engineering of motorways, high-level task forces and strategies. They are important issues. I thank Senators for tabling the motion. I do not object to the amendment in that I know there is no one in this House or the Lower House who does not want it to work. Some of the criticisms are political, but they are the everyday words of politics. This is too important to be a political issue.</P>
    <P>I appeal to colleagues &ndash; I have been guilty of this in the past &ndash; not to be soft on their constituents when it comes to road safety issues such as driving licences, driving tests, motorcycles, drink driving and so on. We will have to stand up to our constituents and tell them, loud and clear, that we will not tolerate it any more. That will be particularly important when I introduce the changes in regard to provisional licences. Long-term permanent reliance on provisional licences makes a joke of the law. People cannot assume that the driving test is for somebody else and not for them. More than 54% of Irish people pass their test, which is in line with countries internationally. There is no reason we cannot increase that figure.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley made the point about the number of points being given for an advanced driving programme, which is a good idea. I will look into it and I have taken on board the suggestions from other Senators in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the debate and I will take on board and try to implement many of the suggestions that were made. In acknowledging the thanks from the House for what we have done to date, I want to make it clear that complacency is a major enemy to road safety. I appeal to everybody &ndash; the Garda, motorists, politicians, etc. &ndash; to keep the pressure on so that the second six months in which the system will be in operation will be as good as the first six-month period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third or fourth occasion on which we have dealt with the area of road safety in the past 12 months. This suggests that the matter is either a significant priority or else it is a sign of the political bankruptcy of the House in that we cannot come up with new ideas. I <Col N="1551" />doubt it is the second because the motion was put down in the name of Senator Dooley, who is one of the brightest members of the Joint Committee on Transport. We are lucky to have people such as the Senator in the House.</P>
      <P>Unlike Senator Ross, I do not consider myself to be a member of the Opposition and, as an Independent Member, I am capricious with my vote. I vote along the lines in which I believe &ndash; sometimes with the Government, sometimes against it. Looking at the terms of the motion and the amendment, it strikes me that there is an element of Tweedledum and Tweedledee at play here. For example, the motion commends while the amendment condemns. It appears that we are engaging in a game of political ping-pong. I am not sure this is absolutely necessary because, in my opinion, there is nothing offensive in the Government motion, which simply recognises the situation.</P>
      <P>I wish to place on record, my admiration and delight at what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, did in terms of taking his speech as read and then dealing with substantive points raised earlier in the debate. That is an excellent headline for other Ministers. We can all read the speeches prepared in advance. It is great when a Minister has the confidence to stand up and depart from the script to discuss issues from the debate. That is the essence of vital political life and I hope it is a trend that will be followed by other Ministers.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very frank about speed limits. I raised this matter when last we debated this issue. Speed limits are chaotic. The problem is that we cannot get people to respect the law as there is no consistency or fairness in it. The Minister was honest enough to say that there are certain places where the limit is 30 mph when it should be 50 mph and some places where it is 60 mph when it should be 30 mph. When I raised this during the previous debate, I was told that the setting of speed limits was in the hands of the local authorities. I suggest that these authorities should be given a brief to ensure there is an overall traffic plan in terms of speed limits or, alternatively, the power should be taken away from the local authorities and given to a central traffic authority. People will not respect plainly insupportable alterations to speed limits. I have provided examples about various roads in the past with which Members will be familiar. It would add insult to injury to put speed cameras on these roads because it would be like shooting fish in a barrel. It is a stupid idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amused to learn there are only three speed cameras operating in the country. It is almost like Russian roulette where motorists are tempted to put the foot down to see if a speed camera is, in fact, in operation or if an old box <Col N="1552" />has merely been put in place. Apparently, one has a damn good chance of its being just an old box.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps there is justification for transferring responsibility for speed cameras to a commercial authority. That would create considerable resentment, however, and, before it is done, realistic speed limits must be introduced.</P>
      <P>With regard to accidents in urban areas, we have a duty to educate pedestrians and cyclists. We are all pedestrians and many of us are cyclists, as well as being motorists. I am horrified by people who sail around the roads &ndash; not just in the cities, where the streets are well lit, but also in rural areas &ndash; with no lights on their bicycles and wear dark clothing, which makes them difficult to see. No amount of tinkering with the speed limit is going to save the lives of such foolish people.</P>
      <P>I will ignore the first half of the amendment because it is politically destructive and merely attacks the Government. However, the Minister was courageous to state that he agrees with some of the issues raised. It is a good idea, and a reasonable proposal, to establish the statutory registration for driving instructors. These people are charged with controlling the quality of driving which has a real impact on road fatalities. However, we do not register or test them and, as a result, anybody can set up operations as a driving instructor. That is not correct.</P>
      <P>I accept that the issue of competition in the motor insurance sector falls slightly outside of the debate, or it was until Fine Gael included it in its amendment. The Minister, more power to him, took up the point. I am glad to hear about the way he has been speaking to the insurance companies, because that is what they need.</P>
      <P>I am again being parochial and personal, but I represent many people who do not understand why they are expected to pay so much for their insurance. I have a no claims bonus which dates back centuries. I obtained my driving licence when I was 16.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As already stated, I have a no claims bonus. I have a beautiful car which cost me only &euro;5,000. However, the insurance premium has risen to &euro;1,800 and I do not know the reason for this. It could be justified if the size of the motor car I own had any effect on the equation or the spare parts for it &ndash; they are quite expensive &ndash; come <Col N="1553" />into play. However, I am only insured for third party, fire and theft. If I was involved in an accident or if the car was stolen, the insurance company would only be obliged to pay out approximately &euro;3,000. I do not understand how premia are calculated. I believe the insurance companies say that I have a swanky car and, even though it is ten years old, that they will whack him.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statements on motorcyclists and I was surprised to learn that only 10% of them are the subject of fatal accidents because they do not wear helmets. I anticipated it would be a higher figure. I believe the Minister is wise to caution us on that issue.</P>
    <P>Member of Fine Gael are within their rights, and I support them, in seeking to have the Minister publish the figures for those found guilty of having caused accidents on the roads, with details of age, gender, type of vehicle driven and cause of accident being provided. This would help us to have a much more informed debate. I do not want these people to be named and shamed, but I believe that we are entitled to this information.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on what he is doing. This has been a useful debate, particular in the context of the Minister departing from his script and replying to Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, and I congratulate him on his hands-on, proactive and realistic approach to the matter of improving how we use our roads. For many years, the introduction of penalty points was merely discussed and was the subject of much waffle. Some said it was unworkable and others simply did not want to change. The previous Minister laid the groundwork in this area, but the current Minister had the bottle to introduce it.</P>
      <P>For a system which, according to some commentators, is not working or is unworkable, 18,000 point notifications and a 32% drop in six-month figures to date for road deaths is a very acceptable rate of return on what is a new innovation in our motoring culture. It is difficult to change people's attitudes but that process has begun.</P>
      <P>The cost of insurance has always been an issue for motorists, particularly young motorists. For many years the insurance companies have profited greatly from high premiums, and the Minister is justified in seeking a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the expected reduction in the number of claims as a result of the introduction of the penalty points system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to driver attitudes and competence, there has been a cultural change. Changes in the driving test, including the introduction of a writ<Col N="1554" />ten theory test, have to some degree improved matters, although more needs to be done. I agree with the suggestion that the teaching of driving skills could at some stage form part of the school curriculum. As part of transition year, teenagers could possibly be introduced to the rules of the road. While they do not necessarily need to be driving, they could be made aware of the responsibilities they will face when they begin to drive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan2" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, thank the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, for his address. All Members of the House seem to agree with the report. With regard to the speed limit review, while the Minister has said he has asked local authorities to carry out inspections of all by-laws governing speed limits, it is most important that they now carry out a speed limit review. In the past it has taken them three years from the start of a review to come back to the National Roads Authority for sanction. This is an important area now that penalty points are being added to drivers' licences. It is essential that such a review is carried out this year. I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
      <P>Regarding the revenue raised from the penalty points system, it is great to see the National Roads Authority's low-cost safety measures being extended. This programme contributes greatly to road safety and the money is well spent. With regard to level crossings and the many dangerous spots on our roads which need additional funding, many lives could be saved.</P>
      <P>National roads have been mentioned. While Senators on the Government side of the House are very proud of the achievements in the national roads programme, Senator Bannon mentioned the need for more infrastructure. I am glad to see him express his support for the programme. I know that some of the roads in question require tolls to implement the full programme but I am delighted to see the Opposition coming round to our way of thinking on the issue. I wish the Minister well in the implementation of the report.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Jim Walsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, whom I congratulate, has a great grasp of matters and there is no point in saying otherwise. He understands the problems and issues involved. He was appointed in May and by November had initiated the first phase of the road strategy campaign. That to my mind is fantastic. He knows where he is going. He stood here today without his script and was able to grasp and field the issues outlined by various Senators. That is what I call knowledge. He is very clear on his plans for the future. One area I hope he will tackle is that of motorcyclists, which I dread meeting on the road. It seems they can do what <Col N="1555" />they like. I am delighted the Minister will grasp this nettle and make sure they will receive fundamental training.</P>
    <P>Another area that requires attention is the review of speed limits. Speed signs should be colossal without any small letters because this, too, can be a deterrent to good driving. This is absolutely necessary. I am not convinced, however, that a speed limit reduction from 40 mph to 30 mph would work, as that is the limit at which motorists are getting caught. This might be a little unfair, as they can be caught for penalty points. I hope the Minister will review the decision in this light.</P>
    <P>The report is a great success story, the best I have heard, and I want to go out and sell it. We are playing a blinder if we can reduce the number of fatalities on the roads. A 32% reduction cannot be beaten in such a short time. However, there is better to come with the proposals listed, which I know the Minister will be successful in implementing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has displayed a lot of common sense and pragmatism in the way he has introduced these measures, and there has been good compliance.</P>
      <P>I will touch on a couple of issues which may need tweaking or, in some instances, a reversal of policy. One of these, as the Minister has acknowledged, relates to speed limits in certain areas not being commensurate with requirements. This needs to be looked at. A prime example arises on my journey to this House each week. I pass through 30 mph zones about a mile or two from small villages. This brings the law into disrepute. On the Arklow bypass, as good as any motorway in the country, there is a 60 mph limit, yet if I travel a back road, with bends, I am still allowed to travel at the same speed. We need to apply common sense in this area, as I am glad the Minister has suggested.</P>
      <P>There is a menu of 67 offences which will come under the penalty point regulations. When the Bill was being debated in this House on Second Stage, I raised some reservations. It is quite sensible, as the Minister noted, to apply points to the non-wearing of seat belts and the non-possession of insurance. I am not quite so convinced, however, that if someone parks illegally, for example, he or she should accumulate them. We should keep the focus on speeding and major offences because if we move into the realm of minor offences, we may dilute the effect we are trying to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been suggestions that because of the lack of computer and IT technology in the policing area there is a time lag with regard to motorists being notified of their offences and accumulating penalty points. In the interests of fairness, this should be looked at. There should <Col N="1556" />perhaps be a requirement that notification be received by the offender within a given period. I would not like to see, for example, a situation where because of delays in notification motorists could have accumulated the maximum number of points.</P>
    <P>With regard to traffic enforcement and the suggestion of a traffic corps, I suggest to the Minister that he might usefully look at the community warden scheme in operation within local government. This scheme attends to offences relating to parking, litter and planning, and could allow local authorities to deal very effectively with speeding arrangements on our roads. This is done in other countries where the police which has responsibility for criminal activities are not obliged to travel the roads measuring the speed at which motorists are travelling.</P>
    <P>I have a very strong objection to the utilisation of motor insurance premiums as an instrument for enforcement. Detection, enforcement, penalties and sanctions are the ways to deal with offences against the law. I do not agree that we should give penalty point information to insurance companies, regardless of any agreement, because I have no doubt it would be abused. If motorists accumulate maximum points and are put off the road, this should have an impact but only at that stage should it impact on their insurance premium. Motorists have for years been paying exorbitant insurance premiums. We should not facilitate such a move.</P>

      <P>The Government should not take greatly to heart any criticism about the greatly improved attitude towards driving. Criticism in this area is good because we keep on looking at the mortality figures, not at the morbidity figures, which, as the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, knows, are dramatically decreasing. This is very important because while death represents a terrible tragedy for the families involved, the morbidity figures are shocking. I am a member of the board of Peamount Hospital where we have a special unit for what are described as people with long-term neurological disabilities, all as a result of car and motor-bike accidents. This is an appalling situation for the people concerned, most of whom will not be in a position to recover and are a huge <Col N="1557" />burden on the finances of the State. We must do everything possible to avoid people finding themselves in such a position.</P>
      <P>While I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the penalty points system, the more we do the better because this is an area we have neglected for far too long.</P>

As I said at the outset, and based on the content of the amendment to the motion, the glass will always be half empty.</P>
      <P>Obviously, good news tends to hurt. However, there is no real good news because people are still dying on our roads. The Minister, and the speakers on this side of the House, all alluded to that fact. There is no doubt that there is a lot more to be done, to coin that other&mdash;</P>

Indeed, he pointed out that there are elements of it which need to be completed. We must accept that what has been achieved is fundamentally sound. Lives have been saved. Obviously, we want to see more lives being saved and we are working on that.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan explained that he enthusiastically supports the Opposition's amendment while also accepting the Minister's achievements. He congratulated the Minister but did not feel that he deserves any better commendation because he is only doing his job. As he accepted that the job is being done well, I find it difficult to see how he is going to disagree with our motion and vote against it. However, that is for him to decide.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also raised the issue of enforcement. He does not believe that the Garda Síochána is doing its job. I can assure him that it is doing it. I travel on a similar section of the road to that used by the Senator on a weekly basis. While I travel from Clare and he travels from Cork, the roads join near Portlaoise and, unfortunately, I see too many gardaí on the road between Portlaoise and Dublin.

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, for being in attendance and I also thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Clondra sewerage scheme in County Longford has been a burning issue with the residents of the area for some time. Officials in the Department of the Environment and Local Government have been aware of the matter since 1973, when it was first raised. On several occasions, political statements have been made regarding an early commencement date for the scheme but these have amounted to waffle and hot air.</P>
      <P>Clondra is located on the River Shannon, beside the Royal Canal, and has a thriving harbour. It is a heritage and fishing village which attracts huge numbers of tourists every year. Local residents, tour operators, fishery bodies and schools have all expressed serious concerns about the high levels of raw sewage in the vicinity of the village, with obvious health and economic repercussions for the area if the problem is not rectified soon. It is dreadful to see locals and tourists walking around this scenic village, with handkerchiefs held to their faces as they try to block out the smell of raw sewage. The people of the area are greatly embarrassed and distressed by this problem. It is very frustrating that the development of their village has been slowed down by the lack of a sewerage scheme, which it is estimated would cost in the region of &euro;1.3 million.</P>
      <P>I request that the Department of the Environment and Local Government approve this sewerage scheme immediately, as pollution in the area is out of control. Infrastructure and village renewal is important for small villages such as Clondra. Given the village's sewage pollution, which in turn is flowing into our waterways and polluting groundwater, it is facing an end to its development and a serious threat to the health and safety of its residents and visitors.</P>
      <P>The village of Clondra has approximately 40 houses, a restaurant, two public houses, a community centre, a school and industry. It has an over-concentration of septic tanks in rocky or poor quality soil, which results in pollution of watercourses, such as the Shannon and Camlin rivers and the Royal Canal. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the sewerage scheme should be approved and constructed immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key to healthy, sustainable settlement patterns in any village is matching demand for development with the supply of sanitary services. I have raised this issue on many occasions with Longford County Council and was told at last <Col N="1562" />month's meeting that all revised documentation requested by the Department has been with them since 19 February for final approval. In the interests of health and safety, it is important for the Department to approve this scheme immediately. I ask the Minister of State to write to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in order to rectify the matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Minister of State at the Department of Transport </P>
    <P>(Dr. McDaid): I am pleased to reply to Senator Bannon on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives continues to be a major focus of Government spending. The unprecedented increase in investment by my colleague's Department on water and sewerage schemes under the current and previous national development plans has made a key contribution to economic growth that has benefited every part of the country.</P>
    <P>Total investment in water and sewerage facilities over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will amount to almost &euro;4.9 billion, of which over &euro;4.2 billion is earmarked for major public schemes. This investment is aimed at supporting economic and social development, employment generation and the achievement of high environmental standards.</P>
    <P>In April 2002, the second phase of the water services investment programme under the current national development plan was announced. This phase covers the period 2002-04 and is a continuation of a rolling strategy that will be progressively advanced up to the end of the NDP in 2006.</P>
    <P>The total allocated for County Longford under the current phase of the programme comes to over &euro;28.4 million in respect of some 12 schemes. The approved schemes include major sewerage projects at Granard and Ballymahon, which have recently been completed. Schemes at the planning stage include the Longford regional water supply scheme and the Longford sewerage scheme, phase two, which are expected to start in 2004.</P>
    <P>Other schemes, which have been approved to enter planning, include sewerage schemes at Drumlish and Newtownforbes, and the review of water supply schemes at Granard and Longford. Under the rural towns and villages initiative, the Lanesborough water supply stage one scheme is being progressed. Sewerage schemes have also been approved at Ardagh, Ballinalee, Aughnacliffe and Clondra. All of these towns and their hinterlands will benefit from the major push to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modern standard.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Clondra sewerage scheme, my colleague's Department is currently examining the design review report, which was submitted <Col N="1563" />by Longford County Council on 19 February 2003. This report reviews the scope of the scheme and reassesses its economic justification. This technical examination is almost complete and Longford County Council will be notified shortly regarding the funding status of the scheme. Once this has been clarified, it will be open to the council to proceed with the preparation of contract documents.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to what the Senator <Col N="1564" />has said. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is keen to see schemes like this one advance quickly so that, as the Senator has pointed out, the benefits that will follow for local communities are brought on stream in the shortest possible timeframe.</P>
