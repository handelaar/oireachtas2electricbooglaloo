    </P>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on the urgent need for funding to carry out repairs to Scoil Áine national school in Clondalkin to ensure the school can comply with the requirements of the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the current status of the application for a new school building for Wardesford Church of Ireland national school, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
    <P>As this is the last sitting day before the summer recess, I thank all Senators for their courtesy and co-operation in the past year. For the 24 new Senators in this 22nd Seanad &ndash; the largest percentage of new Senators in any Seanad &ndash; it was a huge learning curve to familiarise themselves with the restrictions and requirements of the Standing Orders and rulings of the Chair. Some appear to have learned very quickly, but all are learning.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader, Deputy Leader, leaders and Whips of the various groups for their hard work. On behalf of Members, I thank the Clerk, Clerk Assistant and their staff for their guidance and wonderful assistance. I also thank the Superintendent, the Captain of the Guard and their staff, the broadcasting staff and reporting staff. On a personal basis, I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Acting Chairmen for the many hours they spent in the Chair. I also thank members of the press for their attendance and coverage. I wish Members of the House and staff an enjoyable break.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" />One member of staff who gave many years service to Leinster House retired this week as Editor of Debates. I call the Leader of the House to formally propose a tribute to Liam Fitzgibbon.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Before I do so, I echo what the Cathaoirleach said in his tributes to all the Senators under his wise guidance. It is not only the new Senators who had to learn their way. Many of us of much older years had to learn our way as well. It is a pity we cannot bottle the conviviality and distribute it during the year when things get a bit rougher. However, it was a very interesting year.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to you, a Chathaoirligh, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the people who stood in for both of you over the three seasons since we started our business here. I pay tribute to the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and all the staff in their office, which is a nice place to visit. Despite all the work they do, they make everybody welcome and try to help. That is very important. I pay tribute to the press and all the staff of the House who are so friendly, helpful and courteous.</P>
    <P>In particular I thank the Senators, from all parties and from none. We have been very co-operative with one another. We have had our moments, if I can call them that, but that is only proper in a political Chamber. We have done a great deal of good work, however, and during the summer when we consider how we can manage better the affairs of the House from the point of view of work, I hope we will be able to make changes which will benefit proper legislative debate.</P>
    <P>I am particularly mindful of the fact that when difficult or challenging Bills come into this House, having been changed radically in the other House, there is not the time to debate those changes here. We discussed that matter in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I am sure we will be able to work out how we will deal with it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I want to thank the small number of staff in my own office and the staff in each Senator's office. When we call them to try to make arrangements, everybody is most helpful. This is a lively Chamber and it will get even better.</P>
    <P>I echo what the Cathaoirleach said about the Editor of Debates, Liam Fitzgibbon, who has retired. Mr. Fitzgibbon laboured in these Houses for more than 30 years. Since 1996, he has been in charge of the Debates Office. I understand people go to editors and endeavour to get the Official Report changed from time to time. It never struck me to do that. If I say something, that is the end of it. We cannot take away from or add to it. I never trod into those rooms to ask if something could be changed. I was often sorry I said something but I would leave it on the record because it was said in a public Chamber. Liam Fitzgibbon is well known and highly respected by <Col N="1743" />all Members and staff, and he has that excellent record of service behind him.</P>
    <P>Talking about censoring, there is only one occasion on which this House has censored itself and that was in 1942. At that time we had &ldquo;Sirs&rdquo; in this House. A Senator, Sir John Keane, quoted from the book, <i>The Tailor and Ansty,</i> which was forbidden to be read. The then Editor of Debates did not include the quotation from <i>The Tailor and Ansty,</i> written by Eric Cross, a man from Newry, in the Official Report. The entry states: &ldquo;The Senator quoted from the book&rdquo;. It does not even refer to the title, <i>The Tailor and Ansty.</i> That was in 1942. We no longer have &ldquo;Sirs&rdquo; in this House, thankfully, although I am sure they gave good service in their day.</P>
    <P>I believe the then Editor of Debates, who was interested in sailing, was also the press censor and if there were casualties in war, he referred to them as boating accidents. That was a nice way of getting out of it.</P>
    <P>Liam Fitzgibbon gave great service to two local newspapers, <i>The Anglo-Celt</i> and the <i>Leitrim Observer.</i> He has been meticulous in his work here and he was always so polite and courteous. I wish him well in his retirement, which I am sure he will enjoy. I hope he will not burden himself by trying to look at or read what has been going on here. We have cause to remember Liam because he has been a faithful recorder in these Houses. That is something of which he can be duly proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Leader's tributes to Liam Fitzgibbon, who has retired as Editor of Debates in these Houses. The hardest job of anyone in these Houses is to make sense of the ramblings of those of us in both Houses. Mr. Fitzgibbon and his staff have done the State some service in that regard. A serious issue arises, however, about the Editor of Debates and the transcripts that are produced. There is a constitutional requirement that the business of both Houses of the Oireachtas is conducted in public and that the public have a right to know what is said in debates within a very short timeframe by way of the written word. The transcripts that are provided are excellent and it is a great tribute to the staff under Mr. Fitzgibbon and the leadership he has given as Editor of Debates over his time in these Houses that they are so well regarded.</P>
      <P>I want to pay my own tribute to Mr. Fitzgibbon, whom I have known for the past eight years. I can inform the Leader that he intends to remain active outside the Houses. He is an avid squash player and a great swimmer and I know he will get great entertainment from his grandchildren in particular in his retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very nice event took place yesterday in which the Editor of Debates, the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach were involved. It was the launch of a new DVD containing all the debates from 1919 to 2002. Technologically, we have made great advances in that the public can <Col N="1744" />now have the written word from both Houses of the Oireachtas and the committees available in a very short timeframe. Mr. Fitzgibbon should take pride in his work, and particularly the publication of this new DVD. For his time in these Houses, his courtesy and the help he provided to us all, I wish him very well in his retirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, want to pay tribute to Mr. Fitzgibbon who has been such a help to me since I came into this House. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes and the Leader. I do not know how the reporters and the editors manage to make sense of what we say here. What is even worse is when they ring up to inquire about the proper spelling of a particular word, and we are not sure ourselves. Like the Leader, I have never sought to make a change to any of my contributions and it would be a great pity if that were to happen.</P>
      <P>Reading the old Seanad debates one can see that Members were much more fiery then than we are now. I would not like to think that we had toned down our contributions in any way or made libellous statements about anyone. We know that all is well when such an important record as the Official Report of the Seanad is in the hands of people like Mr. Fitzgibbon.</P>
      <P>The Leader thanked all of us for being so co-operative but it would be difficult not to be co-operative with her because she has put a great deal of work into the running of the House over the past year, on which I congratulate her. I thank all the staff for their help. I am sure when the Clerk and the Assistant Clerk see me coming into their office with a sheaf of amendments they think that by now I should be able to write them correctly. Sadly, that is not always the case. I thank the Captain of the Guard and the ushers also for all their help during the year.</P>

      <P>I want to join in the tributes to Liam Fitzgibbon who has retired as Editor of Debates. As a new Senator, I was not very articulate; many might say I am still not very articulate. I have often hassled the Debates Office staff by asking them to correct the record by including what I meant to say as opposed to what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I have always found Mr. Fitzgibbon and his staff very patient and helpful. I was looking at a debate recently from the 1960s about Seanad reform. It is an important historical record which makes us conscious that we should ensure we are thoughtful about what we say. I wish him well in his retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to thank the Leader of the House, the Opposition leader and the other Senators for their work over the year and also the Clerk of the Seanad and all the staff here, as well as the ushers and the Captain. As a new Senator I have been finding my feet and I have had a great year. It has been worthwhile and I have <Col N="1745" />enjoyed it. Everybody has been very helpful and supportive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the other Senators in paying tribute to Liam Fitzgibbon, the Editor of Debates, and thank him for the enormous amount of work he has done for the Houses over 30 years. It is not readily appreciated how onerous a task it is for the editor and his staff to make sense of what we say. The point has been made about corrections to the record. Sometimes what we have to say is almost impenetrable. It is not surprising that the record may sometimes need some amendment. We have had an example, just recently, as to whether a word should be &lsquo;censored' or &lsquo;censured'.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the way we pronounce words can cause difficulty.</P>
      <P>The editor and his staff must also be commended on the speed with which the debates now emerge. The length of time it took for debates to appear was a constant source of irritation and complaint some years ago. It is obviously important that they appear quickly. The editor has additional responsibilities now, with the Internet. It is good to see the debates on DVD, but traditionalists such as myself still like to ensure that the books are maintained and that we have the physical record of debates in the Library. I wish Mr. Fitzgibbon all the best in his retirement. I must thank him, in particular, for making the debates more readable than they were, perhaps, in the past.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach also for the way he has conducted proceedings in an impartial manner and with humour. He has always been able to rein in the excesses, when required, of some of the Senators. It was evident on a number of occasions that his experience as a county board member in a well-known hurling and football county came to his assistance. Some of the rough and tumble there might have been even more excessive than here.</P>
      <P>I also join my fellow Senators in thanking the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and everyone in the Cathaoirleach's office for the extraordinary amount of work they do during the parliamentary year. I thank too the staff of the Houses and the debates staff, as well as the press and in particular Jimmy Walsh of <i>The Irish Times,</i> for their reporting of the proceedings of the House during the year.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes to Liam Fitzgibbon, who has retired as Editor of Debates in the Houses of the Oireachtas. He has done a very good job. His excellence was recognised further afield too, because he edited debates in the Council of Europe. Senator Daly and I, when we were both on the Council of Europe, accompanied him. His excellent work was recognised there, which is a <Col N="1746" />tribute to him and to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I wish him enjoyment of his retirement. I know he is a very active man and likes to keep fit. I wish him every success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business as proposed. I join in the Leader's congratulations to Senator Maurice Hayes on receiving his honorary degree from the University of Ulster yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two issues I would like to raise on the Order of Business. The Leader is aware that the Taoiseach is shortly to make an announcement concerning 10,000 affordable new houses, which the city of Dublin welcomes. This is the type of proposal that many on the Opposition side of the House have been pressing on the Government for some time. It does not, however, do the Houses of the Oireachtas any service that the Government has chosen to make this announcement on the day after the Dáil has risen for the summer. No statement was made yester<Col N="1747" />day in the other House. No statement will be made today on the matter. It makes the Houses of the Oireachtas quite redundant when the announcement of a major infrastructural project of this nature, affecting some 10,000 future home owners in the Dublin area, could not be made in Leinster House. It is a dumbing down of Parliament. Some people might believe it effectively gives the &lsquo;Harvey Smith' to Parliament, itself.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to express that view forcefully to the Taoiseach. It is not the way to do business. The statement should have been made in the Houses of the Oireachtas, either in the Seanad or the Dáil. I regret very much the way in which the statement has been issued today.</P>
    <P>Secondly, this side of the House wishes the Government well over the summer recess, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. We are going into a difficult period. We know the dangers during the marching season and the tensions and overspills that can occur. I ask the Leader to express our support to the Government for its continuing efforts with the British government to try to force the pace of the negotiations and persuade all concerned to get the Good Friday agreement working again. It is in the interests of us all that the Northern Ireland elections occur and that the Executive is re-established. It is the firm view of the Opposition that any effort or dialogue that may be taken over the summer period should be used as a period of reflection by all sides in this debate. We hope that a debate on Northern Ireland will take place at the earliest possible juncture so that we may review what progress, if any, has been made over time.</P>
    <P>I join with other Senators in wishing the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and all colleagues an enjoyable and pleasant summer. I know it will be a bumper summer for the Cathaoirleach because Limerick is still in the football and the hurling championships and he will be very occupied. I wish the Leader an enjoyable summer also. I have been trying over recent months to get her to write her memoirs. May I just tell her I have found a publisher? He is not in the country, but is nonetheless prepared to take the risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Maurice Hayes too. I share with Senator Brian Hayes concern about the way the Taoiseach in making an important announcement is bypassing the Houses of Parliament. We have a duty, as Members of Parliament, to object when we see this sort of thing happening, as I did strongly during the Report Stage debate on the Immigration Bill yesterday. I am glad the practice of returning Bills to the House on Report Stage with large numbers of amendments will be addressed when the Leader holds her review of the workings of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader gave a positive response to my request yesterday to ensure the urgent issue of nursing is addressed in the autumn. We depend <Col N="1748" />on Filipino nurses for around one third of the nursing complement in most hospitals. They are so enraged about the manner in which their contracts are being implemented that a group of them from Loughlinstown Hospital planned to march on Leinster House last night. One cannot issue contracts for a month at a time and require people to renew their work permits each month at a cost of &euro;60. It means they must struggle to keep themselves in accommodation as no landlord is prepared to accept these conditions. If we want to maintain the health service in the period before the Minister for Health and Children makes the necessary reforms, the health service employers will have to show respect to Filipino nurses who have come here to prop up our health service. I request that the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to convey this message to the health service employers. As these nurses are being sought in Australia, America and elsewhere, we will find ourselves with none.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Brian Hayes's hopes for progress in Northern Ireland. I request that the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take careful note of developments with regard to the military courts being established in the United States to try people who have been incommunicado with no access to lawyers for nearly 18 months. It appears the trials of some of them will take place behind closed doors. If this was happening in any other country there would be uproar. Given our long-standing and strong connections, we have some influence with the United States and should object to this sort of kangaroo court. It is not right that the norms of international law should be so bypassed. Once this kind of approach is taken in one country, particularly such an important country, how do we know it will not start somewhere else?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also raise with the Leader the latest announcement on housing and the Government's great plans to address the issue. I recall another major announcement about affordable housing made five or six years ago from which, in reality, little emerged. For this reason, my feeling this time is that I will believe it when I see it. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes's point about the timing of the statement and how it impacts on our work in the House. I propose that the House meets in September to discuss the announcement and to try to ensure it becomes a reality.</P>
      <P>Despite my wish to shorten the holidays, I wish everybody a good summer break. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his work during the year, which I omitted to do earlier. I also congratulate Senator Maurice Hayes on receiving a well-deserved honorary doctorate from the University of Ulster. I am familiar with his excellent work in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the Forum on the Future of Europe from my involvement in these bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the news that 10,000 affordable houses will be provided on land owned <Col N="1749" />by the State. I have no difficulty with the fact that the announcement was made at a meeting of the social partners rather than in the Houses as there was no legislative aspect involved. I would be happy to have good news every day during the recess&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and to welcome it when it comes. I am particularly pleased that a redundant site in Kildare, Magee Barracks which was closed down, will be used for one of these initiatives. By definition, if the land on which the houses will be built will cost nothing, the site cost thereby recovered will provide a major boost in terms of making the houses affordable. It is good news and I welcome it.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's comments on the detention of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. They should be brought to trial by due process. If a civilised democracy goes down the road of ignoring the rule of law, we are on dangerous ground. I hope the matter will be rectified at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I join Senators in congratulating Senator Hayes. When I asked him how one would describe a multiple doctor, he said one would call him a quack.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>On a previous occasion, I raised the issue of the special savings investment scheme. In accepting it is a highly successful initiative, I noted that many people found it difficult to meet their financial commitment to it. As a savings scheme the SSIA has inevitably removed a significant amount of money from circulation. However, savers' working circumstances often change. Many people who received overtime payments in the past now receive time in lieu and some are finding it difficult to maintain the commitment they made. The penalty clause for withdrawing from the scheme should be analysed and savers, depending on their circumstances, should not be penalised for withdrawing their savings or have to wait for the full five year period to elapse to do so. I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry touched on the issue of nursing. If the House returns in early September we should have a full debate on this issue. Filipino nurses have bailed out the health service, providing the valuable nucleus of nurses it requires. As such, they should be treated with great respect. We need them and were they to decide to go to other countries, the problems in our hospitals, particularly in the Dublin area, would be exacerbated. This matter should be addressed and we should show respect for this group of nurses.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the terrible tragedy yesterday at the ESB generating station in Tarbert and the company's tremendous work and exemplary record, particularly on safety, it would be appropriate that the Seanad would <Col N="1750" />today send best wishes to the three unfortunate men badly injured in the incident, two of whom are in hospital in Cork, the other in Tralee, their families and the management and staff of the ESB.</P>

      <P>When asked about the recent away day of the Pensions Board, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, stated she would not interfere in the matter as the event had been paid for by the occupational scheme and PRSA providers. Therefore, she said, the taxpayer had not paid for it. I ask the Leader again to raise the matter with the Minister. I have been contacted by many pension plan holders who have watched as their pensions devalued significantly and they are extremely upset at the manner in which the Pensions Board used funds for its away day in County Wicklow. The Minister's refusal to interfere with the running of the board at a time when so many pensioners are extremely concerned is a serious matter. The case has similarities to social provision provided by the tyre company, Advance Pitstop, to the Garda Síochána, for which it was brought to book. Pension providers should not fund away days for the Pensions Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">

      <P>I join my colleague, Senator Dardis, in warmly welcoming the anticipated announcement by the Taoiseach today at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions conference that State land will be made available for the construction of 10,000 affordable houses. I have no hang-up as to the location at which the announcement will be made. It is tremendous news for first-time buyers and should be warmly welcomed by all sides. There could hardly be a more appropriate forum for the announcement than an ICTU conference. Compliments should also be paid to ICTU and our colleague, Senator O'Toole, for the role they have played, as partners, in the progress of the economy.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most significant interventions in the free market since the current crisis in house prices began. Such interventions are occasionally necessary. The Government and the councils must now ensure this huge initiative, which is only the beginning of a process, is not hijacked by vested interests or, worse, by bureaucratic red tape in such a way that the benefits do not accrue to first-time buyers. I hope the momentum generated by this intiative will continue.</P>

      <P>The name, Hayes, is an important and distinguished one in this House, given that two of our eminent Members bear it. I join in the congratulations to Senator Maurice Hayes on his award yesterday of an honorary Doctor of Letters degree. Hearing the word &ldquo;letters&rdquo; in connection with the Senator one readily understands how deserving he is of such an award when one considers the interesting works he has written. If anyone has not read his works, I recommend &ldquo;Minority Verdict&rdquo; which is currently out of print but <Col N="1751" />available in the Oireachtas Library. It was important that he was honoured in the North because he has rendered that jurisdiction some service.</P>

      <P>Anything that can be done to provide affordable housing must be welcome. There was a debate on housing in the Dáil this week but the Government announcement was not mentioned then. Perhaps it is appropriate that it be mentioned where the issue is being discussed today. While I welcome the announcement, I understand it will apply to only two or three counties. This problem is evenly spread throughout the country and there is a great deal of State land available. I have raised this matter on a number of occasions but expect the Leader will arrange a debate in the autumn on an audit of State properties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of a young student who is studying government and public policy in University College Cork. Part of the course involved a work placement which, for this student, was a ten week period of work in the Irish immigration centre in Boston. On arrival in Boston, however, and despite his documentation being correct, he was interrogated, accused of being a member of various organisations, including drug smugglers, and duly deported the following day. Today the Americans proudly celebrate their Independence Day but there is a problem <Col N="1752" />when people who are properly documented are subject to such abuses on entering the United States. The problem for this young gentleman is that he will now have to delay 12 months of his degree course because he cannot fulfil the work placement part of the course in time to complete his final year by late September.</P>
      <P>I urge the Leader to raise this issue and seek the support of other Senators on this matter. It is intolerable. We encourage Americans to come to this country and the two countries have friendly relations. I have no difficulty with security or dealing strongly with those from illegal organisations, as is evident from my previous contributions in this House. However, innocent people are being subjected to abuse. I have an account of what happened to this student, which I will give to the Leader later, and it is horrific. I call on the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and ask him to have immediate discussions with the American ambassador or his representative. I hope this situation can be corrected. There is approximately one week left to do so and ensure this young gentleman can continue his degree.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, regarding the announcement of land for houses. It is amazing that the Government did not avail of the debate on the Private Members' motion on housing in the Dáil to make the announcement and that it chose instead to give it to the press.</P>
      <P>The television coverage and reporting of the proceedings of the Seanad could be improved in many respects. Much good work is done both in this Chamber and in the committees but little of it is reported. That is a pity. Many of the questions put by Members to the various delegations are not reported either. The media seem to be over-reliant on press releases and only one side of a story. The days of investigative journalism appear to be numbered.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider debating transport in the new term, particularly the new speed cameras? The Minister has said he intends to privatise the service. I am concerned about this and that those involved will see it as just a money making venture rather than a traffic safety matter. I would be nervous about such a proposition given the bad example and money grabbing techniques of the clamping service in Dublin.</P>

We need to bring it out into the open and <Col N="1754" />we should use this Chamber to do it. I ask that time be assigned, perhaps in the autumn, to the intergovernmental conference.</P>

      <P>There are two points to make regarding the case raised by Senator Minihan. The first is how to deal with the treatment of the young man by the American immigration authorities and the second is how to secure his academic career. It should be possible, through a little sensible discussion with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the university, to find him another <i>stage</i> or posting. He should not throw in the towel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1776 the American declaration of independence was signed. It brought independence, freedom and republicanism, spreading light throughout the world. Two years ago, on 11 September 2001, a weapon of mass destruction was used in New York. That is the only way of referring to a plane loaded with aviation fuel which killed 3,000 <Col N="1756" />people. The justifiable anger in America against terrorism has raged for two years. On this day, I ask that due process be accorded to prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. We, the great friends and consistent allies of America, now ask it to show due process to those people, some of whom have committed terrible acts.</P>
    <P>I also wish to share in the congratulations for Senator Maurice Hayes. Sixty-five years ago, when Senator Hayes was a young man, he was very brave. In the Irish college in Ring, there was another young man who did not like going past the graveyard. He used to ask Senator Hayes if he minded accompanying him. That was fine when two were passing the graveyard, but one person had to return on his own. On behalf of Des Hanafin, I would like to thank the Senator for being such a good friend.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by Senator Henry this morning is one for every person with a social conscience and an interest in human rights. I was listening to the RTÉ report on the prison in question. It was chilling and it was not hearsay because the reporter was allowed in not to meet the prisoners, but to talk to the commander of the prison. That commander was not prepared to deny reports circulating regarding execution chambers now being planned within the prison. The prisoners are held incommunicado. The person who spoke on the programme admitted that normal human rights were not involved. One got only a measure of human rights based on the amount of information which one gave one's interrogators. The current position&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to join in the sentiments expressed by Senator Minihan regarding the student from Cork who has found himself in such difficulties. I urge the Leader to do her best to sort out that very serious problem. I also wish to refer to an issue raised by my colleague, Senator Terry, at the start of the week about the J1 students in America who were having such difficulty getting their social security numbers. The delay in the process takes several months and students in America can be deported to Ireland <Col N="1757" />within 20 days if they do not have a number. I urge the Leader to express to the Government the importance of this matter and to try to find a resolution.</P>
      <P>I again raise on the Order of Business the issue, which particularly pertains to rural Ireland, of people who reside in what one might call prefabs. I urge the Leader, when we resume sittings in this House at the end of the year, in conjunction with the debate on housing requested by several Members, to include people who primarily reside in prefabs.

I congratulate the Government on fulfilling that promise and pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, on the tremendous work he has carried out in recent months in putting this package together, as well as Senator O'Toole who played a leading role.</P>

The persons about whom I am most concerned are their spouses and families. Their spouses are not allowed work here at present. The difficulty this causes for their families is particularly striking given that many are young women with young families. In most cases the children are not brought to this country. Therefore, there is a real difficulty for the nurse involved. To allow them to operate as a family unit would assist them.</P>

      <P>I call on the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, to come into the House in the autumn and tell us how he will enforce the 3% quota for people with disabilities in the public sector. He cannot expect the private sector to do it if the public sector is not giving good example.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, welcomed the housing initiative announcement but deplored the fact that it was not made in either House of the Oireachtas. Everybody welcomes the initiative which is a wonderful advance. The reason the announcement is being made at the ICTU is that the ICTU made it a central plank in its discussions on the new programme. The Taoiseach is doing the ICTU the honour of announcing it there. We all appreciate the support all Senators have given on the issue of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of the Filipino nurses and the military court announcement about Guantanamo Bay, which is disgraceful. Soon there will be no human rights left in any country in which the United States has an involvement. It is disgraceful that such a situation was allowed to develop. I feel strongly about the matter, as do other Senators. While we all love our links with the United States, one has to speak out when basic human rights are put to one side with such ignominy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tuffy raised the matter of housing and expressed the wish that the House would meet in September. Actually it will meet for two weeks in September, thanks to the Cathaoirleach at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which agreed to this yesterday. Beginning on 15 September we shall have oral hearings, three days each week, with those who wish to give their <Col N="1759" />views on reform of the Seanad. I am sure all Senators smiled last night when they saw on the television that the Dáil was on its holidays. We are not on holidays yet. There will be committee meetings during the whole month of July and the Seanad is open for two weeks in mid-September. I hope somebody in some office somewhere is listening and will record this fact. We are meeting in September for two weeks. Everybody can be here in the Seanad, the hearings will be in public. We hope some of them will be televised. It just shows that sometimes perceptions outside are wrong.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis welcomed the housing initiative and expressed his concerns about the situation in Quantanamo Bay. I imagine we have not heard half the story, we are hearing only parts of it. We have not heard the full story.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of the savings scheme and the penalty clause contained therein in the event that one lost one's job. I raised this matter with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the House. He was aware of the difficulty and that recommendations had been made. Perhaps, he is reflecting on it. Senator Kenneally extended his sympathy and good wishes to ESB personnel. It was well put.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry raised the matter of the Pensions Board away day. The point the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, made was that she would not interfere in the running of its away or home day. However, the Senator clearly made the point that pension providers should not fund such outings. Senator Fitzgerald warmly anticipated the Taoiseach's announcement on the housing initiative while Senator Coghlan praised the initiative on affordable housing, as did Senator Maurice Hayes.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan made a strong case about the young Cork student who had all his documentation in order but was turned away. Apart from the rough tactics which are developing in certain stratas of officialdom in the United States, I hope we can speak afterwards.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne referred to the housing initiative and wished there was more television coverage and reporting of the proceedings of the Seanad, a matter we discussed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges yesterday and will take further. Senator Dardis said we were to praise Jimmy Walsh who gives such good coverage of the proceedings of the Seanad on a daily basis. Senator Leyden sent his good wishes to the new chief executive to be of RTÉ. He also paid tribute to the Editor of Debates and his staff.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde welcomed the announcement of the housing initiative. As a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, she also welcomed the work done on the European Union and said we should have more debates on the matter here.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes supported the case made by Senator Minihan. I loved the story from Senator Hanafin. One can just imagine the two <Col N="1760" />young fellows whistling past the graveyard to keep their spirits up. It was a lovely vignette and I see Senator Maurice Hayes is laughing. The Chair ruled what Senator Mooney had to say out of order. However, we would all agree that it is the office, rather than the person, that should be respected.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin referred to Independence Day, 4 July, in the United States. It is a great day for its people. It was set up to be the land of the free, with the Statute of Liberty to extend the hand of friendship and human rights to people like us who were not getting them in their own countries. It is sad to see the reverse in the land of the free. I agree with Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú's passionate plea regarding human rights in the prison in question, but nobody seems to pay any attention to the issue. Senator Phelan is in agreement with Senator Minihan regarding the young student.</P>
    <P>In regard to the housing debate, Senator Brennan praised both the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, and Senator O'Toole. Senator O'Toole said that he asked that the housing initiative be part of the agenda.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley spoke about the issue of the Filipino nurses whose spouses cannot accompany them to Ireland. This is upsetting for them.</P>
    <P>The issue raised by Senator White also struck me during the two weeks of euphoria we had before and during the Special Olympics. There is potential in an economic sense for those with disabilities. The norm of 3% was set for their participation in the public service some years ago and the private sector was to follow. County councils and others appear to feel it is too much trouble to implement this norm but that is not the case as there are jobs suited to many of those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Dardis, the Deputy Leader, whose wise advice and counsel have been of great help to me on many occasions.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consider<Col N="1761" />ation&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Bill has changed little since it was passed by the Seanad in February. On foot of an amendment by Deputy Upton, section 6 and the Title were amended to include the Irish language version in the name of the foundation &ndash; Fondúireacht Eolaíochta Éireann.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton also proposed an amendment to section 14(3) which provides that the foundation, rather than the director general, shall have regard to any recommendations of an Oireachtas committee. This amendment was accepted.</P>
      <P>A new section 27, the transfer of rights and liabilities to the foundation, has been added to the Bill. Since the foundation was set up as a committee of Forfás, it has entered into grant agreements that involve the payment of grants in instalments over a period of time. This provision allows the rights and obligations arising from these arrangements to be transferred to the foundation when it is established as a statutory body. The provisions of the new section are based on similar provisions in the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998.</P>
      <P>The remaining amendments in sections 2 and 20 are drafting arrangements.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for the explanation of the amendments approved in the Dáil. As the Bill has not changed much I have nothing further to add to what I said on its various Stages through this House. The establishment of Science Foundation Ireland, which is doing good work, is important for the country. One must be impressed with Dr. William Harris, the director general, and all those involved. I compliment the Minister and his officials on the work done in regard to this Bill. I wish Science Foundation Ireland every success.</P>

      <P>I welcome the finalisation of this Bill. I congratulate the Minister of State and the Tánaiste on bringing it forward and on their dealings with it. I also compliment the Leader of the House in whose name the Bill went through the House. That the Bill was initiated here shows the significance of the Seanad. We had a marvellous debate with contributions from Senator Henry and others involved in the field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the original Bill there was an exclusion <Col N="1762" />clause regarding membership by public representatives. The Chair would be interested in this also. If a public representative is qualified, there is no reason that he or she should be excluded from a foundation because he or she was elected to a local authority, the Dáil or Seanad. It is strange that there is no exclusion clause for Members of the Oireachtas in regard to membership of prison visiting committees. It is right that Members should serve on them if they feel they could serve in that capacity. I asked about this issue on Second Stage. Will the Minister of State clarify whether the exclusion clause remains part of the Bill? As bankrupts and others were excluded I thought councillors were also. Perhaps I am making a good pitch for re-election here by trying to ensure that councillors would be allowed to be members of the foundation.</P>
    <P>This excellent Bill has great potential. It is vital that we are at the cutting edge of research and development for future job creation. This Bill will create jobs and bring marvellous development to the economy. I thank the Tánaiste and the Minister of State for seeing it through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and these acceptable amendments. This Bill is one of the most wonderful things that has happened for research work in this country for decades. It is directed at bio-sciences and information technology which are only part of many important areas of research.</P>
      <P>There must be a framework created for research and development in this country. I realise this is not part of the remit of the Minister of State's Department. The conference of the heads of Irish universities has expressed grave concern about the shortage of research funds going to other areas within the third level sector. The reason this is particularly important is that Science Foundation Ireland must draw from those people doing masters' degrees or post-doctoral research in other disciplines. It cannot exist as an island. We must also ensure the continuation of courses to train the people needed in these areas. I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices with the Department of Education and Science to ensure the universities do not have to cut such courses.</P>
      <P>I must declare an interest in that I chair the Trinity College Dublin Association and Trust. I am also a member of the Trinity Foundation, both of which are fundraising bodies for the University of Dublin. Given the strained circumstances in the private sector, it is difficult to raise the sums required to continue research outside the remit of Science Foundation Ireland. However, it is vital backup for us. As a small country, we have an advantage over others in that there is a great deal of co-operation with and personal knowledge of the work others are doing. This can make a huge difference when one is trying to secure co-operation in such important areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I praise the Bill for what it seeks to do and <Col N="1763" />ask the Minister of State to keep an eye on the Department of Education and Science which will have to provide money to back up the research being carried out in other disciplines. We are trying as best we can to raise funds within the universities. However, when very rich people have lost one third of their wealth, as they see it, with the fall in the value of shares, they are not as enthusiastic as they have been about giving. Low interest rates also mean we are getting a poor return on our investments. Therefore, to support the foundation, we need to make sure we put as much money as possible into other areas of research in third level institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to declare that I am a member of the Oireachtas science foundation group which promotes the sciences and come from a background in the sciences. I welcome the Bill and agree with Senator Leyden that it has great potential. However, I ask that the Leader arranges for the House to debate progress in the area one year from now. I have every confidence in Dr. Bill Harris as director general of the foundation. However, I have grave concerns about the Government's commitment to the sciences.</P>
      <P>A recent report suggests that there have been severe cutbacks in graduate research &ndash; a backward step. This is a modern progressive country and research is vital. We must continue to plan for five and ten years down the line and research is the only way we can do so. I urge the Government to examine the budgets for research and, if they have been cut back as severely as has been reported, to look at reinstating them. Daily newspaper reports refer to underspends in Departments. Therefore, there is money floating around somewhere. One area we cannot afford to ignore is the sciences.</P>
      <P>We must look at the issue from the bottom up by promoting the sciences in primary schools. I was a teacher before I became a Senator. The new curriculum of the 1970s introduced the sciences, which was a great idea. However, the Department of Education and Science gave no resources to schools or teachers to teach them. Therefore, the curriculum never got off the ground. The Department is now making fresh attempts under a new curriculum to teach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State to ask his Department to seriously examine a request by Carlow Town Council and Carlow Institute of Technology to have a centre for the sciences based in the town, mirroring one in Cardiff, which promotes the sciences by encouraging young people to visit the centre to look at the different areas of the sciences. It is a fantastic centre. We had an open day in Carlow which the Minister for Education and Science was due to visit but, unfortunately, had to cancel at the last minute. We seek a commitment from the Government to get the development of such a centre under way. It would be one of a kind in Ireland, attract hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren and adults during the <Col N="1764" />year and help to raise the profile of the sciences. It could only be of benefit to the entire country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which has great potential and hope the Government will provide the resources the general science area deserves.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their support in the passing of this Bill and goodwill in the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland. I thank the staff of the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for their assistance in drafting the legislation as well as the staff of my Department which has done such a wonderful job in the preparation and honing of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We must change from being an economy which produces goods and services, based on knowledge and ideas generated elsewhere, to one which generates knowledge and innovative ideas from investment in our own research. The most exciting developments in the world today utilise new scientific discoveries. By focusing on its priority areas of biotechnology and information and communications technology, Science Foundation Ireland is investing in areas with the potential to change the lives of future generations. Given that the emphasis of Government policy is on moving towards a knowledge based economy, Science Foundation Ireland will have a critical role to play in improving our ability to undertake top class research and development across the spectrum, particularly in the biotechnology and ICT sectors.</P>
      <P>The essence of the foundation's work will be to provide the funding for the various sectors, particularly the university sector, through the research grants scheme which will provide support for our top young researchers to progress and become the best in the world. In Bill Harris, as director general, we have one of the most influential and well respected people in the world. As the House is aware, he comes from the National Science Foundation in the United States where he has been a leading professor. Since he has come to Ireland, his leadership has lifted us onto a new plain. I am confident that, with his leadership and a board made up of the most eminent people in the area of science and technology, we now have the ability to compete with anyone else in the world in terms of being at the leading edge of research. I take this opportunity to wish the foundation well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The considerable amount of money made available by the Government, which has now been allocated to universities, is being extremely well spent. A joint venture between NUI Galway and Hewlett-Packard in Galway city involves one of the most advanced pieces of technology in the <Col N="1765" />area. Universities are highly significant in terms of job creation. By way of illustration, some time ago I sat with the president of Siebel Systems, probably one of the top software companies in the world, and asked him the reason the company located in Galway. He told me that, at the time the company was choosing a European location, it was looking at Sweden, the United Kingdom, France and Ireland. Having spent half a day in NUI Galway and GMIT, the company decided to locate in Galway. What better endorsement of our education system and our young students could we have than to have them as key factors in Siebel Systems locating here? This foundation will add considerably to our ability to be at the leading edge.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its assistance in helping to pass this Bill. I look forward to great results as a consequence of the investment that will be made in the foundation.</P>

I appreciate the constructive discussion that took place in the Seanad as it was one of the better debates to have taken place in recent times.

      <P>The Committee Stage debate in the Dáil, which took place on the evening of 2 July, lasted for two hours. Some 43 amendments were discussed, eight of which were Government amendments. They were designed to improve the thrust of the Bill and I would briefly like to outline their effect to the House.</P>
      <P>The Government put down two amendments to section 6, which deals with the conditions of the employment of fixed-term workers. Under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, a part-time employee is prohibited from comparing himself or herself to a full-time employee for pension purposes if he or she works less than 20% of the hours of the full-time employee. There is a view, expressed by the Departments of Finance and Social and Family Affairs, that a part-time fixed-term employee could compare himself or herself to a full-time permanent employee, in which case it would be necessary to limit comparison regarding pensions to those who work at least 20% of the hours of their comparators, to be consistent with the Part Time Work Act 2001. The new section 6(5), as drafted by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, provides for this point.</P>
      <P>The new section 6(6) is subject to the new section 6(7) and is also in line with the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, under which protected employees are always comparing themselves to employees who work more hours than they do. In other words, the <i>pro rata</i> principle will become applicable in respect of pay or other conditions of employment that are dependent on hours worked. Section 6(8) provides, also for the avoidance of doubt, that Part III of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 relating to public holiday entitlements is not affected by the provisions of this Act. These amendments provide consistency between the part-time Act of 2001 and this Bill.</P>
      <P>There were two Government amendments to section 7 of the Bill, which relates to objective grounds for less favourable treatment. The purpose of the first amendment in section 7(1) is to provide for greater clarity with regard to what constitutes objective grounds for the purposes of Part 2 of the Act. It adds an express provision in relation to renewing a fixed-term contract on a fixed-term basis only under section 9(4) of the Bill, to which I will refer later. This amendment had been sought by ICTU to provide for greater clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment to section 7 inserted a new section 7(2) to cover situations where the terms of a fixed-term employee's contract of employment, taken as a whole in relation to conditions of employment, are at least as favourable as the terms of the comparable permanent employee's contract of employment. This pro<Col N="1767" />vision was sought by the Department of Finance to provide flexibility to employers who might want to provide an attractive package of entitlements to attract certain employees to work on a fixed-term contract basis. This amendment is similar to a provision in the equivalent UK legislation on fixed-term work, the Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002.</P>
    <P>Section 9, which makes provision for successive fixed-term contracts, is a key section of the Bill and was the subject of detailed discussion in both Houses. Senators will recall that on Committee Stage in the Seanad on 10 June, Senator O'Toole tabled an amendment which would, in effect, have capped the total aggregate period of fixed-term contracts at four years. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, undertook to have this proposed amendment examined in detail and to report back to the Seanad if any Government amendment was accepted on Committee Stage by the Dáil. In this regard, I wish to inform Senators that my Department has been in detailed consultation with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel as well as with both ICTU and IBEC on this issue.</P>
    <P>A number of Departments were consulted since the Bill was debated in this House. As a result of these discussions, the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel drafted the revised text of section 9. I wish to outline for the benefit of the House the intent of the new text. Section 9(1) provides that, subject to subsection 9(4), where a fixed-term employee completes or has completed three years' continuous service with his or her employer or associated employer, that fixed-term contract may only be renewed once more by the employer, for a period of no longer than one year. When this Bill has been passed, existing employees on fixed-term contracts who complete or have completed three years' continuous service may have their contracts renewed only once more by their employer, for no longer than one year, following which the next renewal shall be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration, in other words, a permanent contract.</P>
    <P>Section 9(2) provides that, in the case of new fixed-term employees recruited after the passing of the Bill, a fixed-term employee is employed by his or her employer or associated employer on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts and the date of the first such contract is subsequent to the date on which this Act is passed, the aggregate duration of such contracts will not exceed four years. Section 9(3) provides that where any term of a fixed-term contract purports to contravene sections 9(1) or section or 9(2), that term shall have no effect and the contract concerned shall become by operation of law a contract of indefinite duration.</P>
    <P>Section 9(4) provides that the above subsections shall not apply to the renewal of a contract of employment for a fixed-term where there are objective grounds justifying such a renewal. <Col N="1768" />Section 9(5) provides that the First Schedule to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 relating to continuous employment will determine whether the employment referred to in sections 9(1) and 9(2) is continuous. This is a standard provision in employment rights legislation. The 1973 Act provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that dismissal followed by immediate re-employment will not break continuity of service.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 9(4) is in line with the equivalent legislation in the UK, the Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002. The regulations provide that, following a period of four or more years of continuous employment, the next renewal takes effect as a permanent contract, unless there are objective grounds justifying a further renewal. I acknowledge that ICTU has reservations about allowing for the renewal of a fixed-term contract after four years' continuous service on objective grounds.</P>
    <P>I should stress that the Bill provides for fixed-term employees to take a complaint to the rights commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commission if they consider that the objective grounds given by the employer do not meet with the requirements of section 7. The various decisions that a rights commissioner can take in such circumstances are set out in section 14(2) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil I was pressed to give examples of what might constitute such objective grounds. It would be wrong for me to try to do so as I would be pre-empting any cases that might arise in the future. What might be legitimate objective grounds in one case may not be so in another. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that it would not be appropriate to draw up a list which could very quickly require updating in the light of case law.</P>
    <P>As with all legislation, we are setting up a legal framework under which both fixed-term employees and employers must operate. The redress procedures in the Bill, namely, the rights commissioner service and the Labour Court, are in place for both parties to use if problems arise. Furthermore, the Government's amendment to section 13 of the Bill may prevent an employer from dismissing an employee &ndash; by not renewing a fixed-term contract &ndash; where the purpose is the avoiding of that employee becoming permanent. The new text substantially improves the provisions in section 9 of the Bill. I thank Senator O'Toole for his constructive amendment that essentially has led us to the text we now have.</P>
    <P>Two Government amendments to section 13 of the Bill were agreed in the Dáil, the first of which related to the deletion of section 13(3) of the Bill as originally drafted. I was advised that this provision was not necessary but was included originally for the sole purpose of allaying fears that the Unfair Dismissals Acts had been affected in any way. However, a view was expressed by the ICTU that an impression could be given that the Unfair Dismissals Acts were in some way subject <Col N="1769" />to section 9 and section 13(1) of the Bill. The provision was, therefore, deleted to prevent confusion or misapprehension arising.</P>
    <P>The Government's second amendment to section 13 of the Bill &ndash; introducing a new subsection (<i>d</i>) &ndash; is a significant addition. The purpose of the amendment is to prohibit the dismissal of a fixed-term employee wholly or partly for the purpose of avoiding his or her contract being deemed to be one of indefinite duration under section 9(3). The text of the rest of section 13(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) is the same as in the text of the Bill passed by the Seanad. This amendment, by allowing an employee to take a complaint to a rights commissioner, aims at preventing an employer from dismissing a fixed-term employee by not renewing his or her contract in order, wholly or partly, to avoid that employee becoming permanent under a contract of indefinite duration under section 9(3) of the Bill. A minor textual amendment to section 19 of the Bill correcting a typing error was also adopted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is a substantial improvement on the one initiated in this House last month. The improvement is very much down to the informed discussions that took place in this House in relation to section 9, in particular. The Bill now before the House provides a balanced framework under which employers and fixed-term workers can operate into the future.</P>
    <P>Some 70,000 fixed-term workers will benefit under the Bill, many of them in the public sector whose conditions of employment will be improved, particularly in relation to pay and pension entitlements. I particularly refer to teachers and nurses, many of whom have been on fixed-term contracts for far too long. Members of these professions will now be in a position where a maximum of four years will apply to fixed-term contracts and, as a result of this legislation, they will then have to become permanent. This will be significant for those specific professions and others.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects the flexibility that employers want, on the one hand, and the security in relation to tenure that fixed-term employees want, on the other. I urge both employers and employees to use the legislation in a fair and pragmatic manner. Accordingly, I commend the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003, as passed by Dáil Éireann to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the detail he has provided on the amendments made in the other House. I agree with him that they represent a substantial improvement on the Bill as initiated, which is to be welcomed. He highlighted the professions of nursing and teaching. In many professions there was excessive abuse of the fixed-term contract system. I welcome the Bill, particularly for the job security it now provides in its enhanced form and I am glad it provides the flexibility employers need.</P>

    <P>My colleagues, Senators O'Toole, Leyden, <Col N="1770" />White and McDowell, and I were all concerned with section 9 of the Bill. I welcome what the Minister of State has said about it and the necessary improvements that have been made. They were worthwhile. It is important that everything we do is thoroughly equitable. In so far as it has been possible, this has been provided for thanks to assiduous work by the Minister of State and his officials.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on this excellent Bill. Both he and the senior officials in attendance have put enormous work into this legislation, for which this House thanks them. Senators Coghlan, Tuffy and O'Toole, president of the ICTU, have worked on the Bill, for which I thank them. I also thank my colleague, Senator Hanafin, our spokesman on labour affairs, for the input he has made to the Bill which will soon become law. The fact that it was initiated here gives great credit to the House and the Leader, Senator O'Rourke. In introducing legislation here, the Leader has the confidence of all Ministers. This House has passed more legislation in the past year than in any previous year.</P>
      <P>From my experience of coming to this House as a Minister of State, I always found the contributions of Members to be excellent; Senators really forged and fine-tuned Bills. There is much specialisation and knowledge in the House. Having only 60 Members, as opposed to 166 in the Dáil, everyone has a say, as is well noted by the relevant Minister. From my experience of bringing a Companies Act through this House, Paddy Kennedy, a Fine Gael spokesperson, made a tremendous input because of his knowledge of company law.</P>
      <P>While the Bill is excellent, its contents must be notified to those affected. I suggest that this can be done through the Revenue Commissioners by providing a short explanatory leaflet to be distributed in Revenue communications. While it is fine having legislation, it is important that people know their rights. Information can be disseminated on websites but the best way to do it is through advertising in popular newspapers and getting the information to those affected. I thank the Minister of State and his officials, and the staff of the House, who have contributed so much to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here to report on the amendments made to the Bill in Dáil Éireann, both on Committee Stage, which was held on 26 and 26 June, and on Report Stage on 2 July. I propose to outline briefly the aim and content of the amendments, some of which take account of concerns which were already raised in the debates on the Bill in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1772" />In section 2, I accepted a minor amendment to the definition of &ldquo;disorderly conduct&rdquo;, which makes clear it is not limited to the conduct referred to in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) of the definition. Two amendments were made to section 13, which constitute a new text for section 32 of the 1988 Act. These are intended to make clear that the subsections concerned apply to persons who are not licensees. The law in relation to licensees is set out in section 31 of the 1988 Act. Section 32, which is being replaced, deals with persons who are not licensees but who may purchase alcohol for, or for supply to, underage persons.</P>
    <P>Concerns were expressed in both Houses and by other interested parties that the provisions in section 14 prohibiting persons under the age of 18 years from being in the bar of a licensed premises after 9 p.m. might adversely affect wedding receptions and other private functions. To make the matter clear, I introduced a new subsection (4) in section 14 to provide that it shall not be unlawful to allow a child accompanied by a parent or guardian, or a person between the age of 15 and 17, to be in the bar on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to the persons attending the function. This addition necessitated a number of consequential amendments to sections 14 and 25.</P>
    <P>I hope this explicit provision will have the effect of allaying the fears expressed on this subject. I should add that the existing provisions of section 35 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, which prohibit persons under the age of 18 years from bars where an exemption order is in force will remain unchanged. It means that after ordinary closing time, there is no question of a private function justifying the presence of young people in a bar.</P>
    <P>Section 15(3) was amended to make clear that the age document requirement only applies in respect of 18 to 20 year olds who are in the bar of a licensed premises after 9 p.m. A small drafting amendment was made to the definition of &ldquo;age document&rdquo; in the section. Section 16 was amended to provide that it would be an offence for a person aged between 15 and 17 years to be in the bar of a licensed premises after 9 p.m. and before 10.30 a.m. the following day, except on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function.</P>
    <P>Having reflected on concerns expressed in the select committee in respect of section 17, I accepted that the inclusion of the word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; in subsection (1), which applies to off-licensees primarily, could mean that a licensee who complained to the Garda about persons consuming alcohol in the vicinity of the premises would, by such a complaint, be admitting an offence under section 17. To overcome that difficulty, the word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; in subsection (1) has been replaced with the word &ldquo;privity&rdquo;. While it is a word not in common use nowadays, it basically means being complicit in something. In the context of section 17, it would mean that a licensee <Col N="1773" />who wilfully turns a blind eye to the consumption of alcohol he or she has supplied in the vicinity of the premises would commit an offence. The word is used in section 13 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1924, which section 17 is replacing. I understand it still remains in use in the corresponding English legislation so there will be case law on it. Therefore, it makes sense to retain it rather than introduce new uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Section 20 was amended slightly to clarify the definition of &ldquo;reduced price&rdquo; in the section. As I mentioned here two weeks ago, the aim is to ban &ldquo;happy hours&rdquo;, but it would not preclude charging higher prices late in the evening or during a special exemption order. The amendment clarifies that the &ldquo;day concerned&rdquo;, as referred to in subsection (2), is the day beginning at 10.30 a.m. on a weekday or 12.30 p.m. on a Sunday. If a higher price was charged in the early hours of, say, Wednesday morning, it would not constitute an offence to have a lower price in the same premises in the afternoon or evening of that day. If we view a day, as we are bound, as lasting from midnight to midnight, there could have been an unintended consequence that charging more late at night would effectively turn the rest of the day into a &ldquo;happy hour&rdquo;, which would not be a good idea.</P>
    <P>Some minor drafting amendments were made to section 21 to ensure that the terms used throughout the section are consistent. A new subsection (7) was inserted at the request of the Revenue Commissioners. It is a technical amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to allow for the issuing of a tax clearance certificates in relation to a licence under 21. Section 21(6) provides that a tax clearance certificate is required before a licence for a national sporting arena will be issued or renewed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader, the Members and staff of the House for their assistance in enabling me to have the Bill passed by the House in a constructive and helpful debate. As I mentioned during the debates on the Bill, I intend to return to the House with a codification Bill next year when all Members of this and the other House and all interested parties will have the opportunity to revisit the licensing laws and the problem of alcohol related harm.</P>

      <P>The Minister is welcome back to the House. I have no problem with these amendments which effectively tidy up the legislation. We discussed at length the issue of children being present on licensed premises and I favoured the Minister's original proposal of a limit of 8 p.m. after which children would have to vacate the premises. However, having listened and spoken to others who had strong views on this issue, especially those in the tourism industry, I concede that the 9 p.m. limit will facilitate people who wish to partake of a meal with their children in a restaurant or bar where food is served. I hope this resolves the problem people had with the original <Col N="1774" />proposal. Apart from that, I have no problem with the amendments and thank the Minister for bringing them forward.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for attending. Some of the minor amendments that have been made were referred to previously by our spokesman, Senator Jim Walsh, who is unable to attend this debate. I thank the Minister for taking on board these important and common sense amendments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, although I have a pioneer pin and a vested interest in much earlier closing times for licensed premises. It is evident that a great deal of work has gone into the legislation and especially into the amendments that have tidied it up. I agree with the manner in which the Minister has changed the legislation because it affords people an opportunity to make a living while at the same time allowing patrons to attend and enjoy whatever event is being held.</P>
      <P>The changes to the Bill are especially evident in the new measure regarding children being present on licensed premises in hotels where weddings and functions are being held. I thank the Minister sincerely for changing that situation. It is a very good amendment. Parents and publicans act responsibly and the Minister has put in place legislation that will allow them to continue doing so. This will lead to a better society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his presentation. I welcome the amendments and do not have a problem with them. I still have concerns about the provisions relating to children being present in pubs after a certain time and about the age card. However, I am pleased the Minister has seen fit to take on board some proposals, for example, extending to 9 p.m. the time limit before which children may be present on licensed premises. We need to tackle the problem of under age drinking. It is worth repeating the importance of ensuring these provisions and the existing legislation are enforced and that the resources are in place to do it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would bring forward codifying legislation next year. Will he consider examining the issue afresh, especially with regard to licensing hours? Perhaps a pilot scheme of flexible opening hours should be examined because it is not a good idea for all pubs to close at the same time and it is not the solution to the problem. There are other more modern ways of dealing with it. Nevertheless, I welcome the changes made by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments are acceptable and modest. I hope the Bill will make a difference because there is a serious problem with alcohol. I am concerned about the fact that there are problems enforcing the existing law in this area. I hope this additional legislation does not confuse matters and is enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister does not have time to <Col N="1775" />listen to programmes such as &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;. A woman rang into the programme yesterday to say that her 15 year old daughter bought wine in three different supermarkets in Dublin and the girl had no make-up on her or anything else that would have made her look older. That was profoundly depressing to hear.</P>
    <P>I take the point others have made about parents taking more responsibility. This is important because apparently a considerable amount of alcohol is consumed by young people before they leave the home. Sometimes publicans and off-licences are blamed when, in fact, the drink has been consumed within the home. That is something we must examine.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill well. While the Minister could not accept my amendment requiring those who are repeatedly charged with drunkenness to be referred to an addiction centre, he said he would see if something could be done elsewhere. It is pointless just fining such people. We need to let them know that society reckons they have a problem and we must try to see if we can obtain some help for them. It is not how one would want any person, young or old, to behave. I wish the Bill well and hope it works.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comments and will respond briefly to the points made. I assure the House that much remains to be done with intoxicating liquor legislation. It is worth reiterating the following example in case anyone is thinking of investing heavily in the area.</P>
      <P>The position of theatres under the liquor licensing laws is highly unsatisfactory. Premises operate on theatre licences issued by the Revenue Commissioners in circumstances that I imagine were never contemplated by those who adopted the laws. Effectively, all-night drinking is taking place with the odd performance on stage in buildings that none of us in the House would regard as theatres and that are not substantially different in layout from this Chamber. That this should happen is wrong and I will address it. It was too complicated in the time available to devise methods of working out what is and is not a theatre in the commonly accepted use and meaning of the term. Perhaps we will have to restrict theatre licences to being certified by the Arts Council or some such system. There must be some system in future of working out what is a theatre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person contemplating making substantial investments in this area should bear in mind that the fact I have not dealt with it on this occasion <Col N="1776" />is not a green light. I do not want to be told afterwards that people invested a great deal of money in a project on the assumption that the law would remain as it stands. I intend to bring proposals to both Houses at a later stage to deal with the issue. The strategic task force will examine additional facilities related to this area and will be in contact with the Courts Service in this regard.</P>
    <P>In respect of the change in the legislation dealing with private occasions where a substantial meal is served, I want to make it very clear that this provision should be narrowly construed. Chips left out around a bar do not constitute a substantial meal. I hope this amendment is construed in the spirit in which it was tabled.</P>
    <P>A number of Members made the point, reiterated by Senator Tuffy, regarding enforcement, namely, that there are difficulties enforcing the existing law. They asked whether this Bill would complicate matters and what prospect there was of it being enforced. I take those points at face value. However, one of the methods of ensuring a law is enforced is self-enforcement and giving publicans and hoteliers a sense that they would be much wiser to comply with the law without the threat of people knocking on their doors than otherwise. That is why the closure orders that apply to under age drinking and the production of ID and the provisions relating to drunkenness are stated in tough terms in the legislation. The idea is that publicans will know that, if they are found to be in breach of these orders, there will be serious consequences.</P>
    <P>I take the point about checkout staff. I did not hear the programme in question but people running supermarkets who go into competition with people running off-licences should bear in mind that they operate under exactly the same law as an off-licensee. I fully sympathise with checkout staff. It is probably a mind-numbing experience for them to hold items in front of the bar code machine. In those circumstances it is difficult to concentrate on what is happening. By the same token, however, supermarket proprietors must realise that the law is the same for them as it is for an off-licensee in a specialist store. If their staff operate to a lower standard just because they are busy or it is a stressed occupation or whatever, it is up to the supermarket owners in question to put some method in place to make sure that does not happen. If supermarket owners allow alcohol to be checked out at the same checkout desk as all other food, they must bear the consequence if they make a mistake. They could easily have a separate payment system for wine and spirits in a supermarket which has an off-licence attached to it and if they economise by having a single checkout system, the law will not forgive them if the consequence of that is, effectively, a reduced degree of vigilance as to who is buying the product in their stores.</P>
    <P>I stress that anybody in the supermarket business &ndash; Senator Quinn is not here &ndash; must realise <Col N="1777" />that closure means closure of the licensed premises. It does not mean drawing down a little&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Senator Henry would convey to her colleague that if a closure order is made in respect of a supermarket which is licensed for the sale of alcohol, it will carry the consequence that the supermarket will be closed. That will not be a pretty picture. The false economy of allowing staff at a checkout counter to deal with alcohol could lead to terribly serious consequences for supermarket owners if the kind of behaviour Senator Henry mentioned took place.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry about the courts addiction treatment option. The more I thought about it after the debate on the matter, the more satisfied I was that it should be dealt with in a sentencing statute and general powers of the courts in criminal cases legislation rather than restricting it to cases under the licensing Acts. It should be more general in dealing with public order offences, domestic violence offences and many other offences where drink, unfortunately, plays a part.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As someone who worked with young people, I <Col N="1778" />recall winning my first senior championship medal in Offaly in 1966 when we had a panel of 23 or 24 players, only two of whom took a drink. In 1989, I trained a minor team that won an All-Ireland and of 24 players, only two took a drink. A serious incident took place last year when we won an under-14 championship in our own town, where 11 of the under 14s took a drink. That is the change that has taken place in society and that is the reason the Minister has to take these serious steps. Publicans may regard them as serious but many parents will thank the Minister for doing what he has done.</P>
    <P>In reference to the definition of &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;, I am delighted the Minister clarified that a plate of sandwiches served in the pub will not cover it. I thank the Minister and his officials for what I consider a very good Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials. The Minister is having an effect already because I went to the unveiling of the Daniel O'Connell painting downstairs at 5 p.m. at which we were offered glasses of water and cups of tea. No substantial meal was being served. The Minister is having an effect already, although they are not yet offering Horlicks at these receptions.</P>
      <P>An aspect of the representations from some hoteliers which fascinated me was that somehow all human life would end if children were not allowed in bars all night. Do they not understand that the situation we are now providing for obtains in a large part of the world and there is no decrease in the enjoyment of family holidays? Like Senator Tuffy and others speakers, I have expressed my concern and I intend to keep an eye on the sentencing policy with a view to determining if we can do something with these people. I congratulate the Minister on his efforts.</P>

I am not being a spoilsport but we have to get away from the culture of foisting drink on people when a cup of tea is just as good. I am delighted with the Bill and I thank the Minister.</P>
      <P>Whenever I get bad service from young people in shops or stores, I automatically think they are tired from drinking the night before. I feel strongly about this matter from an economic as well as a social point of view.</P>

We have had numerous debates in this House about the consequences of under age drinking, and the points have been well made, but the question that is continuously asked is what action does the Government intend to take? This Minister is serious about his role, the influence he wants to have on society and particularly this scourge of under age drinking.</P>
      <P>This legislation was brought forward in the right spirit and with the right motivation. Points were made by previous speakers with regard to enforcement by the gardaí and publicans but there must also be self-enforcement on the part of people. If they face up to their responsibilities, we can come together as legislators, members of the public and parents to act responsibly to try to curb this scourge affecting our society.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the time he has spent on the Bill. I remember the four and a half hours he spent here on Committee Stage when he made his points forcefully and well.

      <P>I also welcome the Bill. On a personal note, I am always amused when the subject of changing the culture of drink arises during discussions with friends. We had a heated discussion last night on the subject in a restaurant. If someone is forced to call the emergency services as a result of drinking too much, perhaps being twice or three times over the legal limit, they should be fined. Perhaps the Minister might discuss this with the Minister for Health and Children as such a proposal would overlap with his Department. It is an issue that could be looked at. If people received a bill in the post for a few hundred euro, on top of a hangover, it might sober them up and make them think twice. The emergency services are needed for genuine emergencies. Someone getting deliberately drunk after spending &euro;80 on alcohol should be able to afford the same sum as a fee to contribute to the administrative cost of the emergency services. I make no apology for this as it would get straight to the nub of the problem. While this is a personal opinion, it would be worth looking at.</P>

      <P>I thank Members of the House for their kind remarks and supportive approach to this legislation. I echo what Senator Moylan said about my officials who have played a very constructive role in enabling this legislation to be brought forward. They responded to the reports of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission, which only became available in April, in what I consider to be record time in the bringing forward of this legislative package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" />On the question of enforcement, I reiterate my earlier remarks about self-enforcement. We live in a society where the success or failure of this legislation will depend on whether the Garda Sióchána puts its shoulder to the wheel in making sure it is enforced. I may have to talk to the Commissioner and the Commissioner designate on this subject but it strikes me that it may have to be enforced on a regional basis as it is difficult if it is always the local garda who has to come down heavy on the local publican as people complain about the abuse of power and authority. In urban areas a specialist squad which would operate on a random basis would be more effective. If one goes into a public house accompanied by a single member of the Garda Síochána, it is difficult for the garda to check all the cards of everybody going in and out to make sure the law is being complied with. A few high profile instances where six gardaí came to make sure the law was being complied with on a random basis would get the message across that this was not legislation intended to remain on the shelf but rather intended to have a practical effect. That would probably be the best use of Garda resources but, again, I have to defer to the views of the Commissioner and Commissioner designate who have operational responsibility for the deployment of Garda resources. I take from this House, and the debate and reservations expressed earlier, a strong mandate to communicate to the authorities within the Garda Síochána that it is the view of this House that the Legislature has done its bit and that it is now up to the enforcement authorities to do their part.</P>
    <P>I thank all Members of the House for their kind words and supportive and well thought out contributions to the debate. I hope the input of this House has made a significant difference. When we come to consider the matter again, in the context of the codification of legislation next year, it will be interesting to see what practical effect this legislation has had. I am hopeful it will have had those practical effects but politics is a matter of ups and downs and I hope I will not be here reporting a sense of disappointment. I hope we will have seen considerable results for all the hard work undertaken on all sides of the House in recent weeks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1781" />That Seanad Éireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the Resolution passed by Dáil Eireann on 7th October 1997 and by Seanad Éireann on 8th October 1997 as amended by the Resolutions passed by Dáil Eireann on 1st July 1998 and by Seanad Éireann on 2nd July 1998 as further amended by the resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann on 28th March 2002 pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002 be amended by the substitution of the following paragraphs for paragraphs H and I:</P>
    <P>H.&nbsp;The Tribunal shall consist of not more than three Members as follows:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;His Honour Judge Alan Mahon and Her Honour Judge Mary Faherty who were appointed by instrument made on 24th October 2002 by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 2002, and:</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;His Honour Judge Gerald Keys, from a date to be specified by instrument made pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002 by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this resolution is to reconstitute the membership of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments and ensure the tribunal will be able to get back into public session immediately. When resolutions have been passed by both Houses, the Minister will make an instrument under the Tribunals of Inquiries (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002 to give full effect to the new membership. At that stage, the membership of the three person tribunal will be Judge Alan Mahon, chairperson, Judge Mary Faherty and Judge Gerald Keys.</P>
      <P>The need for this resolution arises from the resignation of Mr. Justice Feargus Flood as both chairperson and member of the tribunal. I pay tribute to Mr. Justice Flood for the exemplary manner in which he has discharged his duties, initially as sole member and more recently as chairperson of the three member tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Mr. Justice Flood took on the task of investigating allegations of corruption in the planning process in 1997, neither he nor the Government expected that the work of the tribunal would be still under way six years later. During that period he made a sustained and dedicated <Col N="1782" />contribution. His resignation is, in many respects, the end of an era. As the Taoiseach noted, his name will be synonymous with the will and determination of the Dáil, the Seanad and the people to expose and root out malpractice and corruption. That of itself is a significant contribution by him to Irish political history. One has only to look at the public response to his second interim report, published last year, to have an appreciation of the esteem in which he is held by the people.</P>
    <P>In recent days there has been much speculation about the events leading to the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood and when the Dáil and Seanad should have been informed. I would like to outline the facts. On 26 May there was a meeting, at the request of the tribunal, with Mr. Justice Flood, Judges Mahon and Faherty and the Attorney General concerning Mr. Justice Flood's staying on as an ordinary member of the tribunal and the costs issue being decided by Judge Mahon. On 28 May Mr. Justice Flood wrote to the Attorney General indicating, for reasons set out in that letter, that he considered himself to be unable to continue to act as chairperson but that he considered he could continue as an ordinary member. He asked the Attorney General to arrange to have the Oireachtas and the Minister informed. Both the Minister and the Taoiseach were given a copy of that letter.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General responded on 30 May to Mr. Justice Flood asking whether he wanted a copy of the letter circulated or whether he wanted the Attorney General to simply apprise the Oireachtas of the contents. On 30 May counsel for the tribunal requested the Attorney General not to circulate the letter for the reasons stated on Wednesday by the Taoiseach. On 4 June Mr. Justice Flood wrote to the Attorney General saying he would shortly send a letter, concerning his intention to step down as chairperson, for circulation to the Clerks of both Houses of the Oireachtas. By letter dated 16 June, received late on 17 June, he formally confirmed to the Attorney General that he considered himself unable to continue to act as chairperson and asked that a copy of his letter be sent to the Clerks of both Houses of the Oireachtas. This letter was forwarded to the Minister by the Attorney General, by letter on 18 June, in which the Attorney indicated he believed it would be proper procedure for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to send the letter to both Clerks. He agreed this changed procedure with counsel for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>When a copy of the letter of 16 June was received by the Minister, he decided it should be brought to the Government's attention at the earliest opportunity. At the next Government meeting, on 24 June, the Government considered the letter in the presence of the Attorney General and decided on the lines of the response which the Minister <Col N="1783" />should make on its behalf to the chairperson. At the same time, the Minister arranged to forward a copy of the letter of 16 June to the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The Minister's letter of 24 June to Mr. Justice Flood raised several issues. It indicated that the Government considered it preferable if he were in a position to remain as chairperson to decide the question of costs. It also expressed the view that there were concerns as to the prospects of legal challenges to future reports of the tribunal, in the light of the contents of his letter of 16 June and his continued involvement as an ordinary member. It asked Mr. Justice Flood to address the risk of legal proceedings to a report produced by the tribunal while he was a member. In doing so it was addressing the following issue.</P>
    <P>It was the Government's concern that if Mr. Justice Flood continued hearing modules as an ordinary member over a lengthy period of time, any subsequent report could be challenged. What the Government was seeking to elicit from the tribunal was the nature of risk of such a legal challenge in the context of the length of the proposed modules Mr. Justice Flood would be hearing as an ordinary member. The concern was simple, namely, that those who were determined to challenge a subsequent report of the tribunal would rely upon the fact that Mr. Justice Flood had not heard the costs issue but was willing to decide issues relating to corruption and bribery. It was seeking clarification on this potential problem.</P>
    <P>On 26 June 2003 a meeting took place between the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Flood. This meeting had been sought by Mr. Justice Flood to clarify his position. He stated he was personally disposed towards dealing with the issue of costs and to continue in the tribunal for a further period. He stated his willingness to address the costs issue, notwithstanding the added strains and burden it would impose.</P>
    <P>There was also a brief discussion about possible future legislative changes to enable the administrative burden of the tribunal placed on a chairperson to be reduced by permitting the administrative tasks of the chairperson to be delegated to another member of the tribunal. This was to address one of the reasons behind the proposal contained in the letter of 16 June 2003 and was a mechanism that would assist his continuation in the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that Mr. Justice Flood would return to the tribunal offices for the purpose of sending a letter to the Oireachtas in relation to this future role in the tribunal as discussed with the Attorney General. Later that afternoon the Attorney General received a telephone call from Mr. Justice Flood who was at the tribunal. In the call the Attorney General was informed by Mr. Justice Flood that he then wanted to reconsider his future role in the tribunal having had further discussions. It was agreed there would be further <Col N="1784" />consideration of his position overnight by Mr. Justice Flood.</P>
    <P>On the morning of Friday 27 June 2003 the Attorney General received a telephone call wherein he was informed that Mr. Justice Flood was resigning from the tribunal. A letter was then sent to the Oireachtas and copied to the Attorney General. Members of this House have a copy. There was only one meeting last week between the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Flood.</P>
    <P>The Minister received a letter from Mr. Justice Flood on Friday 27 June in which he indicated that having reflected on the matter and in the interests of the tribunal and its very important work to date and into the future, he had decided to resign with immediate effect as chairperson and member of the tribunal. Mr Justice Flood also sent this letter on the same day to both Houses of the Oireachtas. These are the facts which clearly show that neither in the past nor present has there been any conspiracy to withhold information from the Oireachtas. I hope the matter can rest there and the bona fides of the Government will be accepted.</P>
    <P>The Government has also been accused of attempting to frustrate the work of the tribunal by delaying last year in appointing additional members. Again, this is not the case and is unfounded. Resolutions to allow for the appointment of additional members were passed by the Dáil and Seanad on 28 March 2002. To give effect to these resolutions, it was necessary for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make an instrument under the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts to formally appoint the new members. However, the tribunal specifically requested in May 2002 that such an instrument should not be made until after Mr. Justice Flood had submitted his interim report to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The interim report on the first three modules was finalised by Mr. Justice Flood and submitted to the Oireachtas on 26 September 2002. An instrument was signed four weeks later extending the tribunal to a three person tribunal with a reserve member. The allegations of attempts to frustrate the tribunal were also scotched when Mr. Justice Flood wrote to the Taoiseach on 30 June confirming that all such allegations were completely groundless. The Taoiseach read that letter into the record of the Dáil on Tuesday. I propose to read it again into the record of this House. It reads:</P>
    <P>Dear Taoiseach,</P>
    <P>I refer to my correspondence with the Attorney General and Minister Cullen on the above matter in which the reasons underlining my resignation are set out.</P>
    <P>I note in the public press statements to the effect that action-inaction by the Government in relation to requests from the tribunal for additional judges or other matters have caused frustration and are the real reason for my resignation.</P>
    <P>I wish to state categorically that this is not <Col N="1785" />so. My decision is in no way related to or consequent upon any action or inaction by the Government of any kind.</P>
    <P>My relationship with the Government is through the Department of the Attorney General. I have at all times during my tenure of office had a relationship with the Attorney General's Office that has been exceptionally cordial and co-operative. The allegation that the work of the tribunal has been delayed or frustrated in any way by the Government is completely groundless and has nothing to do with my decision to resign.</P>
    <P>The reasons for my resignation are solely set out in my correspondence with the Attorney General and Minister Cullen. I trust this letter clarifies the position.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Feargus M. Flood.</P>
    <P>While significant work has been carried out by the tribunal, it clearly has much more to do. When the Minister wrote to the tribunal on 24 June, he also asked it to give him a report dealing with the following matters: the likely duration of the current module or modules; the likely duration, up to completion, of all matters arising within the terms of reference, as amended, of the tribunal; the total in legal costs claimed to date by third parties, that is, those who sought representation or provided discovery and so forth; and the likely costs to be incurred in investigating all matters within the terms of reference. The tribunal responded on 25 June. On the future duration of the tribunal, it indicated the tribunal was in the course of hearing evidence in public in relation to a number of interlinked planning modules.</P>
    <P>It is the current intention of the tribunal to conclude the public hearings relating to these modules by the end of 2006, after which it will furnish a report on allegations of planning corruption in the Dublin area to the Oireachtas. It is the intention of the tribunal that its report will make recommendations as to how any matters then outstanding might best be dealt with, having regard to the tribunal's obligations and experience and any legislative changes in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The tribunal also indicated that the duration of the tribunal beyond 2006 would depend upon the number of issues, if any, deemed to merit public inquiry. The tribunal is currently investigating a number of issues in private but no decision has been taken as to whether any of these issues require public hearing. It is anticipated that within the next 12 months the tribunal will be in a position to decide whether any of the issues should be heard in public and, at that time, it will be in a position to advise the Minister and the Oireachtas of the likely duration of the public hearings relating to any such issue. The full text of the letter in question and the Minister's letter of 24 June were sent to the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad on 27 June. It is clear from that correspondence that the tribunal still has significant <Col N="1786" />work to do. In the light of the likely duration, it is understandable that Mr. Justice Flood could not be expected to finalise the work of the tribunal as chairperson and his resignation must be seen in that light.</P>
    <P>The decision taken last year to appoint a reserve member allows for a smooth transition to a newly constituted tribunal. The proposal is to appoint an existing member as chairperson and to make the reserve member a full member. There is no proposal to appoint a new reserve member at this stage and none has been sought by the tribunal as it would not be practical given that the current module is in mid-stream. If the tribunal makes such a request at any stage in the future, the matter will be brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I wish to refer to the question of who will determine costs on modules to date. It was the Government's preference that Mr. Justice Flood would deal with the matter. The resignation of Mr. Justice Flood means it has to be dealt with by another person. This raises legal issues regarding hearings to determine the issue of costs in respect of modules of the tribunal completed to date. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will arrange for new legislation in the autumn to deal with this issue. Pending such legislation, hearings in relation to costs will not take place.</P>
    <P>I re-affirm the commitment of the Government to the completion of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. The speed with which this resolution was brought to the Seanad gives an indication of its commitment to the future work of the tribunal. The members of the tribunal are persons of the highest calibre and integrity and this tribunal will continue with the same persistence and determination demonstrated by Mr. Justice Flood. The members of the tribunal with their legal team and staff will be supported in full in their determination to establish if any corrupt practices exist or have existed in our planning system and to report without fear or favour on the outcome of the inquiries. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his informative contribution. Fine Gael compliments Mr. Justice Flood on the huge amount of work he did as chairman of the tribunal. The public saw some tribunals in the past as a means for lawyers to get wealthy and for people to be exonerated. Certainly, there have been wishy washy reports from some tribunals. That was not the case with the Flood tribunal. The interim report of that tribunal was frank and thoughtful. It called a spade a spade and people appreciated that fact. The judge used the word &ldquo;corrupt&rdquo; in relation to one politician.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Flood is 75 years of age and he sat for 75 months as chairman of the tribunal. He is entitled to his retirement and Fine Gael wishes him well in that regard. We also wish Judge Alan Mahon every success in his new role. We fully support the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1787" />However, the Government's handling of this issue has been far from sure footed. The Taoiseach told the Dáil on 24 June about Mr. Justice Flood's intention to resign but he did not have the common courtesy to inform the Leader of the Opposition. He had to apologise for that later. Whatever about not announcing the matter publicly, it is common courtesy to inform the Leader of the Opposition about what is happening. The Taoiseach's comment in the Dáil that the Flood tribunal might take up to 16 years to do its work was also unhelpful, especially when the tribunal has said it can complete its work by 2006.</P>
    <P>There is a certain amount of undermining of the tribunal at times. The media will run with a story but they can only do so when they get the story from somebody else. Where do the stories originate? A recent issue of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried a story that Mr. Justice Flood resigned because of the media's manipulation. That is unhelpful, to say the least. There might be some truth in it but Mr. Justice Flood's letter seems to dispel that view.</P>
    <P>There is huge concern about costs as a result of Mr. Justice Flood's resignation. It is amazing that the Government will not bring forward legislation now to deal with this issue. It had six weeks to prepare such legislation because it knew for six weeks that this issue would arise. Given that it was pushing Bills through both Houses and guillotining them for the last few weeks, it could have been done. The lack of legislation creates an air of uncertainty which is unhelpful. People are concerned. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could have prepared the necessary legislation within that six week period.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers are also concerned about the escalating costs of the tribunals. They want to see value for money and results. The Flood tribunal was probably the most successful of the tribunals in that regard. The Government has been tardy in the past in its responses to the Flood tribunal. In June 2001, Mr. Justice Flood requested more judges but they were only appointed in March 2002. On 26 May, the Attorney General met Mr. Justice Flood when he decided to step down. There seems to have been confusion as to when he would decide to resign or retire but this information was not passed on to the relevant people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then commented that it would take 15 or 16 more years for the tribunal to complete its work. Everybody makes mistakes and says the wrong thing occasionally but I believe there might have been more to that comment than meets the eye. Mr. Tom Gilmartin is due to appear before the tribunal and he has made serious allegations in relation to the Taoiseach. This uncertainty is not helpful. The sooner the tribunal can proceed in its work, the sooner it can clear up any major issues in that regard.</P>
    <P>I compliment the huge amount of work done by Mr. Justice Flood and I wish Judge Alan Mahon every success in his new position. Fine Gael is keen to see the tribunal continue its work. <Col N="1788" />We are also concerned about the escalating costs. The suggestion by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of private tribunals is worth considering if it would speed up the process and reduce costs.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has been in existence for seven years but the people who have come before it have long gone from the political sphere. One could wonder about the relevancy of the tribunal, which is the danger when it takes a long time.</P>

      <P>I accept that. However, the people that are found guilty are long gone from politics. It is a question of accelerating the process. The Taoiseach has questions to answer about his handling of this matter. I hope the Government gives the Flood tribunal the resources necessary to continue its work and I hope its work will be completed before 2006, as the tribunal believes, rather than 15 years hence, as alleged by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We thank Mr. Justice Feargus Flood for his work in the tribunal and wish him well in his retirement. We note the huge amount of work he got through, the interim report, which the Minister praised, and the punctilious, stringent and rigorous way he addressed the issues which came before him. We also thank the members of his team and others who worked with him in producing the interim report. He has done the State a huge service.</P>
      <P>I was struck a couple of weeks ago by the sudden flurry of concern about the expense of the tribunal. I do not agree with those sentiments. The tribunal is expensive but it is necessary that it continues. The Houses of the Oireachtas voted to establish the Moriarty and Flood tribunals. I was a member of the Cabinet when the establishment of these tribunals was discussed. Regardless of how long it takes, corruption and evil must be discussed publicly and the people responsible must be brought to book. That is the only way we will get public life back into shape and deal with wrongdoing. There is no doubt that both the Flood and Moriarty tribunals &ndash; though we are speaking here about the former &ndash; have done an immense amount of work. Let us hope the outcome of it all is a much higher level of probity in those who stand for public office or serve the public good and that they are much more strongly imbued with the proper tenets as they go about their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk of the cost and I do not mean the cost for those proven to have misled the tribunal or withheld information from it, for that matter will be addressed in the early autumn, as I was glad to read in the Minister's script. There has been much talk of barristers and their fees, to which I also have a simple answer. The labour is worthy of its hire, and whatever rate is ordained for such work is that which should be <Col N="1789" />paid. There is no point in entering into envious discourse about the matter.</P>
    <P>As I said on behalf of our party and as Leader of this House, I thank Mr. Justice Feargus Flood for the work he has undertaken, often in very difficult circumstances. I note that Judge Alan Mahon is to be the chair of the tribunal. I wish him well in his work. I know his family well from Tullamore in the midlands. I also wish well Mary Faherty, whom I also know, and Gerard Keys, who will now be full members of the tribunal. I praise them all for the assiduous way in which they carry out their work, their legal training, and the dignity which they bring to their office.</P>
    <P>I want to correct something which the Minister very clearly outlined in his script and to which our colleague in the House referred. There was no delay. I was a member of the Cabinet during the period when extra personnel were sought. In the script it is very clearly laid out that there was no delay. Mr. Justice Flood wished to issue his interim report while he was still sole member of the tribunal. He said this himself, I presume in correspondence, and it is a matter of record. The extra personnel were granted within four weeks. I know that, on an issue such as this, a hornets' nest can be raised up very quickly. However, there was nothing in it, and the facts were laid out very clearly. The same is true of the facts of the correspondence, of which we received complete copies. I thank the officers of the House for ensuring we got all the necessary correspondence in those last few very busy weeks, when they were engaged in issues such as these, and the punctilious manner in which matters were attended to.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and other members of the Cabinet will be quite clear that current modules will be held in public. There is no way that modules relating to Gilmartin or other planning issues should be dealt with in a private prologue. I fully agree that future modules should be examined in the Bill, which we will have in the autumn, and I am sure that that will be attended to through what I believe will be termed a &ldquo;commission of investigation&rdquo;. The current modules must be held in public. Otherwise the public's belief in the efficacy of such tribunals would be very considerably undermined. The Taoiseach has assured the Dáil, and I wish to assure this House. I have been informed to the effect that the current modules will be held in public, as is proper in order that people's reputations can be cleared. If others have to hit the dust, that is the way the tribunal will conduct its business.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion in my name to the House. The matter has been handled excellently by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Taoiseach, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Above all, the name of Mr. Justice Feargus Flood will be forever linked with the opening up of society and political life, and the exposure of mis<Col N="1790" />deeds, corruption, bribery, misrepresentation and all that was laid out in his report, which was a bestseller. It is hard for us to appreciate that a report from a tribunal could become a bestseller but we saw people lining up on a wet morning in the street to purchase it. Well done to him, and good luck to the new team.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in paying tribute to Judge Feargus Flood for his efforts over the last six years in the planning tribunal which bears his name. The tribunal broke new ground in the history of such tribunals, and Feargus Flood has, by and large, handled it adeptly and very ably. We should remember that in many cases he was dealing with witnesses who had very deep pockets and did not hesitate to go to the courts to assert their rights. In many cases, however, simply by cajoling or persuasion or by the use of words which delivered a clear message to witnesses who might otherwise have been reluctant to contribute as they should to the tribunal, he managed to get the results. It is not difficult to think of examples but I will not recite the names here. He was able to persuade some who might not have done so to contribute fully to the knowledge we now possess. We owe him thanks for this. He did not shrink from using the coercive power of the courts where necessary, as neither he nor the tribunal should. In those decisions, he has done a considerable service to the State.</P>
      <P>It has been remarked on before that his interim report was a model of clarity, something which, to be frank, we had not always got from previous reports. In being so startlingly clear by terming certain individuals' behaviour as corrupt, he made the report and the work of the tribunal accessible to people who might have been cynical about it before and said it was all words and that the guilty would get away with it. They have not got away with it, and I do not think they will. At the very least, we have those bold, clear words from Judge Flood that certain practices or specific actions on behalf of certain people were corrupt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with the Leader when she says we must put the debate about costs into perspective and not lose our sense of outrage about what happened in Dublin in the 1980s. It was without doubt the most outrageous and systemic corruption of power seen in this State &ndash; or at least that we know of. It seems to have involved quite a number of people. It was systemic, happening weekly and monthly in Dublin County Council. Needless to say, none of us stands over it now but at the time a fair number of people seemed to find it acceptable. It is important that through the tribunals and the work of these Houses, we make it clear that it was not acceptable then and that it is not acceptable now. Not only is it important that those who did wrong in the 1980s and 1990s are exposed and punished; it is also important for the future of our political system that we set down a clear marker that such corrupt practices are <Col N="1791" />simply not acceptable. We cannot put a cost on that marker, for it must be put down regardless.</P>
    <P>As Senator Browne rightly pointed out, the matter has been handled extremely ineptly by the Government. Had the facts set out by the Minister here today and yesterday in the Dáil been stated clearly by the Taoiseach last week, there would have been no problem. It arose entirely because the Taoiseach made it such. He arrived in the Dáil last week and gave the impression that he had only just become apprised of the legal difficulties that had arisen, whereas we found out very shortly afterwards that he had been aware of potential difficulty for a full month, since 26 May. It is still not clear, despite all the lengthy explanations about exchanges of letters and contradictory moves yesterday from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and today from the Minister of State, why the Taoiseach did not see fit at some point during the course of that month to say, even privately, as Senator Browne has said, to the leaders of the Opposition, that there was a problem that had to be tackled.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is normally fairly astute and clear about such matters but he has been far from that in the past week. Inevitably, in those circumstances, people will wonder what is happening. This matter stinks to high heaven. We still do not have an adequate answer to that question and I suspect we will not get one. Once this resolution is passed, there will be a new chairman of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is essential the issue of costs is dealt with quickly and fairly. It would be appalling if we were to find ourselves in a situation, because of the events of the past three weeks, where the State had to cough up costs to people who the tribunal found to be corrupt. That is an appalling vista which none of us wants to contemplate. It is essential that legislation is put in place as soon as possible to ensure that does not happen. That is the reason I join others in expressing surprise that it was not found possible or sufficiently urgent to put that legislation in place now.</P>
    <P>It is not clear from what the Minister of State said this morning or from what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage, and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said yesterday what legislation is contemplated. If the Minister of State has any information to that effect I would be interested to hear it. All of us know we cannot shell out millions of euro to known individuals who have delayed the tribunal and been shown to have engaged in corrupt practices. If so, we will make the whole tribunal a laughing stock. I am sure there are some who would like it to be made a laughing stock. I suggest it is in the long-term interest of all of us in this House to ensure that does not happen.</P>
    <P>The Leader clearly said she felt the Quarryvale module and the Gilmartin allegations should be dealt with in public. I accept her assurance and the assurance of others, including the Taoiseach, <Col N="1792" />on face value. It is essential that is the case. In principle, for modules that have not yet been publicly aired or where the tribunal is only starting its work, I would not have any difficulty if they were dealt with in a different way but there would be a need for consultation with Opposition parties to ensure the Houses of the Oireachtas can proceed on the basis of consensus. It is in all our interests that it is done quickly, is transparent and fair and involves a reasonable cost. I am sure the Labour Party would co-operate in ensuring that was done. It must be done on the basis of consensus. Realistically, it cannot affect the modules that have been heard or those that are being heard.</P>
    <P>We wish Judge Mahon well in his future role. It is obviously an onerous and important one not only for the Houses, but for the future of the body politic in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join previous speakers in complimenting Mr. Justice Flood on his work to date. There is no doubt that the manner in which he approached his task and his interim report and the manner in which it was received was an eye-opener for many but, more importantly, it was a good public service. We should never lose sight of the fact that despite comments about tribunal fatigue and that the costs outweigh the benefits, public life is better off as a result of these investigations. During the course of this tribunal certain matters have come to hand, particularly the legal situation in which we find ourselves as a result of Mr. Justice Flood's resignation regarding the determination of costs. This is something from which we have to learn. We have to work on it and, if necessary, we may have to legislate. In legislating for it, let us do it properly. Let us approach the whole question of tribunals and try to make them more efficient and less costly but at no stage should we put that before the public interest.</P>
      <P>As a result of this tribunal the public is more informed about what was going on. It is more questioning, has a greater awareness of the whole planning procedure and has a greater awareness of what is right and wrong. The tribunal said that politics is corrupt and I regret that. Individuals have been found to have acted improperly. If one is a servant of the public, elected to public office and abuses that position and privilege, it has to be exposed and corrected. If the future integrity of public life in this State is better served as a result of what has been going on, it is a good public service. Some advocate that we should close down the tribunals. I question the motives of those people and some of the suggestions put forward. Is that in the public interest or is it self-interest regarding a culture that has developed and has to stop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues facing us and the forthcoming legislation will give us an opportunity to examine the role of tribunals, how they are constructed and how they operate. Perhaps we can find a more efficient way of doing it. At no stage should any <Col N="1793" />of us be taken by the opinion that we should cease to investigate corruption because of costs or length of time. While people want heads on plates, we have to be responsible and allow due process, regardless of our opinions. The long-term view has to be in the interests of the State, the public and those of us who are elected to public office that we should operate and carry on our work to the highest standard.</P>
    <P>There is always a potential for corruption. Unfortunately, those who are close to power at times are found not to have acted in the public interest but in self-interest. That has to be exposed and we have a responsibility to do it. It is a privilege to work in public life, but it is essential that one carries out one's duties properly.</P>
    <P>We compliment the work of the tribunals. In complimenting Mr. Justice Flood, we wish his successor, Judge Mahon, every success in the work he is going to carry on and conclude. I have no doubt that as a result of his findings and his final report, which will be delivered without fear or favour, Irish society and public life will be better served.</P>
    <P>Much of the media spin of recent weeks about the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood has been clarified in his letter to the Taoiseach, which the Minister read to the House. The Minister also clarified a number of other inaccuracies that were being circulated for the benefit of public consumption and which suggested some inappropriate behaviour by the Government in frustrating the tribunals. Clearly that is untrue. These tribunals were established by the Houses of the Oireachtas and there is an onus on us to support them. If we have to bring forward legislation to amend the workings of the tribunals, let us do so but with the common objective that what we want at the end of the day is a better standard of public life in this country, where there is no tolerance or acceptance of anyone who abuses their position and, if that happens, that there will not be any cover-up or protection. That is the responsibility of all Members of the Oireachtas. I wish Judge Mahon well in his endeavours and I fully support the resolution before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members who contributed to the debate on this resolution. I am pleased but not surprised at the general support for the terms of the resolution. In dealing with this matter during the past few weeks, the primary concerns of the Government were to facilitate the continued operation of the tribunal and to ensure its future operations are conducted in a manner so as not to give rise to any future legal or other problems. The resolution deals with the first issue. The more difficult issue is the question of how the matter of costs is to be determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the costs being claimed by third parties. The tribunal has informed us that the costs notified to date amount <Col N="1794" />to &euro;21.5 million but that there are other parties who have yet to furnish estimates. These are significant amounts. The Government is anxious to avoid legal challenges to any future tribunal decisions on claims. It is our duty to act in the public interest and ensure the taxpayer does not have to bear the burden. For that reason, we wanted Mr. Justice Flood to remain as chairperson and deal with the hearings on costs. With his resignation, the hearing on costs will have to be heard by the new chairperson.</P>
    <P>We have been advised that the existing body of legislation in regard to the tribunals will have to be amended to permit the new chairperson to determine the issue of costs. This legislation will be brought forward by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the autumn. There have been some suggestions that it should have been prepared now or over the next few weeks. As the legislation required will, of its nature, be complex, it would be wrong to rush it. The Minister will examine the position over the summer months in consultation with the Attorney General. This is the sensible approach. We need to get the legislation right to minimise the potential for successful legal actions against decisions on costs.</P>
    <P>Because of the issue of costs, and other issues, we have had suggestions that there should be alternative forms of inquiry. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published the Commission of Investigations Bill earlier this week which will allow for the establishment of commissions to investigate and report on matters of public concern. The House will have the opportunity to debate this proposed legislation in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Government undermining and frustrating the work of the tribunal. Mr. Justice Flood made it abundantly clear in his letter to the Taoiseach that this was not the case when he referred to the relationship with the Government, the Department and the Attorney General. He said that at all times during his tenure of office he had an exceptionally cordial and co-operative relationship with the Attorney General's office. Anyone who could suggest there was frustration or undermining of the work of the tribunal has not taken Mr. Justice Flood's letter into consideration.</P>
    <P>I concur with the remarks made and tributes paid to Mr. Justice Flood. He discharged his duties in an exemplary manner. It is right that we speak about him in the superlative. He has done the State a great service during the years he chaired the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their general welcome for the resolution and assure them that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring the necessary legislation before the House as soon as practicable in the autumn.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm bheith ar ais anseo tráthnóna agus is tráthúil go bhfuil muid anois ar an mír dheiridh a bheidh á phlé sa Seanad roimh sos an tsamhraidh agus gurb é críoch Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla atá á phlé againn. Nuair a bhí me anseo san earrach, dúirt mé go raibh súil agam go mbeadh seo achtaithe roimh sos an tsamhraidh agus, buíochas le Dia, is mar sin a bheidh.</P>
      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith anseo inniu fosta chun sibh a chur ar an eolas maidir leis na leasuithe a rinneadh ar Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2002 sa Dáil ó ritheadh sa Teach seo é ar an 13 Bealtaine. Mar a gheall mé le linn na díospóireachta ar Chéim na Tuarascála sa Teach seo, ghlac me le tuilleadh comhairle ar roinnt nithe a bhí ardaithe liom le linn na ndíospóireachtaí éagsúla agus is de thoradh an chomhairle breise a fuair mé a rinneadh na leasuithe atá i gceist.</P>
      <P>Tá liosta iomlán de na leasuithe curtha ar fáil do Seanadóirí. Rinnneadh 39 leasú san iomlán agus ba leasuithe teicniúla formhór acu. Ba mhaith liom léargas a thabhairt do na leasuithe a rinneadh ar an mBille sa Dáil in ord de réir riar na n-alt chomh fada agus is féidir.</P>
      <P>Bhí leasú teicniúil i gceist in alt 2, a bhaineann le leasuithe Uimh. 1, 17, 20 agus 39, a bhí riachtanach de thoradh leasú Uimh. 22 a rinneadh le deimhniú gur i nGaeilge amháin a bheadh tideal oifig chomisinéara na dteangacha oifigiúla agus go dtabharfadh an coiminiséir teanga ar an gcoimisinéir. Rinne an leasú sin go mbeadh teideal níos simplí ar an gcoimisinéar, go háirithe i gcomhthéacs dhul i bhfeidhm ar an bpobal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leasú teicniúil a bhí i gceist maidir le leasú Uimh. 2. Rinneadh leasú Uimh. 3 chun soiléiriú breise a dhéanamh do bhrí na forála áirithe seo. De thoradh an leasuithe seo, ní bheidh gá le rialachán le feidhm a thabhairt don fhoráil agus tá sé soiléir ann go bhfuil gach seirbhís de chuid comhlachtaí poiblí clúdaithe agus is cuma an go <Col N="1796" />díreach nó go neamhdhíreach a chuirtear an tseirbhís sin ar fáil.</P>
    <P>In alt 6 rinneadh leasú Uimh. 4 agus 5 le soiléiriú breise a dhéanamh ar bhrí na bhforálacha in alt 6. Deimhníonn na leasuithe seo, mar a bhí ar intinn ó thús, go bhfuil cead ag gach duine Gaeilge a úsáid os comhair ceachtar Tí den Oireachtas nó os comhair aon choiste dá chuid.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh leasú Uimh. 6 ar chomhairle an Dhréachtóra Pharlaiminte toisc go raibh an baol ann go raibh na focail &ldquo;caint dhíreach&rdquo; débhíoch ó thaobh an dlí de agus chomh maith leis sin chun a chinntiú nach mbeadh gá le ceisteanna Dála scríofa, a aistriú go Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh leasú Uimh. 7 ar alt 8 ar chomhairle an Dhréachtóra Pharlaiminte toisc go dtuigim ó na Seirbhísí Cúirteanna go mbíonn buntáiste ann i gcásanna áirithe aistriúchán chomhleanúnach &ndash; consecutive translation &ndash; a bheith ar fáil in ionad aistriúchán comhuaineach &ndash; simultaneous translation. Faoin leasú seo fágtar an dischréid ag an mbreitheamh cinneadh a dhéanamh faoin gcóras aistriúchaáin a bheidh le húsáid.</P>
    <P>Cinntíonn leasú Uimh. 8 go bhfuil dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí an teanga oifigiúil atá roghnaithe ag an bpáirtí eile úsáid. Beidh cead, áfach, ag aon fhinné a rogha teanga a úsáid.</P>
    <P>Is é an fáth a bhí le leasú Uimh. 9 ná a chinntiú nach mbeidh aon athrú ar an ngnáth-riail atá i bhfeidhm maidir le costais ullmhúcháin na bpáirtithe i gcásanna sibhialta i.e., nach bhfuil aon ról ag an Stát sa chúram sin toisc gur ceist i don bhreitheamh nó ceist atá le réiteach idir na páirtithe féin ag deireadh an cháis.</P>
    <P>Bhain leasuithe Uimh. 10 agus 11(<i>a</i>) leis an bhforáil áirithe sin a thréisiú trí fhogairtí béil &ndash; bíodh siad beo nó taifeadta &ndash; a chur san áireamh. Leis an bhforáil áirid sin a threisiú trí fhógairtí béil, bíodh siad beo nó taifeadtha, a chur san áireamh. Is leasú teicniúil a bhí i gceist i leasú Uimh. 11, a rinneadh ar an mbonn nach raibh na focail &ldquo;nó cibe cuid d'ábhar&rdquo; riachtanach le brí an fhoráil a thuiscint.</P>
    <P>Is leasú tábhachtach a bhí i gceist le leasú Uimh12. De thoradh an leasaithe seo beidh dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí a chinntiú go mbeidh aon chumarsáid, i scríbhinn nó leis an bpost leictreonach, a déantar leis an bpobal chun faisnéis a thabhairt i nGaeilge nó i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla.</P>
    <P>Leasuithe teicniúla a bhí i gceist le leasuithe Uimh. 13, 14, 16, 18, 19 agus 21 ar altanna 11, 13, 15 agus a 17. Bhí na leasuithe seo riachtanach toisc gur rinneadh ath-eagrú, ar chomhairle an Dréachtóra Pairliminte, ar ord na n-alt i gcás alt a 9, mar a bhí roimhe seo. Níor dearnadh aon athrú ar théacs an ailt sin.</P>
    <P>Leasú thar a bheith tábhachtach a bhí i leasú Uimh. 15 ar alt 13. Baineann an leasú leis na forálacha san mBille maidir le léibhéal agus caighdeán na seirbhíse a cuirtear ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta a threisiú. Faoin leasú seo tá dualgas ar chomhluchtaí poiblí cinntiú go mbeidh an Ghaeilge mar theanga oibre ina gcuid oifigí atá lonnaithe san nGaeltacht taobh istigh de thré<Col N="1797" />imhse ama a bheidh le haontú idir an comhlucht poiblí agus an Aire.</P>
    <P>Maidir le halt 20, mar a mhínigh mé roimhe seo an fáth a bhí le leasú Uimh. 22 ná chun a dheimhniú gur i nGaeilge amháin a bheadh teideal oifig choiminisinéir na dteangacha oifigiúla agus go dtabharfaí an coimisinéir teanga ar an gcoimisineir. Ar mhaith le teideal níos simplí agus níos éasca a bheith ar an gcoimisinéir, go háirithe i gcomhthéacs dul i bhfeidhm ar an bpobal.</P>
    <P>Leasú teicniúil a bhí i gceist le leasú Uimh. 23 ar alt 22, a rinneadh ar chomhairle an Dréachtóra Pairliminte. Leasú teicniúil a bhí i gceist le leasú Uimh. 24 ar alt 23, a rinneadh ar chomhairle an Dréachtóra Pairliminte, le cinntiú go mbeadh forálacha alt a 21<i>(f) </i>agus an fo-alt árithe seo mar an gcéanna.</P>
    <P>Bhí leasú Uimh. 25 ar alt 27 riachtanach le soiléiriú a dhéanamh gurb é an coimisinéir teanga a bheidh freagrach as riaradh scéim cúitimh, mar a bhí i gceist agam ón tús. Anuas air sin beidh an dualgas ar an gcomhlucht poiblí i gceist pé cúiteamh a bhíonn molta ag an gcoimisinéir a íoc as an soláthar airgid féin.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh leasú Uimh. 26 ar alt 28 ar chomhairle an Ard Aighne agus toisc gur rinneadh ais-ghairm ar fhoráil a bhí cosúil leis an Acht um Shaoráil Faisnéise le déanaí. Tá altanna 31, 32, 33 34 agus 35 nua.</P>
    <P>Go bunúsach, baineann leasuithe Uimh. 27, 28, 29, 30 agus 31 le stádas na leagan Gaeilge na logainmneacha a threisiú. Faoi na leasaithe seo is i nGaeilge amháin a bhéas logainmneacha sa Ghaeltacht agus beidh stádas comhionann ag an leagan Béarla agus Gaeilge de logainmneacha sa chuid eile den tír. Is rud tábhachtach atá déanta. Ní raibh aon stádas oifigiúil ag an leagan Gaeilge de logainmneacha go dtí seo. D'fhéadfaí iad a úsáid sa dlí ach ní rabhadar oifigiúil. Is é an chaoi a bheidh sé as seo amach ná taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht beidh an dá leagan oifigiúil agus taobh istigh den nGaeltacht ní bheidh ach an Ghaeilge oifigiúil. Beidh an Béarla san nGaeltacht mar a bhí an Ghaeilge san ngalltacht go dtí seo. Sílim féin gur feabhas mór é sin ar chúrsaí. Mar shampla, nuair a bhéas na hordaithe cuí déanta maidir le clárú talún is i nGaeilge a bhéas na hainmneacha san nGaeltacht agus is mar sin a clarófar iad as seo amach.</P>
    <P>Rinneadh leasú Uimh. 32 alt 32 a aisghairm, ar chomhairle an Ard Aighne agus de thoradh cinneadh Rialtais. Is leasú teicniúil a bhí i gceist le leasú Uimh. 33 ar an Chéad Sceideal, le soiléiriú breise a dhéanamh ar bhrí an fhoráil áirithe sin. Faoin leasú seo tiocfaidh comhlachtaí faoi alt 1(5) den Chéad Sceideal más amhlaidh go bhfaighidh siad 50% nó níos mó dá gcaiteachas reatha in aon bhliain airgeadais ar leith ó chomhlacht poiblí mar atá sonraithe i bhfomhír (2), (3) nó (4) den alt sin nó ón bPríomh-Chiste.</P>
    <P>Ba leasaithe teicniúla a bhí i gceist chomh maith le leasuithe Uimh. 34, 35 agus 36 a rinneadh chun na forálacha sa Bhille a bhaineann le comhlachtaí poiblí nua a thiocfaidh faoi fhorálacha an Bhille a chur san áireamh sa Chéad Scei<Col N="1798" />deal den Bhille a dhéanamh níos simplí. Is leasú teicniúil a bhí i gceist le leasú Uimh. 37 ar an Dara Sceideal.</P>
    <P>Táim sásta go bhfuil forálacha an Bhille seo cuimsitheach, go bhfuil siad treisithe go mór leis na leasaithe atá déanta ar an mBille le linn dó a bheith ag dul tríd Thithe an Oireachtais agus go gcuirfidh said go mór le leibhéal agus le caighdeán na seirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge a chuirfear ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do dhaoine a dteastaíonn uathu an Ghaeilge a usáid agus iad ag plé leis na heagrais sin. Táim sásta freisin go gcinnteoidh an Bille seo, thar an tréimhse tosaigh, soláthar seirbhísí poiblí sa Ghaeilge atá i bhfad níos fearr ó thaobh caighdeáin de agus níos fairsinge ó thaobh réimse de, i gcomparáid leis an scéal fíorásach atá ann i láthair na huaire agus go soláthróidh sé meicníocht a bheidh láidir go leor chun ligean domsa, mar Aire, agus do mo chomharbaí an leibhéal tosaigh sin a fheabhsú de réir a chéile le soláthar seirbhísí níos mó, céim ar chéim, a chinntiú, le freastal ar phobal na Gaeilge agus le go mbeidh an Ghaeilge i bhfad níos feiceálaí ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Tús maith é seo. Beidh dúshlán mór romhamsa, roimh gach uile dhuine agus roimh na comhlachtaí poiblí i gceist ag cur an Achta seo i bhfeidhm ach creidim go bhfeicfimid go sciobtha athraithe suntasacha ar scála nach bhfacamar ariamh ó bhlianta tosaigh an Stáit nuair a bhí borradh ann. Tá súil agam gur mar sin a bhéas.</P>
    <P>Ta mé sé bliana ag plé leis an mBille seo. Bóthar fada, fadálach anróiteach a bhí i gceist. Ní jab éasca teacht ar na foirmlí cearta a bheadh réalaíoch ar lámh amháin agus, ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, a thabharfadh stádas don Ghaeilge nach raibh aici go dtí seo. Chuidigh go leor daoine liom ar an mbealach. Bhí dream dílis ag obair sa Roinn ar an mBille seo le fada an lá agus de réir mar a chuaigh daoine ar aghaidh go dtí postanna eile tháinig dream eile a thóg an cúram orthu féin. Rinneadh éacht oibre thar tréimhse sé bliana le seo a thabhairt go dtí an lá go mbeidh seo rite ag an dá Theach den Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, ón gcéad lá bhí baint mhór ag pobal na Gaeilge agus ag na heagrais Gaeilge leis an obair. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leo as na tuairimí ar fad a chuir siad ar aghaidh i rith an ama sin. Bhí plé bríomhar ann. Is cuimhin liom iarraidh ar na heagrais go mbeidís i láthair sa Teach agus an Bille á phlé le go dtiocfaidís ar thuiscint ar an gcóras atá i gceist agus go mbeidís in ann moltaí a dhéanamh domsa agus dos na pairtithe éagsúla sa Dáil agus sa Seanad. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis na heagraíochtaí a rinne é sin. Dua mór a bhí ann agus bhí go leor ama i gceist ach ba chúnamh mór don phróiséas ar fad gur dearnadh é sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas faoi leith a ghlacadh le Baill Thithe an Oireachtais a chuir an oiread sin anró orthu féin ag plé leis an mBille. Níl aon cheist ach go raibh fáilte roimh an mBille seo ar gach uile thaobh den dá Theach. Ghlac go leor Seanadóiri agus Teachtaí Dála páirt in imeachtaí an Bhille seo. Rud amháin a thug an-mhisneach <Col N="1799" />dom ná gur ag tacú agus ag taobhú le haidhmeanna an Bhille a bhí gach aon duine acu. Is túr dóchais é don todhchaí go bhfuil an oiread sin de ionadaithe poiblí na tíre ar son na hoibre atá ar bun againn. Deirimse i gcónaí gur scathán ar an bpobal na hionadaithe poiblí.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas freisin a ghlacadh leis an bhfoireann aistriúcháin, leis an Dréachtóir Pairliminte agus leo siúd a oibríonn in dTithe an Oireachtais. Ní thuigeann daoine an méid oibre a bhíonn i gceist i rud mar seo a réiteach. Chríochnaíomar sa Dáil inné agus tá na cáipéisí ar fad réidh agus leasaithe arís inniu i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla. Is éacht oibre é sin agus tá an-bhuíochas ag dul dos na daoine a bhí pairteach ann.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann glacadh leis an mBille seo inniu, go dtiocfaimid ar aghaidh go dtí an chéad Chéim eile, is é sin cur i bhfeidhm an Bhille. Beidh obair an Bhille seo agus an Achta mar a bheidh lárnach d'obair na Roinne Gnothaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta go ceann blianta amach anseo. Sé an sprioc atá agam ná nuair a thiocfaimid ar ais i gceann cúig bliana agus deich mbliana ag déanamh athbhreithniú air seo feicfear gur gléas láidir a bhí anseo le cur le cothú na Gaeilge mar theanga. Bhí go leor daoine ann a dúirt nach mbeadh an Bille seo ann go bráth agus nach n-achtódh Tithe an Oireachtais Bille teanga láidir. Buíochas le Dia, bhí lucht an amhrais sa gcás seo mícheart &ndash; tá an Bille ann. Fágfaidh mé do na Seanadóirí anois a séal a chur ar an obair.</P>

Tá a lán obair le déanamh chun na Gaeilge a mhéadú ar fud na tíre agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don nGaeltacht. Bhí fadhb ag Fine Gael le halt 32 agus athraíodh é agus tá muid an-sásta leis sin. Tá mé féin agus Fine Gael dóchasach go dtosóidh an Bille seo an obair agus go mbeidh an Gaeilge ag méadú mar gheall ar an mBhille.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom glacadh leis an deis seo chun tréaslú leis an Aire. Mar a dúirt sé, bhí an-chuid oibre i gceist ó thús go deireadh. Bhí 39 leasuithe ar fad &ndash; is ionann sin agus a rá go raibh an tAire ag éisteacht go géar le gach tuairim agus comhairle. Bhí sin thar a bheith tábhachtach mar is rud amháin é Acht a bheith ann agus rud eile ar fad é a chur i bhfeidhm agus dul chun cinn a fháil as.</P>
      <P>Tá meascán an-chiallmhar agus an-phraicticiúil anseo de dea-thoil ar an lámh amháin agus dualgas ar an lámh eile agus sin mar ba chóir. Dúradh go minic sna díospóireachtaí a bhí againn go bhfuil an dea-thoil sin go forleathan anois agus tá sé tábhachtach agus riachtanach má tá muid i ndáiríre maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge bheith in ann tógáil ar an deá-thoil sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí daoine ann a bhí in amhras le tamall nach mbeadh a leithéid de Bhille ann i riamh. Mar a tharlaíonn go minic, ní raibh an ceart acu faoi seo mar is caipéis stairiúil seo agus tá sé ag teacht <Col N="1800" />díreach in am mar ní leor dea-thoil, caithfimid a bheith dírithe níos mó ar an sprioc. Sa chás seo, tá an chabhair le fáil sa mBille.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaím le lucht an Fhreasúra mar ní raibh aon dhíospóireacht faoi seo pearsanta agus ní raibh aon nimhneas ag baint leis, rud a chruthaigh go bhfuil formhór muintir na hÉireann ar thaobh na Gaeilge, níos mó anois ná i riamh. Bhí an Freasúra thar a bheith cabhrach i ngach díospóireacht.</P>
    <P>Níl aon amhras gur sheas na heagrais deonacha an fód le blianta fada anuas ar son na Gaeilge. Thaispeáin siad cé chomh misniúil agus a bhí siad nuair nach raibh siad sásta le rudaí sa mBille gur chuir siad cabhair agus comhairle chugainn. Éinne atá praiciticiúil faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge, beidh sé sásta go bhfuil an Bille seo ann. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ar chumas an Aire bheith fláithiúil leis na heagrais céanna. Aon airgead atá caite ar chur chun cinn na Gaeilge, is airgead ar son na Gaeilge é mar tá torthaí le feiceáil ar an obair sin.</P>
    <P>Tréaslaím leis na hoifigigh. Is rud amháin é litir a scríobh ach nuair atá muid ag obair ar chaipéis agus bunús dlí ag baint leis, caithfear é a léamh agus a athrú arís agus arís eile. Beidh sé deacair ar éinne aon locht a fháil ar an mBille seo. Beidh muid ag teacht ar ais dó i gceann cúig bliana ar aon nós.</P>
    <P>An rud is tábhachtaí ná an bhfuil muid go léir sásta úsáid a bhaint as na seansanna a bheidh againn anois? Sin an príomhrud. Is minic a chuirtear ceist ar duine an ndéanann sé a chuid ghnó trí Ghaeilge le Aonad 88, agus daoine atá an-bháúil don nGaeilge, ní úsáideann siad áis den sort sin. Chuala mé le déanaí go mbeidh an tseirbhís ag Aonad 88 a leathnú amach sna hoifigigh reigiúnacha freisin. Rinne an tAire lainseáil agus chuir sé poiblíochta ar an choimisiún logainmneacha so tá dul chun cinn ann chuile lá anois. Más féidir linn go léir bheith ag obair as lámh a chéile, bheith aontaithe mar fhoireann, agus treoir a thabhairt don bpobal i gcoitinne, beimid in ann dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Aon obair atá le déanamh faoin mBille, tá práinn ag dul leis. Thabharfadh na díospóireachtaí sna Tithe dóchas do dhuine mar ní raibh aon droch-thoil a léiriú. Ní bheadh an scéal amhlaidh sna 1950í agus 1960í. Bhí sé soiléir go bhfuil daoine taobh thiar den Ghaeilge agus caithfidh muid an obair seo a dhéanamh go práinneach mar gheall air sin.</P>
    <P>Bhí an t-ádh linn go bhfuil an tAire Éamon Ó Cuív againn mar threoraí sa mBille. Níl éinne eile a bheadh in ann leanúint leis mar a rinne sé agus a shúil ar chroí an scéil i gcónaí toisc den ghrá, taithí, eolas agus tuiscint atá aige ar fhealsúnacht na Gaeilge. Molaim an tAire agus gach duine a chabhraigh críoch a chur leis an obair seo.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. This matter concerns Wandesford national school, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. The principal recently wrote to me to inform me of the circumstances that currently exist in the school, where, for 35 years, a prefab has been used as accommodation for some of the pupils. It is an unusual school in that it is one of only two Church of Ireland schools in County Kilkenny; there are not too many Church of Ireland national schools in the rest of the country. It caters for approximately 60 students, mainly from Kilkenny but also from Laois and Carlow. The school has applied for a new school building due to overcrowding for the past number of years and it wishes to know at what stage its application stands. I am interested to hear the official departmental response to the request for this badly needed new school.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a glacadh leis an Seanadóir as ucht an cheist a ardú. I thank the Senator for raising this matter. I also thank him for being brief and I hope I come to the point equally quickly. The Minister for Education and Science decided to publish the 2003 school building programme on the Department's website to give the maximum amount of information concerning the school's capital investment programme to managers, boards of management, principals, parents, students and all other interested parties. The criteria used for selecting projects were also published for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application was received from Wandesford <Col N="1802" />Church of Ireland national school, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny, in May 2001. Following this application the planning section within the Department of Education and Science carried out an assessment of the staffing requirements of the school. It concluded that the school has a long-term accommodation need for staffing of a principal, two assistants and one shared remedial teacher. Subsequently, an architectural condition survey was carried out on the school by staff from the Department's building unit.</P>
    <P>However, as stated in the 2003 capital programme, the Department of Education and Science does not intend to allow further large-scale projects into architectural planning during 2003. The timing of when individual projects can progress to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress with existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. In the meantime, individual schools should use their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety works. I regret that I cannot give the Senator any further information.</P>

      <P>I raise the issue of Scoil Áine in Clondalkin as I have been contacted by parents concerned about the necessary repairs to classrooms in the school. The school has been the subject of a report of the Health and Safety Authority. Parents are concerned that if the school does not soon get funding to carry out the repairs it could be liable to prosecution. A local newspaper recently mentioned that funding had been approved and I raise this Adjournment Matter to establish the position.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. As I said in response to the previous matter, the Minister has published the list on the website and information is available as to how selections are made. Scoil Áine and Scoil Íde both share the one school site. The buildings were constructed in the early 1970s. Each school consists of a separate two-storey structure and both share a general purpose room. Scoil Áine and Scoil Íde also share a heating system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the problems with the heating system at the schools, I am pleased to inform the Senator that the Department of Education and Science has recently agreed to provide grant aid towards a major refurbishment of the heating system. The school authorities were authorised to invite tenders for this project. Subject to the outcome of the tendering process, it is anticipated that the refurbishment works will get underway shortly. This project is being funded from the contingency sum for emergencies that was included in the building programme. I also add that the Department has also approved grant aid <Col N="1803" />for some small-scale roof repair works at Scoil Áine in this year's programme.</P>
    <P>The Senator is lucky; she is the last person to raise an Adjournment Matter in the Seanad this <Col N="1804" />session and the good wine was left to last. I am delighted that we can allow somebody to go home happy this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 2.15 p.m. <i>sine die.</i></P>
