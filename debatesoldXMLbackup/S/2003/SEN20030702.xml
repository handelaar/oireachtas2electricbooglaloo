    <Title>Business of Seanad.</Title>
    <P>An Cathaoirleach: I have received notice from Senator Browne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the progress of the national road network including cost projections, overruns and projected completion times as promised in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to review the decision of a three year capping period and not mainstreaming community employment jobs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Minihan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the current position regarding the future of the Cork School of Music in view of the Taoiseach's comments in Cork on Thursday, 26 June and the efforts that are being made to ensure completion of the new school of music during Cork's year as European capital of culture in 2005.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline his proposals to rectify television reception in the south Longford-Roscommon-Lanesboro area as RTÉ 1, Network 2 and T na G have not been visible for the past four months in the area.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Browne, Minihan and Leyden as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the <Col N="1538" />conclusion of business. I regret that I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Bannon as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bannon: He takes the licence fee all the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Tragically, we and the public realise that the penalty points system is not working. The slaughter on the roads over the weekend and the significant increase in road deaths for the months of May and June is an appalling indication of the failure of the penalty points system. We have to point the finger fairly and squarely at Ministers, despite their laudable efforts to take action. The Government has failed to provide the manpower and resources necessary to allow the Garda do its work. People have reverted to their <Col N="1539" />old ways of speeding, bringing great tragedy to many families.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Leader bring the message to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, that it is absolutely essential, as we move towards high season of tourism when there will be more motorists on the road, that adequate resources and manpower should be made available. The fact that there are only 125 gardaí dedicated to road traffic duties at any given time is a clear indication that all the spin from the two Ministers regarding their commitment to road safety is just that. Resources and manpower are not put in place to back up the spin with reality. Until such time as resources are available, we will have the continuing tragedy of road deaths.</P>
      <P>We were promised an extra 2,000 gardaí during the lifetime of the Government. Where is there any indication that it is taking steps to meet its commitment on this very important issue? There is even a failure to provide technology for the Garda to put in place a proper campaign against road deaths and speeding motorists. I ask the Leader as a matter of urgency to highlight to both Ministers that the time for spin is over and that there must now be action. We all look forward to seeing the number of road deaths substantially reduced, as was the case for the first few months of this year. Now we have reverted, and it is time for action.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should bring to the notice of the Leader the fact that in the BMW region there was an underspend of &euro;644 million in the first three years of the NDP. Surely this is another indication of the total lack of commitment of the Government to the region. The disparity between the economic ratings of the east and west is not narrowing but widening. There is verification in all of the reports. It is unfortunate that an area so deprived in the past is now suffering because, despite the resources having been made available under the NDP, they are not being spent during the plan's lifetime. I call on the Minister concerned to make an effort for the remaining three years in all areas, including infrastructure, agriculture and social inclusion, to close the yawning gap between the economic standing of the east and the west. The money must be spent in allowing the west's infrastructure to catch up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we do. I would like to get back to more serious matters, for the issue raised by Senator Ulick Burke is very serious. I would like to join in what I understand to be his call for a major debate on transport and traffic. However, it is unrealistic to expect this before the autumn. We should plan now to have a major debate in this House then.</P>
      <P>The problem is not simply a failure of Government, for that is too easy. There is a responsibility on the part of drivers. The reason people are being killed is that there is too much careless driving. We can assist. It has been said in this House that we must have consistency in speed limits. People will regard them with contempt if, as happens on one of the main motorways into Dublin city, one drops within a matter of seconds from a limit of 70 kph to 50 kph on precisely the same road. We must have a little coherence. I know there are difficulties and that it might need legislation. Perhaps we should examine having an overall regulatory authority to avoid having to deal with a whole scatter of county councils. One needs consistency and coherence if one is to get people to respect such matters.</P>
      <P>We must also examine the situation in Dublin. The infrastructure is being used as a method of attacking citizens. We closed O'Connell Street to all traffic except pubic transport. Now we have one lane in Gardiner Street into Dublin city from the north side, which is absolutely idiotic. Can we have the Minister attend in the autumn to explain the facts about the metro and the Luas, including the incompatibility of the lines and gauges and the fact that they now appear to be demolishing the ramp at Amiens Street Station at a cost estimated as being between &euro;30 million and &euro;60 million? For what? It is all absolute nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I might raise a second very serious matter that should be examined calmly in this House. I know that we have discussed the health service but we were all moved by the death of a small girl with a heart condition. I compliment the surgeon who spoke this morning, who was extremely fair and balanced. He said the death <Col N="1541" />had not been anticipated. Unfortunately, such things happen as mortality is part of the human condition. I send my sympathy to the parents of that small girl.</P>
    <P>That very tragic situation affords the opportunity for a calm and balanced review rather than partisan point-scoring. I know that matters need to be examined such as the capping of nurse numbers. Perhaps we might look at staffing, which the surgeon said was a problem. They had enough beds and the other facilities but they did not have the nurses. He spoke of the wonderful work of the Filipino nurses but I know from them that some are leaving, not just for financial reasons but because they are not permitted under the law to have their spouses with them and able to work. That simple legislative change might help transform matters.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic when people say, as I heard someone say today, that we should demolish the hospital and build a perfectly new one because it is 50 years old. A hospital built in 1850 would not have been demolished in 1900 simply because it was old. We must look at such issues in a very careful and balanced way. For that reason we should have a debate on the issue.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might ask one technical question. An amendment has been tabled this evening but it does not seem to clash at all with the Government motion. Could we not have a little co-operation between the two main parties and have a composite motion which would strengthen the Government's hand with regard to Sellafield?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to ask the Leader about the first two matters. While I have no great objection to them, I do not know enough about them, which is the point I wish to make. Motions are introduced, referred to a committee and brought back having been discussed by it. However, there is no mechanism of which I am aware whereby I or any other Member of this House can find out what the committee thought, said or did about them. I have no problem with the committees but surely the Houses of the Oireachtas ought to know what is happening <Col N="1542" />about all these matters. I ask the Leader to indicate a method.</P>
      <P>The Government may celebrate this but many on this side of the House will not: we have reached an historic moment, for the average price of a new house is now &euro;250,000. If ever there was a measure of Government failure, it is the decision, either deliberate or taken through ineptitude, to price a huge number of working families out of the housing market, or else impose on them a heavy burden of debt. It is worth mentioning today that we have now reached an historic moment regarding the average price of a new house.</P>
      <P>As nobody else seems to have raised it, I ask the Leader, a formidable person in her own right, to find out what exactly went on between Mr. Justice Feargus Flood and the Government. For example, is the correspondence that was published yesterday all the correspondence? The Government has filleted the Freedom of Information Act so we will only know what it chooses to give us. That is a fact. Is that all the correspondence? </P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best not to react. When did the Taoiseach know about it? If he knew as far back as it now appears, why did he not tell anybody? Why did he not tell his colleagues in Government, the Progressive Democrats and, more particularly, why did he not tell the Dáil? These are serious questions about a most important issue and there is a classical fudge from the Taoiseach about what happened.</P>
      <P>This House was an equal party with the other House in setting up that tribunal. Let us remember it was set up following a vote of both Houses of the Oireachtas. We are as entitled as the other House to know what is going on and I ask the Leader to find out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Criminal Court came into operation on 1 July. So far the United States has prevailed upon 44 countries publicly to say they will not prosecute US citizens before the ICC. These were the figures given this morning by the media. Seven countries have secretly agreed. Can I have an assurance that Ireland is not one of the seven secret countries that have agreed that under no circumstance will it refer US citizens to <Col N="1543" />the International Criminal Court? I am sure we are not, but after recent events in Iraq one is never certain of anything.</P>
    <P>I compliment the six brave European countries which came under enormous pressure to sign up to the refusal to implement international law and who are all NATO applicants. Perhaps old Europe and new Europe are reaching an identical view on the world and it is a good thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to highlight the issue of organised crime. I recognise there will not be time between now and Friday for a debate on the matter but perhaps she will contact the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There has been much debate here in recent months on crime and public order offences. To some extent organised crime has gone off the agenda but it has not gone away. This was highlighted over the weekend when we discovered that a journalist from the <i>Sunday World </i>has been intimidated by organised criminals. He and his family are under Garda protection as a result of a threat to their life. This is outrageous.</P>
      <P>This House and the other House acted swiftly in the wake of the murder of Veronica Guerin by similar people by enacting legislation to ensure these people were put out of business. Unfortunately, a void seems to have developed, allowing a similar group or groups to operate with impunity and to contemplate perpetrating a similarly heinous crime. It is incumbent on all of us to ensure something like that can never happen again, to ensure the freedom of the press is maintained and that this type of intimidation is ended.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Transport appears to be the theme today, having been raised by Senators Ulick Burke and Norris. Senator Norris rightly referred to the slow progress of the Luas project and the wholesale disruption caused by it and raised questions on the metro. The contract for the operation of Luas has been awarded to a firm known as Connex. Commuters will have been dismayed to learn over the weekend that Connex, which has also been running part of the British rail system, has had its contract axed by the Strategic Rail Authority. How the Minister for Transport can continue to exude confidence in a company which has had its contract axed in Britain is beyond me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should exhort the Minister to examine, as a matter of urgency, the contract between a company which has been axed in Britain and which is to run our still embryonic Luas project. The Minister would be well advised to meet with the Strategic Rail Authority in Britain to find out exactly what happened and what is the problem in relation to the manner in <Col N="1544" />which they have obviously made a mess of the British system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in asking the Leader for a debate on transport and the penalty points system in the new session. I reject the claims by Senator Ulick Burke that it is a failure of Government on the basis that the penalty points system to date has shown that the number of fatalities on our roads is down by 50 in the year to date.</P>
      <P>While I regret very much the terrible carnage on our roads at the weekend, there is a case to be made for the Garda to refocus its efforts given that the cameras and speed traps are predominately on the widest stretches of road, on dual carriageways and bypasses. If the focus was more on rural Ireland and the smaller roads where accidents take place there would be a genuine chance to reduce the number of accidents.</P>
      <P>I condemn the Irish Insurance Federation who consistently move the goalposts. The penalty points system has shown that the number of deaths has been reduced and that this has saved these companies millions of euro, yet we read in today's newspaper that they are moving the goalposts and are looking for sustained enforcement. This is not acceptable. I condemn them as a whole but commend Hibernian which has committed to do it. For the most part, insurance companies will not reduce insurance premiums. This is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>May I make one comment on the Crumlin Hospital case? During the debate on health I said how bad morale was among the staff of the health service at present. This tragic case will have a devastating effect on the nurses in particular who are in close contact with patients and we will lose even more of them.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the Department of Transport. When the former Senator Máirín Quill was in the House she commented frequently on the reports and surveys which came before the House and wondered what value they were.</P>
      <P>Yesterday afternoon I was contacted by a young lady from England who was doing a survey for the Department of Transport here. I asked why an Irish company was not doing the survey and she said that because there was so much business it had to be farmed out to England. The young lady asked me questions such as: Did I agree slightly, disagree slightly, agree strongly, disagree strongly that I got promptness of reply, competence of handling of complaints, focused organisation? Am I treated as an important person? Am I happy with the quality of service received? Did I have trouble contacting staff by e-mail? It went on and on.</P>

      <P>We are looking for black holes in the health service where money is being wasted, but what sort of waste of money is this exercise? I said I thought the whole exercise was pointless. She asked how many people I employ: two half people. I asked where she got my name and she replied from the Department of Transport. What is the Department of Transport doing carrying out surveys like this? What is the cost of this survey? When we have the debate on the Department of Transport, could we kindly ask why it is carrying out fruitless exercises such as this one? I have not contacted the Department of Transport for years but I have contacted the National Roads Authority. What are we doing in carrying out such surveys? I wish the former Senator Máirín Quill was back here so that she could comment on it.</P>

      <P>I support the suggestion from Senator Ryan. When orders are placed before the House it would be helpful if they were available for consultation outside with perhaps a short summary note on what they are about. The Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service discussed the Civil Service code of conduct but it would be fair to inform the House about these matters in case anybody wishes to raise a point.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Senator Ryan said, it is not necessarily the duty of Government to bring all problems in their raw state immediately to the Oireachtas. The job of Government is to bring solutions to the Oireachtas for discussion.</P>
      <P>I also support the calls of Senators Ulick Burke and Norris for a discussion on transport in the autumn. It is far too early to jump to conclusions and write off the penalty points system.</P>
      <P>The issue of Connex was raised. There is a big difference between running a new transport system and a vast, dilapidated, suburban one in south-east England. One must look critically at the assumption made that a private system is always more efficient than a public one. I have no ideological presupposition in regard to either.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Connolly Station, as a passenger, I would not appreciate being dumped 150 yards from the station entrance, particularly with luggage. It is necessary that the tramway should run to the door.</P>

      <P>In the light of recent announcements regarding job losses and the alarming rate at which we learn of companies and organisations going to the wall, I ask the Leader to bring the Tánaiste into the House to explain the situation. In recent days 50 jobs were lost in Macroom, County Cork when a well established bakery <Col N="1546" />unfortunately ceased operations. We want the Tánaiste to tell us the reason the jobs announced for Macroom prior to the general election to replace the 300 plus lost in the General Semi-Conductor plant, and the 113 jobs promised for Dunmanway, have not materialised. If the jobs came to the country, where did they go? How does the Tánaiste intend to deal with the current disgraceful situation where we are haemorrhaging jobs at an alarming rate?</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to come to the Seanad before the end of the session? The strength of the euro and the weakening dollar and sterling are creating a crisis for indigenous industry. We saw the effect it had on Navan Carpets. I predict the situation will worsen for indigenous companies exporting to the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is meeting Prime Minister Blair today, I would appreciate it if the Leader could arrange for him to come to the House to discuss those talks before the end of the session. I wish to inform Members that the Joint Committee on Transport, which will be attended by members of the RPA, is meeting at 7 p.m. this evening. It would be a good idea if Members attended and heard directly the correct position of the RPA.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on transport in the autumn. The issue of right of redress is a concern, especially in the case of fixed speed cameras. People should have the right to question fines or penalty points imposed. Yesterday representatives of the Irish Insurance Federation attended a joint committee. They blamed the Government for the delay in making reductions in insurance premiums because the legislation due had not been processed. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade <Col N="1547" />and Employment when the legislation will come before the Houses and when will we see a reduction in the crippling insurance costs affecting people around the country?</P>
      <P>As we have a light schedule tomorrow, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on housing. The changes in the planning Act have done away with the figure of 20% for social housing and are having a huge effect in urban areas, particularly Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, was in Galway on Monday and announced a rural transport initiative for south-east Galway, the first in the county. He also announced two quality bus corridors in Galway city, which I welcome. I have raised the issue of the railway strategy report previously. If the part of the report dealing with Galway city could be brought forward, particularly as it relates to commuter traffic from the north, south and east of the country, it would be of benefit and deal with the problem of congestion in the city. I am not prepared to wait for 20 years, as suggested by the rail review, for this to be done. We must work on it now, starting with commuter traffic. I hope we will have a debate on the issue soon.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I raised the subject of selling tobacco to under age persons. As soon as I returned to my office, I discovered an e-mail from the company to which I had referred which stated that in regard to the price of cigarettes, there was clearly no control on under age selling. The company claims to be selling tobacco into Ireland legally at a lower price. I do not know how to handle this. However, we must draw to the Minister's attention that it is something about which we must do something right away. We do not need a debate but must see what we can do. It is outrageous that we can pass laws to protect health, particularly the health of young people, and that it is possible to override them from outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with all that has been said about the horrific deaths on our roads. The problem is not likely to be solved by a debate but there are things the Government can do immediately, one of which was raised recently in this House. Penalty points, north and south of the Border, should be amalgamated. The road between Belfast and Dublin is one of the most horrific for deaths but penalty points in the North only apply there and those in the South only apply here. I read in the <Col N="1548" />newspapers that the Minister may be able to do something about this and that talks were taking place in order that penalty points would apply in all of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are in excess of 250,000 provisional licence holders on our roads. This is a problem about which we can do something immediately. It takes six months to get a test appointment in certain parts of the country. We can do something about this by banning provisional licence holders who have not passed a test from our roads. These are steps a Government could take without debate.</P>

      <P>Since yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, represents the European Union under a system whereby the relevant Ministers of the former Presidency, the current Presidency and the future Presidency represent the European Union. I wish the Minister well in that regard because it enhances and improves Ireland's international image. Will the Leader consider having a debate in the autumn, midway through the Troika of Foreign Ministers? I wish the Minister well in that regard because it enhances Ireland's international image. I am sure the House will join me in commending the initiative taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the Middle East in the last week. He has made a major contribution to reducing tension in the area by bringing to bear his enormous experience of conflict resolution.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Ulick Burke in regard to his call for action on road safety. We are all aware of recent appalling incidents on our roads and it is important that action is taken.</P>

    <P>The transport issue seems to be the order of the day and I join other Senators in their requests for a debate on the matter. It would be wrong of us to send the message that we are decrying the introduction of penalty points since it has been <Col N="1549" />an effective and worthwhile initiative and is acknowledged as such by everyone. There may well be an enforcement issue, which comes down to two aspects.</P>

      <P>One is resources and the other is quality of management. Will the Leader arrange an early debate on transport? The Department of Transport has been doing a good job since its establishment 12 months ago under the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Brennan. I particularly commend his efforts to inject competition into a wide area of the public service. This House should, in a united fashion, strongly condemn efforts by a certain section within the public service to commandeer the assets of a company in order to provide free services. If that situation happened in the private sector, the company would close and the people involved would be sacked. It is unacceptable. Partnership has stood us in good stead over the last 16 years. However, if this is the price of partnership, we must seriously review if it is worthwhile.</P>

I agree with other Senators that he was extremely fair in what he said. I welcome the inquiry by the Minister for Health and Children into this serious and important matter. It is worth pointing out that, over the last number of weeks in Crumlin hospital, 25 beds have closed, chemotherapy has been regularly deferred for small children with cancer and the conditions of the buildings are so inadequate that senior staff are moving to a prefab in order to allow their space to be developed for essential services within the hospital. It is critical that we examine this as a matter of public policy because ICU nurses are simply not available in Crumlin and Mr. Woods said that such an incident could happen again. It is not good enough and cannot continue.</P>

      <P>The acting leader of the Opposition today, Senator Ulick Burke, referred to what he called the failure of the Government to provide resources which has led to an increase in road deaths. The biggest challenge in this regard is for individuals &ndash; those who get behind the wheel of a car and pedestrians &ndash; to take responsibility for their own conduct on the roads. There is no doubt that people have become careless. It used to be the case that when one drove within the speed limit, no one attempted to overtake because everyone was travelling at that speed. However, people are now overtaking again with great gusto. Carelessness has set in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also referred to what he referred to as the &euro;640 million underspend in the BMW region. The money is not put in a box labelled &ldquo;NDP&rdquo; and taken out when it is needed, rather <Col N="1550" />it is part of the budgetary arrangements, which is reflected in the situation to which the Senator referred.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris spoke about dual-carriageway confusion. I acknowledge that such a condition exists. I do not know how one is supposed to reduce speed from 70 mph to 50 mph from the point at which one sees the sign looming and then increase to 70 mph again. It seems disruptive and I am sure it leads to confusion in people's minds.</P>
    <P>The Senator also expressed sympathy to the parents of the young child who died and referred to the manner in which the specialist dealt with the matter in his interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning. I agree that he displayed great sympathy and consideration. I hope we will be able to merge our motions for tonight's debate, as the Senator suggested. That possibility has been in my mind and I hope to speak to the leaders of the parties. However, the Senator is not a leader. He is a representative.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan referred to the manner in which we take motions in the House. I do not like reading out every day that motions are to be taken without debate. However, the motions are from two joint committees and I assume some Senators attend and are members of such committees.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan and Senator Mansergh had a fair point when they requested written conclusions from such committees which could be left on the table in the Seanad ante-room. Therefore, it is peremptory of me to say that there will be no debate. I will follow up on the matter and request written conclusions from the committees.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also asked if I knew what went on between Mr. Justice Feargus Flood and the Taoiseach. The Government Chief Whip made a clear statement on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; in this regard this morning. It appears that the judge did not want the situation to be made public until a particular point. However, I know no more than the Senator about this issue. All such matters become heightened by debate when there are often ordinary explanations for them. There will be a debate in regard to the new chairman of the Flood tribunal in the House on Friday, when I am sure we will get explanations. The Senator also asked about the seven countries which did not want to sign up to the International Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dooley made a clear point in regard to organised crime not having gone away. There are so many people looking for debates in the aut<Col N="1551" />umn that I am thinking we might sit for an extra week in order to encompass them all.</P>

      <P>Senator Higgins and Senator White requested that Connex and the Strategic Rail Authority in the UK speak to the Minister for Transport about what happened in regard to the former's contract. There is a debate at 7 p.m. tonight, which all Members of the Oireachtas may attend. I received notification of the meeting from Senator Dooley, who is a member of that committee. All Senators may attend the meeting and hear the questions teased out and it would be good for them to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator MacSharry referred to the penalty points system. As he said, the Irish Insurance Federation has been very quick to state it will not give reductions in insurance premiums, even though there is clear evidence that there has been a reduction in the number of road traffic accident fatalities. The federation appears to be reluctant to offer reductions in insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the issues of morale in the health service and also this daft survey in which she has been invited to participate. We often receive telephone calls asking us to participate in surveys. I usually respond by saying I am too busy. The surveys ask such questions as how many people one employs.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh echoed what Senator Ryan said and agreed with the need for a debate on transport, Connex and Connolly Station. I hope we will have a major debate on this topic when we return after the summer.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy raised the job losses in Macroom and Dunmanway, both of which are areas that have suffered. Senator White requested that, before the end of the session, the Tánaiste attend a debate on the state of indigenous industry. I understand the Tánaiste is not well and will not be able to attend. The Senator also asked if the Taoiseach could attend a debate in the House on his meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. I am still pursuing this.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne requested a debate on transport in general and the two pieces of legislation due in this area. He also requested a debate on housing. He suggested Thursday when business would be slack. It is not, because I hope to keep it free for the Taoiseach to attend a debate, if I manage to arrange it. It is a remote possibility at this stage. Senator Kitt said Galway had received good news about transport but he wants more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the issue of an e-mail he <Col N="1552" />received yesterday. I also received it and asked my colleagues if they had but they appear not to have. The e-mail offers delivery of under-priced cigarettes to one's home. I do not know if that is proper or correct. The Senator also raised the issue of deaths on the roads and the fact that 250,000 people are driving on provisional licences. That is indicative but they could not be removed immediately from the roads because it must be asked how they would go about their business otherwise. A huge backlog of people await assessment of their ability to drive.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of the Troika of Foreign Ministers and said I would know of this from my experience as a Minister. The Senator praised the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, for his actions in the Middle East last week. We took the opportunity in the Seanad to pass a vote of congratulations to him. I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon wants those who paid the &euro;20 fee for planning objections judged by the European Union to be incorrect to be reimbursed. Senator Jim Walsh requested a transport debate which I hope we can have. He also referred to State employees commandeering assets and that, if this was the result of partnership, he did not want it. I must speak to the Senator about this because I do not know to whom he referred.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to conditions in Crumlin Children's Hospital. I note that a specialist said that, when the new operating theatres were in place, they would make a huge change to how procedures were carried out, but that there were still problems with cancer facilities and in other areas. The Government is working on a plan for the hospital. The sooner it happens, the better.</P>

    <Title>Forfás Consumer Pricing Report 2003: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted that the Forfás report studied the inflation figures to the end of the year in January 2003 when the annual inflation rate was 4.8%. The latest figures from the Central Statistics Office for May show a sharp fall in inflation to 3.7%, down from 4.3% in April. Notwithstanding this welcome downward trend, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have clearly indicated that the Government's target is to reduce inflation to 2%. An anti-inflation group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, has been convened under the new national agreement, Sustaining Progress, and will draw up and monitor progress on a detailed action plan on inflation. One of my officials is actively participating in this group which has met three times and is due to meet shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to bringing about more competitive pricing throughout the economy by facilitating increased competition. To this end, the powers of the Competition Authority to investigate price fixing and other anti-competitive practices have been strengthened. The authority is conducting extensive examinations of the insurance and banking industries as well as many professional services, including the legal and medical professions.</P>
      <P>For competition to be effective, I am aware that consumers must be given sufficient information to enable them to compare prices. In this regard, new price display regulations came into operation this spring, namely, the European Communities (Requirement to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002, SI 639 of 2002, which clarify and underline the obligations of retailers and other traders to display legible and transparent information on prices to consumers.</P>
      <P>I also see a key role for the consumer lobby in Ireland. I urge consumers to raise their concerns regarding prices directly with retailers and suppliers and to be prepared to be assertive in shopping elsewhere if they are unhappy with the prices they pay. To assist the consumer lobby, as provided for in the 2001 budget, my Department oversees payment of an Exchequer grant to the Consumers Association of Ireland of &euro;63,000 per annum, the purpose of which is to enhance the capacity of the association to act as a consumer watchdog and advisory body and represent consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commentators have referred to Government charges constituting a large portion of the increases identified in the report. Some say such increases amounted to 50% of the total increase. Government charges did not account for more than 50% of inflation in the past year. As the Forfás report clearly states, the Government influenced category includes excisable products where <Col N="1554" />price increases have occurred without an increase in excise duties. A significant proportion of the contribution was due to increased tobacco duties, which were more than justified.</P>
    <P>I accept that inflation is a problem and that all businesses are affected by inflationary pressures. The disequilibrium between our inflation level and levels elsewhere in Europe has the potential to undermine our internationally traded sectors, in particular, and put at risk employment and growth. I, therefore, welcome the sharp decrease in annual inflation to 3.7% in May.</P>
    <P>The key to reducing inflation is to improve competitiveness. The Government is already taking measures to improve our competitiveness in key areas. These include strengthening competition throughout the economy, implementing specific measures to tackle cost pressures in key areas such as insurance, increasing investment in research, technology and innovation which will provide the basis for future growth in productivity, and continuing to invest in key infrastructure such as broadband telecommunications. On the specific issue of enterprise competitiveness, Enterprise Ireland has recently introduced a special competitiveness fund designed to help firms improve productivity and strengthen their overall competitiveness.</P>
    <P>All economic stakeholders have their responsibilities in tackling inflationary pressures. The Government, for its part, will meet its responsibilities and its actions will be informed by advice from, for example, the National Competitiveness Council, as manifested in its recent statement on inflation, and by the anti-inflation initiative provided for under the national agreement, Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>The Government is dealing with the important issue of high insurance premia. The Tánaiste is undertaking specific measures to address the issue, such as the implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board action plan within a target timeframe and the establishment of the personal injuries assessment board. The chairperson and ordinary members of an interim PIAB board were appointed on 27 November 2002. The Government recently approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the PIAB on a statutory footing and it is hoped to enact the legislation by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Competition Authority, is undertaking a study into insurance. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004. The Government is also taking action in a number of other areas to help tackle the high cost of insurance. This includes action in the areas of road safety and driver behaviour, reform of the law in relation to personal injury claims, including supporting of claims by sworn affidavits, and in the area of advertising by solicitors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" />The Forfás report is a valuable contribution to public debate on issues relating to inflation. It underlines the importance of the commitment of the Government and the social partners to tackling inflation and monitoring our competitiveness. I assure the House that the Government will meet its commitments under the social partnership agreement in all the policy areas concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He is a well-meaning man but he is on a sticky wicket today.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister of State refer to recent comments. Sadly for him, comments about Government charges constituting a large proportion of the increases identified in the Forfás report are true. I welcome the fact, however, that the Minister of State recognises the problems inflation is causing for businesses across the State. The days of the economic boom are sadly gone and we are slipping in the competitiveness rankings.</P>
      <P>The private sector wants the Government inflation monkey off its back. I wish the Minister of State well in the measures he is putting in place to tackle it, but this is an appalling situation. The National Competitiveness Council has identified the Government contribution to the inflation figure as the largest single factor driving high prices. It contributes between five and six times the share of the inflation figure compared to other EU governments. Across the European Union, the average government contribution to inflation figures is 0.4% while in Ireland stealth taxes and increases in charges add more than 2% to the figure. The private sector is hamstrung by these charges and consumers are being made to pay the increased prices. If Government increases were removed, Irish inflation would be below the EU average.</P>
      <P>The Government increases are undermining our competitiveness on a daily basis and the slide must be halted. Those increases have had a major impact on jobs. Each week since the Government entered office, 600 people have been added to the live register and each day we hear of more job losses, the causes of which can be traced back to reckless inflationary Government policy. None of the factors that brought about a reduction in inflation stemmed from Government action. Any fall in the costs of goods or mortgages has only served to highlight the stark contrasts with the impact created by the Government. The CSO has confirmed that the contribution to the May inflation rate by the Government is over 60% of the entire increase. Increases in indirect taxes alone account for almost 40% of the rise in inflation over the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of other Government decisions on pricing policy has also been clearly illustrated. The cost of third level education has risen by 12.1%, bus fares are up by 13.3%, rail fares by 11%, motor tax by 11.9% and health insurance <Col N="1556" />by 18.7% &ndash; it was announced on Monday that is to increase further &ndash; while dental services have risen in cost by 11.4%, electricity by 13.7% and water and sewerage charges by nearly 20%. The traded sector is suffering a severe squeeze. The prices Irish manufacturers are getting for their products fell by 7.5% in the last 12 months. By contrast, almost all their costs have increased, particularly those costs imposed by Government. The implication is clear &ndash; the Government must get its house in order.</P>
    <P>That is why I said this well-meaning Minister of State is on a sticky wicket. He has a difficult position to defend today and I hope some good comes from his well-intentioned actions. It behoves us all to wish him well in that regard. However, the Government has clearly failed to deliver services efficiently at a competitive cost &ndash; there is no denying that. It has lost sight of the crucial requirements for price competitiveness. There are continuing concerns about the extent to which cuts in prices at the factory gates are being passed on in shops. Manufacturers are clearly protecting their margins by not giving the price reduction on sales in the domestic market that they apply to their export sales. Export prices fell by 10% while prices in the home market increased by 1.4% in the last year.</P>
    <P>The Government is responsible for more than half the current inflation figure. Too much money was squandered before the election last year and economic indicators of the approaching downturn sadly were ignored. The Minister for Finance gave assurances that all was well and that no cut backs were planned. We know what has happened since. The Government did nothing to ensure value for money and, as a result, it has nothing to show for its reckless indulgence. No attempt was made to reform the public service when the funds were available and now we are facing the consequences. We lack the infrastructure to attract and sustain foreign investment and congestion brings our towns and cities to a standstill each day.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister of State have something to say? This is like speaking on the Order of Business.</P>

      <P>Another major problem for us is that we do not have an adequate waste management system and our broadband facilities are below those of other countries. We have a huge problem across the board with competitiveness. Strengthening this area will be difficult. We are out of line with all our trading partners and very much behind with regard to the improvements that are necessary in infrastructure, regulation and taxation, education, innovation, entrepreneurship and management development. Because of the huge imposition of costs on everyone involved in business, productivity is proving very difficult but it is an area we have to support.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister of State said and hope it will work. However, because of what we have witnessed, it is difficult to have confidence in the measures, although I wish them well. Indirect Government taxes are contributing 1.4% to the consumer price index. Government administered price increases are adding an additional 1.3%. If the Government was not pursuing these policies, inflation would now be at 1.6%, which would put us comfortably below the EU average. Instead, the latest comparisons show that Ireland's inflation rate is over double the average EU rate.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge that the Celtic tiger economy is over. Irish competitiveness is very much under pressure. We have also had pressure from the OECD. Most of the problems undermining Irish competitiveness come from Government or Government related sectors. Value for money was the first casualty of the Government's spending frenzy, which saw a surplus of &euro;5 billion blown away in 2000. The OECD illustrates how basic systems of public expenditure management were allowed to rust. The sheer simplicity of its recommendations illustrates just how much damage was done without financial prudence in those heady spending years. As we know, grandiose projects were not properly evaluated. Outcomes matter as much as inputs, an area to which we did not pay attention. Costings should be accurate and properly controlled but, sadly, they were not. We have been creating layer upon layer of administration that does not and has not delivered quality services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed regarding inflation in food products but on a current monthly basis the rate of inflation in food products remains much lower than the general rate of inflation. That has been a consistent trend over recent months, with inflation in food prices at 1.6%. Most commentators expect retail food prices to reduce even further as a stronger euro impacts on exchange rates with sterling, which is to be welcomed. The low level of inflation in food prices is indicative of a sector that enjoys a real competitive dynamic. We are fortunate that every town and village in the country, unlike parts of Britain, has a food shop, which is to be welcomed. The emphasis on price competition in the sector is palpable, clear to consumers and can be seen at every level in the retail grocery sector. I very <Col N="1558" />much welcome this. The rate of inflation in food products, at 1.6%, remains lower than the general rate of inflation and has been a consistent trend.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with all the criticisms of the groceries order. The problem has been in the non-traded sector, as the Minister of State admitted. I fully support this. Whatever the inflationary pressures in the economy, the retail grocery sector has not contributed to them.</P>
    <P>I wish the efforts the Minister of State has outlined well and hope they are not too late, given the bad practice we have witnessed on the part of the Government in all these areas.</P>

      <P>Complacency has set in. People are unwilling to complain or shop around. We should consider setting up a national rip-off hotline to report those who are overcharging who should be named and shamed. That is the opportunity I intend to take here today. The media should take a lead in making consumers aware of their rights with more programmes like &ldquo;Checkout&rdquo; or others similar to the &ldquo;Watchdog&rdquo; on the BBC. I commend the <i>Irish Independent</i> for running a series on comparative pricing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence that we are being ripped off is overwhelming. We are being robbed in the shops. <Col N="1559" />A recent <i>Sunday Independent</i> shopping basket survey by business correspondent, Martin Fitzpatrick, found that a basket of household goods which cost &euro;16.41 in January 2002 now cost &euro;21.70, a 32.2% increase. In another excellent article in the business supplement of last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i>, 29 June, he described how he went on a shopping trip. I would not like to name or shame any particular supermarket but he does name the supermarket in question in the article. The supermarket chain involved, Superquinn, has an excellent reputation. I dealt with it when I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade. Its supermarkets sell quality Irish food and in that sense are not comparable with any others. If Martin Fitzpatrick was to check all of the other supermarket chains, he would find that Superquinn is one of the most competitive. I am delighted Senator Quinn is present in the House and that he will have an opportunity of discussing these issues because he, more than anyone, would know what is happening. While it is unfair to compare different products in a shopping basket, I hope the Senator, wearing his other hat, will respond to the article by Martin Fitzpatrick in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Independent.</i>Ireland's rapid rise towards the top of the European pricing league could pose a significant threat to maintaining the economic success of recent years. As a nation, we are far too complacent. As consumers, we never exercise our right to make complaints, which is vital. When I launched my name and shame, price-busting campaign in May, I said we would choose the month of June to examine prices in shops and services.</P>
    <P>The Consumers' Association of Ireland has kindly leant its support to this campaign and I thank Dermott Jewell, the chief executive. I also express my thanks to the Minister for providing funding in his Estimates for the Consumers' Association of Ireland. The amount allocated is over &euro;60,000 per annum. This organisation is working under extreme pressure and I believe the Minister should strengthen the association so that it is in a better position to work with his Department in highlighting rip-off situations.</P>
    <P>My own research throughout the country over the past four weeks, in so far as it was possible &ndash; I ask people to contact me or other public representatives in this regard &ndash; focused on petrol and diesel prices. The lowest petrol price in Ireland this morning is available at Colman Neville's, Midleton, County Cork, where a litre of unleaded petrol is 79.9 cents. He does not come first for diesel, which is 71.9 cents, a price that applies throughout Midleton. Mr. Neville, to whom I spoke this morning, said the fact that the terminal is close to the refinery possibly helps to make him more competitive while another factor is that he is not aligned to any big company. Therefore, he has freedom of movement as far as supplies are concerned.</P>
    <P>The lowest diesel price in Ireland today is available at Anthony Browne's Texaco station in <Col N="1560" />Moate, where he is quoting 70.9 cents per litre of diesel. The higher prices today are running at 89.9 cents per litre for petrol and 79.9 cents per litre for diesel. I will not list the highest because that would require a more extensive survey. I hope there will be an opportunity during the summer to review the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly note prices wherever I go. I also call on my colleagues in the Seanad and my councillor friends throughout Ireland to supply information on the price of products such as petrol or diesel. The fact that the Government insists on the price being displayed at the forecourt is the reason I am in a position to get that kind of information. This type of information is not always easily available, but is now required by Carmel Foley, the Director of Consumer Affairs, to be displayed in shops, supermarkets and elsewhere. Therefore, it is easy for anyone to see the price of diesel and petrol and it really helps to bring prices down. It is noticeable in any town that generally prices are the same at all forecourts. In Midleton, for example, there are queues outside Neville's because it is so competitive. The other forecourts in the town are also very competitive as a result. It should be emphasised, however, that it is difficult to compare a small filling station in a rural area, given its volume of trade, to a town-based forecourt which can offer a whole range of other facilities.</P>
      <P>In certain localities, for instance, shops are open from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. The price of groceries in a store such as this cannot be compared to supermarkets such as Tesco and Dunnes because they have a different type of market. Nevertheless, they provide a good service and they can help to keep prices down.</P>
      <P>As far as drink prices are concerned, I have discovered that probably the cheapest pint is in Charlestown, County Mayo. I understand the price quoted there is approximately &euro;3 per pint of Guinness. In the town of Roscommon, the price is running at around &euro;3.20 for Guinness, &euro;3.21 for whiskey and &euro;3.50 for lager, which is quite competitive. Those are prices that could, perhaps, be equalled elsewhere. The prices in Dublin are extraordinarily high. The same may be said for cities such as Cork and elsewhere. Bars in cities are charging too much for drinks, but, again, this is a matter for their own judgment because, unfortunately, there is no price control in this industry. I appeal to consumers to check the prices and ensure that publicans are alerted if they are too high. This would ensure that those who overcharge are unlikely to be supported. There are reports in Dublin of enormous prices, such as up to &euro;3.80 for a pint of Guinness. In Cork some of the major hotels charge very high prices as well, but they retort that the price of insurance has gone up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" />In relation to the Electricity Supply Board, a strange situation exists where the standing charge in rural areas is &euro;10.57 compared to &euro;6.12 in urban centres. There should be an equalisation in relation to the standing charge. The charge relates to infrastructure, such as poles which were installed during the rural electrification period, and it is extremely high. There is also a public service obligation levy of &euro;1.92 on the bill.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of Senator Coghlan, the price of petrol at the Tesco filling station in Killarney is 81.50 cents per litre.</P>

      <P>In relation to the letter sent by RGDATA, I agree with it regarding the minimum grocery order issued by the Minister. Removing it would not assist smaller grocery outlets. Loss leaders were a major problem some years ago and that is why the order was introduced. Also, I believe the current size of supermarkets is at the maximum that should be allowed. There are no grounds for increasing supermarket sizes beyond current limits. This was supported by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business in a previous Parliament on both grounds. I know that it is not before the Government at present, but I believe the Minister is aware of the situation in rural areas. RGDATA has put forward a reasonable argument. The order was only changed in 2001 in relation to retail space.</P>
      <P>During the summer months I hope there will be an opportunity for further analysis of prices. Inflation, as the Minister said, is being well fought at present and his Department is doing its utmost to keep the situation under control. I would like further strengthening of the Consumers' Association of Ireland. It is a voluntary organisation, dependent on contributions, and does not have the same clout as the major companies in relation to prices.</P>
      <P>In relation to the price of petrol and diesel, the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10 June highlighted that it costs about &euro;270 per year in rip-offs in relation to two different prices. Newspapers and local radio stations in particular should have consumer programmes, the latter because they are aware of the situation on the ground in their respective areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to airlines and competition, Ryanair has played a particularly important role. Further to a discussion yesterday on the Order of Business, where I brought to the attention of the <Col N="1562" />House the outrageous attacks by Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, on the Taoiseach, the report has been suppressed in <i>The Irish Times</i> today. I am appalled that the editor, Geraldine Kennedy, would suppress a report from this House because I attacked Michael O'Leary. I know there is enormous clout in so far as advertising is concerned. This advertisement in the <i>Irish Independent</i> cost in the region of &euro;50,000. I assure the House that Ryanair shareholders &ndash; I am not one &ndash; are deeply concerned about the abuse of Mr. O'Leary's power and the spending of money in a wrong fashion. I hope the Revenue Commissioners will not allow this type of advertisement to be charged against the profits of the company. The advertisements being placed in relation to the second terminal at Dublin Airport constitute an appalling attack on the Taoiseach and democracy. The use of bully-boy tactics to try to blackmail the Government into granting the second terminal to Ryanair will not achieve results.</P>
    <P>I highlight this issue because we have reached a strange position when the power of advertisers is sufficiently strong that one of our finest newspapers, <i>The Irish Times</i>, which, I am aware, has financial difficulties, will suppress a report. In fairness to the <i>Irish Independent</i>, it published today the statements made in the House yesterday by the Leader and me, despite continuing to feature the advertisements in question. Furthermore, the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland has informed me it cannot do anything about this type of advertising. New legislation should be introduced to strengthen the right of consumers in respect of advertising.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House and the Leader for her willingness to allocate time for this debate. It may be unusual that these kinds of requests are emanating from the Government side of the House as opposed to the Opposition benches, but we are here to speak up on behalf of our constituents, the people, and highlight issues which arise.</P>

      <P>I congratulate everybody involved in the debate and welcome the Minister of State. Having been unaware the debate would take place until I arrived this morning, I have not prepared.</P>
      <P>I wish to relate a story about the Japanese owner of a large chain of supermarkets who visited me several years ago and left a lasting impression on me. When I asked him how many stores he had, he replied he had 14,000 outlets worldwide. When I then asked what made him different from others in the business &ndash; I opened my first shop in the same year he opened his and I was rather proud of having 19 shops by this time &ndash; he told me he would think over the answer. On arriving at our destination, my home, he replied that the reason for his success lay in self-belief. One will be proved right, he said, whether one believes one has a chance against an opponent &ndash; he was a tennis player &ndash; or has no chance. Senators will wonder where this story is leading. His response impressed me because he had built up a huge supermarket chain.</P>
      <P>A similar question will be asked of the Government in the context of inflation. If it decides dealing with inflation is a priority, of which there is little doubt in light of the figures in the Forfás report, it will have to make a number of decisions, many of which will be uncomfortable. Ireland, according to the various measurements in the report, is in the upper range of the inflation league, either first, second or fifth depending on the heading. The report states at the outset that the Government is responsible for between 30% and 40% of inflation. It could, therefore, take immediate steps to reduce inflation, but these may not be in the best interests of the State as a whole.</P>
      <P>Senators Leyden and Coghlan touched on some of the decisions which had to be made. Let me address one of the drivers of inflation raised every time inflation is discussed, namely, the high cost of doing business here. We have some decisions to make in this regard, one of which will be on insurance, a heavy cost to all businesses, not only the grocery or restaurant trades. I understand our insurance costs are the highest in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever decisions the Government takes &ndash; the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently grappling with the issue &ndash; they <Col N="1564" />will impinge on individual freedoms. It is now possible to take a claim to court where a judge decides on compensation. The Government is free to try to stipulate amounts claimants will receive for various injuries such as a broken leg or arm, but it may have to change the Constitution to do so, as such a system would possibly interfere with rights and freedoms afforded under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the issue of health, specifically as it is affected by tobacco. Yesterday, I referred to a British company which had decided to target this country to bring down the price of tobacco. Having asked whether the company would sell tobacco to under age children, given that other retailers must avoid breaking the law, I returned to my office to discover an e-mail from the company in question, which I will not name as I do not wish to give it publicity. As the message was also sent to other Senators, including the Leader, the company is clearly mailing it to as many addresses as it can find. It stated:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir/Madam </P>
    <P>With the price of cigarettes in the UK and Ireland costing up to £5 and as much as 7 Euros a packet don't be ripped off by the government anymore!</P>
    <P>We can send you legally, by registered airmail direct to your UK or Irish address, 800 cigarettes &ndash; all your favourite brands and whatever brand you smoke we charge from 170 Euros fully inclusive of postage, packing and all taxes &ndash; this equates to 4.25 Euros per packet and at current exchange rates this works out at approximately £3!</P>
    <P>We also sell all your favourite brands of rolling tobacco, again from 170 Euros for 30x50g pouches &ndash; that works out at less than 6 Euros per pouch or approximately £4 (about half price!)</P>
    <P>To find out more and to order securely visit our website . . . .</P>
    <P>Do you really want to pay more? </P>
    <P>Kind regards <i>[The company's name follows]</i>If you are not a smoker, and find this e-mail offensive, we sincerely apologise! We will be only too happy to take you off our mailing list. To remove yourself from our mailing list, please go to . . . . </P>
    <P>I mention this solely because while there are ways to reduce prices, a decision will be required in each individual case. Some decisions have already been taken, for example, on the deregulation of the airline industry discussed by Senator Leyden. At that time, certain vested interests argued that the Government's proposals would lead to job losses. Deregulation in that sector resulted in many more people travelling, while the forces of competition caused air fares to decline. It has, therefore, had clear benefits, perhaps even to those working in the airlines concerned.</P>
    <P>The same applies in many other areas. However, when deregulating the telecommunications sector, instead of appointing a regulator <Col N="1565" />charged with ensuring fairness and competition, the Minister, as I argued at the time, should have retained powers for the State to encourage greater competition. One of the reasons access to the Internet is relatively expensive here is our failure to gain the required acceptance or usage of broadband. This can be done by encouraging competition rather than providing that the regulator must ensure fairness.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that decisions must be taken regarding the grocery business. I have believed in competition all my life. I started my business in the 1960s when the Fair Trade Commission was in place. I gave evidence to the commission and strongly argued that below cost selling should be allowed and that customers should have the right to avail of it. I continue to believe in open competition, although I am aware that many of the interests involved would not welcome it. It would have to be in the interests of consumers if, for example, a supermarket decided to sell below cost instead of spending money on fancy advertisements. Nevertheless, it would be unfair to some traders who would argue that big traders would take their business. The Government would be required to make a decision in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are ways it can address the issue, one of which is to insist that there be no limit on what could be purchased. This means that a trader selling below cost to generate publicity could not prevent another trader from buying his stock and reselling it at a slightly increased price. No matter what happens, some traders will argue there is unfair competition. In view of this, a Government decision to abolish the groceries order would create many other problems.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the groceries order deals with attempts by firms to bargain, cajole and bully their suppliers. Such an approach would not be in the interests of indigenous suppliers because purchases can be made elsewhere. In making a decision on this, the Government must balance the long-term interest to the State of lower prices against the likelihood that such an approach will mean the loss of indigenous suppliers.</P>
    <P>Senators Coghlan and Leyden referred to the cap on the size of stores. I believe in open competition and have argued that there should be no such cap. There is little doubt that if competition allowed for the creation of super-stores and hypermarkets, it would reduce inflation. However, it is also argued that it would lead to the closure of smaller stores, which would discriminate against those who are unable to travel. Senator Coghlan referred to this. Having visited the United States, France and other countries where super-stores and hypermarkets are allowed, I have seen towns with no shops left in them. As legislators, we must make decisions that are in the best interests of citizens.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that a cap on the size of stores &ndash; 3,500 sq.m. in Dublin and 3,000 <Col N="1566" />sq.m. beyond Dublin &ndash; is the most balanced approach. These limits probably reflect the size of existing stores in Ireland and are probably acceptable in the light of the balance the Government wishes to strike. However, in taking this approach it is indicating that the balance of its decision favours those who are less fortunate, have less ability to travel, may not have their own means of transport and live in towns that would be denuded of shops and supermarkets were large hypermarkets allowed to develop. Decisions of this kind will have to be made.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden correctly indicated that the best way to deal with competition was to allow for open publicity. Gay Byrne was a great driver of competition in the 1970s and 1980s. On Wednesday or Thursday mornings he published a list of prices on his radio show. All those involved in the business listened to this item to ensure they were not charging the highest prices and if they detected the products to be surveyed, they made sure to respond accordingly. It was a great game but it acted in the public interest and those companies which were unable to survive went out of business.</P>
    <P>This approach is also open to criticism, however. Last year the Director of Consumer Affairs published a list of prices for the top selling grocery items which were identical among the three major supermarkets referred to by Senator Leyden. That is what happens in competition, because none in our business can afford for our competitors to charge lower prices. My first supermarket in Dublin in the 1960s was located in Finglas where two other supermarkets were also located. In those days the vast majority of shoppers were full-time mothers at home. They would leave their children to school and, before attending 9.30 a.m. mass, check the prices displayed in the shop windows. We watched each others' prices. If, for example, a competitor advertised a pound of tomatoes for one shilling and nine pence, we reduced our price to one shilling and eight pence before mass was over. It was open competition and activity of that kind continues today. When last year the Director of Consumer Affairs expressed concern because the supermarkets were selling at the same price, they did so for that reason. Nobody can afford to have their competitors charging lower prices for identical products, be it butter, milk, bread or whatever. It was very difficult to explain to the director that this kind of outcome would be the result of competition.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with what has happened regarding the price of petrol and was even more impressed with Senator Leyden's survey. Another survey has been undertaken by a newspaper of the price of a cup of coffee while others are being done of the prices of other items. Openness, transparency and publicity are vital, as long as it is done fairly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" />The grocery business is being subject to new entrants from non-Irish companies. There is a problem because the groceries order legislation, which inhibits Irish companies, is practically unenforceable against companies based outside the State. This create unfairness. Many of the products sold by the foreign companies are not Irish based, nor are they are Irish brands. While they are probably of very good quality, the public must decide what products to buy.</P>
    <P>The answer is to create and encourage competition. In doing so the State must make decisions which will have consequences. For example, in the area of health I was stunned to discover that the VHI was sending people abroad &ndash; Spain, France or even South Africa &ndash; to have operations because it was cheaper to have them done there than here. These are the kinds of decisions we will have to make if we are to have open competition. I am a great believer in competition which we must encourage. In doing so we will have to balance the benefits to the State against the costs. In doing so it may be decided that the benefit of low inflation is not worth the other consequences of deciding to take a course of action. For example, there is little doubt that it is State policy to have a high price for alcohol and tobacco products, which we would all agree is acceptable, but when we blame the State for being a major cause of inflation, we must recognise that we, as legislators, have made such a decision. We must ensure we strike the right balance when making future decisions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. The reduction of the annualised rate of inflation to 3.7% is good news that the trend is positive. Much of this is due to outside factors such as the fall in international oil prices once the uncertainty over the Middle East situation was clarified and also the strength of the euro. The matter was discussed this morning on the Order of Business. The paradox is that the strength of the euro is bad news for indigenous companies, but good news for the multinationals which translate their profits into dollars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not yet been mentioned in this debate that last autumn, when it framed its budget and took part in social partnership negotiations, the Government judged correctly that the rate of inflation would reduce despite increases in indirect taxation and charges. There were those in the markets who said we were failing to get inflation under control and who predicted a 5% rate. Low inflation growth is essential given that we are in the euro zone. For many of the Celtic tiger years, up to and including 1999, the rate of inflation was kept at the 1.5% to 3% level. While subsequently the rate went considerably above that, it never achieved &ndash; if that is the right word <Col N="1568" />&ndash; anything like the heights inflation went to in the 1970s and early 1980s.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem has been too much demand in the economy. In future budgetary management, we must pay more attention to managing demand to prevent pressures building up. Such pressures were particularly obvious in the construction industry where tremendous demand to develop infrastructure drove up prices and resulted in less bang for our buck. We have discussed in this House over the last few days the different estimates of the cost of a metro system. Differing estimates are part of an era in which a sum considered sufficient one month would be too low compared to a few months later. We must get away from that mentality and leave this era behind.</P>
    <P>House prices remain high and it is entirely unclear whether they are stabilising, rising or, as some have suggested, about to fall. The Government must find ways to take the heat out of the house price market. I am not concerned about the builders, the developers and the landlords, but about the accessibility of houses to those on what are, by today's standards, relatively modest incomes.</P>
    <P>Competition is important. As the report points out, many price increases have occurred in the sheltered, less trade-intensive areas of the economy. It has been a source of frustration to successive Ministers for Finance that while for many years there was no increase in the excise duty on alcohol, it did not prevent an increase in its price. When a modest excise imposition was made in one or two out of every four or five years, it was used as an opportunity to ratchet up the price considerably more. The point that the rise in the price of drink is not even mainly due to the Government is entirely well taken.</P>
    <P>Most of us have plenty of experience of having our hair cut and will have found that the price of the service has escalated enormously over the past five years. The insurance industry has used 11 September 2001 to ratchet up prices in a wholly unacceptable manner. I cited earlier the 600% increase in the profits of Irish Life in 2002. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should examine this matter closely and publicise the actions of insurers. A committee of the Oireachtas is to discuss banking soon. We focus very much on the mortgage interest rate while paying little attention to the fact that interest rates for business and farming have hardly altered despite the steady reduction in base rates.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas have been debating problems which have arisen in the context of the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood, but most of the problems are actually the result of exorbitant legal fees. Exorbitant legal fees must be due to <Col N="1569" />lack of sufficient competition and restrictive practices.</P>

      <P>It is high time we stopped it. While various parties have had cosy relationships with lawyers in the past, we must consider the public interest. I cannot see how the public interest is served where the law is, in effect, inaccessible to anyone other than the big battalions, be they individuals or firms.</P>
      <P>Mention was made by my colleague, Senator Leyden, of the advertisements of a person whose name we are not supposed to mention in this House. I am not sure why we are prevented from naming him. The reason we do not name the officials sitting behind the Minister is that they cannot answer back and defend themselves, but no one could accuse the person we are not allowed to name as being incapable of answering back and defending himself. However, colleagues should note that the more we splutter with outrage, the more we please and encourage the gentleman in question. It is his trademark. I have seen German magazines in which he takes on Lufthansa. He loves to take people on and the more we splutter, the more he feels he is hitting home. I would be inclined to be a little more thick skinned and to ignore such behaviour. That is what it merits.</P>
      <P>Competition has been very beneficial in telecommunications and airlines, but we need to be careful. There has been a great deal of talk about privatising the ESB, but if increasing competition in this area is to mean much higher energy prices, we should question what we are doing. I do not worship competition and privatisation as forms of divinity. The question must be what effect acting in a certain manner will have. If it is a question of pushing up prices to provide a return to the shareholder, I would rather the shareholder was the State. Later this afternoon, the House will discuss the Common Agricultural Policy reform package which is certain to have a positive impact on food prices.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the social partners. In concluding their agreement in quite difficult and uncertain circumstances, they acted in a very statesmanlike fashion. They are being rewarded by the fact that the rate of inflation will almost certainly be below the wage increases they will receive, although it was not obvious this would be the case when the agreement was being concluded. They will have made a fine deal.</P>
      <P>The euro constitutes a very tight framework and we cannot allow inflation to get out of control as it has done in the past. This is a very important point. I hope the reduction we have seen in the rate of inflation is reflective of the soft landing we are achieving for the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suffering from the fact that I have organised myself to say too much. The Chair will forgive me. There are two ways of approaching this debate and, as usual, I will try to take both and probably get confused in the process. One way is to look at useful examples that are hard to understand. I accept everything Senator Mansergh said about insurance companies. It is worth noting that the highest inflation identified in the report was in financial services. It was higher than in expenditure on waste charges and the like. The financial services category experienced the biggest increase of 23%. It obviously includes the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>Some of the issues connected with insurance in this country are peculiarly Irish matters. In the case of compensation for personal injuries, for example, we tend to look at the wrong end of the spectrum, the spectacular awards occasionally made to those who have been seriously injured. However, that is not the reason for high insurance costs. One reason is the declining level of competition in the market. How many competing insurance companies are there, as distinct from front organisations? There are three or four, possibly fewer. Once there is a duopoly or its equivalent, competition rapidly declines, as is evident in the banking sector.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a trend to move towards consolidation and rationalisation. Old fashioned Marxists would say it is a move towards global monopolies, a direction in which we are moving. The number of automobile manufacturers is decreasing, as is the number of oil companies. Ultimately, in spite of all the grandiose talk about consolidation, consumers will be the victims of declining competition. That is not to say the solution to every problem is an irrational pursuit of competition. There is a statement on the Competition Authority's website which states, without qualification, that competition always produces lower prices and better services for the consumer. That is rubbish and when I get an opportunity to meet the chairman of the authority, I will tell him as much.</P>
      <P>Competition is a useful but not necessarily always the best instrument. I am sceptical about its role in the provision of health services, for example. The nearest thing to a free market in health services is in the United States and its health service is highly expensive. Roughly $1 in $7 of gross national product in the United States is spent on health services. The equivalent figure for Ireland is $1 in $11 while the European average is about $1 in $11 or $12. Close to 15% of GNP in the United States is spent on health care. Despite this, the United States has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the developed world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no patience with ideological agendas being inserted into this debate, even if it is the ideological agenda of, for example, public sector <Col N="1571" />transport employees. I recently attended my first Labour Party national conference. At the time I was the party's transport spokesperson in this House. During the conference I had the usual meeting with the CIE group of unions. I have a strongly developed view on public transport and was looking forward to a dialogue with them. They told me, however, that the first thing they needed was a price increase. They could only say that because they knew they had an effective monopoly. If they were involved in Senator Quinn's business, for example, and demanding an increase in prices, the immediate response would have been that Dunnes would undercut them and they would lose their jobs.</P>
    <P>The fundamental problem with public transport is not that workers are overpaid but that we are trying to do the impossible, make public transport operate as a commercial service. No country in the world has ever succeeded in doing this. The only debate is about how to quantify the public good of public transport and how to put prices on its benefit to the environment and other benefits. That is a difficult area about which I know a little. Environmental accounting is extremely difficult and dubious. The justification for subsidising public transport is overwhelmingly environmental. In order to quantify the benefit, therefore, one must be able to quantify the environmental benefits. We know they are real and tangible but whether it is possible to put a cash value on them at this stage in an underdeveloped science like environmental economics is doubtful.</P>
    <P>We will not get to grips with our public transport costs by introducing more competition. There is not a scrap of evidence throughout the world that quasi privatisation or any of the other experiments being mentioned will do much to change the cost of public transport. The only way to do it is through a deliberate public policy of keeping the prices at levels which will attract consumers to use it. We are in danger of pricing public transport out of the market. Whether public transport is provided directly by State owned companies or by franchise private companies is a secondary issue. I am sceptical about competition because I do not believe it is possible to have real competition in this area.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that the maximum quality and quantity of information should be available in an easy form to consumers. Car dealers can take a half or quarter page advertisement in a newspaper advertising the cars they have for sale without mentioning a price anywhere. If one cannot tell one's customers the price one is expecting for something, one is immediately involved in a little deception. Imagine Senator Quinn taking a full page advertisement in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> for example, showing all his products but not including the <Col N="1572" />prices. Car dealers do this on a regular basis. In the motoring supplements there are many pages of advertisements which do not display any prices.</P>
    <P>The most important issue is that people know the prices. The second is to identify the sectors where there is manifest and unjustifiably rapid inflation. It is clear from the report that the restaurant and bar business is another sector of extraordinarily high inflation. Nobody has yet explained how it is possible that the price of eating out in Germany is lower than in Ireland, given the fact that wages per hour in Germany are higher and the employer's social costs in addition to those wages are the highest in Europe. Nevertheless, one can still eat out in most countries in Europe for a price considerably lower than in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to claim it is related to the cost of insurance, which is a recent additional cost. I have every sympathy with small businesses with regard to the way the insurance burden has been landed on them but do not believe the increase is risk related. As Senator Mansergh said, it was an opportunistic misuse of the events of 11 September 2001. The margins expected by many at the middle level of the pub and restaurant industry and the lifestyles they have from the business in which they are involved have lost all relation to reality.</P>
    <P>I recall a few years ago being in an expensive restaurant in the south west &ndash; those who know my holiday habits and my preferences will easily guess where &ndash; and I happened to overhear the proprietor in conversation. He was moaning about the difficulties of making a living from what is a well-known restaurant. The restaurant opened in May and closed in October and, as the conversation developed, it emerged that from October to May the proprietor lived in the Canaries off the proceeds of the previous five months. His only child was attending the most prestigious and expensive boarding school, but he was able to convince himself, and moan to his friends who were also customers, of the difficulties of &ldquo;making a living&rdquo; out of the business.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that every builder now believes that if he or she is not driving a 2003 registered Mercedes, he or she is not making a living out of the building industry. Are there aspirations and expectations of a quality of life, and a return on business, that are out of tune with how the rest of us live? I am not by any means badly off but there is a question about the presumption of what one is entitled to as a return for running a business.</P>
    <P>The third issue that arises from the Forfás report is the comparative cost of rented housing in the eurozone countries. With Ireland at 100, for example, the cost of rented housing in Luxembourg is 79% of the rate here. It is the richest country in the world and must therefore have <Col N="1573" />what we would regard as high property prices, but its rate is 79%. Finland, which is a notoriously expensive country, is 74% of our rental cost. The nearest to us is Luxembourg. In Portugal it is 19% so if one pays &euro;100 a week in Ireland, one would pay &euro;19 a week in Portugal. Italy, which I would have regarded as comparatively expensive, is 43% of our cost. We need to do two things. First, we must get intelligent, objective analysis separate from ideology. I am tired of the Competition Authority saying repeatedly that more competition will solve the problem. If we allow some of the plans for the ESB to be carried through, we will end up with more expensive electricity. If one reads the reports one discovers that it cannot get entrants because it cannot get a price for electricity that would justify the investment. Somehow that is because the ESB is abusing its position. I do not understand that logic but ideology can cloud people's judgment. Second, we need to maximise information to people. My daughter in Italy tells me that she can buy contact lens cleaning fluid for one third of its cost here. She noticed immediately how expensive it was because when she was home I was paying for it and over there she is paying for it.</P>
    <P>Many of the agencies which are supposed to protect consumers, in particular the Director of Consumer Affairs and her office, let this country down during the transition to the euro because she was convinced by the banks of a scale of charges that turned out to be both unnecessary and a rip-off. She accepted their argument and it took the European Commission's intervention and effective dawn raids on the Bank of Ireland and AIB to &ldquo;persuade&rdquo; them that they were ripping us all off. I have reservations about the capacity of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs to really let consumers know what is happening, to inform them and to ensure that they know what is happening, what prices are and therefore have some influence over how they spend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The finding of Forfás on inflation can be attributed to several conditions that prevailed in the economy for recent years. The first is the fact that we imported much of our inflation and the second is demand. There was a demand in the legal sector because we have established many tribunals of inquiry. There have been other causes of our compensation culture that have led to demands on the legal profession and, sadly, that has meant that there has been plenty of work to go around. The effect of the terrorist attack on New York on 11 September 2001, and the subsequent cost of reinsurance, has been a major factor in the insurance business, as has been the demand in building which can be attributed in part to the growth in the economy. The last and most important aspects are greed and opportunism, which have manifested themselves in many <Col N="1574" />different ways and are traits we need to tackle. The inflationary effects from abroad may be easing because we are now paying less for oil, the exchange rate has turned around and we are buying more with our euros in the world markets than previously. This has a knock-on effect on indigenous industry.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, if the high euro continues, we could see over the next few months and years a deflationary effect which will be carried into the Irish economy. I would like to see the deflationary effect passed on immediately. I want to see the price of oil, which was $32 a barrel during the Gulf War, the price of oil today and the expected price of oil over the next few months and years passed on. It seems to be difficult for prices to come down. I would also like to ensure that when we take measures, for example, in the insurance industry if we begin with the PIAB and ensure that there is less fraud, and give effect to regulations to make road safety a feature and there are fewer accidents, that the benefits do not go to the bottom lines of the companies but are passed on to the consumer.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting the key findings of the Forfás consumer pricing report. It states that &ldquo;increases in consumer prices over the past five years have sharply outpaced those of our European neighbours.&rdquo;  They also imported inflation so why have we gone so far ahead?</P>
      <P>This has resulted in an estimated overall consumer price level which is 12% above the euro area average. The strong inflation differential has continued into 2003, resulting in a further divergence in consumer price levels, adding to already high competitiveness risks.</P>
      <P>Ireland is now estimated to have been the second most expensive country in the eurozone in 2002 for consumer prices, marginally behind Finland. It is likely that Ireland will become the most expensive country in the eurozone during 2003. The non-internationally traded sectors were the primary drivers of consumer price inflation in Ireland in 2002. Among individual expenditure categories, &ldquo;pubs and restaurants&rdquo;, [to which I will refer again later] were the most important drivers of national inflation &ndash; accounting for nearly 30% of the increase in the price of the standard basket of consumer goods-services in the year to end January 2003. Combined with alcoholic beverages and tobacco, 19% increase, transport, 16%, and miscellaneous goods and services, 15%, these non-internationally traded sectors accounted for 80% of national inflation in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was the most expensive country in the eurozone for foodstuffs from low-priced outlets in 2002, the second most expensive for foodstuffs from mid-priced outlets and the third most expensive for foodstuffs from high-priced outlets. It was also found to be the second most expensive <Col N="1575" />country in which to buy non-food consumables in the eurozone across all retail types.</P>
    <P>We are about to become the most expensive country in the eurozone. Why as shoppers do we not complain more? If people thought Ireland was an expensive place to live, this report from Forfás has proved them right. We are now the second most expensive country in the eurozone, marginally behind Finland.</P>
    <P>The report also predicts that we will become the most expensive eurozone country later in the year. Eating out, drinking out and groceries are the items that hit the wallet hardest. As a nation we probably do not complain enough. We are too laid back. We notice groceries getting more expensive all the time. Every week something seems to go up, but we are a dead loss at complaining. Eating out and socialising are the worst value for money. One expects to pay high prices at the top restaurants but one is badly served in middle range restaurants. One ends up paying above premium prices for an average return but nothing ever happens for we are not a nation of complainers.</P>
    <P>People are being overcharged constantly and we whinge about it but do not complain. At work, we complain all the time to each other about how expensive everything is &ndash; eating out, property, the pub &ndash; but do not complain in shops or restaurants. I do not know the reason for this. It appears that Irish consumers do not like to complain; they find it unpleasant. The message is, therefore, that if one believes one is not getting value for money, one should tell the restaurant owner or the shopkeeper instead of one's friends, complaining to the source. It will not ruin one's night or day out, and will make a difference. Furthermore, one should complain to the Director of Consumer Affairs. We must use that office more efficiently and give it more teeth.</P>
    <P>There are many areas over which we have no control but there are some. We should bring control back into our lives by ensuring those who need to know &ndash; the greedy ones who are overcharging &ndash; are made aware. Much of what Senator Leyden is doing is correct.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who have contributed to this very important debate, especially Senator Leyden for initiating it. A few points were raised to which I would like to refer but the general consensus from all sides of the House was that our prices had increased substantially in recent years. The question of who was to blame was raised by Senator Coghlan, especially on foot of the report in which Government influence on inflation was mentioned. However, it is important to point out that there are many areas where the Government influenced category includes prod<Col N="1576" />ucts subject to excise duty where price increases have occurred without any increase in duties, especially tobacco, which have contributed a significant amount to the inflation increase in the past year or so. An increase in the cost of tobacco, in particular, can be of relevance, especially to health. We have all become much more aware in recent years of the knock-on costs to health care of people smoking.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden raised the question of consumer assertiveness, as did Senator Hanafin. I suppose it is a trait of our nation that we do not complain when we get bad service, be it in shops, restaurants or anywhere else. We should do so. The anti-inflation group is examining the question of greater consumer assertiveness, which will be considered in the new initiative to stimulate greater price sensitivity among consumers. Senator Leyden also raised the question of supporting the Consumers Association of Ireland to which a grant of &euro;63,000 was made. How we can move forward will be considered in due course in consultation with it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn asked whether inflation was a Government priority. I assure him that it is. The programme, Sustaining Progress, highlights it as such for the nation. The Senator also raised the question of insurance. The Tánaiste has made a reduction in insurance costs one of her top personal priorities. Senators will be aware that in the previous Government Deputy Noel Tracey was Minister of State responsible for insurance matters. He commissioned a report on motor insurance, known as the Motor Insurance Advisory Board report which was issued at the beginning of 2002. It set out 67 recommendations, many of which have now been put into operation. Many more still have to be implemented. Those decisions and recommendations have already had some success. Many of the conclusions and recommendations were applicable to such areas as employer and public liability insurance. There is an interim Personal Injuries Assessment Board. A statutory board will be set up by 1 January 2004 under legislation being prepared. Its establishment and the implementation of the recommendations will have a considerable impact on insurance costs. This is important.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the need for competition. I took it from his statement that he was in favour of free trade and <i>laissez-faire </i>in that area. While we must have competition, we must also take note of the social impact, if we leave matters completely free, on small towns and villages, especially their grocery shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again thank all Senators for their enlightening and valuable contributions. It has opened up discussion on a subject with a wide impact. We hope more people from every walk of life will take note of how they can influence prices in every part of trade. They should not hide their light under a <Col N="1577" />bushel but speak out when they believe they are being wronged.</P>

I received a telephone call during the discussions to say the price per litre of petrol in Cosgraves of Castlebar is down to 78.9 cent, although I have to say that the price of diesel in Midleton is also very low. During the recess I will be taking the opportunity of contacting the public and local representatives all over Ireland to try to maintain the momentum and create an awareness of prices. The position can change very quickly. A week is a long time in politics but an hour is sometimes even longer. I thank the Minister of State's officials for coming here at very short notice and the Leader for allowing the debate.</P>

      <P>The Commission's proposals for the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 were the subject of negotiation for almost a year. Outline proposals were presented by the Commission in July 2002 and the more detailed proposals were published in January 2003. The proposals comprised the most radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy since its foundation and have been the subject of detailed analysis and intense public debate both here and throughout the EU. The Council of Ministers has debated the proposals at each of its meetings this year. During the course of the negotiations, my officials and I had close consultations with all the farming, food processing and other representative bodies, mainly through consultative groups which I set up for this purpose. The issues and concerns have been identified and have been well known for some time. The fact that the negotiations in the Council continued for a full year is indicative of the complexity of the proposals but also of the difficulties facing Ministers in reaching a decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My position on the Commission's proposals was well known. My objectives in the negotiations were to safeguard the benefits to Irish agriculture <Col N="1578" />and to rural economies achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and to ensure the best possible level of support and protection of our production base into the future. The agreement which was reached last week in the Council was the culmination of a long negotiating process and was an acknowledgement by all Ministers that it was time to end the uncertainty about the future policy framework and to conclude the process.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that an objective and fair-minded examination of the outcome of the negotiations will establish that I have been successful in achieving my objectives and in defending the best interests of Irish agriculture. The final outcome contained substantial modifications to the Commission's initial proposals and represented a balanced agreement and a successful outcome to the negotiations from Ireland's point of view. The agreement will reshape the Common Agricultural Policy and secure its future by making it more relevant to modern society and to modern consumer demands. This is the only way forward. We have the opportunity now to exploit the new situation to full advantage. I am sure the details of the agreement are well known at this stage but I will outline them briefly for the House.</P>
    <P>The decoupling of direct payments from production is a fundamental change to the Common Agricultural Policy and, not surprisingly, the Commission's proposal for full decoupling was the most contentious issue throughout the negotiations. In the end, the Council agreed to amend the proposal for full decoupling and to give member states a number of options which will allow them to implement decoupling in a manner best suited to their requirements. Full decoupling across the board remains as an option if member states wish to pursue that possibility.</P>
    <P>Besides full decoupling, last week's agreement provides for other options in relation to cereals, beef and sheep meat which allow for various forms of partial decoupling. Some of the options include up to 100% coupling of the suckler cow premium, up to 100% coupling of the slaughter premium and up to 75% coupling of the special beef premium. The sheep premium and the supplementary ewe premium may now be either fully or 50% decoupled.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, amounts up to 10% of a member state's direct payments may be allowed for the purpose of encouraging specific types of farming which are important for the environment and to improve quality and marketing. Among the major advantages of the new arrangements is that we now have a menu of options which will reduce the paperwork and red tape associated with direct payments and which will allow farmers to respond to market demands without the need to engage in production in order to qualify for direct payments.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the forthcoming World Trade Organisation talks, the new <Col N="1579" />arrangements will enable the EU to take the initiative in the current negotiations and to negotiate from a position of strength. Decoupling and partial decoupling will enable a substantial proportion of direct payments &ndash; depending on the choices to be made by member states &ndash; to qualify as domestic support which has &ldquo;no or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production&rdquo;&ndash; the so-called Green Box. This has the advantage of protecting them from challenge in the WTO negotiations. I have made it absolutely clear that the outcome of the mid-term review represents the bottom line in so far as the WTO negotiations are concerned and that I will not agree to a new WTO round which requires further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The outcome of the negotiations on decoupling has, therefore, been most satisfactory from Ireland's point of view.</P>
    <P>During the coming weeks I will be consulting with the social partners with a view to introducing the model best suited to Irish requirements from the point of view of maximising efficiency, competitiveness and protecting the rural economy. I will also invite submissions from wider interest groups and the public generally before reaching a conclusion. I intend to keep the arrangements under close review, particularly in the light of the facility under the agreement which provides for a review by the Commission of the operation of the new arrangements after the first two years, with a view to dealing with its possible impact on structural reform and markets.</P>
    <P>I am particularly satisfied with the outcome which I secured in regard to degression and modulation. The Commission's proposals represented a serious threat to the level of direct payments in Ireland, which are of such crucial importance to farm incomes. I opposed strenuously the proposed reduction of up to 13% in direct payments to meet future financing needs &ndash; the degressivity proposal. The removal of this automatic system of annual reductions in direct payments was a major achievement. The compromise which was agreed requires the Council to review from 2007 onwards the financial situation annually and, if budget deficits arise, to take necessary action. This is a more responsible and reasonable approach.</P>
    <P>In addition, the proposed rate of modulation has been reduced from 6% to 5% when fully operational and we also have the retention of the &euro;5,000 franchise or exemption which will ensure that almost half of Irish farmers will not have modulation applied to them. My objective in ensuring that modulated funds are retained in Ireland for rural development measures has also largely been achieved. Modulation will commence in 2005 at a rate of 3%, rise to 4% in 2006 and continue thereafter at 5%. Ireland will retain 85% of modulated funds and, of the &euro;40 million <Col N="1580" />modulated, &euro;34 million will stay in Ireland. The resultant net reduction of &euro;6 million per annum represents only 0.5% of the &euro;l.3 billion in direct payments which are currently paid annually to Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>The outcome was a major improvement on the original proposal, where the combined effect of modulation and degression would have resulted in &euro;464 million being siphoned off direct payments over the period 2006-2012. Those who criticised last week's decision have been very quiet on these elements of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the decision in relation to the dairy sector. Last week's decision provides for a cut of approximately 4% beyond the level already agreed in Agenda 2000. In contrast to the original proposal for an additional 10% reduction, we got the reduction in intervention reduced to 4%. In addition, while the original proposal provided for compensation for the intervention price reductions at the same level as applied in the Agenda 2000 agreement, a rate of 56%, I managed to secure compensation of approximately 80% for the additional intervention price reduction of 4% which was agreed.</P>
    <P>The potential losses to the dairy sector from the net effect of the 4% intervention price reduction and the increase in the dairy cow premium amount to less than &euro;14 million a year or 1% of the farm gate value of milk output. The additional 4% will amount to a 6 cent reduction per gallon equivalent. Of that 6 cent per gallon equivalent, 5 cent will be compensated for through the dairy cow premium. The reduction is therefore a 1 cent per gallon equivalent. That reduction is intervention and if our co-ops and co-op plcs do not rely on intervention they do not have to suffer the loss at all. Obviously, the intervention price reduction will only have effect if product is sold into intervention. If product is sold where it should be sold &ndash; on the market-place &ndash; there may not be any loss at all. Depending on market prices, there could be substantial gains.</P>
    <P>The agreement demonstrates again, emphatically, that the dairy industry must realise that sales to intervention are not the way to build a viable industry capable of remunerating its farmer suppliers adequately for its raw material. The industry must adjust to that reality. A few statistics illustrate where we are and what we have to do. In the past four years, Ireland has accounted for between 27% and 35% of EU butter intervention intake compared to our 8% share of production. The figures for skimmed milk powder are similar. Our reliance on bulk, commodity products is way out of line with, for example, Denmark and the Netherlands. Whole and skimmed milk power contribute 50% of Irish total production of dairy products compared to 23 % in Denmark and 15% in the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>We must keep in tune with the modern con<Col N="1581" />sumer. If the late Henry Ford, and his company, had continued to make Model T cars and expected taxpayers to keep them in storage for him, he would have been out of business many decades ago. Similarly, if modern IT companies continued to make electric typewriters and expected taxpayers to store them and then, possibly, offload them to unfortunate third countries, it would not make for a credible future for the industry and nor is it credible for the dairy industry to insist on converting milk into products for which there is no market. It cannot expect taxpayers to pay for the storage and then offload them either onto the EU market where they will depress prices or onto third country markets which will cause mayhem for those unfortunate countries.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the objective of reducing dependence on commodity products and on intervention purchases, I insisted that a reasonable period should be provided for the dairy industry to reorientate itself to a lower level of intervention availability. The original Commission proposal was for a ceiling of 30,000 tonnes per annum on intervention intake of butter and this would have been disruptive in the short term. I secured agreement, against enormous opposition and without support from any ministerial colleague in the Council, to have the intervention limits for butter improved significantly. The final agreement increases the ceiling to 70,000 tonnes initially, reducing over five years to 30,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The Danish and Dutch Ministers were aghast that an Irish man would look for this level of intervention intake as they have similar industries to ours. The Danes are further from our nearest market, the UK market, yet they do not depend to the same extent on intervention. Nonetheless they did not demur and allowed my proposal to stand. It is 2003 and one would expect a modern food industry to have regard for the consumer. The five year lead-in time gives our dairy industry time to get nearer the consumer. However, the situation is urgent and the industry owes it to suppliers to ensure they get the best return and owes it to the taxpayers to ensure there is less reliance on intervention.</P>
    <P>The new dairy cow premium will not be decoupled until the reform in the sector is completed thereby favouring active producers. Overall, I am convinced that the agreement is most satisfactory given, in particular, that the milk quota regime has been extended to 2015. A small price of approximately 1 cent per gallon was paid in terms of intervention price reductions for that objective which will play a major role in supporting the milk price until 2015.</P>
    <P>The original proposal for a reduction of 5% in the intervention price for cereals was unnecessary in view of trends in world market prices. I argued that the intervention price for cereals should remain unchanged. This was agreed and the <Col N="1582" />Council also decided on a partial retention of the monthly increments. I also managed to secure the dropping of the original proposal for ten year obligatory non-rotational set-aside, which would not have been suitable in the Irish situation. The new arrangements on set-aside are more workable in Ireland and allow for further set-aside obligations as market needs arise.</P>
    <P>Some spokespersons have said that this was really a French intervention and achievement. The French were interested in cereals but we kept close to them. If one goes into a Council of Ministers meeting with four votes out of 87, one must create alliances with other countries. To the benefit and advantage of the Irish economy we have worked closely with the French over the years particularly in these negotiations.</P>
    <P>I had been concerned about the overall impact of the Commission's proposals on young farmers and was anxious to secure the best possible terms and conditions for them. The strengthening of support available to young farmers by way of a special new incentive under the proposed rural development measures is another very positive outcome. The maximum support for young farmers undertaking investments within five years of setting up has been increased from 55% to 60% in less favoured areas and from 45% to 50% in other areas.</P>
    <P>I also negotiated changes for young farmers which include the more equitable calculation of single payment entitlements for those who entered farming during the reference period, flexibility to create a national reserve using up to 3% of established entitlements, with the possibility of ring-fencing a certain percentage of entitlements for young farmers who commenced farming activity after 31 December 2002, and the possibility of allowing young farmers who inherit farms to inherit also any entitlements established by the retiring farmer.</P>
    <P>Other changes secured during the negotiations are that the farm advisory system or farm audit will now be voluntary for all farmers, the national reserve may be used for certain early retirement cases and special payment entitlements for certain dairy and other farmers can be traded in the same way as single payment entitlements.</P>
    <P>It is important that we await the legal text of the agreement. We have not yet received it because the legal services of the Commission are working on it and it will take another few weeks and will, I hope, be with us at the end of the month. Hereditary and trading entitlements will be critically important and we need to see the text before we can enter into serious dialogue with social partners in regard to the way forward.</P>
    <P>In these negotiations, my objective was to preserve the benefits of the Agenda 2000 agreement for Ireland and I firmly believe that that objective has been realised. The agreement also has huge potential benefits in terms of reducing substan<Col N="1583" />tially the administrative and bureaucratic burden for farmers and the Department alike, while allowing farmers freedom to farm and to respond to consumer demands and signals from the marketplace. The new policy framework will ensure, therefore, a more market-orientated and sustainable agriculture and food industry which will be to the benefit of consumers and producers alike.</P>
    <P>The package as agreed has a balance within it which repositions the CAP in the modern world. In the longer term, I believe that it will be seen as safeguarding its future. We are highly dependent on a strong and viable CAP and we are not serving our own interests if we bury our heads in the sand and ignore the external threats and challenges.</P>
    <P>The options for decoupling direct payments will, as I have said, allow such payments to be made secure from challenge in the WTO. As a consequence, the contribution of direct payments to farm incomes and therefore to the rural economy will be safeguarded in a manner not heretofore achieved. I do not believe that the level of criticism of the agreement, which is concentrated on one element only, is in any way justified. In an effort to substantiate their case against the milk element of the agreement, certain spokespersons have resorted to misrepresentation. They have added the intervention price reductions agreed as part of Agenda 2000 to the 4% price reduction now agreed.</P>
    <P>Even if it were legitimate to add these two price reductions together, these spokespersons would still be misrepresenting the facts, since they have failed to add in on the positive side the benefits of the 2.8% or 32 million gallon increase in Ireland's quota which was part of Agenda 2000. That quota increase valued at the price being paid currently for restructured milk quota is &euro;45 million per annum. However, this benefit has been ignored by those who are intent on distortion to suit their misguided purposes. I use the word &ldquo;misguided&rdquo; because it is far from clear who benefits from distortion of the facts. The confidence of Irish farmers, and particularly young people contemplating a career in farming, can be severely dented by such distortions. It is disheartening that those who should show leadership in agriculture seem intent on spreading despondency and despair.</P>
    <P>Following last week's agreement, I believe that we can look ahead with confidence and plan for the future in a stable policy environment. Those who continue to preach doom and gloom undermine confidence and do no service to our farmers, particularly those young people contemplating entering farming. There is a future for them and my priority now is to manage the transition from the old to the new regime so as to ensure a <Col N="1584" />smooth transfer and enable Irish agriculture to exploit the new opportunities to the full.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial amount of direct support for farming &ndash;&euro;1.3 billion annually in direct payments and &euro;1.6 billion annually when the REP scheme and the farm retirement scheme are taken into account. For our size of economy that is substantial as it represents about 60% of farmers' incomes which is now secure because the CAP has been preserved. Those direct payments have been safeguarded from challenge in the context of the world trade talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan" hpid="Mr. Coonan Mr. Coonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and acknowledge that, from a personal point of view, he did his best in the negotiations. Unfortunately, however, as in other cases, his best has not been sufficient. Farmers have reacted with anger and many are depressed. Newspaper headlines such as &ldquo;Dairy Farmers Sold Out&rdquo; have appeared.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this is a bad deal. According to the leader of the IFA, John Dillon, &ldquo;The Minister went to Luxembourg without a proposal,&rdquo; and according to ICMSA president, Pat O'Rourke, &ldquo;The Minister failed to defend Irish farming interests and the national council is rapidly losing confidence in the Minister to defend farm incomes and the agri-food sector in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Even the Minister's colleague, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, recognised the devastating effects of the Fischler proposals. He has concluded that they will cripple the dairy industry in Munster, where 40% of Ireland's milk is processed. He has indicated that the CAP proposals will lead to job losses as a result of the reduction in output. The co-operative movement, ICOS, estimates that the industry will lose &euro;327 million by 2007.</P>
      <P>The dairy sector, which was the pillar of farming up to now and the only one which was maintaining confidence in the farming community, has been decimated. Mr. Fischler has given with one hand, but taken twice as much away with the other. Dairy reform has been brought forward one year in order to begin in 2004, so the adjustment period for the dairy farmer is further reduced. The minimum price for butter has been cut by 10% on top of the 15% set out in Agenda 2000 &ndash; a total reduction of 25%.</P>
      <P>The minimum prices for skimmed milk powder will be reduced by 15% over a three year period, beginning in 2004. The proposal to abolish the target price for milk remains, which is a cause for concern because it would allow the Commission to manage the price down to or below the intervention price. There will be no milk quota increases in 2007 and 2008 and the reformed dairy quota system is to be prolonged until 2014 and 2015.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cut in intervention butter. The purchase of butter for intervention <Col N="1585" />will be suspended, according to the Minister, above a limit of 70,000 tonnes in 2004, falling to 30,000 in 2007. The Minister said that is a major achievement on his part, and so it is. However, the current amount of butter in intervention is 150,000 tonnes and this is where the real cut lies, a fact which the Minister has neglected to mention. This large reduction will devalue milk quotas.</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that reducing the rate of the intervention butter over five years from 70,000 to 30,000 will create the opportunity &ldquo;to give the Irish dairy processing industry a lead in time in order to get away from its over-dependence on intervention&rdquo;. The Minister neglects to mention where farmers can sell their excess produce. In 2002, the amount of skimmed milk powder alone sold into intervention was 50,000 tonnes and the Minister has not explained how this shortfall will be made up. Farmers must now sell milk without compensation for 75% of the current price which ranges from 92c to 96c. A dairy farmer with an 80,000 gallon milk quota will lose roughly &euro;7,500 as a result of these proposals. How is he or she expected to survive?</P>
    <P>The proposals in the beef sector are like the curate's egg. We have what the Minister described as a menu but it is more <i>à  la carte</i> than anything else. Member states can opt to retain up to 100% of the suckler premium and 40% of the slaughter premium or 100% of the slaughter premium and 75% of the male special beef premium but not both. The most likely decision on decoupling is for the entire system to be decoupled except for the slaughter premium which amounts to &euro;80 per head.</P>
    <P>The Minister has claimed that retaining the slaughter premium provides an incentive for farmers to produce cattle, not merely retire. However, with 45% of Irish farmers over the age of 55 years, the reality is that many will simply take the European Union income and end almost all production. If this happens, these farm families will have no future and their children will not carry on the tradition of farming. The already alarming numbers leaving the land will snowball. There were 141,527 active farms in June 2000 compared with 170,578 in 1991. Over ten years, there has been a reduction of 29,051.</P>
    <P>We have been told that 80% of the modulation budget, approximately &euro;34 million, will return to Ireland. Can the Minister guarantee the House that this money will be returned to the Department of Agriculture and Food for the benefit of farmers and rural development in general? If so, how will this process occur? This has not been explained.</P>
    <P>Farm incomes have fallen dramatically in recent years because of cuts already imposed through agricultural reforms such as Agenda 2000. This decline will speed up alarmingly, as I have outlined, with a &euro;7,500 decrease in dairy <Col N="1586" />farmers' income. Some 48% of earned income on farms comes from off-farm sources while 44% comes from farming.</P>
    <P>Franz Fischler claimed that Ireland was treated in a moderate fashion and that the Irish dairy industry must not be so dependent on butter and should diversify its dairy products. We have heard the Minister confirm his agreement with the Commissioner's remarks. Despite this, the Minister has shown no leadership to the industry in directing it towards other products such as yoghurts and cheeses. The ICMSA president, Pat O'Rourke, has pointed out that dairy products are unlikely to displace or overtake the best dairy products such as yoghurts or cheeses on the European market because larger states like Italy and France will protect their domestic markets while Ireland is very restricted as to where we can sell our produce.</P>
    <P>The IFA president, John Dillon, has said the implications of last week's deal are such that 10,000 dairy farmers face a serious risk of going out of business with a knock-on effect of 3,000 job losses in the dairy processing and service sectors. As a result of the small farm structure and higher cost, the future of dairy farming in western and northern counties is at the highest risk.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that he had two objectives, one of which related to the Common Agricultural Policy. The selling point and main advantage of the CAP is that there has always been a common agricultural policy for all EU member states. The European Commission's proposals have ended this policy and opened the door to the emergence of trade distortions within and between member states. The nationalisation of the CAP will lead to its dismantling. If this happens, it will be seriously disadvantageous to Ireland relative to our trading partners in the European Union. This is a valid concern the Minister has failed to address.</P>
    <P>The cuts agreed by the Minister in these proposals, especially in the dairy sector, in addition to his consent for the nationalisation of the CAP do not encourage confidence in his ability to ensure the position of Irish agriculture is not further eroded at the upcoming World Trade Organisation talks in September. The Minister has promised to hold the current line at the WTO. However, before entering the talks with Commissioner Fischler, he promised us that there would be no change in the terms agreed in Agenda 2000. He did not keep his word. One cannot be assured that Irish agriculture will not be further compromised at the WTO talks. Can the Minister give farmers any credible assurance that agriculture will not be undermined further?</P>
    <P>The Minister assured us that the introduction of single payments would significantly reduce the level of bureaucracy faced by farmers when applying for farm payments. However, it appears that bureaucracy is likely to continue to increase. <Col N="1587" />The Minister's suggestions on decoupling appear to increase it. He has spoken about different complex and confusing options regarding decoupling such as his suggestions to have ewe, special beef and suckler premiums fully or partially decoupled or have some of the payments fully decoupled and others partially decoupled. It is a bit of a dog's dinner. There is a need for clarification and an urgent decision to be taken. The persistent uncertainty regarding the modulation proposals continues to damage the agriculture industry. I appeal to the Minister to come to a decision in concert with the farming organisations as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The degressivity proposal which the Minister outlined remains but has been renamed financial discipline and will only be triggered if the EU budgetary ceiling is within &euro;300 million of being breached. The rate has not been set. It is proposed that this would be determined in the year when the budget looks like being exceeded. This appears to leave the rate open-ended. The current proposal gives the European Commission the power to adjust any agreed rate upwards or downwards by 3%.</P>
    <P>The farm advisory system will be voluntary for member states until 2006. The Minister has informed us about it being optional for farmers. From 2007 member states must offer advisory systems to their farmers. However, recent cutbacks in the State agricultural advisory service, Teagasc, appear to work against this. The Government has already shown its lack of commitment to farmers by slashing the Teagasc budget and closing eight advisory centres vital to hundreds of farmers in Wicklow, Loughrea, Boyle, Manorhamilton, Gorey, Mullinavat, Tullow and a sheep research centre in Carlow. How can the Minister justify his Department's disjointed policy on the essential services Teagasc provides for farmers?</P>
    <P>Most farmers' worst nightmares have been realised by this proposal and their greatest fear is that more is to come. We hope not but there needs to be clarification. Farmers are concerned because the Minister has already conceded a great deal. When the going gets tough in Cancun, he is likely to concede more.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, and congratulate him, his ministerial colleagues and departmental staff on representing Ireland so ably when they wore the green jersey in the mid-term review negotiations which were far-reaching and during which something could have gone wrong. I compliment the Minister for doing so well as captain of the team wearing the green jersey and achieving what he set out to achieve. He went to Brussels and Luxembourg and took part in the negotiations facing an impossible situation &ndash; to retain for Ireland the <Col N="1588" />benefits that we already had.

      <P>The Opposition will say that I have to compliment the Minister but some logic and sense would do no harm in this debate. Certain farm leaders are once again reverting to their predictable whingeing. More than 20 of them were in Luxembourg holding a watching brief in the press bar while the Minister was conducting the negotiations. When the going got tough and the negotiations lasted through the night, the whingers were tucked in their beds while the Minister hammered out a vital deal for Irish farmers. When he concluded at 7.30 a.m. he immediately briefed the farm organisations but we all know that there was already someone sleepwalking on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; telling us what the package was when he knew sweet damn all about it. He was not at the briefing sessions.</P>

      <P>He was devoid of the facts. How could he have the facts when the Council of Ministers negotiated in restricted session from 3 a.m. onwards?</P>
      <P>What does the package contain? The reforms will completely change the way the EU supports the farming sector. The new CAP will be geared towards consumers and taxpayers while giving EU farmers the freedom to produce what the market wants. That is what we should have been doing for the last 30 years. In future, the vast majority of subsidies will be paid independently of the volume of production. To avoid abandonment of production, member states can choose to maintain a limited link between a subsidy and production under well defined conditions and within clear limits.</P>
      <P>The new single farm payments will be linked to environmental, food safety and animal welfare standards, as well as maintaining farm profitability and producing products that have a place in the market. We import &euro;3 billion worth of food into this State and that is shameful. Those in the processing industry should examine that because there is a market to be entered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The milk quota regime that was due to end in 2008 has been extended to 2015. The critics conveniently neglect to mention that the Commission <Col N="1589" />had offered to leave the Agenda 2000 deal in place for the dairy industry, with quotas ending in 2008, but the Minister took the other deal because it extended the quota system until 2015 and I support him in that decision. The original proposals for an overall 10% reduction beyond the level agreed in Agenda 2000 was reduced to 4% in the reforms and relates only to sales intervention. Returns from the marketplace will not be affected by this reduction. It is time that the good produce we farmers produce is processed to meet the needs of consumers and the market.</P>
    <P>Compensation for this additional price cut amounts to 80%, or 5 cent per gallon, of the 6 cent per gallon intervention price cut. The whingeing IFA and ICMSA spokesmen want to complain so badly that they turn 1 cent into a mountain. Needless to say, in making this mountain they had to add the price reductions agreed four years ago in Agenda 2000 to the price reduction of 4% last week, 80% of which is compensated. Have we ever heard such whingeing about a 1 cent per gallon cut in the intervention price? Surely our creameries, co-ops and processing industries can make up a fall of 1 cent by moving closer to the market place? They should move fully into the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Naturally, these calculations also forget to include the increase of 2.8%, or 32 million gallons, in milk quota, as secured in Agenda 2000 by the Minister. That increased quota has added about &euro;50 million to the farm gate value of the milk output. The Commission proposal was for a ceiling of 30,000 tonnes per annum on intervention butter and the Minister has dealt with that idea. The final agreement secured by the Minister increases the ceiling to 70,000 tonnes initially, reducing over five years to 30,000 tonnes. This will allow a reasonable period for the dairy industry to re-orient itself to the market. Until ten years ago the dairy industry was doing well but it has lost its direction and there is an obligation on the management of co-ops, processing and the farmer representatives on the boards to ensure the maximum is available.</P>
    <P>I mentioned modulation five years ago when we were discussing the proposals for Agenda 2000. I was in favour of it then and I support what the Minister has achieved now &ndash; a removal of the proposed reduction of 13% in direct payments to meet future financing needs and the reduction of the proposed rate of modulation from 6% to 5%. The objective of retaining modulated funds within Ireland for rural development measures has largely been achieved. Modulation will commence in 2005 at the rate of 3%, 4% in 2006 and 5% in 2007. I agree with Senator Coonan that every endeavour should be made to retain that &euro;34 million in Agriculture House for schemes for the smaller farming sector to ensure its fruitful existence continues.</P>
    <P>When the agreed modulated system is fully <Col N="1590" />implemented, Ireland will retain over &euro;34 million per annum of the &euro;40 million that will be raised through modulation. The retention of the &euro;5,000 exemption will ensure that modulation will not apply to almost half our farmers and we should welcome that move. I congratulate the Minister again on this vital improvement. Under the original proposal, the combined effect of modulation and digression would have resulted in a massive &euro;464 million being siphoned off from direct payments between 2006 and 2012. Genuine farmers will acknowledge and appreciate what he has done.</P>
    <P>The Minister's greatest success is that the proposal for full decoupling of direct payments has been amended to allow member states a range of options to implement decoupling in a manner best suited to their agricultural requirements. Decoupling is best suited to Irish needs, apart from the slaughter premium. There is an option for full decoupling of all payments or several options can apply. In arable aid to cereals there can be full decoupling or up to 25% coupled. In the beef sector, suckler cow premium may be either fully coupled or decoupled at a level of up to 100%. If the SCP is fully coupled up to 40% of the slaughter premium may be retained as coupled. If, however, the SCP is fully decoupled, slaughter premium may be fully coupled or decoupled at any level up to 100%, or up to 75% of the special beef premium may be coupled. For sheep farmers there will be full decoupling of all premia or up to 50%. We are all aware of the huge benefits of that scheme, particularly for the west and south west, where there have been problems with overgrazing. The Commission has proposed the retention of the supplementary ewe premium as a coupled payment and the full decoupling of the ewe premium.</P>
    <P>I point to a very critical fact, however. In all cases of partial decoupling, a scheme applicant would have to retain the same stock numbers, or acreage in the case of arable aid, which would have given entitlement to a single decoupling payment in order to qualify for the remaining payment. The stock or acreage reductions would give rise to proportionate reductions in premium payments. Partial decoupling would not suit our farming needs. I urge the Minister to opt for full decoupling, except in the case of the slaughter premium.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposal for a 5% intervention price cut for cereals was withdrawn and the intervention price remains. I say, &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; to the Minister in that regard. We were screwed last year. We were also screwed by the farming organisations which control the co-operatives. We should not be afraid to say this. Let us call a spade a spade. When certain farmers tied to blockade the ports, the farming representatives said, &ldquo;Let it in; we want a cheap product.&rdquo;  It is time for that nonsense to stop.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" />I note that the monthly intervention price has been reduced by half. On the measures for young farmers, maximum support for those undertaking investments within five years of setting up has been increased from 55% to 60% in the less favoured areas and from 45% to 50% in other areas. The additional concessions secured for young farmers include more equitable calculation of single payment entitlements for those who enter farming during the reference period, and flexibility to create a national reserve using up to 3% of established entitlements, with the possibility of ring-fencing a certain percentage of entitlements for young farmers who commence farming activity after 31 December 2002.</P>
    <P>An important Member of the Oireachtas reminded me before we came into the House for this debate that the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2003 should be extended by another year by way of giving a break. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this. Also, there is the possibility of allowing young farmers who inherit farms to inherit any entitlements established by the retiring farmer. In relation to the word &ldquo;possibility&rdquo;, it would be unthinkable if those inheriting a farm, be it a son or daughter, did not inherit the entitlements that go with the farm. They have to be allowed to inherit those entitlements, with the farm. It would be unjust to do otherwise.</P>
    <P>On the general outcome, I congratulate the Minister on a job well done. The outcome of the negotiations means that the benefits of the Agenda 2000 agreement have been retained while the change in the regime will ensure a more market orientated and sustainable agriculture and food industry. The reforms agreed by the Council will come into effect from different dates, while decoupling will commence in January 2005 at the earliest, with an option to wait until January 2007. The outcome marks a major improvement on the original proposal and if we opt for full decoupling, it will also remove the burden of bureaucracy from our farmers. There is no greater single issue of importance to them. Bureaucracy is stifling them. I realise the Minister has achieved a great deal during the years. While there was always money coming in, I strongly urge that we opt for full decoupling.</P>
    <P>In my opening comments I was justifiably critical of farm leaders. I now call on them to give leadership to farmers, which is badly needed. Farm leaders who were elected to do a job should represent and lead them correctly into the future. There is a future for farmers. Farming is a tough business. I know because I have been in the game all my life and have never shirked from it. I have seen good and bad years but we have no business producing produce unless we can get it to the marketplace and the consumer. We produce a <Col N="1592" />good quality product but do we get it through our processors onto the shelf?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to bring all of the farm leaders together in the social partnership. There are more than two farm organisations. They should be brought in and let have their say but at the end of the day the Government run the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. It is a challenge to follow Senator Callanan, particularly when I agree with what he said.</P>
      <P>Earlier today we debated the Forfás consumer pricing report, published recently, and talked about the challenges facing our citizens with price increases across the board. My contribution to this debate will focus more on the consumer than the farmer.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members will excuse me but I enjoy telling the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, that his title should be &ldquo;Minister for Food and Agriculture&rdquo;. I know that is not correct alphabetically but I have always been impressed by the fact that the Minister has worn the food hat rather than just the agriculture hat. He does so again in this debate.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons I welcome the recent agreement on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The first is that it will bring Irish farming a step closer to being market-driven, a point made by Senator Callanan. Such a move is so long overdue we have to welcome it. For over 30 years the CAP has acted as a barrier between Irish farmers and the marketplace. It gave them an incentive to produce food that nobody wanted. Instead of focusing attention on meeting the real needs of the European and world consumer, this agreement will bring us a step closer to seeing the end of that policy.</P>
      <P>Some years ago Commissioner Franz Fischler, with whom the Minister appears to have a very good relationship &ndash; he seems to be able to twist his arm and get something from him that others would not be able to get &ndash; appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food. He spoke for 25 minutes after which I challenged him because he had not mentioned the customer once. He just talked about agriculture, farmers and food, with which I had a difficulty. When he came into this House a year or two later, somebody must have tipped him off to the business I was in because he mentioned customers in every second sentence of his contribution. I would like to think I had some influence in that regard, although I doubt that was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From now on, as Commissioner Fischler pointed out, Irish farmers can turn their attention to producing food for which there is a real demand in the marketplace. They can do so &ndash; this is where the real success lies &ndash; with the comfortable cushion the Minister has managed to achieve that guarantees them an income, even if <Col N="1593" />they produce nothing. For somebody in business that is difficult to understand but that is the way it is. It is a very attractive platform on which to build a business, and I am sure farmers will take full advantage of it after they have spent the usual time complaining about the terms of the latest deal. As others have said, that is what we have to expect.</P>
    <P>Looked at positively, this agreement could turn out to be the best thing that has ever happened to Irish agriculture and farming. Until now, all the links in the chain have been in place but there has not been any focus on the final link, the customer. That focus is important because it is only through the marketplace that we can build a sustainable, long-term position. The previous position, which was allowed to continue for too long, was artificial, uneconomic and doomed in the long run. By spending so much energy during the years trying to preserve what was unpreservable, Irish farming has lost an opportunity to carve out a niche for itself in what I would call the real marketplace. In terms of the opportunities lost, I am talking mainly about dairy farming.</P>
    <P>This was brought home to me about three months ago when I received a telephone call from Polish television informing me that it was examining the opportunities and threats arising from Poland joining the European Union. They sent a television crew over and asked if I would take them around an Irish supermarket. I went around with that television crew and we looked at what was on our shelves. They were very impressed to find that the only beef we sold was Irish beef, the only lamb was Irish lamb, and the only pork was Irish pork. They asked why this was so. These are businesses that are big in Poland and they felt threatened. I said that the Irish people were not willing to buy other products, that they have confidence in Irish beef, pork and lamb.</P>
    <P>However, when we turned the corner in that supermarket and came to the dairy cabinet &ndash; and it was a big supermarket and there was a long stretch of products &ndash; all the fresh milk was Irish, but practically every other product was European. There were some Irish-made products but they had been produced under licence by Irish suppliers. Here were all of these European names on these added value products. The products were not Irish, or if they were, they were Irish produced but under a different brand. In terms of Irish products pure and simple, there was virtually nothing in that added value area.</P>
    <P>This is the lost opportunity, the opportunity that we must now set out to chase. After many years of chasing the low end of the commodity market, we have to establish ourselves as premium producers at the other end of the market. The market is there, the opportunity is there. I suggest it is just a matter of having the determination, skill and ability to go after it. I believe that with a properly market-driven approach we have the possibility of building a sustainable food <Col N="1594" />industry that will bring in more, in economic terms, than it ever has done in the past or was likely to do under the old system. To succeed in that, we have to change our approach radically and utterly. We have to learn that the marketplace is the determining factor.</P>
    <P>I looked at some figures &ndash; I may not be totally accurate &ndash; and I gather that in the last 30 years we have put 540,000 tonnes of butter into intervention. I think the figure is correct. I am not great at maths but I then did a sum to find out how long it would have taken us to consume that butter ourselves. I reckoned it would have taken us 39 years to do so, if we did not produce any more. It is ridiculous that Irish farmers have been producing a product that nobody really wanted and that has been put into intervention. Producing a product that nobody wants cannot be good, even for the mental health of anybody who is in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago, I attended the CIES, the World Food Business Summit, in Barcelona. That meeting was very impressive because we covered a whole range of areas. One of the speakers was an Irishman, Bob Geldof. He is not a man I would have paid great attention to in the past, but he spoke with commitment, dedication and with a fervour that I had not heard from someone like him before, and he caught the attention of the 1,000 or 1,500 hard-headed business people who were at that convention.</P>
    <P>That is the second reason I welcome the reform of the CAP. It will free Europe, and Ireland in particular, from what I call the straitjacket of an immoral policy on world trade. As I have pointed out in this House on many occasions, it is not only the people of Europe who are affected by the Common Agricultural Policy, it is not just the citizens of Europe who have to pay a higher price in tax and health, it is the world as well. That policy has had an even greater impact on the people of the developing world, by distorting the markets that are available to them to sell their agricultural products. I am thinking in particular of Africa. Not only have we put up barriers to their selling within Europe, as we have done for the last 30 years, but we have also undermined their position in other world markets by dumping our own very heavily subsidised surpluses on them. That is unfair. These are the people who are much worse off than even the poorest people in Europe. That policy, which has been driven by the necessity to support the CAP, is immoral. That was the point Bob Geldof was making to us, correctly so, and these are words that we have used here in the past.</P>
    <P>I hope we shall now swiftly see a radical change in European policy on this key issue, not just on that area but in world trade. I have to admit that Europe is not the only offender in this regard. The United States is as bad as we are. It is probably a lot worse than we are in that area, but if we in Europe change our policy it will have the effect of putting extra moral pressure on America to do the right thing as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" />I hope this agreement will see the end of what I call the utterly hypocritical situation in which this country has been for many years. On the one hand we claim to be a friend of the developing world and we have been relatively generous in terms of development aid. Certainly, the commitment of individuals, associations and organisations has set standards of which we are very proud. At the same time we have been among the most enthusiastic supporters of a penal trade policy that has hurt most of the very countries we claim to be friends of.</P>
    <P>The hypocritical nature of this position has not been fully realised by the people of Ireland. I am glad it is receiving more attention than before. In recent times, it has been getting some of the attention that it should have got in the past. Our present policy on world trade is not one, I believe, that the people of Ireland would support if they were fully informed about it. The reason they have not been fully informed is the noise the farming lobby has always made in defending the Common Agricultural Policy. Now the need for that has been removed, or the first steps towards removing it have taken place, I hope that common sense will prevail, and that Ireland will place itself among the leaders of those in the European Union who argue for a much fairer approach to world trade.</P>
    <P>Let me just go back to something I said earlier about opportunities. Senator Mary Henry is not able to be here this afternoon but she spoke to me earlier this morning on this. She quoted the <i>New England Journal of Medicine,</i> which she holds in high regard. She talked about an article she had read in it and pointed out the clout that the low-fat lobby, a lovely term, has managed to achieve on the supermarket shelves and right around the world by arguing that low-fat is the thing to go for, that it is the healthy alternative. According to this article which Senator Henry pointed out to me, the real healthy alternative is low carbohydrates. That is an opportunity for the dairy industry. Those who see their future in the dairy industry in Ireland should recognise that this is the real health story &ndash; not low fat but low carbohydrates. If we can manage to get that message across it is an opportunity for us in Ireland to produce products that will reach supermarket shelves not just in Europe but around the world. We have the opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>One other point Senator Henry made to me is the benefit of grass fed beef rather than corn fed beef, because of the benefit of fatty acids. Practically all Irish beef, for the vast part of the year, is grass fed. However, I have been to places in the United States where the animals are fed solely from those feed lots. Clearly, there is an opportunity for us to sell not just on the basis of taste, but also on the basis of health.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister deserves considerable praise for his achievement here. He faced challenges at the Council of Ministers and has come back with a package which is suitable in a whole <Col N="1596" />lot of ways. It gives farmers a great deal more than they might otherwise have had, and the manner in which he has achieved that success certainly achieves the first steps on the long road to making sure that we in Ireland can stand with our heads held high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, to the House. In particular, I welcome the fact that he has responded so quickly to the requests made last week for a debate on this very important topic. I hope Senator Quinn will not be replacing all his good Irish carbohydrate potatoes with dairy products on his shelves because I think there is a place for both. I would not suggest that he would do that.</P>
      <P>What the Minister has achieved is quite singular and he is to be greatly commended for it. It is worth recalling that when these proposals were published they were quite devastating in their effect. There was an enormous challenge facing the Minister and his officials in dealing with the original Fischler proposals. The way they have been modified is a credit to the Minister. It demonstrates the value of experience in this area. The Minister is now the most senior of his colleagues in Europe. That was to his advantage in the context of these talks.</P>
      <P>The response of the leader of the main farming organisation on the morning the package was announced was facile. When the ministers appeared after an all-night session he suggested that the Minister for Agriculture and Food had been worn down by the Commissioner keeping them up all night, and that as a consequence his critical faculties had been somewhat eroded. The Minister has been through enough of these meetings to know that all-night sessions are a common feature. If one goes back to the time of Mark Clinton and Jim Gibbons, his predecessors, they did exactly the same thing, so it is not new. If one is going to cut a deal one is obviously going to stay there to do it. Many a farmer has stood all day long at a crossroads in various places around the country, with a couple of cattle, in the knowledge that by the time they went home that evening the deal would be cut. They stayed there until it was done. The Minister's experience of west Cork stood to him in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was a singular achievement to obtain what has been obtained, as it was the most difficult of these rounds of negotiations. We have to accept certain realities. The European Union had to achieve a favourable position in advance of the WTO round. There was a need for reform of the CAP itself, independently of that, but to imagine that we could have gone into a WTO round and that within that round we could have continued to keep product price support as a central element of the Common Agricultural Policy would have been to deceive ourselves. I note that the Minister has said, in a very significant statement, that this is his bottom line with regard to the WTO. I welcome that and I am confident that <Col N="1597" />the European Union will maintain that position within the WTO round as it develops.</P>
    <P>A central achievement has been the protection of the Common Agricultural Policy. I support Senator Callanan's statement, and I will be more explicit, that it was quite disingenuous for the leader of the main farming organisation to denounce the deal on radio within a very short time of its finalisation. It was apparent that his statement had been prepared well in advance of the eventual outcome, and that irrespective of what the outcome had been, it would have been treated in exactly the same way. It was obvious that a pre-ordained position had been adopted. Irrespective of what the Minister might achieve at 7.30 a.m., this was the line that would be disseminated on the national media. That is wrong and does no credit to any farming organisation. Any deal of whatever description should be subject to the most severe scrutiny and criticism if that is what is required, but it should be on the basis of the facts. This was not on the basis of the facts. It had been predetermined.</P>
    <P>This train was on the tracks even before the original Fischler proposals emerged. It was going in this direction and decoupling was likely to be a serious feature of it. The only question was what station this train would arrive at. The Minister saw to it that the train arrived at the right station, despite all its deficiencies.</P>
    <P>There has been a central conundrum confronting European agriculture since we joined the European Union. It has become more apparent as time has gone on. That conundrum is how we reconcile the need to have an industry that is competitive and responsive to the market and gives the consumer what they want, with protecting farm incomes and keeping the maximum number of people on the land. Attempting to resolve this conundrum has created round after round of talks. It is possible to square this circle, if I may use that expression. It has been done, or at least has begun. It is now possible to maintain farm income while bringing the industry close to the market.</P>
    <P>The point was made on the difficulty of continuing with 150,000 tonnes of butter in intervention. How do we continue that system to ensure that incomes are protected? The answer is that we do not continue that system to protect incomes. If we do, the European taxpayer, and indeed the Irish taxpayer, will ask, quite rightly, what we are doing with all this uneaten food in storage, piled there despite starving people throughout the world. How can anybody resolve or defend that? It is becoming increasingly difficult to defend it.</P>
    <P>Intervention was required in the past and has been used, but it has had a deleterious effect on Irish farming and the capacity of the agricultural industry to compete internationally. It got to the point that the producer produced, the co-op took it away, put it into the intervention store and was paid for it. That is not the way forward for Irish agriculture. That is not the way to protect farm <Col N="1598" />incomes or farmers. If Irish farmers have shown anything, it is a capacity to respond to the signals that come from the marketplace and Europe. If anybody doubts that, all they have to do is think back to the 1970s when we joined the Common Market and the rapidity with which the Irish farming industry responded to the signals that emerged.</P>
    <P>I started farming before we joined the Common Market and I can remember how difficult it was. At that age it did not matter a damn to me. At the age of 21, one does not mind. One is prepared to work night and day and do everything that is required. That is one of the huge deficiencies in what has been preached over the years, and the Minister has referred to it. If young people, when they get up every morning, are fed on a diet of how terrible things are, is it any wonder that they walk away from the industry? Can anybody be surprised about it? I made that same point in the Minister of State's constituency, at the Forum for Europe in Loughrea, when a young man at the front of the audience stood up, after hearing all the prophets of doom, and said he was very glad to hear what I had to say as he had not heard that before. He wanted to start farming and had the capacity and enthusiasm to do it. For goodness' sake, let us encourage these young people to ensure the industry progresses in a vigorous and optimistic way.</P>
    <P>There is more to this than just food, <i>per se.</i> Farm incomes have been supported through the product price. There are now other elements that are becoming more important. One of these is the environmental element, which has been partially dealt with in REPS. Increasingly, European society is asking farmers to be the custodians of the countryside and the environment, which is as it should be. If they are to succeed in this they have to be supported, in the same way as the price of the product has been supported in the past.</P>
    <P>That is where the opportunity lies for us, in going to the marketplace with products that have been produced from the best grass in the best land in the best environment in the European Union. That is what the consumer wants and will pay for. We have the capacity to harness those things and unite them to the benefit of Irish farming.</P>
    <P>Quality is a <i>sine qua non. </i>It was stated at the outset of the Common Market that all the tomato production would move to the Mediterranean countries and leave Holland, as it was based on expensive fuel in Holland and could not compete with outdoor tomatoes in the Mediterranean region. What was the outcome? The Dutch tomato industry survived and prospered because even then people were prepared to pay for quality, which is what they wanted. That is something we have to keep firmly in our minds.</P>
    <P>Without question, the <i>status quo</i> was not an option. It had to be changed and the Minister did a good job in ensuring that the change will be managed to the best effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" />Senator Callanan spoke about decoupling. I agree with his comments. It was evident when the Fischler proposals were produced that the IFA thought there should not be decoupling. It then discovered that an increasing number of its members and commercial farmers were prepared to accept decoupling provided their incomes were guaranteed. Suddenly there was a slight change of emphasis. The farming organisations have a responsibility to keep in touch with their members.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn's comments on developing countries. Relative to the United States, the European Union's record on support for developing countries is good. Ireland, in particular, has a good record in providing overseas development aid. We also have responsibilities to ensure that products are not dumped on countries trying to develop their agricultural sectors from a small base. In addition, we must accept that we are wealthy and they are poor.</P>
    <P>I found it significant, during the proceedings of the Forum on the Future of Europe, that a question I posed on this issue to one of the non-governmental organisations active in this area elicited an immediate defensive reaction from farming organisations, which insisted they were doing everything they could in this regard. This is incorrect. If 150,000 tonnes of butter is in store, it should be used. At the same time, we must also recognise that many countries would not accept certain products on various grounds, including religious and social reasons. Nevertheless, it is wrong to have food stores while people are starving. Somebody must pay for this.</P>
    <P>I am not sure I agree with Senator Coonan that farmers are angry. While definitely apprehensive and fearful about the future, they are, as I stated earlier, realists who knew changes were necessary. Farmers are now asking who will guide and lead them in a manner which allows them to survive in the new environment.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a point I have made repeatedly in the House. The dairy industry, the wider agricultural community, Teagasc and the research centres must bring forward the required solutions in terms of the need to change production and processing to a lower cost base. While I am prepared to accept that Teagasc has to make cuts because of its financial position, in every circumstance the emphasis must be on closing its offices in towns, while retaining its staff performing basic research rural research centres. Technology has diminished the need for farmers to visit Teagasc offices in towns, which farmers try to avoid in any case because of congestion and so forth. It is of fundamental importance that the basic research required to modify the industry and enable it to develop in the way it should is carried out.</P>
    <P>There is also an onus on us as farmers to change our thinking, which traditionally has been based on the philosophy of intervention and market clearing produce away. We need to change our approach to ensure, as Senator Quinn stated, <Col N="1600" />that we produce food the market wants and of a quality for which it is prepared to pay and reward us. In circumstances such as these in which there will inevitably be casualties, the European Union has the responsibility to ensure the incomes of farmers are underpinned through direct payments and decoupling, whether in recognition of their role as guardians of the environment or for wider social reasons.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Callanan's remarks on the issue of inheritance of entitlement. I transferred my farm to my son last October. I can think of few farms in my area, many of which are large commercial units, in which the next generation is coming through. This returns us to the point that constantly telling people there is no future will lead them to walk away from the sector despite its opportunities.</P>
    <P>Paddy O'Keeffe was editor of the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> for a long time. Having worked under him, I am familiar with his ability. Now in his 80s, he is also a leading dairy farmer in County Cork. If some of the younger people had his vision or attitude, much could be achieved. Writing in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>of 28 June 2003, he stated:</P>
    <P>Survival in dairying is still possible but will require concentrated action by farmer, creamery and state agencies. Closing the income gap will not be easy, yet effective savings are within our grasp. Cost cutting has been debated for long. The matter is now urgent. . . . . Tighter management can redeem the Fischler losses. Better creamery performance could bring us further. We must next plan to consolidate with added progress in low-cost dairying. Moorepark must face the challenge of further cuts in concentrate use and silage needs. Higher protein levels, labour and management convenience and healthier dairy stock must be targeted. All this will require investment in product research. To ensure the future farmers must participate with the state in funding such research. Relative to potential return the cost is small.</P>
    <P>If the writer, with his experience of the industry, is able to take such a position, I wonder about some of the other comments I have been hearing. A transformation in the national mindset is required to tackle the challenge ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and the Minister for his presence earlier. Last year, during one of the current Seanad's first meetings, we debated at length the then imminent second referendum on the Nice treaty. One of the fundamental arguments in favour of the treaty, which all parties in the House supported, was that rejection would create a climate in which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, as the office was known then, would be forced travel to negotiations in Brussels with one hand tied behind his back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a major difference between the orig<Col N="1601" />inal Fischler proposals and the agreement which emerged in Luxembourg last week. It must be recognised that significant advances have been made, even if the proposals will not be acceptable to all the farming organisations or the public at large. If the Minister had been capable of pleasing everybody, he would not be in Kildare Street but in the hot seat in Europe, possibly in Mr. Cox's position. The proposals in what is known is the Luxembourg deal are a major improvement on the original proposals.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important issue. Emerging from the talks in Luxembourg, Dr. Franz Fischler hailed the agreement as marking the beginning of a new era which would change the way the European Union relates to farming. He is correct in that the reform proposals are a radical departure and represent a seismic shift away from the old Common Agricultural Policy. A core principle of the talks was to break the link between subsidies and production, which has been fundamental in the Common Agricultural Policy to date and correctly regarded as incentivising over-production and rewarding inefficiency.</P>
    <P>This approach had to end, also because it was a barrier to dialogue on the new World Trade Organisation round due to take place in Cancun in September. Participants in these talks will discuss the dumping of subsidised produce on developing country markets at the expense of local producers. Senators Dardis and Quinn noted that, as a country which in many respects claims to be a friend of poorer, developing countries, our actions to date have not reflected this ethos.</P>
    <P>The deal on the CAP does not mean the European Union no longer has a common agricultural policy, nor is it contended that it is about saving money. We will retain the Common Agricultural Policy in a different form and annual spending in the farm sector will remain at &euro;40 billion until 2006, increasing to &euro;48.5 billion by 2003. This accounts for roughly half of the European Union budget, a massive sum of money by any standards.</P>
    <P>Average payments this year are running at &euro;13,000 per head. The reform will mean these will be paid in the form of a single cheque and will be subject to environmental and animal health standards. Senator Dardis is correct that farmers were viewed within the European project as the custodians of the environment. However, we have to be realistic when so much money is at stake. Certain responsibilities and conditions must attach to how this money is spent, one of which is that payments should be subject to environmental and animal health considerations.</P>
    <P>Many participants will not be pleased with the results of the negotiations. While it was not unusual to listen to the reaction, broadcast on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, the morning after they had concluded, it is difficult to believe anybody at that early hour could have been in a position to provide a considered view of the outcome unless they <Col N="1602" />had participated in the negotiations. It will require a more considered response than initial comments or short critical statements. Much of the detail will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Commission and the anti-CAP lobby, led by Britain, would have been appeased by decoupling, while France has been spared much pain by the decisions taken on the cereal sector. Consumers should benefit from falling prices and improved quality. Consideration must be given to a consumer friendly outcome. Competitive pricing and improved product quality will be beneficial.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 27,000 dairy farmers will suffer. I spoke to a number of young farmers last week who pointed out that dairy farming had been a lucrative sector, especially for those starting in farming. The future now appears uncertain, even though the bulk of the cut had been decided in 1999 under Agenda 2000. The Minister has indicated that the amount of pain endured will depend on how each farmer reacts to changing market realities. A substantial switch in production from butter to high value dairy products such as cheese has been long overdue. The reforms contain an important element of national discretion in phasing. Such flexibility should allow welcome room in encouraging the beef industry to focus more on a higher quality premium product.</P>
    <P>The national president of Macra na Feirme said the new reform deal had the potential to change the face of Irish and European agriculture, while the president of the ICSFA said the Minister had succeeded in negotiating for Ireland an opportunity that would save the vital &euro;1 billion annual support payments for the livestock sector. He urged farmers, especially those in his organisation, to support full decoupling, saying it would save them &euro;420 million, which the Commission had sought in direct income supports in the original agreement. These are conflicting viewpoints. The Commissioner, Franz Fischler, pointed out that in future many farmers would seek full decoupling. That would be an interesting development, although it is likely to happen later rather than sooner.</P>
    <P>The new deal will reduce the amount of paperwork associated with direct payments. This has been referred to in previous agriculture debates in the House. Participants in schemes were being turned off by the amount of red tape, bureaucracy and paper chasing involved.</P>
    <P>The agreement allows member states a number of options when implementing decoupling and to do so in a manner that suits their requirements. I welcome the fact that the new arrangements will allow a substantial amount of direct payments to qualify as domestic supports. It means it cannot be challenged in the forthcoming WTO talks in September.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he would initiate a large public consultation process on the reforms, which is to be welcomed. I hope it will not only involve sectoral interests such as the farming <Col N="1603" />organisations but also members of the public, including consumers and rural dwellers, from which a consensus will emerge. I understand advertisements regarding the process will be published shortly. The Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, one of the smallest representative groups for farmers in the country, is not party to the partnership agreement, which is probably the vehicle many of the other farming organisations &ndash; the IFA, the ICMSA, ICOS, Macra na Feirme etc. &ndash; will use to implement the new deal. In view of this, I hope the Minster will widen the consultative process to include groups not involved in partnership and who would not, therefore, have a means of implementing the plan in a way that suits their needs.</P>
    <P>Given that the agreement was concluded only after many days and nights of negotiations, it puts Ireland and the European Union in an offensive position when approaching the WTO talks next September. They can justifiably demand concessions from trading partners in return. It is now for our friends in America and elsewhere to make the next move. American has recently revived its system of supports and massively increased its trade distorting agricultural subsidies. By contrast, there has been inverted progress on the European side.</P>
    <P>The new Luxembourg deal, as it has been termed, puts an end to the old system of subsidies which encouraged overproduction and distorted world trade. In consequence, European agriculture policy will change fundamentally. In future products will become more competitive and agriculture policy will be greener and become more trade and consumer friendly. That in itself will have made the deal worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on a job well done in Brussels. It was an excellent performance for which he deserves the congratulations of the House. I also commend the Ministers of State, Deputies Treacy and Aylward, and the negotiating team. A great deal was agreed for Ireland, despite tough opposition.</P>
      <P>I especially welcome the preservation of the financial advances agreed under the Agenda 2000 accord and the agreement on policies which will grant farmers the latitude necessary to accommodate to changing demands and conditions. Even before the negotiations last month, the Minister had already achieved modifications to the Commission's proposals. In particular, he won concessions for young farmers who entered the industry during the reference period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission first suggested that payment entitlements would be calculated by multiplying the average number of animals in the three year reference period by the premium rate for 2002 and dividing by the average number of hectares in the three year reference period. This calculation would mean the number and value of entitlements would be less for a young farmer farming in one or two of the reference years than if he had <Col N="1604" />been farming for the three years of the reference period. Following representations from the Minister, the Commission agreed that the average in such cases should be obtained by dividing by two where the farmer was farming for only two years of the reference period or by taking one year as the average where the farmer was farming for only one year of the reference period.</P>
    <P>It is to be especially welcomed that the maximum support for young farmers undertaking investments within five years of setting up has been increased to 60% in less favoured areas and to 50% in other areas. Further changes which the Minister for Agriculture and Food negotiated include the flexibility option to create a national reserve by using up to 3% of established entitlements with the possibility of ring-fencing a certain percentage of entitlements for young farmers who commenced farming activity after 31 December 2002. The Minister negotiated also a provision to allow young farmers who inherit farms to inherit any entitlements established by the retiring farmer. Other changes secured during the negotiations include the provision which makes the farm advisory system or farm audit voluntary for all farmers, a provision whereby the national reserve may be used for certain early retirement cases and a provision to allow special payment entitlements for certain dairy and other farmers to be traded in the same way as single payment entitlements.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on obtaining European Council agreement to amend the proposal for full decoupling of direct payments to provide member states with a number of options to implement decoupling in a manner best suited to their requirements. An immediate implementation of decoupling would, naturally, be too draconian a change. I welcome the Minister's commitment to negotiating with the social partners to work out the best way in which to implement the changes.</P>
    <P>In the dairy sector, the original proposals allowed for compensation for the intervention price reductions at the level which applied in the Agenda 2000 agreement, or 56%. The Minister has achieved compensation of approximately 80% for the additional intervention price reduction of over 4% which is now agreed. The compensation will be paid through a dairy cow premium. In total, losses to the dairy sector from the net effect of the 4% intervention price reduction and the increase in the dairy cow premium will be less than &euro;14 million a year. The Minister was correct to stress that the intervention price reduction will have effect only if product is sold to intervention. While this represents a decrease in intervention, if a farmer is not tied to or dependent on it, there is no reason prices should be reduced by that, or any, amount. If product is sold on the market, as it should be, there may be no loss at all and it is possible, subject to market prices, that there could be substantial gains. The Prospectus study published by the Minister earlier in the year emphasised clearly <Col N="1605" />the need to increase the product range of the Irish dairy industry. Selling to intervention is not a feasible long-term option.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the outcome of the negotiations means the benefits of the Agenda 2000 agreement have been retained while the changes to the policy framework will ensure a realistic agriculture and food industry which is more market orientated and sustainable. The outcome is well balanced and a new dispensation has been created which clearly seeks to adapt the Common Agricultural Policy to the 21st century. We can face the future with confidence. Stability is essential and the deal we have made delivers it by removing the uncertainty of recent months. The challenge we all face is to handle the change from old to new in a co-operative and consensual way which enables agriculture and all who work in it to look ahead with anticipation and assurance.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, his Ministers of State, Deputy Treacy and Deputy Aylward, and everyone else on the negotiating team once again.</P>

      <P>The overwhelming feeling of many in the European farming community is that Commissioner Fishler's Common Agricultural Policy proposals foster a state of uncertainty and a distortion of competition among farmers, among and within sectors and among regions and member states. Subsidies are said simply to have been repackaged and farmers are being asked once again to pay the price while their livelihoods are on the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first major CAP reform for over a decade promises to reconstitute the basis on which the system has operated since it was established in 1958. Instead of being guaranteed an outlet for everything they produce, farmers will be expected to adapt to market demands giving rise to arguments that the CAP reforms are driven by the <Col N="1606" />world trade agenda. While the entry of ten new members, many with large and inefficient farming sectors, may be the official reason for the reforms, there have also been demands for change from European consumers who are upset by food safety scares and increasing concerns about the Common Agricultural Policy's impact on the rural environment. Mounting pressure from other World Trade Organisation members has been at least as important.</P>
    <P>The new CAP reform deal agreed last week indicates that huge losses will be suffered at individual farm and dairy sector level and in the national economy. The inescapable fact about the impact of the Fischler proposals on Ireland is that our dairy farmers who make up the main commercial core of Irish farming will lose out disproportionately as a result of these landmark EU reforms. &ldquo;Reform&rdquo; is the word on which we must concentrate. The emphasis of the proposals has changed. What we now bandy about as CAP reform was originally intended to be a review. This emphasis makes a huge difference to our dairy farmers. The annual losses in the dairy sector are projected to be &euro;113 million per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm leaders.</P>
      <P>When the proposals were first mooted in July 2002, there was no mention of reform or review of the dairy sector. Now, however, this devastating blow has been dealt. Jobs will be lost, farms will be abandoned and communities and individuals will suffer. The IFA estimates that up to 10,000 dairy farming jobs will be lost with 3,000 more in the processing sector. These figures are dismissed by Commissioner Fischler but the indications are that the Irish dairy industry stands to lose &euro;339 million by 2007, with a far reaching effect on the economy.</P>
      <P>Ireland's loss will be a gain for countries such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand. Poorer countries in Africa and Latin America also stand to gain from this disaster for Irish farming. They will gain because they can produce food more efficiently and in greater quantities than we can and because their sectors are not being undermined by subsidised exports from Europe. What is seen as a long-term plan for sustainable agriculture within the European Union could more suitably be described as a development driven by the world trade agenda. The Fischler reform involves a shift away from Irish and European dairy farmers towards farmers in low cost developed countries such as New Zealand and Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With 27,000 Irish dairy farmers facing losses of up to one third of their annual income, rural areas are reacting strongly and their voices will be heard in the local elections. The decoupling of direct payments from production, as intended by Commissioner Fischler, will achieve two WTO related objectives. First, decoupled payments are classified under the WTO as supports that are <Col N="1607" />non-trade distorting. They are known as &ldquo;green box&rdquo; supports. Second, the analysis indicates that farm production in the European Union, including Ireland, will fall when there is decoupling. This will result in the European Union largely withdrawing from export markets and increasing its imports of food products, with disastrous consequences for farming in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the current policy, a dairy farmer with a 40,000 gallon quota has an average income of &euro;22,296. Under the new system, his or her income will fall to &euro;15,443, a reduction of &euro;6,900. This is an income loss of approximately 30% as a result of the agreement. Although Ministers have agreed the broad outline of the proposals, implementation in its finer detail rests with negotiation at national level. The Commission's final paper of 26 June stated every country had the right to an agricultural policy of its own, provided it was sustainable and avoided or limited trade distortion. It is up to the Government to fulfil its promises to the farming sector and fight within this provision for its future. Certainty is needed in order that farmers can plan ahead. The Minister must make a speedy decision on the level of decoupling he intends to implement.</P>
    <P>As Ireland exports almost 90% of its produce, the impact of this new deal will be felt to a greater degree in this country than in other member states. In County Longford, designated a deprived area having both CLÁR and RAPID programme status, the current figure of 265 dairy farmers will drop by 100 in the next two years. With an average milk quota of 35,000 gallons, these farmers are earning far less than &euro;20,000 per annum. There are 2,700 registered farmers in the county, of whom only 20% are full-time farmers. The average farm size is only 70 acres.</P>
    <P>The county's farmers are suffering enough. The blow of CAP reform falls on top of the closure last week of the Glanbia meat processing plant in Rooskey, which borders on the county. It employed a number of Longford farmers. How much more can these farmers be expected to take? If it is the Government's policy to drive farmers off the land, it is at least succeeding in that regard. However, it is a success that will, in the not too distant future, come back to haunt it.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would remove some of the red tape involved in farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened attentively to speakers in this important debate and compliment them on the sincerity of their contributions. The deal is done. From a farming point of view, we must con<Col N="1608" />sider where we go from here and where profits can be made.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about the dairy sector. Recently an IFA bulletin outlined where the money paid for the gallon of milk went. It described it as a rip off by retailers and caterers. The organisation has to tackle this. The large supermarkets get 35% of the average retail price of branded milk for simply providing shelf space for a few hours. Farmers have to deal with this. The IFA also pointed out that the catering trade, which accounts for over 16% of milk sales, charged up to ten times the producer price. It is the equivalent of approximately &euro;3 a litre. The farmer only gets 31 cent a litre. Overall, the farmer gets about 38%; the dairy, 26% and the retailer, more than 35% of the price of a gallon of milk. From the point of view of dairying, this must be seriously examined. That is the only point that people have mentioned to me in those talks which might give rise to some slight losses.</P>
      <P>Farmers look at savings and those of us who are in farming &ndash; I am a member of the IFA and do some farming &ndash; look at where we are going and we have to make hard decisions now. If the prices that farmers were given for store cattle in the spring continue they are not going to make money from what is predicted by the experts for the finished product. We have to make up our minds that we are in that market and if we want to make money and stay there, we have to think twice about the type of prices that we are given. In some cases we are competing with part-time farmers who use their stock as lawnmowers to consume the grass in summertime. A farmer cannot compete with that type of individual for whom farming is a hobby.</P>
      <P>I read recently in the newspaper that when Grange Research looked at stock management they said that 20 hours per week was the most a livestock farmer with 70 units should spend looking after the livestock. That research also said that there are many more farmers who must look at alternative incomes because there is little use in spending all week walking around a farm if 20 hours is sufficient to look after 70 to 100 stock.</P>
      <P>We need to consider the position with regard to land and, while it may not be relevant, the Minister must look at that and how a young farmer who wants to expand his holding can compete against the speculators who own a substantial amount of land. We see people who receive in excess of &euro;10,000 an acre for land and ask how can a young farmer buy land that comes up for sale when there is that type of money available? That has to be looked at with regard to the people who can purchase farm land and continue in farming, if we want to keep them in farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to look at encouraging young farmers. Continuing to talk down farming is like talking about a hospital &ndash; talk it down and it will close itself. Talk down farming and there will be no young farmers. In the past I argued against the IFA on the deal struck on the farm retirement <Col N="1609" />scheme when it was introduced. It looked all right on paper but it was not index linked. Where is it now? When young farmers took over the farms from their parents, their fathers took a pension at that time but because it was not index linked, they are still on the pension they were on when they took it out. That has to be examined in terms of encouraging the farmers who own farms to hand them over. The age profile of farmers was mentioned earlier and if we want young, active, green-cert trained farmers to take over, we have to make sure that there is an income there for them, which no doubt there will be. We also want to ensure that the farmer, the father, the uncle, or whoever is handing over the farm, will have a pension adequate to meet his needs.</P>
    <P>The CAP reform proposals also state that more funding for rural development has to be moved in and be of benefit in the rural areas where there will be an advantage for farmers and hopefully an opportunity for alternative employment. We need to look at that aspect. The number of farming bodies has been mentioned earlier and if anyone here was a Minister for Agriculture and Food trying to get the best possible deal for the farmers and one was listening to, for example, the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICSA, ICOS, and the Hill Sheep Farmers, each with a different demand, one would have to wonder why the farming organisations do not now take a step in the right direction and amalgamate, with one overall farming body to look after the interests of the farmers in this small country. They could have sub-committees for young farmers, dairying, sheep, hill farming, or whatever, but under one umbrella group. That has to be done from a farming point of view and as a member of a farming organisation I urge them to do this. When the Minister was on television the morning after the negotiations he was surrounded by farming organisations from Ireland. Farmers in the USA would not have as many farming organisations looking after their interests. I do not know how one can deal with that point.</P>
    <P>With regard to the negotiations for the dairy farmer, we have to look at allowing young farmers who are coming in with small quotas an opportunity to get an increased quota from whatever surpluses or quotas are available. We must look at the smaller producer to allow him to develop and expand. I have no doubt that dairy farmers work hard. In the past they have done reasonably well from farming, far better than farmers with dry stock or that type of enterprise. We hope that they will be allowed to expand to a reasonable gallonage so that they can make a living for themselves and their families. I have seen many farmers in my time but very few retired or finished or sold out as millionaires. Most farmers worked hard, earned a good living and were always able to pay their way and that is what it is about. There is too much emphasis in all sections of life on becoming a multi-millionaire no matter in what business people are involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" />I congratulate the Minister on the successful negotiations that he completed for the people. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, and his officials deserve great credit. Many good speakers have made many good points and we look forward to that continuing during the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what people perhaps believe, there is a significant number of farmers in the Dáil constituency which I unsuccessfully contested in June and they were not rallying to my support. Apart from that, as I think the Minister knows, I have long had an interest in the CAP and in the dilemma of developing a way of sustaining life in agriculture and related activities and sustaining life in rural areas, while not creating the sort of monster that the Common Agriculture Policy was threatening to become when Commissioner MacSharry began the process of rethinking it.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the Minister's speech. I remember Seamus Mallon once calling the Good Friday Agreement &ldquo;Sunningdale for slow learners&rdquo;. I have a feeling that the process of re-evaluating the CAP has a similar element. When one hears the sort of figures that the Minister quoted &ndash; that in the last four years we still accounted for between 27% and 35% of butter in intervention, though we only have an 8% share of production &ndash; one sees that there seems to be some slow learning in that sector. Farmers are slow learners if they do not realise that there is no future in intervention, for it can be short or medium-term but in the long term an industry cannot be so focused on intervention. The case is similar when the Minister quotes the figures for our reliance on bulk commodities in comparison with such countries as Denmark and the Netherlands. In any attempt to analyse the outcome of these or other CAP negotiations it is worthwhile asking the reason our agriculture and food sector seems to learn so slowly the lesson that others seem to have learned and grasped, though they were involved before us, that there must be a fundamental reappraisal.</P>
      <P>Let us be very realistic. No one seems to be sure any more how many farmers there are in the country but I estimate their number at around 100,000. There are at least 3.5 million consumers, excluding farmers entirely, though they are consumers, too. To a degree, tails have been wagging dogs here for a long time. I repeat that I have absolutely no objection &ndash; quite the opposite &ndash; to creative interventions using redistributive, taxation based measures to sustain a dignified, worthwhile life for the maximum number in rural Ireland. This country is becoming dangerously over-urbanised without planning or thought, and we are in danger of turning our capital city into a fairly horrible place to live. One of our proper social objectives should be to reduce both the tendency and the necessity to move out of rural areas into urban ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" />It is interesting that young people's value systems and their ideas about where to live have been transformed. Anyone who lives in a university city or town, or anywhere with a third level college, will contrast those places with what they were like 30 years ago or even further back. When the Minister and I were students, they would not have dreamed of going home at weekends. The place to be was the big city. Now, every Friday afternoon &ndash; not for economic reasons &ndash; there is a mass exodus to small country towns and rural areas by our otherwise urbanised students, for the quality of life for many of them is better in their home areas than in big, urban areas such as Dublin and Cork. That is quite an extraordinary statement, for the belief was that youngsters were drawn by the bright lights of the city but the evidence is overwhelming that that is not happening.</P>
    <P>I am not even madly keen on the concept of the Common Agricultural Policy since, as a policy to sustain rural living through agriculture and other activities, it is pushing an open door regarding the inclinations of many young people and where they desire to live. However, it cannot be separated from some of the daftness taking over about rural house-building, for instance. I know that there is a national spatial strategy but there is a need to look far beyond agriculture and production, dealing instead with agriculture and rural living. It cannot be right that we have an objective of maximising living in rural areas based on farming of some form, at the same time making it almost impossible for many young people to build a house in the areas where they would otherwise wish to live.</P>

There is no overall electoral advantage in pretending to farmers or urban Ireland that the old way of the Common Agricultural Policy was sustainable. The German taxpayer cannot keep us in the lifestyle to which we have become accustomed. It is as simple as that, we have to get real. Once, within the last three years, the IFA came to talk to the Joint Committee on European Affairs and in a half hour presentation by the then president, now a Minister of State, the words &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; and &ldquo;market&rdquo; were never mentioned. I find it astonishing that an organisation <Col N="1612" />which represents producers who wish to sell into the marketplace never mentioned them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him and his team of officials on their success, by no means for the first time, in overcoming difficult negotiating hurdles, to all intents and purposes preserving the interests both of the farming sector and, simultaneously, the country at large. I sometimes believe our farm organisations do not always give the Minister credit, to put it mildly, for what he has succeeded in doing. He has immense experience and has essentially been at the negotiating table as Minister, and briefly as Minister of State, for the best part of 16 years. During that period we have managed to get as much out of the negotiations as has been possible.</P>
      <P>I will give an illustration of what the Minister is up against. I came across this at random as a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service. It is a report on a seminar held in Helsinki in February, The New Financial Framework &ndash; Challenging EU Road to the Future, detailing how the UK delegation expressed dissatisfaction with the rate of reform of the CAP to date and the need for agriculture to have an ever reducing role within the European Union. One can open <i>The Economist, The Sunday Times</i> and so on. It is not simply reform of the CAP that they want but abolition as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister, with allies in Europe &ndash; I suppose the French are leading them &ndash; has put up a good battle to prevent agriculture being written out of the equation. The sickening thing about it is that the British Government, when it reaches the negotiating table, wishes to protect the interests of the largest farmers. It is the old adage that socialism is for the rich and capitalism for the poor. One hears Lord Walston crowing about how many million euro he collects each year from the CAP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foot and mouth disease episode showed very clearly that there was an identity of interests in this country between the farming and urban communities. At this stage that is well understood. About two weeks ago a brochure was launched in County Tipperary seeking industrial promotion and decentralisation. The front cover showed lush green fields against the Galtee Mountains with the caption, &ldquo;How would you <Col N="1613" />like your office to look out on this?&rdquo;  It shows the interdependence between our towns and the surrounding countryside. That is clear also in relation to tourism.</P>
    <P>The overall amount of money available for farming was secured a few months ago to 2013. The Minister has managed to negotiate a wide range of options which he can discuss in further detail with the social partners. It is good that they include the farm organisations which are there to discuss and negotiate with. Decoupling is the big issue in each sector. It appears the Minister has a wide margin of flexibility and also a fund to provide support for valuable schemes such as the REPS.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan, whom I had the privilege to hear, made a very interesting contribution. I agree with him on the importance of confidence in farming. The problem is that most of the time farm organisations have to paint the picture in fairly lurid colours which has the disadvantage of not giving any great message of confidence for the future. No one can pretend that farming will be an easy occupation because of all the pressures. The comparative living standard it can offer has undoubtedly declined and nobody has been able to do a huge amount about this during the past 20 or 30 years. There is a process of evolution and adaptation and if it is done sufficiently gradually, that adaptation can take place without too much disruption. If there was abrupt change, as some member states want, there would be huge problems.</P>
    <P>Countries such as the United States are not in any position to moralise given the amount of support they give to farming. We are apt to forget in the argument about developing countries that the European Union is the biggest importer of foodstuffs from developing countries by a long shot. It is of vital interest that large tracts of land are not abandoned. It is important to maintain land use and the industries it supports to keep the rural and social community alive. The Minister has provided good breathing space for the next few years as a result of the negotiations, on which I congratulate him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Acting Chairman's efforts to allow me make my contribution. I welcome the Minister to the House for this debate. I acknowledge the difficult situation he had to encounter during the past fortnight in negotiating what has transpired. Most understand decoupling means separating land from production. I see this as separating the farmer from the land from hereon. Despite the Minister's best efforts, Commissioner Fischler has clearly indicated he wants to revolutionise the agriculture industry in Europe. In so doing he wants to displace as many farmers as possible from the land. He sees them as an inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The World Trade Organisation is driving the <Col N="1614" />whole agenda. We are non-existent in terms of ranking with regard to the WTO. The package negotiated cannot be viewed as anything other than a redundancy package for so many farmers here. Members on the other side tell us not to be negative, not to talk down agriculture as there is a future. That is fine but the reality is much different. We do not have to talk down agriculture any more because farmers are gone. In some areas there may be pockets of the most profitable forms of agriculture but the west is becoming denuded of young farmers. We have part-time farmers. This is the first step out the gate, never to return. There are reasons for this.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that two weeks ago in this House, his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, gave a guarantee, following strike action at his Department's offices, that additional resources and overtime would be provided for personnel in the Department to process REPS and other scheme applications, apart altogether from the provision for certification of animals to allow movement. I regret I have learned today that the provision for overtime working has been withdrawn breaking an element of the negotiated strike settlement. During the negotiations we were told clearly and distinctively that resources would be provided to facilitate overtime working. Since the ending of the strike not one REPS application pending for nine months in south Galway has been cleared for payment nor has even one additional new application been processed. If that is the response, it is regrettable. I ask the Minister to intervene as a matter of urgency to rectify the situation. What other sector which depends on such payments for a sizeable proportion of its income would wait an additional nine months? </P>
    <P>I wish to make one further plea.</P>

      <P>When we use the words, &ldquo;from the farm gate to the plate&rdquo;, we eliminate the farmer from the process. Bord Bia can call on a restaurant owner and ask from where he or she gets his or her meat. In reply the owner can say he or she produces it on his or her farm and processes it and that it is quality Irish beef. If one wishes to secure certification under the Bord Bia stamp of approval, one has to obtain it through an authorised agency. The authorised agency named a particular supplier who had been traced as having most of his beef sourced outside the State from third countries. Is that what we want for Irish farming? Is that not a kick in the teeth for Irish farming? This is being done by Bord Bia, an agency of the Department. It is time the Minister rectified this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Joe Walsh Mr. Joe Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate. By and large, the contributions were positive and objective. Some concerns were raised, including those raised by Senator Ulick Burke, which were not germane to the mid-term review. They included the CPSU strike and Bord Bia, matters I will take up. The Common Agricultural Policy has been reformed on a number of occasions. The first reform was carried out under former Minister Austin Deasy and dealt with the introduction of milk quotas. Then we had the MacSharry reforms which tried to shift support from product to individual producer. We had the Agenda 2000 reforms in 1999 and now we have the mid-term review reforms. What is consistent about all these reforms is the hostile and negative reaction from farm spokespersons.</P>
      <P>When former Minister Austin Deasy introduced milk quotas, he was regarded as Cromwellian and so too was former Commissioner MacSharry in his time. We should not try to reverse the improvements in the development of the CAP because it needed to be developed and modernised. It was introduced after the war to secure a food supply for Europe. The original model put in place was overly successful in doing that and as a result we had to got rid of surpluses. I am pleased that individual speakers have made the point over and over that to continue converting raw material produced by farmers into products for which there is no consumer is not a sustainable way for the future.</P>
      <P>In the dairy sector we have almost 200,000 tonnes of both butter and skimmed milk already in storage. It is absurd that any leadership could give vent to a policy of saying that we should continue with increasing that commodity type of product storage into the future. It is even worse than that as it misdirects farmer producers from the real market situation. People ask where is the market. It is here at home. Senator Quinn said one could go along rows in his supermarket and see rows and rows of food products not manufactured in Ireland. Any of us could do the same in any supermarket in the country. These foreign products are ordinary everyday items ranging from cheese to products across the board.</P>
      <P>There are &euro;3 billion worth of opportunities each year in Ireland because we import more than &euro;3 billion worth of food each year. We are members of the European Community Single Market which has 400 million consumers, a number which will rise to 509 million when the ten new applicant states become members. We are well capable of producing food for the consumers of those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made some progress. There was much brouhaha in the beef industry over the years which was shovelling beef into intervention in the 1980s. That has stopped and now we are the <Col N="1616" />biggest beef supplier by far to our nearest neighbour, the British market &ndash; over 250,000 tonnes &ndash; which is one of the world's most discerning markets. To supply the range of competitive super and hyper markets there one must be good and must produce good quality. When intervention was discontinued and it was put up to us, we were able to avail of the opportunity.</P>
    <P>When I looked for some lead-in time for intervention &ndash; we got another five years to reduce from 70,000 tonnes of butter to 30,000 &ndash; my Danish counterpart said he was appalled at an Irish Minister for Agriculture and Food looking for additional storage for an unwanted product. I explained that we needed more time and could not get the industry to change over night. He pointed out that we were nearer the British market than them but that they were beating us hands down in that market. Sadly, that is the case. Our farm and co-op plc leaders must show greater leadership.</P>
    <P>Before Commissioner Fischler put his proposals in January I established, commissioned and paid for a Prospectus report on the dairy industry. That study pointed out the insane policy we have pursued in the dairy industry of shovelling more and more milk products into intervention. We must get away from that. We must also share facilities. There is no point in Connacht Gold, Lakeland Dairies, Arrabawn and Glanbia all having their own little processing units. We cannot afford that because we must remove costs from the processing side of the industry.</P>
    <P>At a medium level, in west Cork we have four co-ops, Bandon, Barryroe, Lisavaird and Drinagh which now process no milk. However, the co-ops are still there and they supply hardware and store material to the farming community in their areas. All the milk goes by tanker to Carbery Milk Products in Balineen. Carbery Milk Products is doing a superb job because it does not convert the milk into old hat type products. It was one of the early pioneers of Bailey's Irish Cream and did a lot of research and provided the method of processing the cream into alcohol. It still makes alcohol products and produces Boru Vodka which is produced from milk, one of the greatest raw materials of all time. The company also produces the fabulous Dubliner cheese.</P>
    <P>Thirty years ago in Killeshandra, John O'Neill was able to make UHT milk which was put into jigger packs and was available on every airline all over the world. However, in recent years product and process development has been lacking. That is not because of lack of support. Enterprise Ireland provides substantial research and development support for industry. However, where there is prop-up intervention there is no need for research or development. That day is now gone. The game is up and we must now get out into the marketplace and provide good qual<Col N="1617" />ity food to the 500 million consumers we will have in the EU from 1 January next.</P>
    <P>The change necessary is well signposted in the Prospectus study. I have met almost all the co-ops over the past few months and have told them that they will not survive with their current product portfolio but must increase their range of products. There are many opportunities to do that and they owe it to the industry and their farmer suppliers to make those changes.</P>
    <P>The main proposal in the current reforms is decoupling or breaking the link between premium headage and getting payment. Whether they liked it, people had to keep cattle and sheep in order to collect payments because a headage payment was made. The more headage people had, the more payment they got. That resulted in a surplus and overgrazing. Then we had to introduce destocking in order to prevent overgrazing. We were promoting production on the one hand by premia and headage and promoting destocking on the other hand. When this livestock was converted into meat, I was invariably called on to visit Mr. Fischler to know if we could get increased export refunds to get rid of the surplus product. Having promoted production we were then looking for additional EU taxpayers funds to get rid of it. The unfortunate aspect of this was that we found ourselves in some of the least developed third countries and invariably ended up dumping our surplus product on these unfortunate people and their fledgling economies which wrecked and caused mayhem in them. It had to stop.</P>
    <P>The current proposal is that we pay farmers a single farm payment based on the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002. A farmer will now get a single payment of the average of what he got in those three years. He will make one application and get one cheque in the post each year. There will be complex cases involving inheritance and lease of land and farm pensions, etc, but these are being taken care of in the legal text. The single farm payment will be a tremendous cushion for those farmers. They will have their payment anyway and will then produce high quality products for which there is a market. The only return will be from the market. They start with a single farm payment and may then go on to produce high quality Angus or Belgian blue beef, or whatever the market demands. It is the signal from the market that will be responded to &ndash; farmers will engage in rearing livestock rather than farming headage. The concept is a good one.</P>
    <P>I will sit down with the social partners and industry representatives and we will come up with a model, from the menu of variations on full decoupling, which will become a road map for the development of agriculture into the middle of the next decade. I hope we will come up with a sensible format which will take some of the bureauc<Col N="1618" />racy out of the system and shift us considerably closer to the consumer and the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The second big advantage of the current agreement is that it leads us into the world trade talks in a strong position. We have put our house in order by stopping the promotion and development of surplus products and taken away the considerable irritant of the dumping of subsidised products onto third country markets. The agreement will safeguard direct payments, through the single farm payment, which amount to &euro;1.3 billion per annum. People might say that there are no longer that many farmers and their numbers are falling further. However, the figure of &euro;1.3 billion works out at about &euro;13,000 on average per farmer, although some get more and others get less. This figure represents up to 60% of farmers' incomes. They will be protected from challenge in the world trade talks because they are no longer linked to surplus production. They will be protected in this manner right into the next decade, which is extremely important for our farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Joe Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, I will conclude. People say that the CAP is a costly instrument and so it is at a cost of &euro;43 billion per annum to the European Union. However, it is only 1.5% of Europe's GDP and I believe that our farmers deserve support. The EU is not giving its farmers any more than the US Administration gives its farmers. If we want good, high quality food which recognises food safety and animal welfare standards, the people who toil on the farms deserve that kind of support. I believe that taxpayers do not begrudge farmers, provided that they produce what the consumer wants. Farming is a huge commitment which extends to seven days and nights per week. I was at a wedding on Friday which people left at 5 p.m. in order to put on their wellingtons and milk the cows before returning at about 9 p.m. I marvelled at their commitment.</P>

      <P>Before we commence, I wish to remind Senators that a Senator may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 1 to 4.</P>
      <P>I wish to thank Senators from all sides for the manner in which they supported the thrust of what I sought to achieve with my amendments on Committee Stage yesterday. Although I do not wish to be repetitive, we must briefly restate the arguments, which I genuinely believe are compelling and have already been put forcibly by all sides. Senator Mansergh, in particular, was very strong and passionate in pointing out the glaring omission of the Office of the Clerk of the Seanad and also the position of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. I will deal with the argument in regard to the Clerk of the Seanad in subsequent amendments.</P>
      <P>Senators from all sides subscribed to the argument that the Cathaoirleach's omission was a slight, an insult and was not accidental. Senator O'Rourke stated clearly that this was a deliberate rather than an accidental omission. The Minister of State is the fall guy because he has to present the Bill but, as we listened to his replies to our arguments, it became obvious that whoever drafted this Bill made a deliberate decision to omit the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether we are dealing with the Clerk or Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the same fundamental argument applies, namely, the status and legal and constitutional position of Seanad Éireann. Articles 18 to 25 of the Constitution deal specifically with the Seanad. We have a bicameral system which involves a two House Legislature. One cannot function without the other. There is an inter-dependence between the two in that laws <Col N="1620" />and Bills cannot pass without the joint co-operative efforts of both Houses. On the other hand there is also a clear independence, whereby this House stands on its own two feet. We have a different electoral system with 49 Members comprising representatives from five vocational panels and 11 comprising representatives from two university panels. We have different procedures and Standing Orders which, in some cases, are vastly different. For example, one of the refreshing things about this House is the Order of Business, during which in the Lower House one is strictly confined to asking questions about promised legislation. In this House we have a refreshing experience where one may raise matters of topical interest provided one calls for a debate. I need hardly mention that we also have different pay scales.</P>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann is deserving of a place as deputy chairperson of this new commission. For example, he presides over the deliberations of this House &ndash; which is an independent Legislature in the same manner as the Lower House &ndash; he leads parliamentary delegations overseas with considerable style and dignity and he presides and speaks at joint sittings of the Oireachtas when foreign dignitaries visit. Despite this, in the establishment of a new statutory commission he is ignored and left aside, apart from being an ordinary member with no greater power than anyone else. I accept the argument made yesterday by Senator Mansergh that there appears to be a <i>de facto</i> recognition that he will be the deputy chairperson but there is no guarantee of this and there should be. The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad should have a right to be included as deputy chairperson of the commission, and that does not exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Higgins has said almost everything that needs to be said but I would like to make one point. People often forget that this House is not entirely subordinate to the Dáil. It has one power where it is equal to the other House, namely, the power to reject a statutory instrument, and there is no procedure for the Dáil to overrule it. The Seanad is not just a consultative Chamber but one with real powers.</P>
      <P>I have great regard for the Minister of State and have had interesting debates with him on numerous topics in many forums. He was presented with tissue thin defences for some of these decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see in this legislation Dáil Éireann asserting a primacy to which it is not constitutionally entitled. None of the joint committees of the Houses is chaired by a Member of Seanad Éireann. I am not sure if any of them even has a Senator as a Vice-Chairman. I know some sub-committees have Senators as Vice-Chairmen. I detect in the legislation a reluctance on the part <Col N="1621" />of Dáil Éireann, or someone with the mentality of some in that Chamber, to recognise the equivalence and significance under the Constitution of Seanad Éireann. It is as if it reluctantly conceded that there were two Houses but that there was a determination to ensure the legislation would state clearly the view of some Members of Dáil Éireann &ndash; not the constitutional position &ndash; regarding the significance or otherwise of Seanad Éireann. That is the reason these amendments are important.</P>
    <P>The commission is an important body but the constitutional position of the two Houses of the Oireachtas is of greater importance. The commission is about 66 years too late. I have always believed the position of the Department of Finance apparently having the authority to decide how the Houses of Parliament should be funded, how much money they should have and regulating the expenditure of that money is profoundly unconstitutional. If the Houses were ever to go to court to assert their autonomy, the court would have no option but to say the idea that the Department of Finance could regulate the operations of the Houses of the Oireachtas was profoundly unconstitutional. That attitude towards the Houses of the Oireachtas and especially this House is at the core of the issue raised by Senator Higgins.</P>
    <P>In seconding the amendment I repeat that this is not a little exercise in vanity by this House but an attempt to insist in legislation on the correct constitutional position. One of the few points Senator Higgins omitted was that the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Éireann was a member of the Presidential Commission and so recognised under the Constitution. I do not understand how it could be for any reason other than deliberate intent to make a statement about Seanad Éireann that a constitutional officer who under the Constitution is one of three people who can function as Head of State of this country could be omitted from having the appropriate status in a commission established to run the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my views known on this point yesterday. There is an implicit recognition in the legislation in section 9(1), if one is being logical about it, that the deputy chairperson must be a Senator and <i>a fortiori</i> cathaoirleach in all but the most exceptional circumstances. I would have preferred this to have been stated explicitly for the reasons outlined by my colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the matter will arise in the forthcoming discussion on Seanad reform. This House is entitled to proper recognition through its officers of its position as the second House of the Oireachtas. I am a little disappointed that the Minister of State and the Government, which he represents, are reluctant to acknowledge this explicitly. There is plenty of matter for discussion <Col N="1622" />on Seanad reform. This obviously must be taken in the context of a Bill which is an important step forward and, generally speaking, a positive move. I register my reservations but, at the same time, recognise that the point is dealt with.</P>
    <P>It will be the job of the Senators who will be members of the commission to see to it that the logical understanding is communicated to Deputies, if any of them is in any doubt about it, to argue the point based on section 9(1) and establish a precedent from the beginning that will continue to be observed. It would have been better had this been explicitly stated in the legislation. I am unsure of the reasons for the reluctance to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have ploughed much of this ground before. It is necessary to set out the formal process for the appointment of the deputy chairperson, and the Bill simply states the appointment is to be made in writing by the chairperson of the commission. We know who that will be.</P>
      <P>I know it has been and surely will be for a while the subject of much debate as to who the deputy chairperson should be and who should have an input into the selection process. Only one member of the commission is precluded in the Bill from being the deputy chairperson, namely, the Secretary General. All other members have an equal chance of being selected for the role.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not preclude the chairperson from consulting his committee. I expect that, in the selection of a chairperson by any committee comprising eminent Members of both Houses, it will come to a wise decision. If it is decided that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is the person deemed to be suitable, I have no problem with this. If we dictate to the new commission exactly how it should fulfil its functions, it will deplete its effectiveness and independence.</P>
      <P>I do not want to adopt a belt and braces approach by pointing out the scenarios in which it might be necessary to appoint a deputy chairperson because it will be in exceptional circumstances. The committee will meet when it suits and is necessary and the chairperson will be anxious to be involved because it is a small group with onerous duties. In the few cases that the chairperson is not available, as will be made clear in the Bill, the appointment will be made in writing. I stand over the position I took yesterday and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>d</i>)&nbsp;the Clerk of Seanad Éireann;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Yesterday all sides of the House were unanimous in their belief that the Clerk of the Seanad should be a member of the commission by right. We were appalled when we read the membership list because it is patently obvious that the Clerk of the Seanad should come directly after the Clerk of the Dáil as an automatic member of the new commission. We argued strongly, particularly Senators Mansergh and O'Rourke, who are on the Government side, that there should be a reflection overnight and a change of heart.</P>
      <P>We were appalled by the insulting argument that because the Clerk of the Dáil, who will be Secretary General and chief executive of the new body, had been Clerk of the Seanad, that should be seen as sufficient representation of the House. It was not and it is not and that is an insulting argument. In that past many Clerks of the Dáil did not come through administrative training in this House and there is no guarantee it will happen in future. We are arguing that the Clerk of the Seanad should be automatically included in the new body. We would go even further and say that not alone should the Clerk of the Seanad be an automatic member, but should be the Assistant Secretary General. This is effectively a Department of State and all Departments have Secretaries General and Assistant Secretaries General. Why should the Houses of Parliament be any different when establishing a new commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument is made that there are three Senators on the commission by right and we acknowledge that. It is not, however, beyond the bounds of possibility that in a new Seanad, if there is a swing to one party and a large transfer of Members from this House to the other, there will be an influx of new Members. When I entered the Seanad in 1981, having been nominated by the then Taoiseach, there were very few former Senators in the House. A new influx was elected and the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garrett FitzGerald, used it as a training ground for aspiring TDs in constituencies where the party was not represented. This could lead to a situation where novice Senators without the necessary experience <Col N="1624" />to act on the Seanad's behalf represent it on the commission.</P>
    <P>There is an irrefutable case for the Clerk of the Seanad to be an automatic member of the commission and, indeed, its Assistant Secretary General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment. The Clerk of the Seanad is also the returning officer for the elections to the panels of the House. According to its functions, the commission shall provide for the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas. As of now, under this provision, when there is an election to the Seanad, the Clerk of the Seanad will have to apply to the commission to be allowed to use space in this House to conduct a constitutional function &ndash; the carrying on of elections to Seanad Éireann. The Clerk of the Seanad will not have a right to be a part of the body that will decide how the facilities of the House will be used during a Seanad election. That is constitutionally and institutionally wrong. It is profoundly wrong that a constitutional officer, responsible for the conduct of an election under the Constitution &ndash; an officer of this House &ndash; will have to apply to a body as an external person for permission to conduct elections to the House.</P>
      <P>Apart from all the other arguments, that is an extraordinary position that was either not anticipated by the drafters of this legislation or was anticipated and ignored. The former is the position frequently taken up by drafters of legislation who have, on many occasions, learned to their cost that Seanad Éireann is perfectly capable of dealing with complex legislation and identifying faults and failings in it. Perhaps, over time, they learn the wisdom not to take Seanad Éireann for granted.</P>
      <P>That leaves the latter possibility &ndash; that the drafters of this legislation thought this through and decided it did not matter that one of the major roles of the Clerk of the Seanad would have to be conducted in a supplicant form by asking permission of a commission to use this House to conduct a matter provided for under the Constitution. How does that reflect properly on the constitutional reality of elections to the Seanad and the position of the Clerk of the Seanad in the conduct of those elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was clear from the debate yesterday that all who were present had a united view on this issue. I did some research on the Government offices that have number twos. The Attorney General's Office has a Director General and a Deputy Director General. The CSO has two Directors. The Civil Service Commission has a Chairman and two Commissioners. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has a Secretary General and an Assistant Secretary General. The Director of Public Prosecutions has a deputy. The Department of Foreign Affairs has a Secretary General, a second Secretary General, a Government press secretary and a deputy press secretary. In the <Col N="1625" />Minister of State's own office there is a chairman and two commissioners. The Revenue has three commissioners. The Department of the Taoiseach has a Secretary General and a second Secretary General. The Departments I have not mentioned have a number of assistant secretaries.</P>
      <P>Two anomalies arise here. At one end of the spectrum we have the Department of Finance, which has two Secretaries General and three second Secretaries General. I have great respect and time for the Department of Finance, and I do not want anyone to think otherwise, but there might be an element of <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i> in terms of the lean, efficient operation of Government. At the other end of the spectrum there will be a new Department or commission which will have one Secretary General and, I understand, although I have this second hand, six principal officers. It will not even have assistant secretaries, let alone a deputy Secretary General. It would be a caricature and a misinterpretation to suggest that of all the offices of State, the Houses of the Oireachtas are the least among them but one could be forgiven for having that impression.</P>
      <P>This commission needs to have not only the Clerk of the Dáil, who operates in a number of different capacities about which we spoke yesterday, inform it but also the Clerk of the Seanad, even if not as a voting member. In the rainbow coalition, and during the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, former Deputy Molloy was a Minister of State at the Cabinet table. The input and contribution the Clerk of the Seanad can make to the work of this commission would be invaluable. Senator Higgins made the very good point that in certain general elections there may be a large turnover of personnel, particularly in this House. Obviously, the permanent staff provide continuity and the newcomers to the House will take time to learn the ropes and find their feet.</P>
      <P>I have to register my disappointment, indeed my protest, that we do not have an amendment to this effect from the Government. Naturally, as an obedient, disciplined member of the party to which I belong, I will not do a John Deasy on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot I was not supposed to mention a Member of the other House. I apologise and withdraw that remark. This is not a matter we will let drop in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another dimension that just happens to apply currently is that we, as Members of this Oireachtas, are supposed to be setting an example on gender equality. It would send a very good message if the Clerk of the Seanad, who happens to be a woman but who is just as capable as anyone else, was a member of the commission along with the Clerk of the Dáil &ndash; one man and <Col N="1626" />one woman. Perhaps in time to come the equivalent of assistant secretary posts will be created. Even in that scenario, I do not want to see a situation where the Clerk of the Seanad is overlooked and where there might be a jobs for the boys type system. These dimensions ought to be considered. The Department of Finance is also the Department responsible for the public service. That is also a dimension of the issue. I am sure it will be protested that it is not the case that because somebody is of a particular gender, this move is not being made.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday, there are two Houses of the Oireachtas. There is no logic or rationality in this measure. If we are setting up something new, there should not be a public service read across it to the effect that Department X might want to have a deputy Secretary General. We should do what is right for us. The Houses of the Oireachtas differ from a Department in this crucial respect: there are two Houses in the Oireachtas. It is not a single, unified body in the way most Departments are, at least in theory.</P>
    <P>I rest the case but this issue will have to be further pursued through whatever means are open to us. I am sorry it appears that the Government and the Minister are not prepared to accept the arguments being put forward.</P>
    <P>Ms O'Rourke: Here we go again around the mulberry bush. At this time yesterday evening we were debating this matter, and here we are again. I find it extremely difficult to cope with the twisted logic which led to this measure not being adopted. Like Senator Mansergh, we put our case forcibly and at considerable length not just here in the House, but also where we went for recourse.</P>
    <P>This is a new Department but it is for Members of the House. It is to allow Members of both Houses to do their own business and work through their &euro;295 million budget over three years, as laid down, with the officials and decide how they will run their own business. This is the only Department which is actually for elected people, and unelected people had to draft the legislation, yet when a very sensible amendment is put forward by the Fine Gael Party that the Clerk of the Seanad should be a member of the commission, it is not accepted.</P>
    <P>We are the elected people, although I was appointed, but for many years I was an elected Member. We make up the Members of this Seanad and we are putting this case on our own behalf, yet the unelected people who frame the legislation, advise and act in that capacity are rejecting it. As Senator Higgins said, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is sent out to do the batting. That is what Ministers are for and there is no doubt he is amiable and astute, but he has been told that he cannot accept this amendment. I know well how the Civil Service works. I know what they say when they send a Minister out with a brief. They say that a Minister cannot accept <Col N="1627" />this or that and must accept something else, but I would say I was accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

      <P>Once one does that, it is the most wonderful feeling in the world. One is one's own mistress or master. They are behind one, but one is on one's own feet, using one's own voice. It is a most wonderful experience knowing what to do at a particular time and I have done it on many occasions. People have learned to live with that and if they did not like it, they respected me for it.</P>
      <P>We are like supplicants, to take up a point made by Senator Ryan, and regardless of whether we like it, we are regarded within the elected sphere as the poor relation. We have managed to assert ourselves this year with the co-operation of all the Members and the Ministers and staff who have come here, but we are still seen as a type of Cinderella in that sphere of democracy.</P>
      <P>We are the supplicants at the door asking for the Clerk of the Seanad to be a member of the commission. It is not because the present Clerk to the Seanad is a woman. There are glass ceilings all over the world and we have to thump at them and try to break through. I have been at it for many years. The incumbent in question is a person of intellectual calibre, dedicated to her job, as indeed are all the people who work in the Seanad office. I would challenge the inherent unfairness of what is now being done. It is being railroaded through, over our heads as elected Members.</P>
      <P>Imagine when the history of this comes to be written. There are two Houses of the Oireachtas, the Dáil and the Seanad. Of course we are going to have the Clerk of the Dáil on the commission and he is to have a grand new title, Secretary General. Then there is the Seanad, the second House, with its own place in the Constitution. The response in effect is: &ldquo;No, we cannot take the Clerk to the Seanad. No thank you. The man we have got will be wonderful.&rdquo;  Of course he will be very good. Let nobody say we are casting aspersions on Kieran Coughlan, the Clerk of the Dáil, who is a person of excellent intellectual calibre.</P>
      <P>It is the sheer unfairness of what is being proposed in our names that I am referring to, because we are the elected people. We are the Members. We pass the legislation. We debate serious issues and come to serious conclusions. We are, under your aegis, a Chathaoirligh, reasonably run and led by the leaders of all of the parties and the representatives of the independent Members. Yet somehow, we are being put out the back door and told to come in the tradesman's entrance rather than through the main door. One does not know what upset the Clerk of the Seanad might cause. She is not to be taken on board this important commission. It is a total disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with Senator Mansergh, I will be voting <Col N="1628" />with my party, but it does not stop my tongue. Nor will it stop what is in my head from coming out. I am determined to say it. I am equally determined to submit a motion at the meeting next week of the committee on the reform of the Seanad calling for the amendment of the Bill so that this House can stand on its own feet and have its Clerk as a member of the commission.</P>
    <P>We could fling ourselves out the window, but that would do no good. I am disappointed, but I do not blame the Minister. The Minister was well able to flex his muscles and still is. He was well able to give me a dressing down &ndash; which I duly gave back to him &ndash; at a feisty meeting of 600 or 700 people in Athlone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to follow those great and stirring words from Senator O'Rourke, not that I believe the Minister will listen, even though the contribution of such an eminent and long-standing Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas should be taken on board. One should have thought that if we had any sense and the system worked, the views of someone like Senator O'Rourke would be taken into account. It is not too late. There is still time for a fine independent Offaly man, such as the Minister is known to be, to do that. It might not be a bad idea for the Minister to put down a marker in terms of how he intends to carry out his business in the future.</P>
      <P>It will be a grave insult to the House if this amendment is not taken on board for the reasons Senator O'Rourke and other Members have pointed out. We are being treated as lesser citizens in this legislation. The way it is framed puts us in an entirely weakened position in relation to the important commission being set up to run the business of both Houses. Within that context we are to be given the status of second class citizens by virtue of the fact that we do not have equality of standing within the commission's membership. It simply is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like others I would say it is not a reflection on the personage of the Clerk of the Dáil, but it is not to be expected that he should represent our interests. It does not happen in any other context or legislation. Neither does it happen in the Constitution and it is a bad precedent. I would ask Members on the other side of the House who have spoken so passionately on this to support <Col N="1629" />their sentiments with their vote and let the Government know clearly where they stand. Let it not be a party matter. It should be regarded as pivotal to the standing of this House and its future.</P>
    <P>It should be viewed in the context of our discussions on Seanad reform, as Senator O'Rourke has pointed out, and the desired wish of long-standing Members of this House in particular, as well as new Members, that we should be held in the highest possible regard. We are basically legislating to give ourselves second class status. This is intolerable. I call on the Minister to take on board in a proactive manner what he has heard. I have not heard a single valid argument against this amendment and I would ask Members on the other side of the House to put their vote where their sentiments are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a slightly different angle. I accept what has been said about the status of the House and the fact that it should be adequately represented, whatever the body happens to be. Apart from standing on ceremony and status, I believe it would actually improve the body. In relation to Bills at the end of a session, my experience tells me that frequently they can be defective. The defects are not always picked up because of the necessity to get them through the Houses. The argument that a Bill might have to be returned to the Dáil for amendment at the end of a session is not valid. If it is right it is right and should be done.</P>
      <P>We made reference on Second Stage to the need for staff to be represented on the commission. I agreed with Senator O'Toole about this. This is one way of squaring that circle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and I am not going to discuss that amendment, but it is a way of marrying two things, so to speak. The other point is that the Clerk of the Seanad would bring a different perspective from that of the Clerk of the Dáil. In general, the Clerk of the Seanad is closer to the Members than her counterpart is to the Members of the other House. We are all familiar with the Clerk and we have easy access to her. The Clerk would be in a good position to bring forward proposals and recommendations by ordinary Members of the House, not just those who happen to be on the commission. The Clerk of the Seanad has unique expertise which would be beneficial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1630" />Frequently in these circumstances a general commitment is made to take into account certain views, in this case, those of the Clerk of this House. This is not good enough and must be provided for through legislation because general commitments are forgotten about. I share the view of other Senators that the Clerk should be appointed to the commission as deputy Secretary General. The issue at stake is not our standing or status, but the fact that the proposal is right and, if accepted, would improve the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with some trepidation that I entered the House today, having been reminded yesterday by the Leader of my privileged, guest status here. The Leader and other Senators made strong overtures to me on this proposal and sought an instant and positive response. I came to the House with one hand as long as the other which exacerbated my trepidation as did calls from Senators to do the right thing, which suggested I was out of control or out of touch.</P>
      <P>Since the debate yesterday evening, the Leader and Senator Mansergh communicated their passionate views on this issue to the Minister and I understand he told them he would sleep on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Minister nor I could dismiss the case put to us without giving it serious consideration and nor did we feel comfortable about some of the charges implicitly made during yesterday's proceedings, when we were alleged to have either demeaned or affronted a House of the Oireachtas. This accusation left me uneasy and I chose not to respond to it immediately. It was also suggested that we were being guided by the interpretations of civil servants who exerted undue control over us. I recall Senator Higgins lambasting as a great loss to members of the Opposition the tremendous support civil servants provide to Ministers.</P>

      <P>It was implied that senior civil servants have a negative influence on the Minister and me. The suggestion that we are being led blinkered into taking a dangerous position has upset both of us. When asked yesterday to consider this proposal, I did not commit to giving it serious thought. Nevertheless, both the Minister and I considered the matter overnight. Whereas the Minister has had a long and varied career in politics, I am only commencing mine. Both of us, however, were moulded in a difficult school and have been around for a while. The saying regarding the old dog for the hard road could apply as we believe it does not always pay to take the easy option and sometimes passion, irrespective of how articulately expressed, does not necessarily <Col N="1631" />guarantee great wisdom. If one stands back from an issue, one may get a much clearer view.</P>
      <P>Having reflected on the amendment, we are not in favour of any change. I implore the Leader, regardless of the outcome, not to fling herself through the window.</P>

      <P>The office will serve two Houses but will have more than three prongs. Each House has a Clerk and assistant Clerk and the joint staff has its own tribe of heads of functions dealing with different aspects of the service it provides. This group also has its chief, who does not have a related title, but also happens to be the Clerk of the Dáil. It is the work already undertaken by the Clerk and under his control which will move in its entirety to the commission. As Clerk of the Dáil he will remain under the jurisdiction of the Ceann Comhairle and, similarly, the Clerk of this House will continue to perform her functions unaffected.</P>
      <P>The other new capacity of the Clerk of the Dáil will be as chief executive officer of a collective called &ldquo;the Commission&rdquo;. Senators expressed the high regard in which they hold the current incumbent. I do not envisage that the Clerk of the Dáil in this new position will become a kind of insider trader on behalf of the Dáil, trying to do down the interests of the Seanad. Nor do I envisage that the commission, which will be his boss, would allow him to do such a thing. He will be the chief executive officer of a ten person commission consisting of Members of both Houses, which would not allow him to do down either House.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan raised the possibility that the Clerk of the Dáil would be beholden to the commission. This is a white elephant which will not arise. The commission will have no function to override the constitutional requirements of either House. In other words, the Seanad, like the other House, will be in charge of its constitutional rights, whereas the commission will take control of the administration of the various other tasks of the Houses. Nothing will impinge on or impugn the constitutional rights of the Clerks of either House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, Senator Mansergh repeatedly drew attention to the English language Short Title of the Bill and suggested we were contradicting it by having no statutory presence from among the Seanad officers on the commission secretariat. We do not accept this. The detail of the Bill makes clear what the focus of the commission will <Col N="1632" />be, namely, the allocation of funding for and provision of services and staff to Members of the Houses. The allocation of funds and staff between the Houses, committees and other services will be a large part of the commission's remit and policy decisions on these matters, within which the chief executive will have to operate, will be taken at commission level, not the administrative level, which will act on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The Leader referred to the role of the elected representatives. I was elected and received sufficient votes to be in the other House, rather than here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">

      <P>The elected representatives on the commission will make decisions on behalf of the elected Members of the Houses. The decision makers will include Members of the Seanad, the Cathaoirleach and the three ordinary members. The main decisions will be taken by the commission, not the Civil Service backup.</P>
      <P>My previous job, in the course of which I crossed paths with Senator Mansergh, involved considerable toing and froing between various groups and agencies, giving interviews and so forth. A high degree of repetition was sometimes required to get one's message across. This has also been the case with regard to the issue before us during the various Stages. In recent weeks, a large number of amendments have been tabled to this legislation and I have found myself reverting to repetitive mode. Unfortunately, I have been compelled to do so again with regard to the fundamental aspects of this issue because they have been ignored.</P>
      <P>In our approach to the legislation, we wish to give the commission the greatest possible level of freedom, rather than tying its members' hands in advance. This is the basis on which the special funding arrangements were devised and the reason virtually all the powers currently vested in the Minister for Finance are being transferred to the commission. The general consensus is that this is a positive move. Senator Ryan, for example, stated it should have happened 60 years ago, while Senator Mansergh described it as a giant step forward, both of which are true.</P>
      <P>It was consonant with this policy that the shape of the organisation below the chief executive or Secretary General is being left to the commission. It is being given an opportunity to think purposely about how its business should be carried out by its staff. This is also the reason a provision has been introduced to allow commission members to be chosen well ahead of its opening for business next January. In summary, we are not prepared to change our position on this matter, despite the strong arguments made by Senators.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis correctly said we are not concerned with semantics and the argument has been made regarding the status and <Col N="1633" />autonomy of this Chamber. The key point is that acceptance of the amendment would improve the commission. I appreciate the arguments made by Senator O'Rourke and Senator Mansergh. It will be interesting to see if Senators on the other side of the House will behave like Deputy Deasy.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Mansergh for his research. He could not have put the argument more forcibly. The commission will create the posts of a Secretary General and six principal officers with no intermediate post, while other Departments, such as Finance and Foreign Affairs, are heavily represented with grades at a corresponding level. Despite this, the Oireachtas, which passes the legislation on which all other Departments work, cannot insist on the creation of a deputy chief executive. Senator O'Rourke put that point well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is only one year in office and he should take note of Senator O'Rourke's well put point regarding the need, now and again, to stamp one's authority. Invariably, memoranda and Bills are presented as a <i>fait accompli.</i> It often means that one must accept them despite arguments to the contrary. Senator O'Rourke said she repeatedly told officials to change one such document presented to her as Minister. I recall debating two good education Bills &ndash; the Regional Technical College Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technology Colleges Bill &ndash; in the other House when Deputy Brennan was Minister for Education and Deputy Aylward was the Minister of State. Both Bills were concerned with changing the status and the name of the two colleges and, among other things, provided for changes in staff titles from directors to principals. Deputy Michael D. Higgins and I repeatedly argued in favour of two or three amendments. Eventually, and against departmental advice, the Minister of State made the necessary changes, even though it constituted a charge on the <Col N="1634" />Exchequer. He acted because he understood the merits of the arguments.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I was expected to stem the floods in Gort, at Six Mile Bridge at Newport and in Tipperary.</P>

      <P>I asked my Department to authorise practical projects to alleviate flooding that could be implemented at short notice. One such project was undertaken at Belcar, County Galway, near the home of the former Minister of State and Senator, Mark Killilea, where roads had been flooded for 20 years. In fairness to the Office of Public Works, it quickly did the necessary work. Within three hours of the completion of the project, I was to be given the honour of donning a helmet, rather like Senator O'Rourke in relation to the Luas light rail project, to remove the last scoop with the JCB, but I was told it could not be done because of European Union regulation regarding the preservation of the grasshopper. I gave instructions to proceed regardless and nothing was said afterwards.</P>

      <P>While we do not expect the Progressive Democrats to assert its independence within the coalition Government on this issue, we expect the Minister of State to accept this sensible amendment. It will not impose a charge on the Exchequer as the necessary funding can be found within the budget allocation of &euro;295 million. The arguments in favour are comprehensive, reputable and compelling. Knowing the Minister of State's ability to make up his mind, I am surprised he has not accepted the persuasive arguments made on both sides of the House.</P>

The provisions amendment No. 8 seeks to include would have the effect of improving the commission, which would be better if one of its members was a staff representative.

    <Title>Nuclear Safety: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann commends the Government on the recent developments with regard to Sellafield, in particular the pro-tem order issued by the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague that both Governments must exchange information on nuclear safety, and calls for the case to remain at the Tribunal and to continue to be pressed vigorously by the Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. I commend him and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and their Department on their ongoing battle against Sellafield. The decision to continue a relentless campaign against Sellafield despite the setback of the OSPAR tribunal ruling underlines our determination to defuse this time bomb on our doorsteps. This ruling is disappointing but we can draw comfort from the fact that the OSPAR tribunal decided that it has jurisdiction in such cases and this leaves open the possibility of further legal action. The Minister and the Attorney General must explore every possible legal avenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case before a UN tribunal under international maritime law is one of the most significant legal actions we have undertaken as a coun<Col N="1637" />try. This shows that many people on this side of the Irish sea are genuinely terrified of the danger that Sellafield represents. While the operators of Sellafield, BNFL, have shown themselves to be experts in the game of PR they cannot hide the fact that there is no economic or environmental reason for the plant to remain in operation. Experts are frequently hauled out in an effort to assure a disbelieving public that the discharges from Sellafield do not represent a danger. We regard any level of discharge as unacceptable. There simply should not be such radioactive waste. Internationally, I would like to see greater effort in trying to pull together a coalition of like-minded countries against Sellafield. I ask the Minister to pursue the issue until we have secured a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>Since 1994, when planning permission for the MOX plant was granted, Ireland has conveyed to the UK authorities on numerous occasions, at official and ministerial level, by letter and at meetings, its opposition to the MOX plant, including detailed responses to five rounds of public consultation convened by the UK authorities. In October 2001 the UK Government announced that the manufacture of MOX fuel was justified in accordance with EU law. On 20 December that year the UK regulator, the Health and Safety Executive, gave the go-ahead for the plutonium commissioning of the plant.</P>
    <P>Ireland has initiated legal proceedings on two separate fronts regarding the MOX plant: under the 1992 OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. In June 2001 Ireland initiated arbitration proceedings against the United Kingdom under the OSPAR Convention regarding the commissioning of the MOX plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. In the OSPAR Convention case Ireland has sought disclosure of two UK reports that addressed the justification for the production of and trading in MOX fuel. They were prepared for the UK Government and formed the basis of five separate rounds of public consultation in the United Kingdom. Edited versions of both were made available to the public as part of the consultations in response to which Ireland asked to be given the complete texts. This was denied on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Oral hearings regarding the proceedings took place in the Permanent Court of Arbitration, PCA, in The Hague in October 2002 before an international tribunal consisting of the chairman, Professor Michael Reisman, Mr. Gavan Griffith, QC, and Rt. Hon. Lord Michael Mustill, QC. Today, 2 July, the OSPAR tribunal published its judgment, making five principal determinations: a unanimous rejection of the United Kingdom's argument that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction; a unanimous rejection of the United Kingdom's argument that Ireland's claim was inadmissible; a <Col N="1638" />two-to-one majority rejection of the United Kingdom's argument that Ireland had no right to sue at an international tribunal; a two-to-one majority rejection of Ireland's argument that the specific information requested was covered by the scope of OSPAR Convention; and a unanimous decision that each side should pay its own costs.</P>
    <P>Although Ireland failed to gain access to the confidential information contained in the consultants' reports, the tribunal established an important international legal precedent: the United Kingdom is now accountable to an international tribunal to disclose information to another state which relates to the marine environment. This gives Ireland the legal right to access information on the United Kingdom's nuclear industry, using the provisions of the OSPAR Convention, should the need arise.</P>
    <P>An arbitration tribunal, also under the auspices of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, was established to hear the substantive issues in Ireland's case. Hearings in the case were heard in The Hague from 10 to 21 June. Ireland's legal team was led by the Attorney General. They discussed issues relating to the threat from the continued operation and expansion of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>At the hearing arguments were introduced by the United Kingdom that Ireland should have taken its case before the European Court of Justice. A Commission reply to a European Parliament question tabled by Proinsias De Rossa MEP was cited by the United Kingdom as evidence. In its reply the Commission stated it would not take a position on the merits of the case brought by Ireland but cited article 292 of the EC treaty, which stated questions of Community law should be considered only by the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The past week has seen us reach a milestone in our relentless battle against Sellafield. Britain must now consult us about future developments at the plant. For that reason, the decision is historic and perhaps the most significant ruling in our favour since we started the long battle decades ago. The legitimacy of our concerns has also been underlined in the past week by revelations that traces of Sellafield waste have been found in packets of salmon in UK supermarkets. While the health authorities are arguing that the traces found do not represent a threat to consumers, there should not be any amount of such material in the food chain.</P>
    <P>The revelations over the waste in supermarket salmon are also causing concern in other countries, particularly Scandinavia, Iceland and the Isle of Man. We are committed to co-operating with other countries concerned about Sellafield to increase the international pressure on Britain finally to clean up its act. We have been successful in getting support from those countries. I believe we can also build on the growing concerns in Germany and other continental countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" />Sellafield's record certainly does not inspire confidence. Since the Windscale fire in 1957, the plant has built up a catalogue of accidents and safety breaches. We are pursuing our legal actions because we see a very real threat to our environment. The people have ongoing concerns about the nature, safety and frequency of shipments of nuclear fuel. The events of 11 September 2001 have added a further worry about malicious attacks and security. This represents an unacceptable and avoidable risk.</P>
    <P>Assertions by BNFL and the UK Government that emissions from Sellafield and the MOX plant do not pose significant health risks oversimplify the issue. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has explained that there is simply not enough known about the long-term implications of the discharge of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea and its subsequent effects on the marine environment to justify that position.</P>
    <P>It is good that relations between the Irish and UK Governments are closer than ever before. However, that close relationship between our two countries, though very important and valued greatly, also means that we should continue our battles regarding Sellafield. The Irish Government has a responsibility to the Irish people as well as the environment &ndash; responsibilities we must honour. Others support the promotion of the nuclear sector but we are focused on the issues of protection and safety. We believe we are entitled to no less.</P>
    <P>The Government has made many attempts during the years to have the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria shut down. I pay tribute to the Attorney General, Mr. Rory Brady. The legal team led by him has made a very strong case, particularly recently in The Hague regarding the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, radioactive discharges and pollution of the Irish Sea. He made a strong case that the Government's protests were not taken into account when the licence for the Cumbrian complex was granted. The Minister has also expressed his concern at the inadequacy of the environmental assessment undertaken by the United Kingdom regarding the facility and the failure properly to assess the risk of terrorist attacks on the site. He has described the action at the United Nations court as essential to protect Ireland's interests, though he said he regretted that such a step was necessary. The British Government has rejected claims that discharges from the MOX plant pollute the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>This debate is very useful. I hope we will have all-party agreement on the motion in order that we can put a united case to secure what we seek. We certainly want to ensure Government action will continue to be supported by all parties in this House and also that we work in a united fashion, <Col N="1640" />making a strong case for us to remain at the tribunal and continue to press vigorously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion and welcome the Minister to the House tonight to discuss this very important issue. For many years now we have listened to the lip service paid by the UK Government and BNFL to our concerns about the Sellafield plant and the ancillary activities carried out there. Not only our concerns but also those of the Scandinavian countries and the Isle of Man and others have been dismissed and, on some occasions, ignored with contempt. Slick PR campaigns and glossy brochures have been used to disguise what is generally accepted as a clear and present danger to the future health and well-being of the Irish people and to our environment.</P>
      <P>When we look at the frightening catalogue of accidents and potential disasters associated with the plant, no amount of prevarication or weasel words can hide the threat that exists, not only to ourselves but also to those UK citizens who live directly beside the plant and to the wider population of northern Europe. After the Windscale fire in 1957 the plant should have been decommissioned. The purely economic arguments that the British have used to justify the continued use of the plant have diminished greatly over time and we are at the stage where there is absolutely no excuse for the way in which the Government there refuses to see the dangers posed by the plant.</P>
      <P>There is no justification, economic or environmental, for the continuation of operations at the Sellafield nuclear plant. These operations, which include the storage of high level radioactive liquid waste, the continued operation of the old Magnox reactors and the transportation of nuclear fuels to and from the plant, all pose huge threats to our country's environment and our economy but particularly to our people's health. There is now a long list of incidents and near-misses which when added up are a frightening indictment of how the British Government has, over the years, refused to take on board the expressed concerns, not only of the Irish Government but of many international bodies and in some cases of its own experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UN OSPAR Convention is in the news at present. The British Government has repeatedly ignored the requirements of the convention for member states, of which it is one, to take the necessary measures to protect the seas against the adverse effects of its own activities and to conserve maritime ecosystems. The discharge of nuclear materials into the Irish Sea and the recent findings of contamination of the fish stocks &ndash; ironically on the shelves of shops in London of all places &ndash; is unacceptable, as my colleague, Senator Kitt, said. Our Radiological Protection Institute tells us that not enough is known about <Col N="1641" />the long-term implications of the discharge of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea and its consequences for our health and environment. With support from the Scandinavian countries and Iceland, we must continue to press at all levels for the cessation of activities at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's decision regarding access to information on the MOX plant is disappointing but it is certainly not the end of the road. That there was a split decision in this case and that the unanimous rejection of the UK's argument that the tribunal had no jurisdiction have, in the Minister's words, established an important international precedent and, in my opinion, should act as an incentive for us to continue this fight.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Attorney General, Rory Brady &ndash; my namesake but no relation unfortunately &ndash; and his team on their excellent work to date. We have to defend strongly our sovereign right to protect ourselves in whatever forum we choose. Yesterday's decision vindicates that right and any costs incurred are wholly justified. We must continue to build the case piece by piece. The decision last week in the International Court in the Hague, along with the actions taken under the UN Convention of the Sea, will all add to this case.</P>
    <P>When we look at the number and the nature of the incidents associated with Sellafield it is no wonder the public is concerned &ndash; and in some cases terrified &ndash; that no action is being taken on the plant and its activities. Since the Windscale disaster there has been a catalogue of accidents and safety breaches. From the long-term storage of plutonium in questionable conditions to the disastrous debacle of the transport of MOX fuel pellets to Japan in 1999, and their subsequent return from there due to the falsification of documents, we should not only express concern but object outright to the continuation of the operation of the plant, full stop.</P>
    <P>The UK Government's decision last year to set up a liabilities management authority is at least an admission that it has a case to answer when it comes to the safety and environmental viability of the plant. When BNFL makes statements such as, &ldquo;A building at Sellafield which is 50 years old cannot be expected to conform to the standards of a modern plant,&rdquo; and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate reports, &ldquo;Sellafield showed a deterioration in safety performance and a weakness in control and supervision of operations at the site,&rdquo; it is no wonder people are afraid.</P>
    <P>We all agree that our relationship with the British Government is crucial to this country on a number of levels, not least in the context of Northern Ireland. However, we should not be afraid to protect, and be seen to protect, our national interests when it comes to the matters of health and safety of our people. We should continue to engage in constructive dialogue and, <Col N="1642" />when needed, constructive criticism in the cause of our national interest.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, on their obvious interest in and commitment to this vital issue. I commend the efforts they and their Department have made so far and I wish them well with what is definitely a good fight. This is a great opportunity to speak on this issue because it affects us all. I wish the Minister well in his efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;Government&rdquo; in the last line to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and calls on the British Government to immediately grant access to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to act as an Irish observer at Sellafield thereby having the same status as the International Atomic Agency at this facility.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is easy for any Irish politician to call for the closure of Sellafield. I say that because everyone knows it will not happen. It will not happen because if one has read the recent White Paper on energy proposals for Britain, one will come to the conclusion that New Labour is committed to a nuclear future.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has done a complete U-turn on its policy. In opposition it said one thing about a nuclear future but in Government it has done the opposite. I understand it has given a commitment to have 20% of its energy produced by the nuclear sector during the next ten to 15 years. New Labour is committed to a nuclear future, as is the Conservative Party in Britain. I do not believe that we in this Chamber or those in the other Chamber or nationally will change that commitment. That is the political reality with which we are faced. We may not like it, we oppose it, we want it closed but it will remain open until such time as political opinion in Britain changes. That may be in 20 years' time or after a terrible atrocity takes place there but it will remain open. We can cut through much of the huffing and puffing about this issue and get to the heart of the matter during the course of this debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Fianna Fáil motion. It is useful to review progress in this matter. If Sellafield were to cease processing tomorrow nobody would know what to do with its stockpiles. There is no international view on what should be done. It would take 100 years to decommission fully the stockpiles at that plant and at every other reprocessing plant. Even if the plant is closed tomorrow, Sellafield has to be dealt with on a long-term basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the British and the French, the big producers in this industry, have not ensured that the proper technology is given to the Asian countries in particular. Most of the <Col N="1643" />material transported from Asia to Britain and to France need not be transported if the technology base was in Asia to reprocess it. After the Second World War none of the information was shared because of hostility towards the Japanese. If we are honest about this we have got to look at ways in which this problem can be solved internationally through proper exchange of technology so that the reprocessing industry will not use our part of Europe as a dumping ground.</P>
    <P>That leaves us with a conundrum. What can we do to make a difference? The Fine Gael amendment tries to help the Government in its task. We want to support the Government in what it does internationally but I suspect it will not get us anywhere. One ruling is positive and another ruling is against. We will not succeed in getting Sellafield closed unless the British decide it. That is the bottom line. Therefore, we have to convince the British to do so.</P>
    <P>If we take 50,000 jobs out of Cumbria, we will have to subsidise them. Is that a realistic proposition? If the British Government came to my constituency and told me to abolish an industry that would have a knock-on effect on 10,000 jobs, who would pick up those jobs? The reason Mr. Jack Cunningham is so belligerent on this issue is that it is about jobs, regional development and the pathetic policy in Britain and Ireland where places like Cumbria are excluded. I have visited Cumbria, which is one of the most beautiful places on these islands, but there is no tourism development there. We must put our money where our mouth is. If we talk about closing down these jobs, we must talk about doing something to help Britain close Sellafield. That is the real politics involved here.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the regulatory authority for safety standards in this area in the State, should have automatic right of access as an observer to the Sellafield site. I was in Sellafield and put this suggestion to Mr. Askew, the site director. He said he had no problem with it but that it was a matter for the British Government in bilateral arrangement with the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>While I was in Sellafield I saw representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which, as the Minister knows, is an important UN agency charged with responsibility for tracking plutonium and uranium throughout the world to ensure that rogue elements and nations do not get hold of it. When I asked why they were there, I was told by BNFL that they were there because of the company's international obligations to ensure that none of the product got into the wrong hands. If the British have conceded that the International Atomic Energy Agency should be there, then surely they must concede that we have a right, as their nearest neighbour, to have our authority there to report independently to the <Col N="1644" />people whenever it sees fit and to issue reports on anything that issues from the company.</P>
    <P>No matter what BNFL or the British Government say about Sellafield, nobody believes them. We have a responsibility to press the British Government on this issue. We can achieve this in the short term. Let us continue with court cases till the cows come home and we shall see how far we get. With my sceptic hat on, I do not think we will get far. However, if we demand that our regulatory authority has a 24 hour, seven days a week, 12 months a year base there, the members of which can go wherever they want in the plant and report independently, it would give credibility to the information coming from Sellafield. However, it might be that we might not like the information coming from our regulatory authority if it issued positive reports.</P>
    <P>I put this suggestion to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and colleagues there supported it. I also put it to the Government which I understand is supporting the amendment to the motion, for which I thank it. It is time for the British Government to deliver on this issue. The British-Irish Council, which is still in place despite the breakdown of the Northern Ireland institutions, will have its next plenary council meeting in December. Before December there will be a meeting of environment Ministers. I want this issue addressed by our Government and ask it to put this proposal, with which Mr. Askew has no difficulty, to the British Government. There is international precedent for it because the International Atomic Energy Agency is there. I want our authority based at Sellafield on a permanent basis. That is progress we could make in the short term and I ask the British Government to agree.</P>
    <P>We must take on the responsibility of Sellafield because it is right beside us. Whatever about the issue of the ongoing discharges into the Irish Sea, since the events of 11 September the nightmare scenario is that if any internationally branded terrorist organisation wants to take a pot at Sellafield, by whatever means, we are in the firing line. We have a direct interest in Sellafield. The British Government has accepted the international precedent of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It must now accept our interest and act as a good neighbour and friend and concede to this proposal, irrespective of the longer term objections we have to the site.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the support of this side of the House in his endeavours. He should keep up his work at an international level but we also have a wider responsibility to think out the implications in regard to the huge amount of employment Sellafield provides. We must be honest on the issue. It is easy for us to make remarks about Sellafield which make us and our constituents feel good, but nothing happens as a result. Our amendment is something we can achieve in the short term. I ask the Government to press the <Col N="1645" />issue and I ask the British Government, as a good friend and neighbour, to concede.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. I support and second my colleagues' amendment.</P>
      <P>Any concession that gives Ireland a vestige of control over a situation that affects our citizens, our health and safety, the safety of our unborn children and our environment is unreservedly welcome. The interim order by the Hague based UN Permanent Court of Arbitration is the first major concession that has been granted to Ireland in relation to the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield. Ireland's other claim, taken last October under the OSPAR convention &ndash; an agreement between the 14 north Atlantic states relating to pollution and discharges into the marine environment &ndash; in which Ireland sought documents relating to the MOX plant at Sellafield, has been denied. This came to our notice this morning.</P>
      <P>Ireland sought a ruling, under the 1992 OSPAR Convention, that it was entitled to a full version of two partially suppressed British reports, one of which deals with the economic justification for the £470 million MOX plant and the other with its likely environmental impact on the Irish Sea. Although the current ruling of the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration is unlikely to affect processing operations in Sellafield in the short term, the court has set the scene for future dialogue and has delivered a rebuke to Britain for not having co-operated fully with Ireland in the past.</P>
      <P>The Government did not succeed in its international court bid to close Sellafield, but progress has been made. It is incumbent on us to continue to bring whatever pressure possible to bear on the British Government for closure. We must not rest on our laurels. Following on this ruling, we must actively demand safety information from British Nuclear Fuels Limited, which manages Sellafield, and from the British Government.</P>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes's, call for Ireland to have an independent observer at Sellafield, on a permanent 24 hour basis. The International Atomic Energy Agency observes the site continually but given Sellafield's proximity to the east coast of Ireland, we must have observers on site at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ever present threat of terrorist action following the events of 11 September 2001, and the catastrophic repercussion of such action for Ireland, must intensify the pressure for this concession on both Britain and the court of arbitration. Apart from the issue of the proximity of Sellafield to Ireland, the shipping of large consignments of plutonium based fuel around the <Col N="1646" />world is highly dangerous. This has been emphasised many times in the past.</P>
    <P>We are in grave danger from radiological sabotage or an attack on shipments from Sellafield. Ireland, like Belarus, which is situated next to Chernobyl in the Ukraine, has no nuclear plants but a terror attack on Sellafield could leave us equally devastated. I compliment the many Irish people who take young children from the Ukraine and Chernobyl into their homes each summer and I welcome the group in Ireland at present.</P>
    <P>Ireland, and particularly our east coast, has been a sitting duck since 1956, forced against our will to be party to Britain's atomic age. When the world's first industrial-scale power station was opened at Calder Hall in Sellafield, it was promoted at the time to British consumers as &ldquo;electric power that would be too cheap to meter&rdquo;. It did not take them long to realise the falsity of that statement. The station closed last March as it was said to be increasingly uneconomic. That is good news but it will take 100 years of decommissioning before the site is declared to be safe.</P>
    <P>It is the more recent activities at Sellafield that are of major concern to Ireland and, likewise, the people of the Cumbria region. Two years ago British Nuclear Fuels opened a MOX fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield. This plant combines oxides of uranium and plutonium from reprocessed fuel into mixed oxide fuel for use in reactors. Britain was granted permission for it, despite a scandal over suspect safety data and the knowledge that the Irish Sea was among the most radioactive-polluted in the world. The company has a long record of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea. Any choice on behalf of Britain in relation to nuclear power plants implies a duty to protect Ireland as its near neighbour.</P>
    <P>Millions of gallons of contaminated water are pumped from Sellafield into the Irish Sea every day. This in itself is worrying but it is compounded by the succession of accidents which have made it the worst managed nuclear waste plant in Europe. The court rejected the Irish demand for an end to radioactive discharges from the mixed oxide plant at Sellafield as Ireland had not proved that the MOX plant was causing serious harm to our marine environment. However, the tribunal has agreed to allow Ireland to apply for provisional measures to protect the marine environment against serious pollution.</P>
    <P>The case in The Hague is of immense benefit to Ireland in building international political awareness of the dangers of the Sellafield plant. We are involved in a unique situation. A small country is taking on a much larger one and highlighting issues that have major consequences for the nuclear industry worldwide. In doing so it is reaching further than Ireland's case against the Sellafield plant. We are questioning the role of the European Union's constitutional position on <Col N="1647" />the promotion of the nuclear industry. Within Europe any decision taken in The Hague could impact on countries such as France which also ships nuclear waste without consultation with its neighbours.</P>
    <P>Currently, only Norway and Denmark support Ireland's call for extended measures to reduce radioactive discharges, over and above the national plans agreed at the last OSPAR ministerial meeting five years ago. Ireland, with Norway and Denmark, has called for legal authorisation on discharges of technetium, one of the most toxic radioactive pollutants from the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>Since 2001, certain initiatives have been taken in regard to forcing the closure of the plant at Sellafield. In October 2001 the Government stated it would take a case against it to the European Court of Human Rights. This has not yet happened. In November 2001 the Government failed to prove that the Republic's rights, under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, had been breached. In November 2001 Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth failed in the High Court in London to stop the start-up of the MOX plant at Sellafield. In April 2002 campaigners sent 1.3 million cards &ndash; one of them from me &ndash; to the British Prime Minister in Downing Street which called for the closure of the plant. In September 2002 the Government and environmentalists protested at the passage of a nuclear waste ship through the Irish Sea en route to Sellafield. In October 2002 Ireland took a case for the release of confidential information on the plant under the OSPAR Convention but the claim was rejected. In June 2003 a case was taken to The Hague under UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.</P>
    <P>As many of us would say, a lot has been done but, undeniably, a lot still remains to be done. With the ever present threat to health and safety uppermost in all our minds, I urge the Government to press ahead with whatever means possible to bring about the closure of the plant at Sellafield. This issue is of paramount importance and on everyone's lips throughout the north-east of Ireland. I have met people who object to the plant as far away as Galway, Clare and the west. The Minister has our support. I have no doubt he will accept the amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Government motion. I commend the Minister on the work he has put into this task. Since assuming office, he has been working step by step through the machinery available in legal international fora to bring about the ultimate objective, the closure of the plant at Sellafield. In the context of that work, I commend the Minister for the <i>pro tem </i>order referred to in the motion. He will be aware that many efforts and long days and nights have <Col N="1648" />been spent over the past five years in an attempt to achieve this.</P>
      <P>Some measure of achievement was recorded before the <i>pro tem </i>order was made. It is encouraging and gratifying that an order was made to give Ireland the right to consultation. The Government knows that the British Government is now obliged, under the direction of the UN Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, to consult it in future and exchange information on nuclear safety.</P>
      <P>The motion is timely. It is as much about the MOX plant as it is about the Sellafield complex in general. The case made by Ireland at the OSPAR tribunal was for access to certain information about the MOX plant which had been withheld from the public domain by the British Government. The judgment in the case handed down today did not go entirely our way but we are as heartened as the Minister that three of the five main points in the judgment are very much in our favour. It is disappointing that a 2:1 majority rejected Ireland's main argument. However, even in rejecting it, as the Minister rightly said, quite considerable scope is now being given to the Government to examine all the options available, given that there is now a clear acknowledgement that the British Government is accountable. On the basis of the judgment, the Government may seek out, identify and pursue all options available. This considerably diminishes our disappointment that the main argument was not accepted.</P>
      <P>We were never naive enough to think that, simply by going to a tribunal in Europe &ndash; despite the fact that the Minister had made a good case &ndash; we would automatically succeed. There is a huge force to the contrary and, with the Minister, we were aware of that fact. Nevertheless, his achievement must be recorded and, as he rightly said today, he is more determined than ever to exploit the opportunities and options presented. Three of the five main aspects of the judgment provide a clearer road map than that which was in place heretofore and known to the Minister's Department yesterday.</P>
      <P>The judgment represents a milestone in Ireland's step by step approach to the objective of having the plant at Sellafield and its operations closed down. In his response to the ruling today the Minister clearly articulated his relentless determination to continue to pursue every legal avenue and available international forum to establish that the operations at Sellafield constitute a clear and present threat to the Irish Sea and the citizens of Ireland. That determination is warmly welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All discharges from Sellafield constitute unacceptable radioactive pollution of our marine environment and must be stopped. Since the 1950s, the plant at Sellafield has had a disastrous history of repeated leaks, accidents and safety <Col N="1649" />failures. There is a furtiveness and secrecy about the BNFL operation, as evidenced by the withholding of information and the deliberate falsification of records on safety standards.</P>
    <P>Colleagues on all sides will be familiar with the slick presentation of propaganda about the nuclear industry in general and its safety. It is heartening to know that all Oireachtas Members and citizens are at one when it comes to the plant at Sellafield. We all want it closed. There is no argument about it. It is the only response that will restore our confidence in the safety of our waters and operations in the neighbouring country.</P>
    <P>The decision by Britain to proceed with the implementation of the MOX plant against the background of an increase in international terrorism and after waiting five years and engaging in consultation on five occasions is hardly the action of a friendly neighbour 50 to 60 miles from our coast. It is regrettable that, at a time when the distrust of centuries in Anglo-Irish relations is dissipating quickly, the British Government persists in causing needless ongoing friction between the two countries by its refusal to acknowledge our legitimate concerns about the threat of the plant at Sellafield and the MOX plant to our people and marine and terrestrial environments. That is sad and regrettable but a fact, one the Minister has faced every day since he took office. He has reaffirmed and reinforced his determination to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The British Government's decisions have been made contrary to independent and international political and scientific concern. It has ignored the repeated warnings of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, who has referred to the exposure of the operations to the increased risk of terrorism involving nuclear weapons. Leading scientists, to whom I referred on the previous occasion this issue was discussed, such as Dr. Frank Barnaby of the Oxford research group and Dr. Large have stated publicly on a number of occasions in recent years that the MOX plant represents a prime target for a terrorist attack and poses a major threat to this country.</P>
    <P>Dr. Barnaby publicly accused the British Government of gross stupidity and irresponsibility, to use his words, in granting BNFL permission to operate a mixed oxide fuel plant at the Sellafield site. He pointed out that the plutonium in the MOX could be used to produce nuclear explosives. He explained that, if terrorists were to get hold of the MOX, they could easily chemically separate the plutonium and uranium oxides and use the plutonium oxide in a crude nuclear explosive. He said very little expertise was required and that most people with one or two years' experience dealing with explosives could do it. He also said MOX was particularly vulnerable to acquisition by terrorists, especially during transportation.</P>
    <P>Dr. Barnaby also saw the possibility of a terror<Col N="1650" />ist flying a plane into the plant at Sellafield. Previous speakers have also referred to this. Dr. Barnaby saw this possibility as a major and real threat. He said such an attack would have devastating contamination consequences over a very wide area. He estimated that upwards of 3.6 million people could die as a result. His views were supported by two other scientific reports, one by Dr. Large &ndash; I am unsure of the author of the third. All concluded that terrorists could easily identify the most dangerous parts of the plants from publicly available information and crash aircraft into them, releasing vast amounts of radiation.</P>
    <P>It is not that long ago that the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, when making a statement to the world on the lessons of the volatility of financial markets, climate change, international terrorism, nuclear proliferation and the challenges of globalisation, told all countries, including Ireland, that our self-interest and our mutual self-interest were inextricably woven together. It is a pity that, in those profound words of wisdom he was so anxious to give to the world, he did not take account of his decision in 2001 on the MOX plant.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister, urge him to continue his good efforts and assure him of our support. He has chosen the right way and knows the forums in which to continue to fight this case on behalf of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for tabling this important motion and affording me the opportunity, of which I am pleased to avail, to speak to the House on it. I welcome the motion and the spirit in which it has been tabled. It is an important recognition and endorsement of the Government's strategy on the Sellafield site and its operations.</P>
      <P>On 24 June 2003 the tribunal established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, delivered what I regard as a significant interim judgment in our case against the Sellafield MOX plant. This judgment recognised, by way of an order of the arbitral tribunal, Ireland's claim that the necessary co-operation and consultation required between the United Kingdom and Ireland was inadequate. The award of the OSPAR tribunal was published today. I am pleased to have the opportunity to report to the House on the outcome of these proceedings also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These judgments are the latest milestones in a series of interrelated legal actions initiated by the Government in June 2001 but whose genesis dates back much further. Those with a long-standing interest in Sellafield matters will recall that it was a Fianna Fáil Government which originally considered taking a legal case against the plant as far back as 1994, when the option of taking action under the then Paris Convention was considered. It was decided at the time not to proceed with action under this convention as its provisions were not considered sufficiently robust in <Col N="1651" />their prohibition of radioactive discharges to provide an appropriate basis for action in this regard. However, legal action remained an option open to the Government, and our approach was subject to continual review. Ratification by Ireland and the United Kingdom of both the OSPAR and the UNCLOS Conventions provided a stronger legal framework in which to act. Our concerns heightened with the development of the Sellafield MOX plant.</P>
    <P>Ireland first became aware of the plans to build a MOX plant at Sellafield in 1993 when a planning application was submitted to Copeland Borough Council. In our response to the council's consultation the Government expressed its concerns about the adequacy of the environmental statement, the economic case for MOX, the security implications of the plant and its obvious interdependence with reprocessing activities at Sellafield. Ireland continued to reiterate these concerns on many occasions over the following years, including by its participation in no less than five separate public consultations in the United Kingdom on the justification for the plant, as required under EU law.</P>
    <P>Throughout these consultations Ireland had to rely on heavily edited consultants' reports on the economic case for MOX. The Government considered that the full versions of the reports should be made public to provide a fully transparent analysis of the purported benefits of the plant. Ireland argued that the reports did not fully consider the major disadvantages of MOX fuel manufacturing, including a completely unsubstantiated analysis of the world market for MOX fuel. Despite repeated requests, Ireland has not seen full versions of the reports as the UK claimed that the edited material was commercially sensitive.</P>
    <P>As a result of the unsatisfactory response that Ireland, as a sovereign and friendly state, had received in the consultations and in frequent ministerial correspondence, we signalled to the United Kingdom our willingness to pursue our concerns through international arbitration. Ireland set out this position clearly at the June 2000 meeting of the OSPAR Commission in Copenhagen when we advised the OSPAR contracting parties, including the United Kingdom, that if a settlement could not be reached with the United Kingdom on access to the full consultants' reports, we would pursue the issue under the OSPAR Convention.</P>
    <P>In June 2001 the Government launched a legal action under the convention. This case sought access to the complete and unedited consultants' reports commissioned by the United Kingdom in support of the economic justification for the MOX plant. The case came to an oral hearing in The Hague in October 2002 and, as I mentioned, a judgment was announced by the tribunal today. While the case related to access to information withheld by the United Kingdom on the grounds of commercial confidentiality, it also related to the elaboration of the fundamental rights and <Col N="1652" />obligations of contracting parties to the OSPAR Convention. In arguing its case before the arbitral tribunal the United Kingdom had contended that the tribunal had no jurisdiction in the matter and that Ireland's claims were inadmissible.</P>
    <P>In its decision the tribunal made five principal determinations: a unanimous rejection of the United Kingdom's argument that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction; a unanimous rejection of the United Kingdom's argument that Ireland's claim was inadmissible; a two to one majority rejection of the United Kingdom's argument that Ireland had no right to sue at an international tribunal; a two to one majority rejection of Ireland's argument that the particular information which had been requested was covered by the scope of the OSPAR Convention; and a unanimous decision that each side should pay its own costs.</P>
    <P>Although the tribunal has decided that the information we sought in this instance did not come within the scope of the OSPAR Convention, we nonetheless have established an important international precedent. The United Kingdom is now accountable to an international tribunal for information it must disclose to another state under the OSPAR Convention. The possibility, therefore, of further action under the convention is kept open to us. I have little doubt that this judgment, in setting out the respective rights and obligations of the parties, will prove extremely valuable in time to come.</P>
    <P>Ireland launched parallel proceedings against the United Kingdom under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea in October 2001 when the United Kingdom confirmed, on 3 October 2001, that it would proceed with commissioning of the MOX plant. The case was taken when the strongly held objections of the Government to the commissioning of the plant, conveyed many times over many years to the United Kingdom, were disregarded. This is a much broader case, taken in support of Ireland's position that the MOX plant had been built and commissioned without a proper environmental assessment, without due regard to the pollution impact on the Irish Sea and without adequate consideration of the possible security implications for the plant at Sellafield or for the consequent increase in the marine transport of radioactive materials through the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>It was in respect of this case that oral hearings began in The Hague last month and on which the UNCLOS tribunal delivered a provisional measures award on 24 June. This is an interim judgment in the case pending a further hearing scheduled for later this year. I regard this judgment as a significant milestone, not just in terms of our case but also in terms of our wider policy on the plant at Sellafield and our relationship with the United Kingdom on the Sellafield question. The tribunal has reaffirmed the earlier judgment of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea from December 2001, which ordered the exchange of information on the consequences of commissioning the MOX plant, and <Col N="1653" />the establishment of effective monitoring measures and prevention of pollution of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Last month in The Hague the tribunal heard submissions from Ireland that the December 2001 judgment had not had the intended outcome of greater transparency and co-operation from the United Kingdom. It agreed with Ireland that such co-operation was not as timely or effective as it could have been and that this stemmed, in large measure, from the absence of secure arrangements for the co-ordination of all the various agencies and bodies involved. This judgment is important because it is not solely the claim of the Government but the judgment of an independent, impartial tribunal and, as such, carries an authority and imposes obligations that neither Ireland nor the United Kingdom can ignore. The United Kingdom must now, with Ireland, set up an effective mechanism for co-operation which ensures our rights to be properly informed about nuclear safety issues are provided for and that our views are fully taken into account. Nor does the process end there. Both Ireland and the United Kingdom will have to report back to the tribunal on progress toward achieving this goal and I am confident that the tribunal will act with rigour in assessing how much progress is being achieved. As I mentioned, this is not the final part of the case. When we return to the substantive case, Ireland will continue to underline our view that these operations at Sellafield constitute an unacceptable risk.</P>
    <P>Some Senators may also be aware that the European Commission has recently expressed an interest in Ireland's case against the United Kingdom. This is the principal reason given by the tribunal for its postponement of full hearings until December this year. I have previously been asked the reason Ireland did not decide to take its case through the European Court of Justice and my answer remains the same. Ireland chose the UN route because we recognised that route as being the quickest and most effective way of making our case. The Convention on the Law of the Sea contains important provisions on co-operation and marine pollution that do not exist in European law. While I welcome the interest of the European Commission in Ireland's case, I do not accept a view that Ireland should have taken a case before the European Court of Justice. Our position does not preclude a future challenge through that court. I remain committed to this litigation, which is in line with the policy of the Government to oppose the continued operation and expansion of activities at the Sellafield site.</P>
    <P>Senators will be conscious from previous debates in this House that a multiplicity of operations, from decommissioning and reprocessing to storage of waste and separated fuel, and now the fabrication of MOX fuel are currently conducted at Sellafield. Each of these activities represents a potentially serious threat to Ireland's population, our environment and economy. Senators may also be aware that, until February <Col N="1654" />2003 when it was announced by BNFL that generation of electricity at the site would then cease, the plant at Sellafield also generated electricity through the four on-site Magnox reactors at the Calder Hall section of the site. While I welcomed this announcement of the planned closure of these reactors, there remains much work to be done. Closing the Magnox reactors will be a lengthy and time consuming process; it involves defuelling and decommissioning, each stage of which requires the consent of the United Kingdom's nuclear regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.</P>
    <P>As well as the legal actions, the Government has continued to execute its policy on the plant at Sellafield through a variety of other means, all of which involve advocating the highest possible standards of safety as well as health and environmental protection. My officials and I continue to meet our United Kingdom counterparts on a regular basis through the UK-Ireland Contact Group on Radioactivity Matters, the British Irish Council and through regular meetings between the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and its regulatory counterparts in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that throughout this process of legal action, as befits neighbouring states with so much in common, our relationship with UK colleagues, both at ministerial and official level, remains friendly and positive. However, our perspectives in relation to the plant at Sellafield are some considerable distance apart. The UNCLOS interim judgment will be influential in developing our co-operative relationship as the tribunal recognised that both countries met and co-operated across a wide range of bodies but that improvements in these arrangements were necessary.</P>
    <P>The current plans and consultation process for the establishment of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority include a recognition of the importance of Ireland as a significant stakeholder in the protection of our shared environment with the United Kingdom. They are also an important recognition that the legacy of nuclear operations in the United Kingdom will require many decades to clean up and, in particular, that the way in which the Sellafield site has been managed by BNFL has been wholly inadequate. The short-term commercially-driven outlook of BNFL must be replaced by a body which recognises that the management of operations at Sellafield requires a long-term commitment to safety, security and environmental protection, and that this will ultimately cost many billions of pounds. We should see such a body in the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</P>
    <P>In the meantime Ireland will continue to campaign against the ongoing high risk activities at Sellafield, including liquid discharges into the Irish Sea, the storage of liquid high level waste in ageing tanks and the storage of separated plutonium. On the latter, I welcome the recently published report of the plutonium working group <Col N="1655" />&ndash; part of a standing dialogue between BNFL, local authorities, NGOs and UK regulators &ndash; which explored the options for the safe disposal of separated plutonium. Importantly, the group recognised that there were options other than the manufacture of MOX fuel for the safe disposal of plutonium and that these should continue to be investigated.</P>
    <P>Ireland achieved a further significant step against the continuing liquid discharges from Sellafield at the recent meeting of OSPAR Ministers in Bremen, Germany on 25 and 26 June. This meeting included a review of progress towards achieving the aims of the Sintra Strategy on Radioactive Substances, agreed in 1998. At Sintra Ministers agreed that discharges of radioactive substances into the marine environment should cease by 2020.</P>
    <P>I had been concerned, in the run-up to the meeting in Bremen, that the necessary agreement required to determine baselines for objective monitoring of progress in implementing the Sintra strategy would prove difficult to reach. While my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, who attended the meeting, confirmed that agreement was difficult, I am happy that through his efforts, and with the support of like-minded countries, credible baselines were established for the measurement of progress toward completing the strategy.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the meeting recognised the concerns of Ireland and others about the continuing discharge of technetium-99 from Sellafield and our view that these discharges should cease immediately. It also welcomed the UK's recent request to BNFL to stop discharges from the MAC treatment process for the next nine months. This will create the necessary space for further research into abatement technologies for technetium-99, which I hope will lead to a safe and permanent cessation of these discharges from Sellafield. The Government considers the moratorium proposal to be a welcome and positive development in that it would bring about an immediate cessation of tc-99 discharges to the Irish Sea. We strongly urge that the moratorium proposal be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Government has long been concerned about radioactive discharges to the Irish Sea, including discharges of tc-99, and has consistently called for the immediate cessation of such discharges. In December 2001, my predecessor, Deputy Jacob, expressed his concerns about the proposal by the UK Environment Agency to retain the existing tc-99 discharge authorisation limit of 90 tbq per annum and not to reduce this limit to ten tbq per annum until around 2006. We consider that proposal to be totally at variance with the commitments given by UK Ministers at OSPAR in 1998 when the OSPAR Strategy on Radioactive Substances was adopted. I welcome the request by the UK Government to BNFL to introduce a moratorium on tc-99 discharges pending the introduction of TPP abatement tech<Col N="1656" />nology in respect of treating the existing stored MAC &ndash; medium active concentrate. While welcoming this proposal, the Government would be concerned as to what will happen with the stored MAC if further research into TPP shows that the concerns of both the Environment Agency and the HSE cannot be satisfactorily addressed and that, as a result, the process does not become licensed for use on a commercial scale. In the meantime, Ireland will continue to press for the ending to all other discharges from Sellafield as they continue to constitute unacceptable pollution of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>There is no moral justification for the discharge of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea &ndash; not now, not ever. As technology advances, there are now alternative options available for the safe disposal of this waste. Surely it is better that waste is treated rather than simply dumped into the sea. The horrendous knock-on damage to the marine environment is incalculable and remains so for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. As Minister, I am determined to bring discharges to an end.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Fine Gael amendment, the possible inspection of the Sellafield nuclear plant by Irish experts, in conjunction with appropriate independent international experts, is a matter that is currently under consideration. This issue was raised at a meeting between myself and the former UK Energy Minister, Mr. Brian Wilson, MP, in Dublin on 28 May. I anticipate that it will be followed up in the engagement between the Irish and UK authorities going forward. Accordingly, I have no difficulty accepting the addition contained in the Fine Gael amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion, which is an important recognition of the efforts of the Government to address the concerns of the public in relation to Sellafield. My Department has given, and will continue to give, a high priority to this issue and I would like in particular to acknowledge the commitment and effort of the Attorney General and his staff as well as officials of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland in their prosecution of these cases. The Government remains committed to ensuring the safety of the Irish population, environment and economy from this unacceptable threat.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him and his officials on a splendid speech which has given me more insight into nuclear power than I had before the debate began. The Government has been very wise in actively pursuing the issue of Sellafield, as have previous Governments which took up this issue. As well as monitoring Sellafield, however, will the Minister ensure we keep an eye on an even greater nuclear danger to us, that is the situation regarding Chernobyl? When the Chernobyl explosion took place almost 20 years ago, there was evidence of radiological fallout in this <Col N="1657" />country, and particularly in Wales, which is nearer to Sellafield than Ireland. Distance does not always make something safer.</P>
      <P>The situation now with Chernobyl appears truly appalling. Apparently, the sarcophagus over the damaged reactor is cracking badly. Worse still, one of the scientists who complained about it has been imprisoned. We should make an objection about this to the Belarus Government because if we cannot get information from its scientists, how will we know what is happening there? Will the Minister support international efforts to try to have reparations made of the sarcophagus, or whatever remedial action is necessary, because it appears we are in a serious situation which could cause dreadful damage?</P>
      <P>The Minister will remember that because of a lack of proper organisation of the fire after the explosion, there was considerable loss of life and a considerable spread of radioactive material, including on clothes which were taken away as souvenirs by people all over Russia. I raise this matter now because there are other reactors which could pose a problem and I hope the Minister will support all the EU efforts to have those examined, both within the Russian Republics and any others remaining in eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>I find it alarming that in the invasion and occupation of Iraq, the American and British forces did not see fit to secure the nuclear power stations and facilities. Apparently, there has been theft of low-grade radioactive material. For example, the barrels which were used for storing contaminated water were taken by the locals and used for washing their clothes or storing water or food. Apparently, that has already led to the development of leukaemia in some members of the local population. It is dreadful to think that with the terrible damage already done in Iraq by the invasion and occupation, and due to the inadequate precautions taken by the occupying forces in regard to maintaining the integrity of these sites, the local population will suffer even more. We are aware that the UN monitors were allowed in again to examine these sites but they were not allowed to assess what happened to any of the stolen barrels or to take account of the effect of that on the local population. While the Minister is continuing his good work on Sellafield, I hope he will keep those two issues very much to the forefront.</P>
      <P>The position regarding Sellafield is important but Chernobyl is important also. It appears to be in a disastrous state. At the same time we must monitor the situation in Iraq regarding the possibility of the theft of nuclear material. We know that nuclear material was taken and sold from sites within the Russian Republic shortly after the breakdown of the federation. These are real concerns. They are not something that just happens in films. They happen every day. I would like to think the Minister would also support the international efforts being made to stop these sort of instances occurring.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion and the all-party spirit of it. I have been with this issue off and on for the best part of 20 years. I have a vivid memory from 1986 when Charles Haughey, as Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil, forged by force of character an all-party motion on the closure of Sellafield. Since then, there has been an all-party position on the subject.</P>
      <P>I commend the efforts of successive Ministers. There are three I can recall immediately who pursued this matter with energy &ndash; Ray Burke, Deputy Jacob and the Minister, Deputy Cullen. It is an important issue. I declare an extra interest in that my wife has some relatives who live in Cumbria and it is sad that such a facility is placed in such a beautiful part of the north-west of England.</P>
      <P>There are three dimensions to this, the micro threat, the macro threat and the economic dimension of the argument. As far as the micro threat is concerned, it is a fact that the beaches around Sellafield are closed to the public. If Sellafield were not a threat to anybody, that would not be the case. There are clusters of leukaemia, both among workers and in the vicinity of Sellafield. As the cigarette companies argued for a long time that cancer had nothing to do with smoking and it was a pure coincidence, I think BNFL has been trying to make an argument of the same type in relation to the leukaemia clusters. I am not in the least convinced.</P>
      <P>There has been a poor track record of accidents, with false spin-doctoring of said accidents, going back to the 1950s, which does not inspire great trust or confidence. I have been present at meetings where the matter has come up between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister, who otherwise have very good relations, as we know. The issue seems to be down to the preservation of jobs argument. Sometimes that is a sign that something is on its last legs. I think we would all agree that cleaning up Sellafield is going to be such a mammoth task that it would keep a substantial number of people employed for a long time to come, without continuing proactive reprocessing.</P>
      <P>Obviously what we are most concerned about in this country is the danger of a major accident, arising either from a malfunction or from a threat of terrorism, which is clearly very real. It is a huge ongoing threat, and will remain so for decades if not centuries to come. There are suggestions that this is something which has at least been looked at by terrorist groups. For its own sake as much as ours, the British Government's priority should be to secure the place and close it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any other type of accident that would be so capable of devastating life in these two islands. There can be very bad accidents, like air crashes, train crashes, motorway pile-ups and chemical accidents, but it is very difficult to think of something that could so blight life. We have seen, in the example of Chernobyl, what can happen. A large tract of country in the <Col N="1659" />USSR, which is a huge area, was devastated. These islands are very much smaller.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is being pursued as it makes absolutely no economic sense. The Minister, as an additional string to his bow, should look more closely at the economics of it. I think there has been any amount of false accounting and putting up of spurious economic arguments. I am not surprised that commercially sensitive reports have been suppressed, because the economic case does not stand up.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. A figure of £36 billion sterling in debts associated with Sellafield has been written off. As I pointed out then, would Aer Lingus be allowed by the EU Commission to write off even &euro;100 million of debt? What has happened to the laws of competition? Why is it permissible to subsidise to such vast extent the nuclear industry, which is clearly so uneconomic? If one looks at the restructuring, the thing would collapse if it was not propped up by the government. I doubt if it is any longer much connected with the nuclear arms industry, although originally it was. If Britain thinks that Sellafield enables it to punch above its weight in international councils, I am sceptical about that.</P>
    <P>The British taxpayers are lambs being taken to the slaughter, and quite often they are very passive on this subject. What could £36 billion do for health and education? We need to publicise this to a greater extent. It is a menace to our existence. Let us hope an accident never happens, although we cannot be sure it never will. It is a complete economic nonsense which needs to be exposed. Brussels and the EU Commission, which are always complaining to us about competition, need to be asked why it is that the laws of competition seem to be suspended in the nuclear industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his attendance and the generous way in which he has presented what has happened and what is to happen on this very contentious issue. I also thank him for accepting the amendment. We met in the afternoon, when I found the Minister very generous and ready in his response on this matter. All sides of the House are united on this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body to which Senator Mansergh referred and chairman of the sub-committee dealing with Sellafield. Maybe I can cast light on how this issue is being viewed by recounting an episode that took place when an eminent British Labour party MP, Mr. MacNamara and I, Deputies Glennon, Morgan and a Conservative MP, a very committed person, were on the sub-committee of which I was chairman. At the next meeting of the sub-committee the title of chairman had gone and I was now called the <i>rapporteur,</i> a vague term which means one reports on <Col N="1660" />matters but is not quite the chairman. I did not want to make a fuss about it as I did not think it was worth it, but I did ask Mr. MacNamara, the British MP, how I had lost my title between one meeting of the committee and the next. He brushed it aside, even though he is an active and likeable person. We have had two meetings and we aim to meet again in Jersey and Guernsey on Sunday and Monday, to examine the management of waste material in small countries. I regard the work of the sub-committee of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body on this matter as a fine example of what can be done.</P>
    <P>However, without waving any anti-British flag, I strongly believe Britain wants us all to be quiet about this, as quickly as possible. The intrusion of another voice, which may be discordant from time to time, does not suit their agenda at all. While it is clear the good relationship between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair is wonderful in the context of the North, they do not agree on the plant at Sellafield. We have &ndash; correctly &ndash; been defiant on this issue from the outset, laying out and pressing our case, which we will continue to do.</P>
    <P>I received a telephone call yesterday from a Member of the Norwegian Parliament who will attend the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body as an observer. The Nordic countries have observer status because of the plant at Sellafield. During our conversation he requested a meeting to discuss the issue and informed me of his intention to come to Dublin with his assistant on Friday week, 11 July. He also told me he understood I was no longer chairman of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which I found interesting and indicative of the way the wheels turn. I told him he could address me as he liked, that I was deeply involved in the body and that he was most welcome to attend. I will contact the Minister's office requesting a meeting with officials from the Department to discuss the issue. It occurred to me that certain tentacles had spread when a Norwegian MP could be aware of the change in title. He also informed me he was present at the first meeting in Manchester at which I was appointed chairman.</P>
    <P>Our approach in asserting our right to oppose the discharge of noxious substances into our waters is correct. I visited the site at Sellafield with Deputy Glennon and Mr. Kevin MacNamara MP, where we were courteously treated. The facility and the implications of the activities taking place there are frightening.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by the Minister's statement that there had never been and never would be a moral justification for the discharge of nuclear waste to the Irish Sea. Ireland will continue to be honest but also aggressive and determined in pursuing this matter as the <i>pro tem</i> order demonstrates.</P>
    <P>Large countries have clout, oomph and much else. It is easy to say small and large countries are <Col N="1661" />equal. In reality, strident voices are listened to and their concerns addressed. It is interesting the European Union has woken up and is now asking the reason Ireland did not take the matter before it. The strident voices also appear to have got to the European Union. We will, if required, take the matter to the Union and exhaust every avenue open to us to ensure the &ldquo;For Sale&rdquo; sign goes up on an empty Sellafield plant. Only when we see such a sign will we know the necessary deed has been done.</P>
    <P>A long, difficult and challenging road lies ahead. However, the Minister has got his teeth into the issue, as did the Minister of State in the Department of Public Enterprise during my term of office, Deputy Jacob. The Minister is the first person I have heard pay credit to Deputy Jacob who, as the Minister with full statutory responsibility for the plant at Sellafield, was thorough and relentless in his pursuit of the issue.</P>
    <P>The reason I related the tale about my changing status on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body is that I am curious as to who persuaded Mr. MacNamara MP or the officials of that excellent body that I was to be sidestepped into a change of status. Regardless of whether I am chairman or rapporteur, I have got my teeth into this issue and will be glad to work with the Government and the Opposition to press the case. The Minister is a doughty fighter and I am sure will leave his mark on the issue. I hope there will be remarkable change before the Government's term ends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sellafield is one of the issues on which Government bashing, which we all enjoy, would achieve little. I have learned during my years in politics that there is little point in it, even though I, like most capable Ministers, enjoy it.</P>
      <P>As Members will be aware from my frequent allusions to my profession, I am a chemical engineer. While I am not a nuclear engineer, I am certain there is no such thing as absolute safety. Anybody from Sellafield who comes here professing to be a professional engineer or technical expert and states there is no risk is either being dishonest or betraying his or her profession. There is no such thing as certainty, merely a possibility of minimising risk.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to give the House an academic lecture. However, even my first year students know that risk involves two elements, the probability that something might happen and the scale of the damage that would result if it were to happen. It is possible to play games with numbers and put together risk indices by multiplying scale by probability. Obviously, there is high and low risk but one never has zero risk. For this reason, one always examines the risk and makes a judgment as to whether it is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the British Government has done with regard to the site at Sellafield is make a risk judgment about the British people &ndash; this is a <Col N="1662" />problem for them and I wish they were more alert &ndash; but also about the people of this State without us having any serious input. My promise not to get involved in Government bashing does not extend to a succession of British Governments, which essentially decided that the risks inherent in a project such as that at Sellafield were acceptable.</P>
    <P>The likelihood of the plant at Sellafield blowing up, while on the lower end of the scale, is not zero. Any engineer, technician or specialist who pretends the risk is zero is telling lies. He or she will be aware from his or her training that there is no such thing as absolute safety. An evaluation of the risk is, therefore, essential. The first factor to consider in undertaking such an evaluation is that the potential scale of the damage were something to go wrong is enormous. Moreover, in order to believe the risk is minimal, one must also believe, in the light of the likely scale of damage, that the probability of something going wrong is extremely low.</P>
    <P>The record of Windscale, the former name of Sellafield, is an eloquent statement which attests to the fact that the British Government recognised the reality that people did not trust the installation. It decision to rename calls to mind the renaming of Asbestos Cement in my home town to Tegral Asbestos when the material went out of fashion.</P>
    <P>We do not know what harm the Sellafield plant has done because our methodology for assessing low level environmental damage is still extremely primitive. While I do not wish to claim expertise &ndash; some of my colleagues have much greater expertise than me on this issue &ndash; in western society we are still not equipped to evaluate low level, long-term risks. The possibility of something major happening at Sellafield aside, the possibility of damage to people from low level radiation emissions from the plant is a second consideration. It is easy to state background radiation or discharges are currently quantity X and will be X divided by ten next year, or that there is no scientific evidence that exposure to radiation at such a level causes any harm.</P>
    <P>The only scientific evidence available about the impact of low level radiation derives, tragically, from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. To my knowledge, at least twice or three times over the last 50 years, the threshold level of radiation deemed to be harmless has had to be reduced as evidence accumulated that people exposed to what were supposed to be safe levels of radiation, post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki, began to show signs of damage to their physiology, manifested in the appearance of tumours and such like. Given this, the acceptable level of what was regarded as safe radiation dropped.</P>
    <P>The second issue concerns not only the level of exposure but also the long-term effects. How can it be said exposure for 40, 50 or 60 years is safe when there is not enough evidence, studies or <Col N="1663" />knowledge? The same could be said of the medium to long-term consequences of incineration, even from the best incinerators, although incineration is on a much lower plane. The medium to long-term consequence of radiation cannot be known. For example, it cannot be known if the reproductive organs of a generation of young people are being slightly affected by exposure to low level radiation. It may be one or two generations before the damage becomes apparent.</P>
    <P>Nothing is safe. Therefore, the scale of what is happening at Sellafield is sufficient to justify our campaign. In addition, nobody can say with certainty that exposure to even slightly increased levels of background low level radiation is harmless. It is only 60 years since the first nuclear fission was procured. This is an insufficient time period in which to gather enough information to be certain about the consequences. The wise precaution in such circumstances is to take the classical approach that the risks could be huge. Therefore, the precautions must be proportional to the potential risks. In this instance, the potential risk could be huge. Therefore, the wise approach is to close down the plant.</P>

      <P>I raise the situation regarding community employment schemes, particularly as they apply to the Irish Wheelchair Association. Personal carers are to be withdrawn. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, and the <Col N="1664" />chief executive of the association, Séamus Thompson, met yesterday. Perhaps the critical situation of recent days may be resolved. Mr. Thompson outlined the position in his letter of 25 June. I look forward to the Minister of State's comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's concerns and note his comments on the position of the Irish Wheelchair Association. The association's headquarters are located in Clontarf, in my constituency of Dublin North-Central. It does a huge a amount of work. I appreciate its concerns in this matter.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of community employment as an active labour market programme is to reintegrate long-term unemployed persons into open labour market secure jobs. Community employment provides unemployed people with temporary opportunities, whereby they can develop their skills and, I hope, obtain work having secured a record of work experience.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced, reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. As part of this process, a decision was taken to gradually reduce the numbers employed on community employment from an average of 37,500 in 1999 to 28,000 by 2003. Mainstreaming of school services, with general reductions in participation levels due to lower levels of unemployment and budgetary requirements, have further reduced the numbers employed on the programme.</P>
      <P>The average participation rate on the community employment programme for 2003 is expected to be approximately 22,500. Funding, amounting to &euro;274 million, has been provided for this purpose. At the end of 2002 there were 24,991 participants in the programmes. This number will reduce to a projected participation rate of 20,000 by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>In line with a commitment in the PPF and following consultation with relevant Departments and the social partners, certain school services provided by participants on community employment programmes have been mainstreamed. This provided for additional funding, representing 4,514 on community employment places in schools, to transfer to the Department of Education and Science on a phased basis by 2003. The availability of this funding has enabled the Department to put in place an equitable system of funding for auxiliary services throughout the free education school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participation in community employment programmes is usually for a period of one to three years. All school based participants have been <Col N="1665" />facilitated to complete their full engagement in their school project. However, community employment participants are not being replaced in schools and further provision of schools services, including classroom assistants, caretakers and secretarial positions, is now a matter solely for the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>As part of the restructuring approved by the Government in 1999, future participation in community employment programmes by an individual was capped at three years, effective from April 2000. An individual's participation in a programme prior to this date is not taken into account. This change was introduced to discourage repeat participation in community employment and encourage unemployed persons to avail of training and education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful outcomes with regard to the progression to jobs for the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>Community employment is an elective labour market programme and, as such, the concept of progression by participants is central to it. Self-employment services are available to assist participants who have completed their term of community employment to progress to employment on the open labour market or to advise on training and education options available locally.</P>
    <P>The three year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period. FÁS has discretion to offer up to 20% of CE participants a further period on the programme on a case by case basis. An extension is considered if, on reaching the end of their normal community employment entitlements, participants are likely to experience difficulty obtaining employment due to age, literacy or numeracy problems or a lack of suitable jobs available locally. To ensure that persons with disabilities were not adversely affected by the ongoing restructuring of the community employment programme, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, which has primary responsibility for funding in this area, considered the possible mainstreaming of community employment services provided in the health sector.</P>
    <P>A detailed examination of the practicalities involved in mainstreaming these positions was undertaken and it was discovered that an additional &euro;46 million would be required on top of the contribution from existing community employment funding to mainstream them. Due to the very high demands on the health budget, it has not been possible to provide this additional funding in the current Estimates provision of the Department of Health and Children. I am pleased to indicate that all health service related community employment projects, including those providing services for persons with disabilities, are ring-fenced and protected from reductions. Other services ring-fenced from reductions include <Col N="1666" />drugs task force activity and child care service provision. Projects in RAPID areas are prioritised.</P>
    <P>Sponsor organisations, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, have indicated that they have difficulty in replacing participants who have completed their normal term of community employment due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme. In this regard, FÁS has been requested to make every effort to identify community employment participants suitable for the positions in question. Should FÁS encounter difficulties in replacing departing CE participants with suitable persons, the matter can be considered in the context of the 20% flexibility in relation to extending community employment participation.</P>
    <P>A number of reviews of community employment are underway. The Programme for Prosperity and Fairness provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. In addition, an interdepartmental group consisting of senior officials has been asked to consider options for the future of community employment taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is completing an internal review of community employment and the job initiative programme which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly.</P>
    <P>The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of the community employment programme. I appreciate and understand Senator Leyden's perspective and the points he raised. I will ensure they are taken on board in the considerations I have outlined.</P>

      <P>I wish to query the Government's road building capability. The national development plan was launched with great fanfare a few years ago and we were told we would have dual carriageways everywhere by 2006. We were promised there would be no more delays and that our infrastructure, which the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment described as being of Third World standard, would be upgraded. We were told we had nothing more to fear. Unfortunately, we are only three years away from 2006 and we have fallen far behind schedule. People are wasting their lives stuck in cars due to congestion, while incurring massive insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's record in this area is not good. According to recent reports, over 20 major projects are ready to begin, but the Government <Col N="1667" />has failed to provide the necessary funding. I hope the Minister of State will clarify this matter in his response. I would also be grateful if the Minister of State would clarify the Government's commitment to the national development plan. During the last general election campaign, there was grave confusion and blatantly opportunistic politicking by Fianna Fáil and, in particular, the Progressive Democrats in the south east in relation to the N9 from Kilcullen to Waterford. Deputy O'Donnell recently spoke in the south east and stated that the Progressive Democrats had made no promises in the last general election. She said they were made by the Fianna Fáil boys. This is not the truth and I seek clarification on the status of the major intercity routes connecting Dublin, Cork and Waterford.</P>
    <P>How do we plan to upgrade these roads? We are being told by some Progressive Democrats that they feel these projects are a waste of money. If this is the case, why is the NRA making almost &euro;3 million available to Kilkenny County Council to progress the southern end of the N9 motorway? Why is the NRA providing &euro;2 million to Kildare County Council with regard to the same project? Why are landowners being told one thing only to find that the opposite happens? Landowners are badly affected by the road and they deserve to know where they stand. While it is awful to have a motorway built on one's farm, especially if one is involved in dairying, if one knows one is to be compensated and when that compensation will be paid, one can plan ahead and move on. Landowners cannot do that at present as certain politicians are making mutually exclusive statements.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will clarify the status of the major interurban routes as well as the commitment of the Government to honour the promise it made to the people in the national development plan to improve our infrastructure.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Browne for raising this issue. My ministerial colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has asked me to tender his apologies. He is caught up in a meeting. I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the important issue of the national roads programme and to report on progress in implementing the upgraded programme provided for in the national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Brennan, and I wish to see a safe and efficient road network which we recognise is a key ingredient for continued economic success, more balanced regional development and enhanced levels of personal mobility. In response to the long-standing and well-recognised deficiencies in the national road network, the national development plan provided for a major increase in investment in upgrading the national roads network. Exchequer spending on the national roads improvement programme this year will amount to over &euro;1.2 billion which is the highest ever level. Investment in the period <Col N="1668" />2000-03 will amount to &euro;3.823 billion which exceeds by approximately 13% the figure forecast in the national development plan.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne took the opportunity to make a political point in respect of commitments made during the last general election campaign. That election was won on the basis of the good government practised by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats since 1997. Some people are sore at the fact that the people had the confidence in the Government to re-elect it, which is something we have not seen in this State's recent history. Senator Browne's party had the opportunity to invest in roads and to fulfil its other promises, but it failed. There were other instances when his party made promises but failed to implement them.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the expenditure on this issue. Much is being achieved with this level of investment. The House will be aware of the continuing transformation of the road network around the country. Good progress is being made in upgrading the network as evidenced by the 27 schemes completed in the period 2000 to date, including major projects on the M1; 16 major projects in construction or due to start shortly, including the bypasses of Kildare, Monasterevin, Kilcock/Kinnegad and Cashel; and the commencement of the tendering process on ten further projects throughout the country with a view, subject to available funding and the outcome of the tendering process, to commencing work on the projects in 2004. These include long awaited bypasses of Loughrea, Ennis and Ashbourne as well as the Sligo inner relief road.</P>
    <P>Route by route, the network is being upgraded to a standard that will support growth and development and facilitate more balanced regional development. Senator Browne is concerned about cost overruns and delays in completing the programme in the timeframe originally envisaged. He is not alone in this regard. All involved in implementing the programme share these concerns. The cost of the programme mandated in the NDP has increased substantially. The main reasons for this are some underestimation in costs when the NDP was being drawn up in 1999; construction cost inflation in the period 1999-2001; exceptional items such as the upgrade of the N9, higher land costs on the south eastern motorway and additional costs on the Dublin port tunnel; higher land acquisition costs, particularly in Dublin and adjacent to urban areas; and the availability of more accurate and detailed estimates as projects progressed from preliminary to more detailed planning.</P>
    <P>A proactive response is being taken to address the pressures arising from the increased cost of the programme. The NRA has strengthened its arrangements for cost estimation and control as an integral part of the strengthening of project management and monitoring arrangements, including appointment of a cost estimation specialist who reviews all cost estimates, benchmarking tender and scheme outturn costs and <Col N="1669" />greater use of design and build lump sum contracts offering cost efficiencies, greater certainty of outturn costs and reduced scope for claims.</P>
    <P>The increased cost of the programme means that some projects will take longer to complete than originally envisaged. Nevertheless, the ambitious upgrade programme provided for in the NDP remains a valid strategic framework for the development of the national roads network. On the basis of a continuation of existing levels of funding, the NRA estimates that full completion of the major inter-urban routes could extend to 2009-10. However, route completion dates will depend on the funding levels available in the years ahead and on construction and land acquisition costs. The Government is seeking to ensure, within the constraints of available funding, that the pace and momentum of the national roads upgrade programme is maintained and, if possible, accelerated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport is committed to achieving real improvements in the transport network. He is considering ways of accelerating and streamlining procedures for the delivery of major infrastructure projects in the transport area. The focus will be on developing a package of measures which will shorten the approval period for such projects and also reduce costs. The Minister has already made progress in this regard, some of which received coverage in the media recently.</P>

Measures under consideration include the degree to which public consultation is appropriate and issues connected with compensation for land being compulsorily acquired. The preparation of a critical transport infrastructure Bill is included in the current Government legislation programme. The House will agree that significant improvement of our national roads network is clearly underway despite the challenges presented by the implementation of a programme of such magnitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the Minister is familiar with the background to this issue. I have raised it consistently in the Seanad over the past year. There is no need for me to make the case for the Cork School of Music. It has been well made and the case was accepted by the Government inasmuch as it entered into a public private partnership process to secure the construction of a new school. Unfortunately, that has not happened.</P>
      <P>There is growing frustration in Cork about this, mainly because the city successfully bid to be designated European capital of culture in 2005. Winning the bid was a great reflection on the people of Cork and of this country. However, the bid hinged on the construction of the flagship new school of music. We have been let down. The school has not been built and it is unlikely to be built. Even if it is given the go ahead in the next couple of weeks, we will be lucky to see it completed by 2005. Not only is this a potential embarrassment for the people of Cork, it is also a potential embarrassment for the Government and the country. We have let the side down with regard to this bid.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of different answers when I have raised this issue. I hope the Minister will be able to clarify a number of points this evening. We are told by the Government that there is a difficulty with EUROSTAT. The problem is that EUROSTAT claims it has not been consulted on the matter and it has put that claim in writing. I believe the other problem relates to an interpretation of EUROSTAT's ruling by the CSO. The Taoiseach said in Cork last Thursday that he was doing everything possible about this issue but he then went on to repeat the EUROSTAT opinion or interpretation. Will the Minister write to EUROSTAT and ask for its interpretation? The Minister should then make the correspondence public so we will know, once and for all, whether EUROSTAT has a problem with it or if it is an internal problem in this country.</P>
      <P>Much as I hate to say it, I believe it is an internal problem. There seems to be a blockage in the Department of Finance even though that should not be the case, given that the Department was represented in the processing of the public private partnership and in the tendering process. If there were problems or difficulties, they should have been highlighted then. We should not have reached the stage of selecting a preferred bidder and then not placing the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a serious industrial relations problem looming and it will be upon us next September. The staff and students vacated the school of music 18 months ago to facilitate its demolition and the construction of the new school. They are in temporary accommodation in hotel rooms and other venues, which causes huge health and safety <Col N="1671" />issues. The students and staff have had tremendous patience but I cannot see that continuing into next September. There is a window of opportunity in the next couple of weeks to remove this blockage and do what is right. We must honour the case that was made and, more importantly, ensure this country is not let down in the eyes of our European colleagues in 2005. Otherwise, it will be an eternal embarrassment for us.</P>
    <P>I apologise if I sound frustrated but the Cathaoirleach and other Senators are aware that I have been raising this issue for 12 months. I am only reflecting the frustration of the people of Cork about it.</P>

      <P>News about anything in the Cork area is of specific interest for me. I do not take offence at anything that the Senator has said and understand the frustration he is expressing on behalf of the people of Cork. I presume he was referring not only to those associated with or who have an interest in the School of Music but also to all other participants, including those who might be looking at PPPs and other such projects. I appreciate that there are obstacles, cumbersome and otherwise, in the system but one recognises that in a fair and balanced system where people can avail of an appeals process, it can take time to surmount them. The democratic appeals process is part of the hiccup in the case of the Cork School of Music. To be as fair as possible, I will outline to the House the position to date.</P>
      <P>The project was launched in July 2000 and 12 consortia expressed an interest in bidding. After initial presentations and interviews, a final shortlist of three bidders was issued with the invitation to negotiate documentation in November 2000. In that short period, July to November 2000, the project made quick progress. Detailed evaluation of the final bids was undertaken just two months later in February 2001. Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder just four weeks later in the following month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officials and advisers of the Department of Education and Science entered into a period of intense discussions with Jarvis with a view to reaching financial close on the project. During this period Jarvis, under the terms of the project, sought and received planning permission for the <Col N="1672" />project from Cork City Council. However, An Taisce, as it was entitled to do, submitted a planning appeal to An Bord Pleanála against the grant of permission. During the period of the appeal, work on the project was suspended and resumed only after An Bord Pleanála rejected the appeal and granted planning permission for the development on 24 December 2001.</P>
    <P>When the project was first launched, the economic climate was healthy. Since then, however, as we are all aware, the economy has suffered significantly, particularly because of the downturn in the global economy, so much so that the affordability of each capital project must be examined closely in the context of overall Government expenditure. This brings me to the question of the general government balance, the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the stability and growth pact of the Maastricht Treaty. Under EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general government balance over the construction phase.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan referred to the role of EUROSTAT. I would like to clarify the position for him. If he has any further questions, I will be happy to provide further clarification. A EUROSTAT group is reviewing the accounting rules on the issue to which I have referred. A standing committee, established by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will also advise on the general government balance implications of private sector financed projects. EUROSTAT ruled on the GGB implications of the bundle of five post-primary schools and found that the capital cost must be reckoned for GGB purposes. To answer the question the Senator posed specifically, it has not ruled on the Cork School of Music project. The prudent approach, therefore, is to adopt a working assumption that the cost of the project will have to be counted for GGB purposes.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, final approval for the Cork School of Music project will be a matter for the Government. Consideration will be based on a thorough assessment of its affordability in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes in the future, taking into account the issues surrounding the general government balance. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, expressed his desire that I inform the Senator that both he and his Department will continue to pursue the matter with all concerned with a view to having it determined by Government in the very near future. I hope this is helpful.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 July 2003.</P>
