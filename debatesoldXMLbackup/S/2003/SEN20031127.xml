      <P>I have received notice from Senator Wilson that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to extend the rural renewal scheme beyond 2004.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when Presentation College, Askea, County Carlow, will be approved for works under the school building programme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a procedural motion agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the attendance of Dana Rosemary Scallon, MEP, in the House this afternoon, with the arrangements as outlined in the motion, to be taken without debate; No. 2, a procedural motion as agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges regarding the attendance of Nuala Ahern, MEP, in the House this afternoon, with the arrangements as outlined in the motion, to be taken without debate; No. 3, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of No. 12 on today's Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, concerning the application of certain provisions of the 2000 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and its 2001 protocol to Iceland and Norway, to be taken without debate; No. 4, the address by Pat Cox, MEP, President of the European Parliament, this morning, the arrangements for which were agreed yesterday; and No. 5, the Road Traffic Bill 2003 &ndash; All Stages, to be <Col N="1506" />taken at 4 p.m, to conclude not later than 5 p.m, and an early signature motion for that Bill on its receipt from Dáil Éireann this afternoon. The general office will circulate a Supplementary Order Paper on notification from the Dáil that the Bill has been completed there. There will be a sos from 12.40 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
      <P>There are those who would rightfully ask why we cannot deal with the Road Traffic Bill during the period allocated for the sos, but we will not have received it from the Dáil at that time. It must pass through the Dáil and then come to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Members were shocked to hear this morning of the stabbing of a man in his forties in Ballyfermot last night. He was defending his property, trying to stop thugs from interfering with his car, and was stabbed to death as a result of his actions. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should make a statement on this matter, although the issue will probably come before the courts. Once again we see knife-related crime in this city, perpetrated by a small, persistent group of young people who feel they have a right not only to interfere with property but to kill people who stand in their way. It is appalling. I am sure all Members want to pay their respects to the gentleman who died this morning in St. James's Hospital for doing nothing more than defending his property. It is an indictment of this society that people can pull knives on each other as quickly as they would look at each other. This House should have statements on this matter at the earliest possible time so that we may express our revulsion at what is taking place in this city and throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, the Leader kindly arranged to publish the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill amendments and circulated them to Members. I know it is the Government's intention to take Committee Stage of the Bill next week. My spokesman has asked me to establish whether it is possible that the deadline for submitting amendments to the Bill could be extended to Monday of next week rather than tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. However, if Committee Stage were taken at a later date next week, it would allow us to spend more time on the amendments proposed by the Government. Given that the Leader told us earlier this week that the Bill has been virtually rewritten, I think we should consider it carefully. I ask the Government to consider this in consultation with the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to restate a matter I raised some months ago. In 1792, a Count Rice from Dingle organised a plan to free Marie Antoinette from incarceration. The count and his family <Col N="1507" />organised a fleet of ships to take her from France to the safety of Dingle and a house was prepared for her there. This is the only connection between Ireland and Marie Antoinette. Rice House, currently in the ownership of Údarás na Gaeltachta, is now threatened with sale. I raised this issue before and while the cottage is still for sale, the sale was not proceeded with at that time. The Government needs to take a firmer stand and protect the Marie Antoinette residence. Rice House is one of the few surviving examples of an 18th century merchant's house in Ireland and should be protected in the national interest. I ask the Leader to raise this at the appropriate level of Government and perhaps hold a discussion on it in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am reluctant to go back over old ground, I have a fundamental issue that I wish to raise yet again, namely, the way in which our policy on embryonic stem cell research was reached. While a compromise is apparently being worked out, the Oireachtas will not know what this is until the vote takes place on 3 December at a meeting of the Council of Ministers. For most of my political career I have been one of the more Euro-critical Members of this House. I should point out that I am broadly in agreement with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the matter. However, the Government should not decide this matter without authorisation from both Houses of the Oireachtas. If the Government states it is entitled to negotiate on such matters without authorisation from the Oireachtas, then the whole idea of accountability and subsidiarity in the EU is entirely meaningless. Public scepticism will grow about the European project. If people begin to believe that the big issues will be decided in secret and without accountability, they will not take the project to their hearts and it will eventually fall apart.</P>
      <P>Now that there has been a breathing space, the Government should table a motion for debate in both Houses that states its position and seeks the approval of the Oireachtas. That is functioning democracy. My views on the EU have been consistent for 20 years and I have not changed my position. I see it as a good project done badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet the Senator voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the Nice treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will discuss that with Senator Hayes in another place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I sought a debate on child poverty in this country. The Taoiseach and the Combat Poverty Agency appear to have different views on the extent of child poverty. Measured by the same indices used by the Combat Poverty Agency in Ireland, we have the second highest level of child poverty in Europe. We should be profoundly ashamed of this and should debate and try to remedy it rather than pretending it is not a <Col N="1508" />problem. I ask the Leader for a debate on the issue before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas every year the Government side calls for a debate on homelessness. Given that public policy is now deliberately creating homelessness, can I at least request the honour of their silence on the issue for the next six weeks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the overturning of the conviction of a former Christian Brother, Paul Farrell, two days ago by the Court of Criminal Appeals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a question for the Leader on this. Paul Farrell gave 30 years of his life to teaching in an institution and was principal of an inner city school in Dublin. He was convicted on the flimsiest of evidence and the judge was found to have erred in three matters of fact&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can discuss rulings of the courts. The Judiciary is independent and we cannot discuss its rulings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point I am making. Some years ago, the Taoiseach rightly made a full apology to victims of institutional abuse in this country. This case is an example of similar institutional abuse of a former Christian Brother. I ask the Leader to consider asking the Taoiseach if he will make an apology to people who have been similarly abused by the institutions of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support what Senator O'Toole said about Rice House. I hope this House might consider renewing its appeal in order that this historic building is saved for the nation.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Leader to use her good offices regarding a place dear to her and countless thousands of people, including me, namely, Dinis Cottage. The cottage is at the meeting of waters in the heart of Killarney National Park and is badly in need of reconstruction and renovation. Money had been set aside this year to do this. Sadly, there has been an appeal from someone living quite far away from the cottage, although that is neither here nor there as he is apparently within his rights. I ask the Leader if, with the support of the House, we can assure the moneys that have been set aside for these important works might be made available next year. The appeal will mean that the works will not be carried out this year.</P>

      <P>This House should send a protest to the Israeli ambassador to Ireland regarding the erection of a new Berlin Wall around the State of Palestine by the Israeli Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect most people will have seen page 17 of today's <i>Irish Independent. </i>This is the new Berlin wall, built by Israelis whose people were treated in a particularly difficult way during the Second World War. Now they are imitating the East German authorities in building a wall three times higher than the Berlin wall. They have cut off the city of Qalqilya. I spoke to the Palestinian ambassador this morning about this issue.</P>

      <P>Order please. I want to be fair to Senator Leyden. What is the Senator's question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be an emergency debate in this House prior to the recess. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, will be assuming the Presidency of the European Union from 1 January and will have tremendous influence as regards the Israelis. However, they have turned down the United States of America which has withdrawn $290 million in loans from Israel because it was being used to build this new Berlin wall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already built and is 900 kms in length. When the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Pat Cox, comes into the House, he should be told that he, too, can play a role in this regard. We should condemn in the strongest possible manner the approach of the Israeli Government and its treatment of the Palestinians. Finally&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;as regards access to Bethlehem, the location of the nativity 2,000 years ago, we should ensure that Christians are able to go there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a shocking incident last night in Ballyfermot when a man was followed into his own home by people because he dared to defend his own property. I find that astonishing and strongly support Senator Brian Hayes's call for a debate on this matter. I am sure he is supported on all sides of the House. It is not just a matter for this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Leader share my concern and revul<Col N="1510" />sion at the attacks on polling stations in Derry by republican mobs? These were people attacking their own community's right to vote. It is from that source that we got this stuff about &ldquo;one man one vote&rdquo; when that merely reflected what we had down here with regard to property qualifications; it was always one man one vote. It is interesting to see how democratically certain elements take this right.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Toole as regards Rice House. This would be a wonderful development in Dingle because it is a marvellously romantic story. I did not realise until Senator O'Toole raised it in the House about a year ago that there was a connection with an attempt to smuggle Marie Antoinette out of revolutionary France. It is significant that this fine building is an unusual example of a Roman Catholic merchant's house of that period. I support a debate on that and measures to defend the house. We had a descendant of Colonel Rice in the House yesterday as a guest, Professor Valentine Rice of Trinity College Dublin, who met the Leader.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments of Senator Morrissey and it is something I intended to raise, but I would like to put it in a slightly different way. We all sympathise with victims of sexual abuse, whether it be from clerical sources or within the family or wherever. However, there are other victims. It is worrying that a small number of people have been unjustly accused. If I was one of them I would not give a damn about an apology, but there should be compensation. People have been deprived of their income and position in society and held up to contempt and abuse. In cases where there is an injustice of this kind, some rectification should be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Morrissey in his comments regarding the former Christian Brother, Mr. Farrell. I commend his compassion in so doing because we are living in an age where many members of religious orders feel they no longer have a voice. Everyone in this House accepts that the vast majority of the religious gave great service and have not done anything wrong. Mr. Farrell is now an innocent man, but as he has said, his life is ruined. I commend RTE for the exposure it has given him. This House has given plenty of time to defending the rights of those who have been abused. It is time for us to provide a voice for those who have been wrongly accused and whose lives have been ruined. I would go as far as Senator Morrissey did in his contribution. This is important in that the only hope we have to save the good names of those people &ndash; there are other cases &ndash; is if an apology in this case is offered from the highest voice in the land, namely the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Roads Authority is due to have a board meeting on 9 December about the roads project for the year. It might be fitting if we could debate the issue in the House next week with the Minister for Transport, <Col N="1511" />Deputy Brennan. He has spoken about plans to fast-track the Cork-Galway motorway but he has not indicated how this will be done. We need to know which projects will be shelved in order to facilitate this motorway. A debate on tolling should be included.</P>
      <P>A debate in the House next week on the Northern Ireland elections would be apposite because the outcome will be known. I have spent some time in Northern Ireland this week canvassing, as did many other Members. From what I heard many of the bad old ways have not gone away. We heard about racketeering and intimidation by certain factions. We should have a debate on that entire issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes I have one question for the Leader. I would like to support Senator Leyden's request for a balanced debate on the Middle East. If the way the security fence is drawn is unacceptable so are the suicide bombings which kill many innocent civilians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was struck, coming up to Christmas, with the number of fundraisers with open buckets on the streets of Dublin. I was reminded that the same fundraisers seem to operate with different charities. I am not sure what the position is in regard to our charity legislation. One wonders what proportion of a donation is received by the charity, given that fund raisers very often are paid on a percentage profit basis. Is it time to review our charity legislation as the British are doing? I read yesterday in the Queen's speech in Britain that a charities Bill is being introduced to secure some control over collections. In the case of some charities such as St. Vincent de Paul one knows that every euro donated goes to the charity. Others might not have the same constraints.</P>
      <P>I was impressed, on seeing a list of the 23 Bills in the British legislative programme and the seven draft Bills they have introduced, to see in many cases that they are following us. There are some that we should consider following. They intend, for example, to have a Bill for the House of Lords to remove some of the hereditary peers. The aim is to select some non-party members. I am not suggesting that should become part of the review of the Seanad, but perhaps it should be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Quinn's call for a discussion at some stage on charities legislation. It is time something was done about that. It is long overdue. The Senator <Col N="1512" />is right to pinpoint the people on the streets with boards who are paid and make money from this.</P>
      <P>I also support the proposal of a debate on Northern Ireland before Christmas. We will know the result of the election by tomorrow but it is optimistic to think that we will know the outcome. That will take some months. I support Senator O'Toole's remarks about the house in Dingle.</P>
      <P>My view of the religious orders is similar to that of Senator Ó Murchú. I was educated by a religious order and I worked for one. I have enormous respect for the work the orders have done. At the same time, to assert that the Taoiseach should apologise personally every time a case is overturned on appeal is to trivialise both the office of the Taoiseach and the legal system. We should not ask him to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan" hpid="Mr. J. Phelan Mr. J. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes's request for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to discuss the incident that occurred last night. While the Minister is here he could also discuss his proposed reforms of the Garda Síochána. This has been raised by a number of Senators over the past week but the Leader has not responded adequately. I urge her to invite the Minister to the House to discuss these reforms. It would be devastating for rural areas to have any more Garda stations closed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quinn's call for a debate on the charity organisations. There is such an overlap at this time of the year that a debate is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Maurice Hayes's call for a debate on Northern Ireland before Christmas. We have deliberately delayed having such a debate for diplomatic reasons but it is critical now that such a debate be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes brought the murder last night to our attention. The starkness of the murder was terrible. Any of us might go outside the house at night to check if the car has been locked or to get something from it. To be murdered for the simple act of looking after one's property is appalling. I have been endeavouring to bring the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House. He wishes to come here but timing is the problem for both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question was asked about the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill. A total of 55 amendments have already been put down and, to an extent, the Bill has been redrawn. It is an important Bill and one we are anxious to discuss fully. If that is to be done, the debate will have to commence next week. It is scheduled for Tuesday because we will deal with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill on Wednesday. We would be pre<Col N="1513" />pared to continue discussing the Bill into the following week to ensure it is given adequate time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Committee Stage be over two weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. That would allow plenty of time for discussion of important amendments and for putting down more amendments.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the Rice House in Dingle and asked that it be preserved. Last evening Senator Norris and I met Val Rice, whom I know well, in the House. Senator Ryan asked for statements in each House before the next vote takes place on the embryo stem cell research programme in Brussels. I will consult with the Whips in the Dáil to see if that can be done. They will point out that Senators have already debated it, which is true, but the controversy on this matter has hardened somewhat. It might be necessary to discuss it again.</P>
      <P>I take the point that citizens are critical of Europe. If decisions are taken which are not transparent, open and debated, they will believe things are being done in a furtive fashion. However, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has been very open with this House and she answered questions for almost two hours in the Dáil this week. She has not been found wanting in that regard. Nevertheless, I agree there is a need to have greater transparency on such issues if we hope to get the support of citizens.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also sought a debate on child poverty. We hope to hold that debate the week after next. Senator Morrissey raised the issue of the Judiciary but I am reluctant to enter into that debate. All my life I have refrained from commenting on judgments.</P>

      <P>I will answer his point when responding to Senator Ó Murchú. This House should not discuss who made a judgment or what way it was made. Senator Norris tackled this matter in another way by referring to the need for compensation. However, it is a matter for citizens to take their case.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan agreed with Senator O'Toole about Rice House and also referred to Dinis Cottage in Killarney. I spent a pleasant few hours with Senator Coghlan in Dinis Cottage in Killarney.</P>

      <P>I said we had libations, nothing else. Senator Leyden referred to the new Berlin Wall in the city of Kalkilya which is photographed in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>. He asked me to invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House. I have written to the Minister and told him that all Members of the House want him to come to the House for a debate on international matters. I hope he will come to the House for that debate. The Senator also spoke about access to Bethlehem.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris supported Senator Brian Hayes and Senator O'Toole. He spoke about people who are wrongly accused of seeking compensation. Senator Ó Murchú supported Senator Morrissey. I do not wish to comment on that case. I hope he and Senator Morrissey will excuse me from discussing the judicial statement. In general, however, the issue of abuse in institutions is becoming unbalanced in several cases. Of course, there were dark days. However, there were also sunlit days when great education was given. I am thinking in particular of women who received a proper education, which they would never ordinarily have received. We need to keep a sense of perspective in such a debate but because the abuse was so horrific, our minds tend to focus on that. Nevertheless, we need to look at both sides.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne raised the NRA and the fast tracking of roads. He also wants a debate on Northern Ireland. I have asked the Taoiseach to come to the House to debate Northern Ireland. In fact, two letters have been sent, one to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and one to the Taoiseach. If time permits and they have the time to come to the House, both debates will be held before Christmas. That is what I requested. Senator Mansergh supported Senator Leyden's call for a balanced debate. I will find out later what was meant by his remark about chivalry.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to the overlapping of charities, comments which were supported by Senator Ormonde. A clear statement is needed on the matter. He spoke about the list of 30 Bills in the UK, which I hope to read today. He said that the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, hopes to abolish hereditary peers, but I do not know what who will replace them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes referred to Northern Ireland, on which I hope to have a debate. He voiced a note of caution on the point made earlier <Col N="1515" />by another Senator and he spoke in general about religious orders.</P>
    <P>Senator John Paul Phelan asked if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would come to the House. We pursue him up and down the corridors and he is anxious to come to the House, which I hope will happen.</P>
    <P>Senator White expressed a wish for a debate on Northern Ireland. It is hoped to have such a debate before the end of the session.   </P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to welcome Mr. Pat Cox, President of the European Parliament, to Seanad Éireann. His attendance is particularly timely in view of Ireland's forthcoming EU Presidency. Over the past few years, President Cox has become one of Europe's most celebrated political figures. He has raised the profile of the European Parliament as well as being a strong ambassador for Ireland. One had only to be present in the House in October 2002 when President Cox addressed Seanad Éireann to appreciate his commitment to Europe. His enthusiasm and passion for the enlargement of the Union was also obvious. To this end he worked tirelessly and visited all accession countries. He has addressed many of their parliaments explaining both rights and responsibilities that come with membership. I call on President Cox to address Seanad Éireann.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to touch on a number of themes about the moment we are living through as Irish Europeans and in the European Union. We are on the threshold of 2004, a year of renewal and redefinition for the European project. It will be a year of renewal because the European Union will grow from 15 to 25 states. In a certain way we will fulfil two powerful visions from two very different sources in the act of realising that enlargement. One, I recall, was the first visit paid by the current Pontiff, Pope John Paul II, to his native land in Poland in 1978, when he said he believed that our old Continent would never really heal earlier injury if it could not breathe fully with its two lungs, east and west. Next year we will breathe on those two lungs. The other vision is to be found in the seminal speech in May 1950 by the then <Col N="1517" />French Foreign Minister, Robert Schuman, which set out the thinking on new European institutions for the foundation states of European integration after the Second World War. Inside all of those institutional ideas was one big value, that of creative reconciliation. For our generation of Europeans, 1 May 2004 will be the most powerful generational act of creative reconciliation that our Continent has seen in our lifetime. The second act of renewal and redefinition is that we will have a new constitutional treaty, not yet ratified, but already available in the public market place of ideas and debate as we move into 2004.</P>
    <P>A new European Parliament will be elected in June 2004. Its first job will be to vote on a nominee President for the new European Commission, whose first job will be to introduce a five year programme and appoint a new team of Commissioners. Considerable energy and focus will be required in respect of any new capacities this new Europe may derive from constitutional change. The Irish Presidency arises at an extraordinary moment characterised by a conjunction of Europeanness, growth and development of a scale and nature we have not seen before. I am so pleased, as an Irish person, that this happy coincidence should prevail from next January.</P>
    <P>As President of the European Parliament, I express my gratitude to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, who in recent months have worked with us in the Parliament to establish an Irish presence. Many Irish Ministers have already been to Brussels and Strasbourg, where they met the committee leaders, across all parties, to discuss the work they must do.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency will begin in a public way in January, but it has already begun many months ago in terms of planning and strategy. Although this process has gone unseen it should not go unremarked. It represents an intense level of necessary co-operation, and in this regard I thank the Government.</P>
    <P>I thank the Irish public servants with whom Irish public life is blessed and acknowledge their extraordinarily high quality. I take a particular Irish pride in recognising that the first and only woman to be a permanent representative of a state before the European Union is the Irish EU ambassador Anne Anderson. She and her team from the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments are in the engine room preparing for the Presidency. It is proper that I should acknowledge, on the basis of my parliamentary work, the extent of their long engagement in the planning process.</P>
    <P>Of the many distinguished Members of this House, I single out and thank Senator Maurice Hayes on behalf of the European Parliament. The leadership he has given through the National Forum on Europe was indispensable to Ireland's acceptance of the Nice treaty, which in turn was indispensable to realising enlargement next year during the Irish Presidency. Moreover, given that <Col N="1518" />the Senator is so good at his work, the work he will continue and need to do when we have a new constitutional treaty to debate and ratify will remain central to Ireland's ongoing role in Europe.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament was very impressed and pleased with the method of preparation of the constitutional treaty on the part of the Convention on the Future of Europe. We believe this is the way to open up debate to a wider audience. Even if people chose not to follow the debate, they cannot claim to have been excluded. The convention sat for 17 months and had, between full and substitute members, 207 members representing Governments and Parliaments from 28 states, including the Houses of the Oireachtas, and also the European Commission and European Parliament. The convention heard more than 2,000 spoken contributions on the public record, dealt with more than 6,000 amendments and considered more than 240 proposals. It published 23,500 documents, including amendments, proposals, analyses, input and revision, on the Internet as they arrived before it. This represents open engagement and not a Europe behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament, in its resolution, supported the fruits of the convention's labour by an overwhelming majority of three to one. Could we think of ways in which it could be improved? Of course we could because each of us could do so, as could political institutions. However, we asked a different question, namely, is this better than what it replaces? Our answer was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. We asked whether it will make Europe more democratic and our answer was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. We asked whether it will create more rights for Europe's citizens and our answer was &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. We asked whether it spells out the current values and objectives of Europe and our answer was again &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. It spells out a Europe closer to the ideal of the citizens' Europe and a more parliamentary Europe. Therefore, it represents something very big, namely, the idea of Europe as a political and parliamentary entity and not merely an economic entity. This is a very powerful step towards a Europe in which we are prepared to invest more because we can understand it better and contribute more to it.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament fully supports the proposition that the Oireachtas and national Parliaments throughout the Union should be involved in reviewing the Commission's annual legislative programme. This would serve as an early warning system. If one third of all Parliaments in the Union claims a Commission proposal offends subsidiarity and proportionality, that is, the issues of who does what and whether a certain decision is correct, then the Commission must pause. This warning system never existed before and it is a way of extending ownership, parliamentary engagement and accountability. We support it because now it amounts to not a competition of Parliaments, but a necessary expression of democratic accountability at each appropriate level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1519" />Although 732 MEPs will be elected to the European Parliament next year to represent 25 states, the 28 states that participated in the convention will have more than 10,000 Senators and MPs between them. Connecting the 10,000 Members to this project is a powerfully positive step towards opening up and democratising and it contrasts with the circumstances that obtained in the past.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament welcomes the idea of merging the functions of Javier Solana and Commissioner Patten. We welcome the idea of having a continuous Council Presidency to deliver more of what we say we want to do. However, the Parliament believes in a Presidency that gets things done and not in a super-Presidency that tries to oversell the capacity and function of such an office. We welcome the broad balance between the different institutions. It is important, especially in Ireland, that the Community method of making decisions remains strong in this treaty and that a new European Commission remains strong in articulating the Europe of tomorrow because the European Commission is the forum to which small states look for fair play and guardianship of the treaties.</P>
    <P>Two days ago the Italian Presidency published a document which this weekend will be considered at a conclave of Foreign Ministers in Naples. This document is a step in the direction of trying to close the debate, not to close it down but to arrive at a conclusion. We in the Parliament earnestly hope that the Italian Presidency will succeed in bringing closure to this before the Brussels summit in mid-December. I know from our extensive contacts with the Irish Presidency that should that not be the case, the Irish Presidency is able and willing to pick up those pieces. I hope that will not happen for one political reason. We know all the questions and delaying the answers by several weeks or months will not change the essential questions so now is the time to decide.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on one issue, more as an Irish European than in my role as President of the European Parliament. I find it interesting how members of the media here present one of the assertions the Government has made about a so-called red line, namely the question of maintaining unanimity in taxation. There is a vigorous debate on this but somehow in our reporting it frequently transforms almost to a decision. That is not the case. There is a debate and divided opinion but the opinion of the Government on tax and unanimity is not an isolated one. My personal presumption, and here I speak personally, is that the objective that has been set down will materialise in the essential fabric of the new document. The Irish Presidency, ignoring whether there is a spill over of the constitution, still has several powerfully important contributions to make. As the Senators know, we have for several years had the Lisbon agenda, an economic and social reform package to try to make <Col N="1520" />Europe a truly competitive global player, a place that tries to show solidarity within and without, and that is capable of holding its own as a knowledge-based and information society. I do not wish to go into it in detail but there is a large identifiable and measurable gap between what we say we want to do and what as Europeans we are delivering. The March summit of the Irish Presidency could be a defining leadership moment in Europe for a State, regardless of internal controversies, which shows that reform can work and put people back to work. It will show that Spain, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg, Denmark and Ireland with their very different kinds of politics and people in charge have one thing in common, each to varying degrees has reformed more than the large continental economies and each has established that reform delivers. We have to convey, deliver on and plant that kind of message.</P>
    <P>Permit me to share a story which I told at the last summit meeting in Brussels about this agenda. It involves the famous Mayor Daly of Chicago, well-known in these parts for all the obvious familial reasons. In one of his many administrations he came to give the opening speech as the re-elected mayor. Someone had written the script for him and the honourable gentleman had not read the script prior to its delivery, something that would never happen in the Seanad. The speech writer had written &ldquo;we commit our new administration to the achievement of ever higher plateaux of achievement&rdquo;, plateaux not being a very user-friendly word in anyone's mouth. The good mayor read it out and committed his new administration to the &ldquo;achievement of ever higher platitudes of achievement&rdquo;. I tell the story because Ireland needs to put zip and attitude where today, and for the last few years, we have had platitude. We are up for it and are capable of doing it. It would be an important European contribution.</P>
    <P>This Seanad, the Dáil and the Irish people have a deep and abiding respect for, and commitment to, the United Nations Charter and multi-lateralism. Multi-lateralism was severely tested at the time of the Iraqi crisis and Europe developed a severe internal strife. An Irish Presidency committed to multi-lateralism can do Europe a great service. If we carry it forward to add the other part, how do we discover effective multi-lateralism, and lead from Ireland a debate in Europe about the renewal of the UN Charter? It is the charter that looked at wars between states but we live in an era where, for the most part, states are not necessarily the antagonists with which we may fear war. We must look again at this and which state in Europe could be better placed than this one, with its history of commitment to the United Nations, to begin to develop and deliver this platform? On 29 January next, we in the European Parliament will have the privilege of a visit from Kofi Annan and I will have the privilege of presenting our annual Sakharov award to recall those who fell in <Col N="1521" />Baghdad in our international public service, Sergio de Mello and those others. I have invited the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to associate the Irish Presidency with this and I hope and believe we can take moments like that as Irish Europeans to bring our values of effective multi-lateralism on to a wider stage. Without labouring the point we have a very special relationship historically and, in modern terms, economically, with the United States of America. The Irish Presidency can do Europe another service, that of making running repairs to a robust but stressed EU-US relationship. We have a way about us that some others do not have in these things and we could deploy and employ that to powerfully positive effect for a wider EU-US dialogue.</P>
    <P>Next week I will be in Naples attending a meeting of European Foreign Ministers on Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, involving north and south, and both sides of the Mediterranean including of course the difficult and at times apparently intractable problems of the Middle East. I will announce this officially next week but can tell the Seanad now that the European Parliament has worked with national parliaments of tomorrow's Europe of 25, with the parliaments of all the states in the Middle East and across the southern shores of the Mediterranean to agree to a European-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly. The Oireachtas will be represented there, as will the European Parliament, with the integrity of their political mandates. I would love if during the Irish Presidency we, who are geographically north in Europe, would take up this challenge and be the first to produce such an assembly to establish that we offer solidarity and are connected to the concept of the wider Europe, its new neighbours, old neighbours and its intractable and difficult problems. In that way we would not say to the Mediterranean states, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece, that is for them because it is their region, but rather that this is an issue for us, because we are committed Europeans.</P>
    <P>I will develop one other theme. I am very proud of the Europe of values in which I believe, and what that Europe tries to do. I will give a few brief illustrations. We in the European Union have led a committed case, for which Irish MEPs voted, to establish an international criminal court with due process, and therefore to elevate to the highest standard of law and due process one message, that those who perpetrate wrong will pay, and will come before a court to answer for their wrongs, genocidal or otherwise. I would prefer the due process of the international criminal court any day to the absence of process in Guantanamo Bay every day.</P>

      <P>In the Europe of values I am proud we are giving a lead in sustainability, in global warming and the Kyoto Protocol. We need <Col N="1522" />to keep that challenge before us because what we are doing is bigger than merely something for ourselves or our generation.</P>
      <P>I admit we should do more, but I am proud of the fact that the EU is the biggest donor community in the world, giving annually more than two and a half times what the USA gives in terms of untied aid to the poorest nations on earth. I am proud that we are the largest donor of humanitarian food aid, mostly bought in the places where we go, rather than by selling our goods by subsidy to others.</P>
      <P>I now present a challenge. I ask the Seanad to assist me as European Parliament President in an exercise which I hope the Irish EU Presidency might take up, which marries some of the issues I have mentioned. We are an ancient country with long traditions, one of them greatly recognised and celebrated across continental Europe, namely the missionary tradition. Times change and things move on, but there remains some kind of depth about Irish out-reach which has not gone away. Whether it happened during the Celtic tiger period or post Celtic tiger, we have become a digitally literate society. The biggest gap today does not relate to simply sending a goat to someone who is a farmer, or sending a cow where there is no cow. I do not dismiss these actions, all of which are positive, but the biggest gap for tomorrow's world is the digital divide between the haves who are on-line and the have-nots who are wholly excluded.</P>
      <P>With our missionary tradition, our digital literacy and a budget line on which I am working in the European Parliament for next year, let us try to give an Irish leadership to touch the idealism of European citizens much in evidence when the debate on Iraq got under way. People hanker in some way to be given a lead, to connect and reach out. Let us try to work together during the Irish EU Presidency to create a European development volunteer corps, and give an Irish lead to a missionary tradition, a digital literacy and a determination to bring solidarity for tomorrow through education, using the capacities with which we have been gifted in this generation.</P>
      <P>This is a wonderful moment for European affairs. It is so special that the two major European political institutions should coincidentally and for the first and only time in our 30 years in the EU be led by Irish Europeans. We are a people with pride, values and capacities. Let us together bring those to Europe in the next six months and leave a legacy of which I know we can be proud. Thank you.</P>

      <P>I welcome the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Cox. I was impressed <Col N="1523" />with the detail given in his speech, and I am proud as an Irish person to witness his knowledge and his capacity to present the facts on the re-shaping of Europe, a prospect for whose realisation he feels deeply.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cox has said so much that I hope we can get a copy of what he has said at another time, because some great ideas have been put forward. I have tried to jot them down as Mr. Cox spoke. He talked about giving us back the ownership of Europe and about subsidiarity. These are very powerful words. Up to the Nice treaty referendum we did not own Europe. Mr. Cox and the second Nice treaty referendum have helped us to do so, and helped us towards reaching a decision on where we will go in the reshaping of Europe.</P>
      <P>Mr. Cox also referred to the concept of the future of Europe and the fact that we will have such a huge diversification in the expanded Europe, with 25 member states. With that diversification we will have a range of wealth, history, geography, language and people pursuing different interests. It concerns me that we could then have sub-groups emerging in the pursuit of their interests. There are implications for that in the future because of the diversity of so many small states coming into play from such a wide background. It is possible that all of us as Europeans will be called on to hold that Europe together. I would like to hear Mr. Cox's views on that.</P>
      <P>We are proud that we will have an Irish President of the European Parliament and an Irish EU Presidency at the same time. That will certainly put Ireland on the map. As Mr. Cox said, we have the capacity, the ability and the personality. We should flaunt it.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael party I welcome the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Cox, to the Seanad this morning, and I thank him for an interesting and inspiring address. One of Mr. Cox's colleagues, Mr. Joe McCartin MEP, was with us yesterday, and I was struck by his remark that when he first entered the European Parliament 24 years ago, many of the people he served with were the sons and daughters of people who had been slaughtered in the Second World War. He made the point that as we move further away from the last century and the terrible tragedy of two world wars on the Continent of Europe, we lose sight of that tragedy and forget about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Mr. Cox referred to the new accession countries which will join the EU next year, I was very much taken by his remark on what he called creative reconciliation. We in Europe must never forget what happened, because the whole genesis of small countries originally coming together has resulted in a much bigger European Union. We came together because of our differences. Ireland is now an equal partner in the EU with Britain, which had a very belligerent relationship with Ireland for so many years. That fostering of a new relationship must never be forgotten, any more <Col N="1524" />than the slaughter that occurred on the Continent of Europe. I welcome Mr. Cox's remark about creative reconciliation and how it can be developed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Cox also referred to the EU method. I want to tease that out with him. The European system is one based on the equality of all countries, from the smallest country, Luxembourg, to the biggest country, whether it be France, Germany or Britain. Does Mr. Cox agree that last Tuesday morning, at a meeting of the Finance Ministers of the Council of Europe, that notion was destroyed when France and Germany got their way in not having penalties imposed on them despite clearly and deliberately breaching the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact? Either there is one law for every country or there is not and I would be interested to hear the President's comments on that development. It will clearly require a re-negotiation of the very pact that allowed the eurozone countries to establish the currency.</P>
    <P>The decision has further implications because we will probably see interest rates rise within the eurozone. One could argue that we are at the bottom of the cycle and it would happen anyway but this brazen decision on the part of the two largest economies will lead to Irish mortgage rates increasing by more than they would ordinarily in the next eight months. I would like to hear Mr. Cox's comments on that in his capacity as President of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the President's remarks on the Irish Presidency of the European Union. We hope that the deal will be done by the Italians by the end of December but, if not, we will take up the cudgel and try to put it together.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the President's remarks on the Lisbon agenda and Ireland's role in bringing the interests of the EU and the US together. I do not believe in the new European chauvinistic view of the US, we must repair that relationship because it is in all of our interests economically and in pursuit of greater democracy and justice in the world. Whatever the view of the current US presidency, we must repair that relationship and we are ideally located as a small country with great cultural and economic connections with Europe and the US to bring that about during the course of our EU Presidency.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has raised the notion of reviewing of the triple lock mechanism. Last week we sent 500 troops to Liberia under the UN banner but we cannot send troops to Macedonia, a potential future member of the EU, because the Chinese influenced the Security Council not to formulate a resolution. We must examine this issue because fundamental internal reform is required in the United Nations and as a neutral country with great experience of peace keeping, we must play our role. We must act in Europe, not just other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>I thank the President for a very stimulating address and wish him the best of luck in next year's elections.</P>

      <P>I thank the President for his stimulating address. I have also been to some of the accession countries and the excitement about their entry is incredible. Some of them are linking up with countries that are already members of the European Union. The Estonians say that the Finns will look after them. One could almost walk from Estonia to Finland if the tide was out.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes mentioned our role during the Irish Presidency and the relationship between the European Union and the current United States Administration &ndash; there have never been such difficulties with any other US Administration. We all know what happened in Iraq but I am concerned about the change in attitude in the US Administration towards development aid. The US Administration has cut aid to some of the multilateral agencies of the United Nations which we support, causing great distress. While the EU has tried to make up the deficit, it is very difficult. Money promised to assist the global effort to combat AIDS by the US Administration has been diverted to developing a vaccine against anthrax. The only country in the world that has had trouble with anthrax is the United States and the anthrax originated there. Have we any moral influence?</P>
      <P>I supported the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy and I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Food favours decoupling. European farmers, and farmers in the rest of the world, are at a serious disadvantage due to the supports given to farmers within the United States. Many of the protective tariffs introduced in America are contrary to the regulations of the World Trade Organisation. Is there any hope of influence during the pregnancy? I apologise, I should have said Presidency. Great potential exists and we should hope for positive results.</P>

      <P>The lead up to a pregnancy is a lot more exciting than the lead up to a presidency. I promise not to refer to the forthcoming European elections. It would be improper for me given my possible position.</P>
      <P>I have frequently said that the achievement of the Presidency of the European Parliament by Pat Cox is an honour for the country and fully deserved. We may disagree on many issues, as we will see over the next nine months, but the achievement of the Presidency and the way in which the President has done the job have been a credit to the European project and to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teastaíonn uaim dhá rud a lua faoi stair na hEorpa. Tháinig rudaí iontacha as sin ach tá comharthaí a thugann an stair sin dúinn faoin gcontúirt atá ann i gcónaí fosta. It was the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, who first drew my attention to the fact that in the last century, there were only three European states with a longer period of independent, functioning democracy than Ireland. We are one of the most ancient <Col N="1526" />democracies of the last century, even though we see ourselves as relatively new. Only Switzerland, Sweden and Britain are older. Democracy, however, is a fragile creation that is always at risk. As a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I have been fortunate to visit a number of the accession countries and see the richness and depth of the civilised heritage that exists there. We must remember, however, that in spite of that cultural and religious heritage, the most ferocious wars ever fought took place in the same civilisation. That should give us pause and that is why, in spite of many criticisms, I am committed to the European project.</P>
    <P>We subscribe to a set of values but there may be difficulties with their implementation and operation. How can we create the competitive European economy we wish to see while preserving the extraordinary uniqueness of the European social construct? There is no easy answer to that fundamental question.</P>
    <P>The preservation of an economic order that provides prosperity and economic security for everybody and does not push us into a ruthless, competitive market, where those who are less successful literally fall off the table, is one of Europe's great successes since the Second World War. Many of the small countries of Europe have shown us how to achieve this, but there is a great danger that the need for reform in some of the big economies may undermine that, which is something that interests me.</P>
    <P>The second concern I have, which is an old concern of mine, is the continuing degree to which civic society feels that many things in Europe are done in secret. I refer particularly to the continual lobbying of NGOs concerned with development issues and trade issues on the process by which the EU arrives at a single trade policy. Committee 133 is, rightly or wrongly, a <i>bete noire </i>to most of the NGOs because they do not know its agenda, its processes, or its outcomes. The idea that such a major issue as European trade policy would effectively be decided in secret, apart from being bad for democracy, is bad for the project. I want to know what are the future prospects of genuine openness? I believe President Cox subscribes to this, but it is not necessarily a part of the culture that has developed in the European Union. Indeed, a considerable part of his political achievement was to expose the more sordid side of that secrecy, an area in which he was particularly successful.</P>
    <P>There is a moral issue here which is not embryonic stem cell research. It is a personal issue with which I have difficulty. What will be the position of the European armaments industry? Will we become a competitor of the United States of America, Russia and China, or are we to become moral leaders in an attempt to reverse the international trade in arms? So many of the world's problems, local conflicts, terrorism etc., are inextricably linked to the fact that the world is awash with, not weapons of mass destruction, but weapons of individual destruction that are killing <Col N="1527" />thousands of people and literally hundreds of thousands of children every year. We have a role in that.</P>
    <P>Europe has the capacity to be a moral leader, the Europe of values that the President of the European Parliament talked about has the capacity, but we will devalue our moral leadership if we do not establish a consistent, honourable and moral position on the armaments issue.</P>

      <P>That will not end at the conclusion of his presidency, it will continue when Cork is the European capital of culture in 2005. Hopefully, we will be able to educate the President even more. I will not mention the school of music although I would welcome any help on this. Could the President advise us?</P>
      <P>President Cox has covered many issues in his challenging address. When preparing questions, it is advisable to have one or two questions ready in case they are covered. As usual, in the case of President Cox, one would have to have seven or eight questions ready as he covers so many different topics.</P>
      <P>The challenges before us, in the lead up to our presidency, are issues we have highlighted in this House over recent weeks. We have continually referred to the six months ahead and the challenges that face us. The President of the European Parliament has come here and not only set challenges for us, he has set challenges for the Government that we all feel should get a response. I have a particular interest in what President Cox had to say about the Middle East. This is one of the big issues facing the world today and the problems there have been going on for far too long. Hopefully, during our Presidency, we as a Government will be able to work with the President of the European Parliament in advancing his proposals to bring about some form of settlement and greater understanding there.</P>
      <P>Some of the previous speakers have covered a number of issues to which I hope President Cox will return, particularly the Stability and Growth Pact.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the triple-lock mechanism, this is an issue I highlighted in this House 12 months ago. I appreciate and understand the Government's position on the triple-lock mechanism, but it is flawed in the light of what happened in Macedonia.</P>

      <P>When President Cox speaks about revisiting the UN Charter and how the Security Council comes to its decisions, a mechanism must be found in order that when we in Europe want to partake in a humanitarian aid project &ndash; and 99% of the Irish people would support the ongoing mission in Macedonia &ndash; an EU resolution on a humanitarian aid project must be able to receive some kind of UN sanction to allow us to overcome this problem. I firmly believe that our non-participation in Macedonia is quite an embarrassment.</P>
      <P>I welcome President Cox's comments on Guantanamo Bay, an issue that has been addressed in this House continually and must be aired more often. We had an interesting debate on overseas development aid in this House last night in which the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, participated. The President of the European Parliament raised the issue of volunteerism; it is interesting that one of the areas about which the Minister of State spoke was on a proposal that he hopes to bring forward next month in connection with the extension of volunteers working through APSO into the international arena. Again, President Cox's ideas on that subject will have the ear of the Minister of State who takes this very seriously.</P>
      <P>From an Irish position, how does the President feel the area of the mutual defence and solidarity clause will progress over the next 12 months? Does he feel that, from an Irish perspective, we will be able to retain the status quo that currently exists in our defence commitments in Europe?</P>

      <P>I welcome the President of the European Parliament to the Seanad. These days we are immersed in a huge amount of European knowledge as the attendance of many of our MEPs has been an eye-opener for many of us.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the terms of the Single European Act, Maastricht, Amsterdam, the first and second Nice treaty referenda and the Lisbon agenda, in particular, which sets out the social and economic pathway for the future. However, if we were to go on to Grafton Street now and stop people and ask them to list the Single European Act and all the other treaties I have mentioned to determine if they knew anything about them, they would not be able to do so.</P>
      <P>President Cox spoke about next year being the year of renewal for Europe. It will fail if we cannot make the connection between the single citizen, be it Tom Kelly, Mary Brown or whoever, in whatever village or town in Ireland or Europe, as President Cox's brief is Europe. We must make the connection between that citizen and all the lofty ideals Europe epitomises.</P>

      <P>I was listening to President Cox's address on the monitor in my room. I came to the Chamber because I was so impressed by the clarity and forthrightness of what he had to say. I particularly compliment him on his courage in what he had to say about the International Criminal Court and Guantanamo Bay. He should continue this, as it is one of the most important issues for humanity around the world.</P>
      <P>His broadcast this morning was equally lucid and clear. Although I find difficulties with the invocation of God in our Constitution as it is troublesome, it is an historical fact that Europe derived benefit from its Christian tradition. A reference to that fact should not offend anyone.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of the right of Israel to exist. I know and love that country. However, I know that the human rights sections of Israel's external trade agreement have only been tentatively triggered. I would like, as a friend of Israel and knowing the mind of many decent people there, to see this being ratcheted up and implemented in order to place the Sharon Government in a situation where it must recognise the human rights of the Palestinian citizens of Israel.</P>

      <P>I thank the President for his kind remarks about the forum and about me. The forum was set up to communicate about Europe and to engage the citizens. The President's personality and profession are a good example of how that can be done. He brought a sense of vision to the issue today and he took Europe away from a collection of directives and orders and gave us a feel for the philosophical and historical basis of the enterprise, which is what the citizens need.</P>
      <P>The President spoke about the Mediterranean grouping. How does he envisage the participation of Israel and Palestine in that? That is a place on which Europe should concentrate. If that boil could be lanced, it would reduce the political fever in that part of the world.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the President's thoughts about a type of digital volunteer core. Given that all the European countries are moving away from military service, young people need a right of passage to responsible citizenship. That is a wonderfully inventive and thoughtful way of doing it. Has the President thought about doing it on a national or European basis which would bring them further together? I thank the President for coming here today.</P>

      <P>Unlike some colleagues, I believe we will have a European defence force. How does the President see that developing and how soon will it emerge? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the human rights section of the new con<Col N="1530" />stitution there is a statement that everyone has the right to life. In the President's opinion, does that include the unborn? If it does not, will the protocol, which we annexed to the Amsterdam treaty and which protects Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, be overridden if and when we accept a new constitution? </P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cox, MEP Mr. Cox, MEP">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox, MEP</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to those Senators who, because of that constraint, have not had time to make comments or ask questions. Senator Ormonde spoke about groups and elasticity and she wanted to know if we could end up being all over the place as a result of becoming too flexible. The short answer, because I do not have time to develop long answers, is that we have flexibility because we have diversity and provided it is rooted within a system that can contain it &ndash; we do not want flexibility which ruins the fabric of the institutions of the Union &ndash; then we need flexibility. An example is Schengen and border passage. We and the UK are out. We are out pragmatically, not on principle but because we have many transit journeys to and through the UK and we do not need passports. Switzerland and Norway are not in the EU, but they are included, which seems to be sensible flexibility. Some 13 states are in the Economic and Monetary Union, but some are not included. That, once again, shows degrees of flexibility. Those are two solid examples. As we go forward, we need room and diversity for flexibility, provided the flexibility respects the basic fabric of the rules we put together. We do not need people building alternative power centres which undermine the fabric of the European process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Members mentioned the Stability and Growth Pact. I have mixed feelings about it. On a strictly rules based approach, I agree with the sentiments of Senator Brian Hayes and others who asked why the big countries should get away with it. From that point of view, they should not if that is the essential question. The rules of the pact are relatively clear. However, while I accept that they were skirted this week, they were not necessarily entirely ignored. When there is a persistent breach of deficits, which is the case for France and Germany, there is, to avoid Euro-speak, a procedure where, ultimately, the Euro<Col N="1531" />pean Commission shows a red card. However, the fine which might happen as a result of the breach does not follow automatically. Those are the rules in the treaty. It goes to the ECOFIN Council in the euro zone and it must figure out by judgment if it should be exercised as a fine. In those terms, exercising judgment is provided for in the rules and, as such, it is not a breach of the rules. In the rules based approach, the logic should be clear, namely, it is the same rule for everyone.</P>
    <P>However, we now come to a different question. John Maynard Keynes used a wonderful phrase when someone said he had changed his mind because he had said something else at a lecture some years ago. He said: &ldquo;Yes, for the facts have changed, dear boy. When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?&rdquo; Using that Keynesian expression, let me arrive at this point. France has just avoided recession and is in a low growth phase. Germany is just crawling out of recession. It is in our interest as a small trading state that they lift and grow. Does it make sense, therefore, to kick that dog when it is down? It seems that on the basis of economic analysis and interest the right choice was made. Half of the European Parliament will be deeply angered by what I have said because they want it to be rules only. However, if the rules &ndash; this must be for Europe, not only for this type of case &ndash; become so obsessive that we are asked to leave our common sense outside the door, there is something wrong with them. Common sense must come into play when making judgments. I make a 50:50 call on that.</P>
    <P>Several Senators referred to the visit of my colleague, Mr. Joe McCartin, here yesterday. I have worked with him since I arrived in the European Parliament in 1989. He has served there since 1979. He has been a wonderful and consistent Irish public servant and he is deeply undervalued in this country. I am pleased the Seanad got a chance yesterday to share some of his insights because he has been one of the consistently best, high quality Members elected from this country and, curiously, one of the most consistently ignored in terms of media coverage. It is not for the want of knowledge, wisdom and literacy because he has all those qualities in abundance.</P>
    <P>Several Senators mentioned the triple-lock. It is not my function in my role as President of the European Parliament to talk about Irish public policy <i>per se</i>, but the question was asked. It is my view that the Government entered some type of moral contract with voters before the Nice treaty when it offered the triple-lock mechanism. I understand &ndash; I am not talking about politics but about the right to expect a certain consistency of message and delivery &ndash; why the Government feels constrained in terms of decoupling from such a moral contract.</P>
    <P>As regards the case of Macedonia, I had the privilege two months ago to speak in every Parliament in the western Balkans with a differentiated but European message. The people in Macedonia <Col N="1532" />are struggling in the most desperate economic circumstances, but they are wonderfully good. They are trying to constitutionalise pluralism between a Slavic and Albanian population, to hold the line against threats of terrorism and to connect to a European vision. I am sorry Ireland will not be there for the triple-lock reason, of which we are aware. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia recognised Taiwan, which led to the payback. This raises an operational question. If ever there was a place where the qualities of Irish peacekeepers and policemen could mean so much on the ground, that is it. I do not believe we would necessarily dishonour the triple-lock commitment if we explained to the public that this is such an exceptional case that it fits into the philosophy of the triple-lock even if there is a Taiwanese exception.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked about EU-US relations and our relations with the current US Administration. We have many high-level values and principles in common. Interests are important in politics, and the EU-transatlantic investment and trade relationship is the deepest bilateral relationship in the world. In investment and trade terms it is worth more than $1 trillion per annum. In mutual jobs terms &ndash; Europeans working for US firms and US citizens working for EU firms &ndash; there are 13 million people on the payrolls on both sides. It is broadly balanced, although the EU has slightly more workers in the US than the US has in Europe. There are so many common interests that we would be negligent in our public responsibilities if we let the disrepair of the current relationship slip into breakdown.</P>
    <P>When it comes to some of the differences in values, we need to speak with clarity to our American friends. I have a great grá for that wonderful republic; I have a bust of Thomas Jefferson, among others, in my office in Brussels and I have taken enormous political insight from Madison and others who wrote so beautifully and elegantly about the values of the Enlightenment which inspired the constitutional traditions in the US. Then I look at the abomination of Guantanamo Bay, which diminishes that great republic and traduces its very soul. We must tell that in honesty to our friends when we engage in dialogue with them. On that broad point, because I do not have the time to develop a longer answer, we must tell our American friends that they freely have our alliance but they have no automatic entitlement to our allegiance. Between those two concepts of alliance and allegiance, we have the dignity to be ourselves and carry to the table of bilateralism a sense of who we are and what we believe in.</P>
    <P>This is why I mentioned the UN and effective multilateralism, because we Europeans are more committed by our preferences, state by state and collectively, to a multilateral order, whereas the US Administration perhaps fears the Gulliverisation of a giant &ndash; that the pygmies could tie it down through so many bonds of multilateral interconnection. Somehow we must develop <Col N="1533" />multilateralism to be effective, keep the US engaged and avoid any tendency to drift towards selective unilateralism or selective multilateralism.</P>
    <P>Rinne Seanadóir Ryan tagairt ar stair na hEorpa agus chuir sé ceist faoin daonlathas. Tá níos mó na trí stát ina raibh daonlathas ann sula tháinig sé go hÉireann. I have one thing to say to Senator Ryan about democracy. It is no accident that Greece only joined the EU after the despicable Colonel Papadopoulos left, that Spain joined after Franco was dumped, that Portugal joined after Salazar and that Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania are joining after the collapse of the Soviet empire. Pluralist democracy is the price, first and foremost under the Copenhagen criteria, to enter the club. It is a wonderful thing to remember, even with the distance of years, the maturing of our new State with the handover of power to Éamon de Valera and Fianna Fáil in the early 1930s. This was an act of mature pluralism in a maturing democracy and the same thing is happening all over central and eastern Europe with Governments of the left and right. Something good, deep and abiding is happening and the EU will help it last. This is the power of creative reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The Senator spoke about the Lisbon agenda and, broadly, about the social market economy. I agree with his remarks. I recently spoke at meetings in Germany about economic reform and in a broad way, without entering into the detail &ndash; Germans own the detail of the reform debate &ndash; argued the case for reform as being something indispensable. The demographics of continental Europe are changing; people are getting older. To live longer in good health is a wonderful tribute to having a society and not just an economy. We should not treat ageing as a problem, but from a financial point of view it is a challenge. For this reason there must be reform.</P>
    <P>Those who believe in solidarity must now confront themselves with the question of making it sustainable. This is precisely the value mentioned by the Senator, but sustainability and solidarity must be married if this social model is to continue. The example sounds bizarre, but it is true. Today in Germany, 38% of the male labour force aged between 55 and 64 is at work, while 62% of a working age are retired. This is because of crazy incentive and disincentive systems. These things must change because more people at work and in good health is not a bad thing in itself. We must say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to solidarity but also to sustainability.</P>
    <P>The arms industry was mentioned. As Senators know, there has been some discussion about a European armaments agency. I incline to the view &ndash; I am sorry I do not have time to develop a more substantial explanation &ndash; that this makes some sense. Let us return to the question of effective multilateralism. If we want to make a European capacity contribution, as Kofi Annan has asked us to do so that Europe as a region will be able to contribute in crisis situations willingly and <Col N="1534" />immediately on UN call, we lack the capacity. We have the developing Rapid Reaction Force, which is not a European army but a group consisting of contributions from European armies. In Europe today the 15 states spend half of what the USA spends each year on defence and we obtain only one tenth of its capacity to act. This is bad value for money. If we want to bring to the effective multilateral table our European capacity to act, we need better value for money. An arms agency can help us in this regard. Other points were made about weapons control and so on. We do not have to walk away from those values. Let us build them in and be more effective but also more cautious.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan asked about the Middle East and Senator Norris also touched on this. There was a recent Association Council meeting between EU Foreign Ministers and Israel. Taking place behind closed doors, it was the toughest session there has been in a generation. We insisted that the customs benefits for goods, which started in the Palestinian territories but were exported through Israel must go back to the Palestinians. Regrettably, the total amount involved is only about &euro;10 million, but the principle is an important one and it is the first time we have insisted on this. Who started the debate in European terms? It was the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I have the opportunity to address, on invitation, some time in the coming quarter the Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Authority. I would benefit greatly from the wisdom of the Irish Presidency on this matter when the moment comes, but I would like to give the address. I would like to speak frankly about the things that bind us and truly about the things that concern us. I am also encouraged by the green shoots of grass-roots perceptions that there should be a climate for peace. I support all initiatives and, in particular, note the Geneva accords, which are a sign of potential hope.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Rourke raised the question of communication between Europe and its citizens. We will never achieve this with the dead language of euro-speak. We will never achieve it if, as political leaders, we fail, personally and through our institutions, to articulate in plain language the essential public purpose of the things we do together.</P>
    <P>I hate the language of euro-speak and hope I have avoided using it today. I had a private encounter last night with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, where we dealt with Presidency issues for the Parliament. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche wants this to be a special theme of the Irish Presidency. I support him and believe we should do some work in this area. This House has many gifted literary Members, such as Senator Norris and others. Let us invent a language that talks about values and capacity to act and, as Senator Maurice Hayes said, fills this wonderful <Col N="1535" />project with a sense of vitality and public purpose. After all, the Union is not merely a big anonymous market filled with economics and regulation, although we must have those too. We did not invent the European model for the CAP and its Byzantine structures.</P>
    <P>I am a former leader of the Liberal Democrats group in the European Parliament. After the collapse of the Santerre-led Commission, I wanted the group to discover what was the Europe that had, in a different way, gone through that crisis. We travelled to Krakow in Poland with four Holocaust survivors and travelled on to Auschwitz. An old rabbi who had escaped from a holding camp in the Netherlands with the father of one of our Jewish MEPs travelled with us. This old man lit a candle and chanted the Kaddish, the sacred Jewish prayer of remembrance. He then lit the candles of the survivors and they in turn lit the candles held by me and my colleagues. In doing so they passed to us a duty of memory about the essential reasons for reconciliation &ndash; fighting anti-Semitism and racism and achieving real, deep and meaningful values.</P>
    <P>I tell that story today to pay tribute to a woman of whom Members will never have heard but who inspired me that day. She moved to Belgium after the war, became a grandmother and passed away one month ago at a ripe old age. We did not fight that war and we cannot continue to say, &ldquo;remember the history&rdquo;. We must build our own history. Our history has a route and I know it. Elie Weisel wrote an essay entitled &ldquo;The Night&rdquo; about incarceration in a concentration camp. It is a short essay and Members should read it. For me, Europe is the daylight. Let us keep the lights on.</P>

      <P>I congratulate President Cox on his election as President of the European Parliament. It is a great and fully deserved honour for him personally and for this country. On behalf of the Members of Seanad Éireann, I thank President Cox for his wide-ranging and interesting address and his comprehensive replies to the questions raised by Senators. We deeply appreciate his kindness in accepting our invitation to address the Seanad. It is quite clear that notwithstanding his extensive portfolio, he has not lost any of his passion or commitment to Europe. I assure him that he has the sincere good wishes of all Members of this House in his future endeavours.</P>

      <P>I wish on my own behalf and on behalf of all members of Seanad Éireann to welcome Ms Dana Rosemary Scallon, Member of the European Parliament, to the Seanad today and her family which is here in the <Col N="1536" />Visitors Gallery. Dana was elected as an MEP in 1999 for the constituency of Connacht-Ulster. Prior to her political career, she was a national figure, due to her success in the Eurovision Song Contest of 1970. Since then she has had a multifaceted career, and in whatever task she has undertaken she has expressed her views clearly and cogently. She has always conveyed a genuine enthusiasm and passion for the task in hand. I look forward to hearing her address in the Seanad today in accordance with Standing Order 52A.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Scallon, MEP</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, Members of the Seanad and Leader of the House, I am delighted to be with you. I thank you for the opportunity to meet and to share with you some of my experiences in the European Parliament. This is an important initiative. Many of us in the Parliament have wished we could have had this opportunity more frequently. I hope it will be the beginning of a regular exchange of ideas. For maybe too long there has not been sufficient communication between Europe and Members of the Oireachtas. Members of the Oireachtas will sometimes find regulations presented to them for consideration which we have been discussing for two years or more in Europe, when they must then face the music on their doorsteps.</P>
      <P>I am new to politics. After I first dipped my political toe in the water I was welcomed to the Seanad. I recall that day well. It meant a great deal to me. It is a great honour to be here today. I am a member of the largest grouping in the Parliament. I knew that as an Independent Member it would be important to have the clout of a big grouping and so I joined the European People's Party, which is basically a centre-right group. I am the first independent MEP to be accepted into the group. It means I have access to committees and to speaking time. Otherwise, as a lone Independent Member, it would be difficult.</P>
      <P>I enjoy the work in the European Parliament. The problems we face here on a national level are generally reflected in every country. One is able to find alliances and support for issues that are important to one's constituents from diverse areas. It is extremely important not to be caught in one political corner and so I have close colleagues from the Socialist and Green groupings and even one in the Communist grouping. We are all struggling to try to support the needs of our constituents. That support must be sought on many different levels and on diverse subjects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I chose as my first committee the Committee for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. I considered that these were particular needs for my region of Connacht-Ulster. It is acknowledged that there has been a huge problem of under-investment in the Connacht-Ulster region and I considered these areas to be a priority. I also attend, as a substitute committee, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. We do not have a competence for sport and I am not very good at it, but we are moving towards education through sport. A base is <Col N="1537" />gradually being built for some kind of competence in this area. I consider that the two committees dovetail. They meet basically at the same time and on the same days. I am sure Members sometimes face the same problem here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Scallon, MEP</NameTxt>
      <P>One tries to run from one committee to the other and to cherrypick the different reports that one feels are relevant. In the cultural committee I have been contributing to debates on the protection of children on the Internet, the protection of intellectual copyright and, of course, education through sport. Those are the areas I have dipped into and I have made contributions to reports on these aspects.</P>
      <P>In regional policy, transport and tourism two large committee areas, covering transport and regional policy, were merged. As a new member I had no idea that this was a schizophrenic committee. Halfway through the meetings, about 50% of the members would leave. I would sit on. The two aspects covered by the committee have gradually blended together, although they retain a distinct focus.</P>
      <P>Transport is extremely technical. We deal with safety in all forms of transport. Inter-modality is most important but it is difficult for the western and the southern regions of this country to attain it because there must be an equal balance and support between road transport and rail transport linking into sea transport. The west of Ireland desperately needs a north-south rail link. Otherwise it will not have inter-mobility and this will impact greatly on freight transport. The taxation of road users is also being discussed at present. Members will be pleased to know that we are discussing the development of a chip, to be installed in each new vehicle, which will be monitored by the new satellite system in Europe. Road users will then be taxed according to their road use. That is fine if there is an excellent road transport system but if somebody in this country wishes to choose rail, they will be severely disabled in doing so.</P>
      <P>We are also coming to a conclusion on the single European sky. There are different needs and focuses in the various countries but one of the main ones is how to divide the military zone from the civil zone where air usage is concerned. We do not have a single European sky at present or a single military control. Various countries are anxious to ensure they will not be curtailed in the use of military zones by a central decision making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speed with which reports go through the European Parliament is increasing. There have been incredible changes in the working methods of the Parliament, even over the past five or six years. The powers of the Parliament have increased since I was elected, specifically in this term as a result of the dismissal of the previous Commission. There is now co-decision in a number of areas and that will become more common. <Col N="1538" />I believe it is a good thing. However, the speed with which we have to debate reports means juggling a number of items in the air.</P>
    <P>Being an Independent MEP has many advantages in that I can say and do what I wish. That is not to say one cannot do that in a party but sometimes one pays a price for doing so. As an Independent I have a great deal of freedom. However, a member of a party has a great support system and access to people who specialise in particular areas. There are many advantages to being a member of a party.</P>
    <P>Every type of question comes my way. I dip in and out of various committees, such as agriculture and fisheries. Indeed, I have even had to deal with the way animals are kept in zoos in Spain on foot of a request from one of my constituents who is now living there. Another issue concerned how much green and white there should be on a leek. There are all types of questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>All kinds of everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Ms Scallon, MEP Ms Scallon, MEP">
      <NameTxt>Ms Scallon, MEP</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly. I read a great deal. In fact, to prove how detrimental that has been, I am now obliged to wear glasses. It is a fascinating experience and one for which I am most grateful.</P>
      <P>That is a quick overview of the work. During a debate, a Member is given one minute of speaking time. At a maximum, the Member will be given two minutes if he or she is a main contributor to a report and three minutes if a rapporteur. As one can imagine, the debates can be extremely sterile. It is also frustrating because one cannot insult anybody or make a joke. By the time it is translated, two further people have spoken and one could end up insulting the wrong person. Nothing is as frustrating as making a joke and seeing people starting to laugh about five minutes later. It is a somewhat sterile atmosphere.</P>
      <P>There should be more time for debate, it should be conducted at a slower speed and there should be less regulation. The regulations are over burdening although they originate with the best of intentions. Where there is a gap we try to find some way of filling it or to answer a need. However, there is, and this probably applies at national level too, a burden of regulation and detail, which is having a detrimental effect on growth and enterprise. We are raising this at European level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to two further inter-related areas that concern the lack of communication with the elected or appointed members at national level. If we do not have open channels of communication, it makes the national parliament's work impossible and our work extremely difficult. One of the imminent issues we are dealing with is the Intergovernmental Conference on the constitutional treaty. After I became a Member of the European Parliament in 1999, our group was given an initial presentation on the charter of fundamental rights by Mr. Aznar, the Spanish leader. He advised us that since the ongoing ramifications of a charter would be far reaching and <Col N="1539" />deep, we should make it a politically endorsed rather than a legally binding document. We simply did not have enough time to explore it sufficiently. That was the first time I or members of my group heard the charter mentioned. The advice made sense because if one does not know where something is going, one should be extremely cautious.</P>
    <P>Two weeks later, during a group meeting, I picked up a document which informed me that our group had unanimously agreed to support a legally binding charter. I knew it had not been discussed in my presence and I had attended all group meetings. When I asked senior members of the group, two German women, if it had been discussed, I was informed that it had not and was immediately concerned. Members will have heard talk about the democratic deficit in the European Parliament, of which this is a prime example. The three of us asked for the right to discuss it in the group but we were told it could not be discussed until our summer study days, which took us through to the summer of 2000. By then, it was well under way and a convention was to be put in place.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's position in Nice was absolutely correct. He was advised by the Attorney General that it could not be made legally binding and the Taoiseach stated as much at Nice. He would only politically endorse it if it could never be made legally binding. Members of the Parliament were asked to vote on it. We had no translation into any language except French and we had to vote on it within 24 hours, knowing that we could not change a syllable. The charter was passed. We were advised prior to voting that the charter would be the first pillar of an EU constitution at which point I knew I could not support a document that had never been discussed in the Oireachtas, one the Taoiseach expressly said could not be legally binding. I opposed the Nice treaty because we were consistently reminded that we were moving towards a constitution of Europe. I began sending out press releases and, at the time, I would have welcomed an opportunity to come here and talk to Senators.</P>
    <P>Much is written in the press about people and, unless one has a chance to sit down and talk to people on a one to one basis, misinterpretations of one's intentions can arise. I am not against Europe. I support fully the European project. However, I believe it is moving too fast, too soon, without informing the people. When it moves so far ahead of the people, how can they ever catch up? I strongly believe that the only way to protect the democratic process, fragile and often weak as it is, is to ensure that the voice of the people is reflected in the decision-making process. Members of the Seanad and Dáil and our elected leaders are that voice. The more isolated from the people decision-makers become, the more one damages the democratic process. I could not support Nice I and the enforcement of Nice II was against European law. It was a very bad example <Col N="1540" />of the ability to overturn European law. I was very concerned about this.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Members have received a copy of the European constitution. Our only hope of keeping track of and being able to contribute to and shape policies in the European Parliament is to be aware of them, even prior to a proposal from the Commission. We receive a prior indication of proposals from the Commission. At that stage it is essential to be aware of what is proposed. Once it becomes a proposal from the Commission, 99 times out of 100, one will end up with what the Commission proposed. This was confirmed during a journalists' lunch by a senior diplomat in the European Parliament. When the matter was put to him, he confirmed it was correct. By the time a proposal reaches national level it is invariably too late to shape it. It is insulting for Members to receive a copy of the European constitution today because it has been in print since June.</P>

      <P>That is good. We received the first draft of the European constitution in June 2003. It was a little book and we were given a copy each. I copied it and wrote notes where I felt there was a conflict between our constitutional position and sovereignty and the proposals within the European constitution. This is very worrying but we do not have time to go through its details. A major issue is the legal personality which is given to Europe, including the article which states that it takes precedence over all national law and constitutions. The counter-argument is that it refers only to European law and the institutions. However, 78% of our national law is decided in Brussels. The earlier one can be involved in the decision-making process, and make a contribution to policy and documents like this, the more chance there is of representing the needs and concerns of people and of protecting the democratic process and the sovereignty of our own country.</P>
      <P>This brings me to a related matter, namely the recent debate on Ireland's position on embryonic stem cell research. There are different levels of concern in this regard, including the personal and moral position. I am sure I do not need to reiterate my position. I believe it is wrong to take human life and kill it for research purposes. Then there is the constitutional position, which has been strongly challenged. Article 40.3.3º was understood by the people who voted for it to protect life from the moment of conception. This is our constitutional position until challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of the bio-ethics group since 1999 and I was one of the 60 strong <i>ad hoc</i> committee which was given the task of drawing <Col N="1541" />up ethical guidelines for embryonic stem cell research in 2000-01. I was intimately involved in developing the guidelines, which pitted industry against ethics. These are like oil and water and do not mix. The scientists said to us that they do not make the laws, that we should make them and they will work within them. At the end of a year's debate among a very mixed group, from the far left to the far right, a political conclusion was reached. We have a very small pot of public money. It is European law not to finance in the area of research what is illegal in one member state. There are absolutely no positive results from the use of embryonic stem cells. They are, in fact, considered high risk. However, there are positive results from the use of adult stem cells, therefore, let us as a Community place the small pot of money we have where it is legally within the limits of the Union and where there is certainly as much hope and more positive proof of developments in adult stem cell research.</P>
    <P>As the Council began to debate the issue, I was contacted in December 2001 to informally ask the then Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for research and development, Deputy Treacy, to attend a meeting in the Parliament.</P>

I hope this opportunity for dialogue will be supported and extended to whoever is representing us at European level, although I may not be among them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Ms Scallon, MEP, and thank her for giving of her time to provide the House with an insight on how she operates within her work agenda. She said she works in the policy area of transport and tourism and referred to what she described as a democratic deficit and a lack of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this exercise in the House is to ensure there is dialogue. This aspect needs to be reinforced. Since the second referendum on the Nice treaty the Government has attempted, through this Chamber, to create dialogue in this area. In addition, the Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, has at all times been in contact with the various processes of the convention charged with drafting the constitution on the future of Europe. Furthermore, the National Forum on Europe has gone out of its way to meet at various venues throughout the country in an attempt to correct the democratic deficit. We are doing our best and it is why we <Col N="1542" />ask Ms Scallon to do her best to get her message across.</P>
    <P>It is a reflection on the democratic deficit that I was not aware of Ms Scallon's membership of the European Parliament's transport and tourism committee. As an educationalist I would like to know the extent and nature of her brief in the area of education and sport. Perhaps she would comment on this aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Ms Scallon to the House. I admire her because she has convictions and beliefs and sticks by them. That is refreshing in comparison with the Government whose members express different opinions and beliefs. This is reflected in the recent remarks by Deputy Andrews when he described himself as a dissident because he agrees with Government policy. Ms Scallon should be commended for her beliefs and strong convictions.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ormonde, I was not aware Ms Scallon was involved in the European Parliament's transport and tourism committee. I am privileged to be a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and perhaps I can ask a few questions on that area. What view does the European Parliament committee on transport and tourism take on Ireland's failure to control budgets in terms of transport issues, for example, with regard to the delivery on time of the Luas light rail system, and is the committee concerned about this? While most funding for infrastructure projects derives from Irish taxpayers, some EU funding is provided.</P>
      <P>Ireland's unique island status poses greater challenges in terms of transport. Ms Scallon hinted at this in her speech and perhaps she would elaborate on the difficulties this status presents in other areas by comparison with the situation in other member states. The Government's bias in favour of road funding at the expense of investment in public transport means investment in the former is not always matched by investment in the latter. This approach is an exception in the EU.</P>
      <P>Ms Scallon referred to the possibility of computers using chips to monitor road usage. It is an interesting concept on which she might elaborate. The Australian Government imposes a tax on petrol for the purpose of ensuring that those who use their cars less frequently pay less tax.</P>
      <P>Ms Scallon is also involved in the European Parliament committee dealing with the media. Her position in the west was affected by the BCI decision on radio licensing as it affected North West Radio. Members of this House have expressed their unhappiness with the procedures adhered to, including the lack of an appeal procedure. In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, Radio Kilkenny lost its licence, which was a cause of great unhappiness. Perhaps Ms Scallon would outline how an EU dimension can be used to address the concerns raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this week the House debated the decision of the German and French Governments <Col N="1543" />to ignore the limits set by the Stability and Growth Pact. This has happened over three consecutive years. Members of the House were unhappy at the example they have set. We considered they got off lightly. Perhaps Ms Scallon will outline her views on this issue.</P>
    <P>The issue of fraud at EU level continues to be a cause for concern, especially following the recent findings of EUROSTAT. Ms Scallon referred to the removal of the EU Commission four years ago following allegations of its failure to deal with fraud. At the time, everyone thought the problem would be addressed but, unfortunately, it is still ongoing. This damages the credibility of the EU institutions with the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Ms Scallon to the House. It is a pleasure to have her here. I am sorry she could not elaborate on the question of stem cell research. I support the view taken by the Government and I believe the Tánaiste dealt with the matter courageously and clearly. All medical research should have ethical controls and guidelines. As Members will recall, four yeas ago I tried to introduce legislation by way of a Private Members' Bill to regulate <i>in vitro </i>fertilisation. Unfortunately, it was not accepted, although the purpose of the legislation was simple. All that was required was for clinics to be registered, that they be obliged to say what they did, outline their success rate and what they charged. It is unfortunate that four years later we still do not know how many clinics are operating in the country.</P>
      <P>I want to take the issue of the proposed EU Commission guidelines on stem cell research a little further. Many people may not be aware that their purpose is to control what is going on. I was particularly taken by the fact that the precautionary principle is in place, whereby if it is possible to use adult stem cells they and not embryonic stem cells should be used.</P>
      <P>There is a very difficult situation with regard to the pharmaceutical industry in this country. Most of the pharmaceutical companies here are derived from parent companies in the United States. Biotechnology firms within the US specifically grow embryonic stem cell lines. Two of the largest of these firms &ndash; Vestigen Corporation and Geno Corporation, both based in California &ndash; undertake toxicity testing on embryonic stem cells for, I understand, almost all the American pharmaceutical companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader will recall I tried to get this aspect debated when the House held an excellent debate on stem cell research, a debate that was far better than the one that occurred in another place. Does Ms Scallon consider that we should allow drugs into this country no matter how efficacious if, in any part of their development, the toxicity has been tested on embryonic stem cells, because this is happening more and more? Should we even countenance allowing these companies to have factories here given that they use biotechnology companies which are very profitable for testing <Col N="1544" />drugs for toxicity and even if the drugs which are tested on embryonic stem cells are not made here, although I gather this will become an increasingly important aspect?</P>
    <P>This is an issue we all need to address. It must be remembered that the pharmaceutical and chemical industries here are responsible for 40% of our exports and are big and good employers. As well as addressing the position of the companies, will Ms Scallon outline her views on whether drugs which have been tested on embryonic stem cells should be permitted for use here no matter how efficacious?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with others in welcoming Ms Scallon to the House. I suspect I would not agree with many of the views she has expressed but there are many thousands of people who do and it is good that their views find reflection in the European Parliament. I wish to take her up on the two issues on which she concentrated, that of the European project and the issue raised by Senator Henry.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty in pinning down the views expressed by Ms Scallon on the current standing of the European project. She says she is in favour of the project and, specifically, of more co-decision, which inevitably detracts from some notions of national sovereignty, yet she is very resistant to the notion of repeating in the constitution of Europe something that has been part of European law for many decades, namely, the notion that European directives pertaining to European competences take precedence over national constitutions and laws. Forgive me if I am wrong, but she seems to support the project, yet she is pushing all the buttons the sceptics and cynics push. Maybe she is doing this for electoral reasons and knows well what she is doing, but it seems there is a contradiction. Will she explore this further?</P>
      <P>I do not claim any medical or scientific expertise on the issue mentioned by Senator Henry. However, it seems Ms Scallon's argument is diametrically opposed to the notion of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation in the first instance. While many in this country do not understand or have not engaged with the issue of stem cell research, adult or embryonic, they do have some knowledge of <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation. Will Ms Scallon address this?</P>
      <P>I am not a constitutional lawyer but do not believe we should accept that it is generally thought that the unimplanted egg has constitutional protection and that it is necessarily illegal to perform research in this field in Ireland. I would not be willing to accept it as a given because it is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join previous speakers in welcoming Ms Scallon to the House. I am afraid I am of such an age that she will always be known to me as Dana. I am delighted she is here. It says a lot for this small country that this House has been addressed by an Irish Independent President of the European Parliament in the morning <Col N="1545" />and by an Independent MEP in the afternoon. It demonstrates the benefits of democracy and our success in electing people to represent this country on such a big stage. Given our relatively small population and the fact that the population of Europe is now approaching 500 million, this is a tremendous achievement. I congratulate Ms Scallon on it.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate Ms Scallon on the way she represents her views on certain issues. I do not want to deal with stem cell research, which we debated, but it is topical. Ms Scallon raised it, it has been before us in recent weeks and will be again over the next week, during which time we will see how the debate progresses. The contradiction we face in Europe is such that we must ask how Irish elected representatives, who represent a small group, can embrace democracy while imposing our view on a population of 500 million. Do we not have to be tolerant of a diversity of views? Is this not what democracy is all about? Many of us are concerned about getting this balancing act right in Europe.</P>
      <P>I have difficulty accepting Ms Scallon's statement about killing a human life for research even though I am very much pro-life and have always held this position. The definition of the unborn has not been clarified in our own courts, nor has clarity been provided in the area of embryonic research. If such research is to be carried out, not necessarily in Ireland but in Europe, we as a small nation with pro-life views, and other nations should play an active part in influencing the introduction of legislation to ensure safeguards in this area. This is what we have endeavoured to do this week.</P>
      <P>Ms Scallon sat on a committee drawing up ethical guidelines for something she may not believe in, which is a great act of democracy and a testament to the role she plays. The issues I have mentioned are complex and demonstrate the diversity of Europe. However, can the view of our 4 million people be sufficient to stop the momentum of 500 million people?</P>

      <P>What are Ms Scallon's views on <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation? I am told the church is against it. I cannot understand this because <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation has brought such happiness to couples by enabling them to bring forth a baby after their having been childless for many years. It is one of the success stories of research that hitherto childless couples can have a baby of their own. Does Ms Scallon agree with the church's teaching on the matter?</P>

      <P>On a macro level, it is not democratic if one is invited to discuss decisions that have been made when one has no hope of changing them. All I can do is raise such matters with the media. If we had an appropriate channel in the Oireachtas I could raise it with its Members at a very early stage and state what is happening and what we are being told. It would not have been democratic if, at the end of 1999, the Oireachtas was told a very strong force was to have a legal charter &ndash; I do not care what is in the charter &ndash; it had not debated and which our elected Head of State had never seen. All I can do is make press releases. As one knows, it is very hard to engage the media and they generally do not want to know about an issue until it becomes a topic on the national stage, by which time it is too late. I have been making such press releases but today presents a wonderfully freeing experience and an opportunity to talk honestly to the Seanad. I hope this process will continue because it will help address the democratic deficit.</P>

      <P>It robbed him of his right to influence it because a decision had already been made. The repercussions of this are evident today, four years later. The charter will be legally binding as part of the constitution. This is robbing one of one's democratic right. I was not reflecting on what the appointee did but stating what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Browne stated he did not know I was <Col N="1547" />on the transport committee. Again, it is very hard to engage the media and this is the biggest problem. The committee is aware of the priority routes for the trans-European networks programme. We have one major priority route, which extends from Belfast to Rosslare. Feeder routes are also a priority. The initial plan was to have a circuit of Ireland to feed into this and to cross Ireland. One of the routes that fulfilled all the criteria for investment was the road from Dublin to Sligo. I brought over a group, including two major spokespeople for different delegations, and made them drive from Dublin to Sligo. Along the way we met every chamber of commerce and county council and in Sligo we met representatives of every party to whom I suggested the establishment of a steering group headed by private sector individuals so it would not become a political football. If we could get the private sector to head it up, and achieve unity, we would have a very strong platform to begin feeding into a major priority route. The next stage is the rail link to Shannon. I also had an American consortium interested in developing Knock Airport and I was looking for the arteries needed for sustainable development. The media have covered this but it is very hard to get it across.</P>
    <P>Ireland is unique in Europe as an island and this entails disadvantages in costs. We are not part of the main land mass of Europe therefore we need special attention whenever there are Europe-wide initiatives, for example the taxing of inter-mobility to encourage people to choose the rail network. We do not have the same conditions as the European mainland therefore we need the special attention accorded to several of the islands. I am pressing for this and trying to work with other members. We are always told we are on the periphery of the periphery and we need special care.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne asked about road funding versus public transport. In fairness, we had to catch up very quickly from a low level provision of infrastructure and we received significant investment, but this has been undeniably skewed. The investment figures of the National Roads Authority for 2001 show the west received 5% of infrastructure funding. We all know how that can happen politically but it helps neither Dublin nor Ireland to have an imbalance in regional development. Transport and infrastructure provisions must be tempered by regional development needs and we are struggling with that.</P>
    <P>The most worrying thing about the North West Radio issue was the consultants' description of the listeners in the west. It was a deeply insulting profile of them as uneducated and all aged over 65 years. It has won the award for radio station of the year again. We can all do and think what we want but do we really listen to the people? Do we think we know what is best for them? If so we do not deserve to hold any kind of office to represent them. We have to listen to the people and if they enjoy the station and voted it number <Col N="1548" />one it is mighty high-handed of a consultancy firm to say the listeners are not educated and do not know what is best for them. I studied the report, much of which focused on Sligo where there is a student population and probably a younger profile than most of the west. It comes down to whether we are listening to the people and representing what they want.</P>
    <P>Over the past few past days I was here with the economic committee from the Parliament. There is a perception that as a small country we were hauled over the coals when it looked as though we were in danger of breaking the Stability and Growth Pact. The economic situation is very difficult and France and Germany did break it. Yesterday morning we met the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who explained that Germany had tried to make some very stringent changes but could not manage to because of the economic atmosphere. It was felt that if Germany was fined on top of the difficulties this would hamper even more the two driving forces of the European Union. As it happens the Minister was right but if we are going to then have to live with an interest rate increase from the Central European Bank, that is wrong. We should not have to pay for this. Germany has until 2005 to get its finances in order. I told the Minister that during the Irish Presidency he should emphasise that any other country finding it difficult to stay within the 3% should benefit from the flexibility allowed to France and Germany, and we should not have to suffer an increase in interest rates from the central bank.</P>
    <P>In response to Senator Henry's question on stem cell research, it was said that this vote in Europe was simply on the ethical guidelines. That is incorrect. The moratorium stated that the Commission could not fund it until the guidelines were in place so the vote was to open the door to funding. Ireland took the position of supporting the Commission proposal but would never have reached the qualifying majority because Germany, Italy, Austria, Luxembourg and Portugal did not support the Commission's position. That was the truth of the situation. It was not simply on the guidelines. The decision had been taken by the Government in 2001.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf and that of Seanad Éireann I welcome Nuala Ahern, Member of the European Parliament, and members of her family here today. Nuala was elected to the European Parliament for the Leinster constituency in 1994. Prior to that, she was also a very successful local politician and is a well known campaigner in the areas of environmental protection, consumer protection and nuclear radiation. In accordance with Standing Order 52A, I call on Nuala Ahern to address Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ahern, MEP</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his welcome and for the opportunity to speak here. It is important that Members of the European Parliament make this link. We are Members of the Oireachtas but we are very much out on a limb in our own spaceship. Sometimes we feel only very tenuous connections with home base or even with planet Earth.</P>
      <P>One of my colleagues, Mary Banotti, said that she has wanted this kind of opportunity for a long time, so I thank the Leader, Senator Mary O'Rourke, for making this concrete. Such an opportunity can be useful for Senators and MEPs alike. I will concentrate today on current issues, because I am sure that is what Members will most want to hear about.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the EU trade and industry, energy and research committee and the culture committee. The vast amount of legislation that comes at us from Europe goes through the powerhouses of the committees, which are very important. Members of the European Parliament are expected to be well up to speed at least on the issues they directly address. It has been a challenge and a pleasure to represent the people of Leinster and Ireland in that forum and to find oneself challenged to keep abreast of the issues in a very profound and technical way, as one is. I hope and believe I have represented my constituents in that way and I believe all the Irish MEPs are very competent, although one does not hear much about that. That is one of the reasons this link with the Seanad is important.</P>
      <P>I know the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, visited the Seanad today, as did Rosemary Scallon, so it is a big European day. That tells one that the Irish EU Presidency is looming. It will be tremendously important for all of us, and we all want to see Ireland put its best foot forward, as I believe it will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1551" />It could fall to the Irish Presidency to handle the new European constitution, the new constitutional treaty, although the Italian Presidency is working hard at bringing it together before the final summit on 12 December. The current Presidency has not been noted for handling matters very well, but the Italians are great and skilful negotiators and it is quite possible that they will bring difficult issues together. However, it may well fall to the Irish EU Presidency to handle the vast work on the new constitutional treaty. In our permanent representation in Brussels, we are very well represented by the ambassador, Anne Anderson, and her staff. We are all up to the task, although if the constitutional treaty arrangements fall apart under the Italian EU Presidency, the job will be difficult.</P>
    <P>I will say a few words about the Irish EU Presidency and then return to the issue of the treaty. One of the really innovative developments already announced is the 100% debt cancellation for poorer countries. This will be great for the Irish Presidency. Ireland has already stated that it wants to push this and to run with it during the Presidency. It will be very well received throughout Europe, Africa and the rest of the world. I welcome the initiative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs on debt cancellation. If it is a success it will earn the Presidency a great deal of respect.</P>
    <P>In every member state young people are falling away from politics and we must try to involve them again. There are initiatives to address that problem during the Presidency and if we can succeed in that area we will be doing everyone a service.</P>
    <P>There is too much euro-jargon. People talk about Lisbon and the Amsterdam leftovers. I work with such language on a daily basis and it is completely impenetrable and it turns people off. We are renowned for our use of English and culturally capable of doing away with bureaucratic language and avoiding jargon during our Presidency. Many people will be thankful if we do that.</P>
    <P>As an anti-nuclear campaigner for over 20 years, I would like the Irish Presidency to get rid of the EURATOM Treaty if it is not tackled during the summits that end the Italian Presidency. I welcome the Taoiseach's initiative in joining Austria to seek a review of the treaty. It will be a huge issue for environmental and anti-nuclear groups during discussions on the new European constitution. If Ireland can steer a review of the treaty through with Austria, which took the lead, with the Swedes and Germans joining in, it would be another major achievement.</P>
    <P>The new constitution might be completed by December but it is probable that it will fall to us to deal with it. I prefer the way it was drawn up to the manner in which the Nice treaty was cobbled together and the way business was done previously. Our citizens do not expect us to behave in that way. The Convention on the Future of Europe was inclusive and open and involved <Col N="1552" />Governments from across the Union, which was a clear change. I also welcome the inclusion of human rights as a central element in the new constitution. I am inclined to be favourable towards it, although I will wait before making a final judgment.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand that while the new constitution seeks to clarify and make consistent previous legislation, and includes all of the other treaties, it has left out the EURATOM Treaty, one of the founding treaties of the EU. It is so old and unworkable that there was no way to include it in the new constitution. The constitution and the EURATOM Treaty will run parallel, leaving the promotion of nuclear power as a core value, a fatal blow to the new agreement. We must review and abolish the treaty as it stands and ensure that measures to protect citizens from radiation are introduced to the constitution while not allowing nuclear power to be promoted in the way it has been in the past. The EURATOM Treaty allows Britain to give millions to British Energy and BNFL under state aid programmes that would not be allowed for any other industry. It is complete nonsense under the rules for state aid and competitiveness. This is my hobby horse but I feel very strongly about it and there is an opportunity for Ireland to run with this. Austria has given us an opening and we should take the issue up during the Presidency.</P>
    <P>I have never been in favour of the European Stability and Growth Pact. The way we were treated some years ago by the Commission on this issue was disgraceful and I defended the Government to the hilt at the time. I might not agree with the Minister for Finance's budgets but we were treated very badly and now we see France and Germany being treated in a completely different manner. It is outrageous. The stability pact is burying itself. For the Commission to say it will discipline France and Germany is nonsense. Germany has been hoist with its own petard because it demanded the stability pact. The treaties were more flexible. We do not want to run up large budget deficits but there is plenty of flexibility in the original treaties without hammering people under the stability pact. It should go and that would give us more room to fund infrastructure from our budget. If we learn one thing from this, it is to go ahead with infrastructural projects because that is what France and Germany do when it suits them.</P>
    <P>Senators listened to my colleague Dana Rosemary Scallon on stem cell research. I have been a member of the research committee since 1994 and I have heard all the complex and intricate arguments. I have no objection in principle to stem cell research but we have different legal systems so it is unfortunate that we are trying to fund an area that is so contentious in various member states. It is a huge issue in Germany, where it is illegal to use embryos to extract stem cells, although it is not illegal for them to import stem cells for that purpose. This is an absolutely hypocritical position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1553" />The constitutional difficulties the issue presents in Ireland are very complex because we have no legislation to deal with it. We are open to all kinds of events here that we would not be able to control under the law as we do not have legislation. It is for this reason that we should not fund this at European level now. We should leave this discussion until the seventh framework programme which we are already discussing. There are only about 12 projects and a very small amount of money. If this research was to be funded under the framework programme it should have been in the specific research programme. We avoided putting it there as we did not have the full ethical situation teased out. For many people in Europe it is not just a religious problem, even though that is what it tends to be in this country, as many people have ethical objections to the use of embryos who have no religious belief at all. The situation is very complex and it is a large step to take.</P>
    <P>What has been of particular concern to my committee is to avoid providing an incentive for the creation of embryos for destruction by research. That is a very difficult and dangerous area to get into. That is where this discussion endlessly goes around in circles. People want to use these stem cells to alleviate suffering, which is an ethical question in itself, but how does one do it without a situation arising in which one would be creating life in order to destroy it? That is a real ethical conundrum on which I would welcome the comments of Members.</P>
    <P>I have sat and listened to members of the US Congress on this matter, and run the gamut between those who believe it should be publicly funded, which in the US it is not, and those who believe that embryos should be adopted and grown into children, the believers in &ldquo;creationist&rdquo; science. It is a very wide spectrum of understanding. All our contributions on this should be valued. We are getting into a very strange new world in this case and we need to be quite careful in what we do. I do not think this is the moment to agree to the public funding of this in Europe. It is currently the case that this research is publicly funded by member states, for example the UK. It is not a question of stopping this research although we are ahead of ourselves. It is a complex situation on which I hope I have made my position clear, in as much as we can be clear on these difficult issues. I have tried to listen to all sides in this debate and have been prepared to sit and make legislation on it in discussing the framework programmes.</P>
    <P>I know the President of the European Parliament has been here today. I am sure he was very good at briefing Members on the new Europe in which he is so involved. The coincidence of an Irish Presidency of the European Union and a President of the European Parliament next Spring will be tremendous for this country. I hope that we will ultimately choose Pat Cox as our next European Commissioner. He would make us proud, and has made us proud already. I hope <Col N="1554" />Members agree that all Irish Members of the European Parliament are making us proud.</P>

      <P>We will not get into the stem cell research debate. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment had a very difficult job this week, which she carried out with a great amount of sincerity in trying to regulate this business.

      <P>On the Green agenda, I am sure that within the Green Party Ms Ahern is opposed to genetically modified foods. What success has Ms Ahern had in Europe in doing something about that? It interests me greatly and I would like to hear her views on it before she leaves us.</P>

      <P>I welcome Ms Nuala Ahern, MEP to the House, as a fellow Leinster person. I thank her not just for all the work she has done for the Leinster constituency, but for the entire country. I wish her every success in her retirement, although I am not sure I should use that word, but rather refer to the next phase of her life. I know Mary Banotti has difficulties with that word. I wish her well in her future endeavours.</P>
      <P>On the subject of the 100% debt cancellation agenda, which Bono is pushing at every opportunity, it sounds great and makes sense, but unfortunately in life things that make sense and sound ideal often are not. Are there negative implications in doing that, in terms of economies around the world? Could one make a bad situation worse? I am not an economist, I am just thinking about this. While it may sound sensible to cancel the debt of poor countries one could disadvantage them further. Perhaps Ms Ahern could share her views on that subject with me.</P>
      <P>I congratulate her on her work on the nuclear plant at Sellafield. Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, who is a constituency colleague of hers, has certainly done a lot of work in that area by highlighting the concerns of people in Leinster and Ireland about the nuclear plant in Sellafield. The recent strike in Sellafield, where the workers literally abandoned their posts and walked off, caused a few sleepless nights for everyone concerned. How will we ever get the Sellafield plant to close, unless we permeate the British Government and convince them to close it down?</P>
      <P>I am aware of the German Green Party's success as part of the governing coalition in that country. They have agreed a programme of closing nuclear factories, in fact the first one was closed the other day with the press of a button. The Green Party minister was there for that event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" />On public funding for stem cell research, the idea is that there will be accountability as a result. If it is entirely privately funded there is no control over it, which is one feature of the public funding debate.</P>
    <P>To build on a comment of Senator Lydon's about the Green agenda, it is fair to say that most political parties are now pro-environment. One thing that concerns me, not about the Green Party but the Green lobby, is that when they go looking for something and get it, such as the Environmental Protection Agency which they wanted established years ago, they query and do not accept the results produced. In this case they now want a new agency to be established. They tend to move the goalposts, which is damaging to environmentalists around the country as it damages their credibility. I ask for Ms Ahern's views on that issue. It is important to have agencies to control the environment and that when they make reports, we accept them and act on them. We should not be alarmist. For example, the EPA produced a report recently which showed a factory was in breach of emission levels, which proves the EPA is doing its work, but it should not be used for alarmist purposes in calling for factories to be closed, as some people might do. It proves the EPA is effective and doing its work and means we have to push resources to that agency to enable it to continue its work.</P>

      <P>I welcome Ms Ahern to the House and I thank her for her address.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the stem cell issue first as it is very serious. Like Senator Browne, the reason I am so in favour of the Government's position, as expressed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is because I look with dismay at what is happening in the United States of America where large profitable biotechnology firms are solely based on the development of embryonic stem cell lines. I do not know if Ms Ahern heard me asking Ms Scallon about her views on drugs which are produced using embryonic stem cells to test for toxicity, particularly developmental toxicity. I am sure Ms Ahern knows all about that. I also asked Ms Scallon about her views on pharmaceutical companies with plants here, which use such research methods in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of Ms Ahern's interest in the nuclear industry. I was glad when the Taoiseach met Silvio Berlusconi and told him we were not as enthusiastic as he was about President Putin's control in the former Soviet Union. We strongly objected to its human rights record in Chechnya and other places. I was extremely glad the Taoiseach did that. However, I do not know if he spoke to him about the proliferation of nuclear material under President Putin's reign. We talk about Iran, but Russia has sold material to some dodgy governments, such as the Burmese Government whose human rights record is appalling. We do not have any idea what the Burmese <Col N="1556" />Government is doing about anything or what it proposes to do with the nuclear material it has bought. That is not the only country to which it has sold such material. A big problem is that President Bush is in the process of developing what he calls small nuclear bombs, which will only attack bunkers. This prevents criticism of President Putin for allowing so much nuclear material to be sold to other countries. Does Ms Ahern think we should highlight during our Presidency that this dispersal of nuclear material is wrong and ask the United States to pull back from what it is doing in terms of nuclear armaments? </P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ahern, MEP</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I remember all the questions. The first question was asked by Senator Lydon and it was about the Green agenda and genetically modified foods. The issue of genetically modified foods involves the World Trade Organisation and its rules. European consumers &ndash; I will not refer directly to the Green lobby which has been a strong campaigner in this regard &ndash; have been suspicious of such food finding its way to the table following the BSE problems and food scares throughout Europe. However, it is difficult to ban some things outright, as many of us would like to do, because of the rules of the World Trade Organisation and because we could be accused of protectionism when we query these matters under our health legislation. The European Union proposed stringent legislation on traceability and labelling of food and foodstuffs, which was adopted earlier this year. That is a sensible approach, which is welcome.</P>
      <P>Two other things must happen. The first is that there must be clear rules on liability if anything goes wrong. It is important that small farmers, for example, who use or produce such material, are not left holding the baby. The bio-technology companies, such as Monsanto, which produce such material, should be held liable if things go wrong. This is an extremely serious issue. As in the US, if we started to grow genetically modified food in Ireland, we could find ourselves in a difficult legal position. It would be stupid to do that because this is an island. Consumers throughout Europe are crying out for non-genetically modified products. We could easily provide them if we agreed with the producers in the North of Ireland to keep the island of Ireland free from genetically modified products at least until we could determine the adverse effects. Studies in the UK have shown that there are bad effects on the environment and these could lead to problems with further trials and licensing of crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always advocated that the same type of testing should be done on new genetically modi<Col N="1557" />fied foods as is carried out on drugs. Otherwise, it will not be possible to feel safe about eating them. That is not currently the case. The US Food and Drug Administration accepts the studies done by companies. It will consider if Monsanto, for example, has successfully grown Round-up ready beet. It does not test the food in the same way it tests drugs for their effect on human beings, which it should do. It says there are not any ill effects, but how does it know that? As Members realise, unless something is tested in a controlled manner, one does not know the effects it could have. There is a serious question about putting such food on our tables and feeding it to our children. I have always been concerned about that, but I have not received a satisfactory answer as to why we should allow it. The legislation, although stringent, does not go far enough in terms of liability and testing of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>I was part of the delegation to the US. US Senators and members of Congress protested because they regard this as protectionism. However, we did not want to allow the US or the World Trade Organisation to unravel good public health, consumer and environmental legislation which we have taken years to enact in Europe. We stood over that and they respected us for it. The American consumers are looking with envy at what we have done in Europe. We would like to see the introduction of similar protections in their country.</P>
    <P>I have much respect for my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, who is interested in the Sellafield issue. The nuclear industry will only be driven out of business by some type of economic sanction. It is a nightmare economically. The UK Government has spent the past year pumping millions of pounds into the nuclear industry. It is a black hole. I have demonstrated that on my website which shows an analysis I did of BNFL's accounts in 2001. The Minister responsible subsequently admitted that BNFL was technically bankrupt. It needs to hive off the liabilities from BNFL as a semi-private company and try to deal with them. That is why the EURATOM Treaty is important. The only legal basis it has for giving such large amounts of state aid is that treaty, which should be taken from it. Nuclear power is incredibly expensive. We should create an infrastructure to deal with renewable energies, which would be a better way forward. In the medium term there is plenty of gas, which is currently the fuel of choice &ndash; more gas power stations are being built than any other kind. It is an intermediate fuel and we have been making the environmental argument for years. There is a strong economic argument for its use and it is simply nonsense to say otherwise.</P>
    <P>In references to the Green lobby I detected a sense of &ldquo;us and them&rdquo;, a suggestion that those in the Green lobby are the baddies. I do not agree with that &ndash; Senators would not expect me to. It is important that citizens raise issues that affect them directly. As legislators, we must take a wider view, but if something is coming down on <Col N="1558" />somebody, he or she has an absolute right to protest. What we need is implementation of good laws that already exist. The EPA was set up under weak legislation. Its staff do a very good job and try their best but the Green Party has criticised the legislation under which they operate. If we were to take seriously the implementation of European environmental legislation and stop paying fines for infringement, we would be moving a long way ahead.</P>
    <P>In the 21st century we must realise that economic progress and a clean environment are not mutually exclusive. They can and must go together. Much work and investment can go into clean technologies of various kinds. I have the job of rapporteur on the industry committee for the electronic waste directive, in which we try to encourage good design for the environment &ndash; including environmental provisions from the beginning of projects so that environmental consequences will not have to be dealt with at the end. It is rather like turning off the tap instead of mopping up the floor when the bath overflows. That is the principle that should apply in the future. There will always be lobbies and they will always use every issue in a political way. That is their right; it is part of democracy. Sometimes we do not like it &ndash; some may not like the Green lobby, I may not like the liberalisation lobby &ndash; but we must all live with each other. I hope that is sufficient answer to the question.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked about nuclear proliferation. Ireland had a wonderful track record on the non-proliferation treaty years ago in the UN so her idea is an excellent one. What is going on in Russia would make one's hair stand on end, although the Senator obviously knows this. The trafficking in nuclear materials throughout eastern Europe and the East is frightening. Proliferation in south Asia and Iran is frightening. The next state to go nuclear will be Japan, which is a serious development. If Mr. Bush announces that the USA intends to develop strategic nuclear missiles, of course Japan will move in the same direction. We should be pulling back from the brink. It would be an excellent idea to do something about this under the Presidency. We should give a lead in the EU because although we talk about illegal trafficking, the EU trades in nuclear materials &ndash; we export them all over the world. We should stop doing that. How are we to deal with illegal trafficking of this material if we are providing the base technology for other countries to use, as has happened in Iran? It is obvious &ndash; we should not be trafficking in women, we should not be trafficking in heroin and we should certainly not be trafficking or trading in nuclear materials.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding for stem cell research, I do not like to see private squalor and public affluence or <i>vice versa</i>, so we must regulate whether this is done through the private sector or with public funding. The only grip we have in the European Parliament is over the budget and therefore over public funding, so that is where we <Col N="1559" />should direct our attention. I believe in an open economy but it should be well regulated, because without regulation one ends up with criminal activity instead of business, as has happened in Russia. We are on the verge of that with stem cell research. The mass production of embryos for research in the USA is abhorrent. Mr. Bush has said that the research will not be given public funding but that the private sector may go ahead with it. That should not happen in Europe. We should regulate the sector. With respect to Senator Lydon, this research is happening anyway; it is legal in a number of member states. We must bite the bullet and try to achieve some agreement on regulating it. I hope I have answered the Senators' questions as fully as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome Ms Ahern to the House. Whatever our differences, our parties tend to find themselves on more or less the same side of the argument on most issues, both here and on a European level. In a sense, that is reflected in her own family background; her father was to the fore in progressive politics in both our parties at various times. I offer belated condolences on his recent death.</P>
      <P>I agree with almost everything Ms Ahern said about the Stability and Growth Pact and about EURATOM. She led off with the issue of the European constitution, saying positive things about the Convention and the process that has almost led to the draft constitution. I will go along with that. However, I am conscious, as I am sure is Ms Ahern, of a report produced subsequent to the Convention entitled Alternative Report: The Europe of Democracies. It is a relatively short report and is extremely critical not only of the constitution but of the process, which it says was wholly undemocratic and did not involve the grass roots in Europe. It then goes on to set out principles for a Europe of democracies. If any selected half dozen of these principles were applied, the EU would come to an end because it states, for example, that laws should only have effect if national parliaments pass them and that national parliaments can veto any law which is deemed of national interest. It calls for an end to activism at European Court level.</P>
      <P>Ms Ahern is probably familiar with the document. The reason I am asking about it is that it was endorsed by my good friend and her colleague, Deputy Gormley. I know the Green Party is working through a process of locating itself on these issues and I do not want to go down that road. I invite Ms Ahern, however, to comment on the document. Does it represent her personal views as she heads into retirement, to use Senator Browne's unfortunate phrase? Is she party to it, and does she endorse the views endorsed by Deputy Gormley?</P>

      <P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming Ms Ahern to the House. I will be brief <Col N="1560" />because I am conscious of the time and I know others want to ask questions. The humanitarian mission in Macedonia is operating under the auspices of the EU. We found ourselves in the unique position of being a great contributor to humanitarian missions but ineligible to partake in this mission because of the triple-lock mechanism. Given that 99% of Irish people would support our participation in the mission, does Ms Ahern find that at a European level it is something of an embarrassment that we are participating in its funding but cannot participate in the mission itself?</P>
      <P>As we are on the subject of defence, considering Ms Ahern's views on the solidarity clause and the mutual defence commitment, how does she see Europe evolving? Will we be able to maintain the <i>status quo</i> we achieved in the Nice treaty <i>vis-à-vis</i> our future defence commitments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Ms Ahern to the House. I am much in sympathy with what she said about the nuclear industry. If the Government wanted to invest &euro;36 million in Aer Lingus, the EU Commission would quickly point out that it was entirely contrary to laws and rules of competition etc. and would constitute unacceptable State aid. It is extraordinary that no one blinks an eyelid when &euro;36 billion is used to write off the debts of Sellafield in particular, and the British nuclear power industry in general. When I think of what an investment of &euro;36 billion could do in other spheres, I am amazed at the passivity of the British public. Nuclear power retains an aura of prestige politics and no one seems to treat it as a public issue. There seems to be a total contradiction between the general ethos of the EU and the way the nuclear industry is treated economically. I have long held the conviction that it is the sheer economic lunacy of nuclear power rather than safety arguments that will get rid of places like Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I know a debate on attitudes to future European developments has been under way in the Green Party in the period since the second Nice treaty referendum. While I appreciate that the European constitution has not been finalised, we can see what are the likely variations. I am in favour of Ireland fighting its battles in Europe and doing so from within. However, I do not see how we can serve our interests by stepping outside the frame, which is what using the nuclear option of voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; to these developments would seem to be.</P>

Several MEPs have told me about the raft of legislation that comes before them. Can we make more use of the Irish members of the Committee of the Regions?</P>
      <P>Regulations and laws have been foisted upon us in the past; I am thinking particularly of those on NHAs and SACs. A farmer may have valuable assets, such as an esker deposit of gravel, lying within such areas. While the reason for designation &ndash; perhaps an endangered species of flower &ndash; may lie within only a small part of a townland, the full townland must be designated. If a farmer's land is designated, he may lose his valuable asset. Legislation does not allow us to subdivide a townland or DED. Those are simply points I wish to make although I realise Ms Ahern will not be able to reply to them.</P>

      <P>The Green Party is thrashing out this issue in considerable detail. I think we have defended neutrality to the hilt during the referendum campaigns on various treaties. We should have a separate discussion on neutrality, as this country clearly does not know the meaning of neutrality anymore, if ever it did.</P>
      <P>While many members of the Green Party are pacifists, I am not and I believe in defending people from aggression. However, I am an anti-nuclear campaigner and I abhor the use of nuclear weapons. I do not want us to enter a treaty that is nuclear armed. I also abhor the proliferation of armaments, which is particularly marked in the developing world. For example, Sweden is a neutral, nuclear state and a producer of armaments. There are many contradictions in the debate and we must sit down and try to address them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Minihan talked about humanitarian issues and I certainly believe in the triple-lock &ndash; it would be strange if I did not. Nevertheless, we must ask ourselves if we address real issues when they arrive. We failed to do this in the early 1990s in Bosnia. I felt my party failed to seriously address this issue. We are constrained by other serious issues, such as nuclear proliferation and armaments. Many of our members and the public hold strong views on this, as do members of Senator McDowell's party. While it is difficult to <Col N="1562" />see us shining light in the area without generating heat, we could do it more seriously than we have done in the various referenda.</P>

While the Convention has not been ideal, it is certainly much better than what has gone before. Deputy Gormley has played a constructive role in the Convention, trenchantly putting forward views precisely on the issues surrounding the proliferation of conventional weapons and how this can be controlled in Europe.

      <P>The debate on the new constitutional treaty is going to be trenchant. We must await what comes out of the Intergovernmental Conference. It is difficult to see what will emerge and it may be for the Irish Presidency to make the final call. I am not going to look into the crystal ball to see whether I can stand over the final decision. I am going to make trenchant representations in my own party on the usefulness of the Constitution in clarifying existing legislation and in having human rights as a core value.</P>
      <P>I am going to campaign basically on the question of the EURATOM Treaty. If I see progress on that I will have a positive approach to the issue. I believe I am well respected in my party. It is well within the capability of the Irish Presidency to do something serious on the review of the treaty, which must be up and running by spring 2005. That would be before the holding of a referendum in this or any other country throughout Europe. We have a window of opportunity to push this during the Irish Presidency and I look to the support of the House in that regard. I am glad the Taoiseach has already said that Ireland looks to Austria on this. If anyone wants further information on the issue I would be happy to provide it, as time is short.</P>

    <P>Senator Mansergh mentioned the distortion of markets.

Again, I am at the Senator's service and will provide information if it is needed, although the Government side is not short on this.</P>
    <P>The committee of the regions has a tremendous role to play because we sometimes feel ourselves to be in a spaceship. We are reliant on a two-way flow of information and we need to ensure our communication systems are working. For that to happen people from all over Ireland, particularly those involved in local government, need to know what is going on as regards issues that deeply concern them. It may be only one or two issues, but they can contact the Commission. It is one of the reasons I am a determined supporter of each member state having its own Commissioner. While in theory Commissioners are supposed to represent the whole of Europe, there is no substitute for each member state having one, together with his or her cabinet, so that detailed problems can be brought to light, thus enabling the kind of exchanges that are necessary which will ensure that those in Brussels understand the impact of legislation at the grassroots. They are interested in this in theory but we must make it a practical proposition. I hope I have answered all of the questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I thank Senators for facilitating the debate, particularly at short notice. I appreciate that the House has agreed to take it in this manner. The Bill is a technical instrument, designed to provide legal clarity to just one element of the legislation relating to drink driving and to remove a possible basis for a challenge to certain drink driving prosecutions.</P>
      <P>The particular issues being addressed consist of the replacement of section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 and the amendment of section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. The position as regards section 10 of the 2002 Act is that I have received legal advice to the effect that a difficulty could arise if I were to provide for its full implementation. The House will recall from the debate on that Act that this section provided for the extension of the grounds under which a driver was required to submit to a preliminary breath test. Senators will be aware of my intention to pursue that extension. However, in preparing for that, a legal difficulty was identified as regards the sequence of the subsections in that section, in so far as they are referred to in section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. That section relates to the obligations on a person to submit to a blood urine or evidential breath test in a Garda station and any potential question as to the capacity of the Garda to invoke powers in that important section needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I took the view that in order to provide for the extension of roadside breath testing and to ensure the legal certainty of the powers relating to the carrying out of the evidential tests, I would ask the Oireachtas to agree to the technical amendments I propose in the Bill. In that context I am anxious to ensure that the extended powers to carry out roadside breath testing should be available to the Garda at the earliest possible date so as to support this year's Christmas drink driving campaign which gardaí are pursuing jointly with the National Safety Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The specific nature of the extension to roadside breath testing envisaged under section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 related to circumstances where a driver was involved in an accident or had, in the opinion of a member of the Garda, committed a traffic offence. Legal advice made available to me called into question the presentation of the reference in the section to a driver being involved in an accident. Essentially, it was suggested that the provision was not workable. I was, therefore, intent on commencing the remaining elements of the section. These included the provisions which allow the gardaí to require a person who was considered to have committed a traffic offence to submit to a preliminary breath test. I intended to provide for that commencement with <Col N="1565" />effect from 1 December. However, it was in that context that the question about the sequencing of the section arose. This difficulty could have created a doubt about the power of the Garda to arrest a person who had refused to submit to a preliminary breath test for the purpose of demanding that the person subsequently submit to a blood, urine or evidential breath test.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years there has been a significant reduction in the number of people killed and injured on our roads. It is clear that over the past year the introduction of penalty points for speeding offences has proved to be a positive initiative. The Road Accident Facts 2002, which has just been published by the National Roads Authority, shows that in that year road deaths fell by 9% to a total of 376. Provisional figures suggest that this year will show a further improvement in our road safety. However, we must seek to support greater progress in areas that can contribute to even greater improvements in road safety.</P>
    <P>One area where there is clear room for improvement relates to drink driving. As the NRA's report shows, in 2002 over 30% of all fatal accidents occurred between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. These are the hours most closely associated with drinking and driving. The extent of the problem of drink driving can also be gauged by the fact that in 2002, the Garda made 11,200 detections for drink driving. Approximately 90% of blood and urine specimens and 81% of breath specimens analysed by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in 2002 were above the limit. Furthermore, over half of those who failed blood or urine tests and almost one third of those who failed evidential breath tests had alcohol contents that were twice as high as the legal limit.</P>
    <P>My initiative in pursuing the commencement of the extended basis for taking roadside breath samples was predicated on the need to provide for a greater focus on the issue of drink driving. As I indicated in the Lower House today, my intention is to improve driver behaviour and to give active support to the efforts of the Garda and the National Safety Council in the pursuit of their drink driving campaigns. The initiative will greatly improve the deterrent effect of the enforcement of drink driving law generally. I have decided, however, that while the difficulties noted with the legislation are real and would have compromised my initial proposals, the best course of action is to proceed with my plans on the basis of introducing amending legislation that would address those issues. The Bill before the House today deals with those difficulties and will, if supported by the House, provide that the scheme for the extension of roadside breath testing that was envisaged when the House passed the 2002 Act can be introduced on 1 December.</P>
    <P>To achieve that, the Bill provides for the repeal of section 10 of the 2002 Act and its replacement by a new provision. The new provision is contained in section 2 of the Bill. That section provides for the replacement of the original section <Col N="1566" />12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994, which provided for the operation of the current scheme for roadside breath testing. That scheme limits the Garda to applying the requirement to demand the test only from drivers in respect of whom a member of the Garda would have formed the opinion that they have consumed alcohol. This is a very restrictive basis for the operation of this scheme and it is arguable that until it is extended, we will never be in a position to either establish the extent of the drink driving problem or to address it comprehensively. For that reason the 2002 Act proposed to extend the basis for the operation of roadside testing to encompass those who were either involved in accidents or who had committed a traffic offence.</P>
    <P>The wording of one element of the original proposal was open to a narrow interpretation. This is the primary reason for the proposal Senators will find in section 2 of this Bill. The new section addresses the difficulty that has been noted while at the same time providing for the scheme envisaged in the 2002 Act. The extended basis for the operation of roadside testing will mean that the Garda can now directly target the two areas where drink can clearly be a factor in terms of driver behaviour. In particular, we will now be in a position to establish the extent to which the drinking of alcohol by drivers contributes to accidents. The passage of this Bill will allow me to provide for the immediate commencement of all of the elements of this new section. This will, I hope, increase awareness among drivers of the consequences of drinking and driving and of the greater possibility of being detected.</P>
    <P>The second main provision in the Bill is set out in section 3. This provides for the amendment of section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. The amendment will provide that the reference in that section to subsection (3) of section 12 will now be changed to refer to subsection (4). The subsection of section 12 in question relates to the power of arrest. With the replacement of that section, through section 2 of this Bill, that power will now be contained in subsection (4) and not subsection (3), as is the case in the existing section. In the context of the application of drink driving laws generally, it is vital that the legal basis for the arrest of a person accused of an offence is clearly established. There is no area of law more contested than in the drink driving area. It is most important that the legal basis is correct, which is the reason we are dealing with this today.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the 1994 Act provides the legislative basis for the operation by the Garda of the testing of those drivers accused of the commission of one of a range of offences for the presence of alcohol in their blood, urine or breath. Depending on the results of those tests, a driver may be fined, jailed and be disqualified from driving. Where a person refuses to submit to the taking of a roadside breath test under section 12 or refuses to obey a requirement of that section, he or she can be arrested and brought to a Garda <Col N="1567" />station so that a sample of their blood, urine or breath can be taken. It is essential that the reference to the power of arrest that is contained in section 12 must be correctly provided for in section 13. The purpose of section 3 of this Bill is to facilitate that point.</P>
    <P>The focus of the Bill is to address issues that have an immediate impact on the operation of breath testing. In effect, the passage of the Bill will see the implementation of the scheme envisaged in the Road Traffic Act 2002. However, the issue of drink driving and the determination of the best approach to combating it in the future is a subject that I intend to continue to pursue. It is not acceptable that an estimated 120 people should die on our roads each year simply because a minority of drivers choose to drink. There is clear evidence linking the level of alcohol consumed by a person with their ability to respond in a cognitive manner to events around them. The next road safety strategy will have a particular focus on this issue and will see the identification of measures aimed at providing greater focus on this area. As a first step, as I indicated in the Dáil this morning, I will bring forward proposals to provide for random breath testing in the new year. These are matters for the future, however, and will be the subject of debate in this House.</P>
    <P>For today, I again thank the Senators and staff for taking this Bill at short notice. I greatly appreciate it because it allows us to commence an important section of legislation on 1 December which, between now and Christmas, will save many lives.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister even if it is an embarrassing occasion for him, given his failure to spot this glitch in the legislation. However, we will support this measure to rectify the problem.

      <P>On a serious note, Fine Gael welcomes this measure and will support it. We have not put down any amendments to ensure it is passed speedily.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that 30% of all fatal accidents occur between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. Is it productive to have television advertisements showing the disastrous effects of drink driving? They cost large amounts of money but are they effective? Would it not be more effective to have more advertisements about this on the radio? The first thing people do when they get into the car is turn on the radio. The advertisements would be a reminder for them. They could be played every half hour between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. and remind drivers not to drink and drive or outline the disastrous consequences of doing so. It might be more effective.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, when we are in our sitting rooms watching television and see the advertisements showing the disastrous effects of drink driving, we tend to distance ourselves from them and say they do not apply to us. If we heard the advertisements while driving, it might deter us from drink driving.</P>
      <P>While the gardaí have been very successful in apprehending drink drivers, the reality is that this is just the tip of the iceberg. There is a major difficulty in this area. Young drivers are not the main offenders. The problem is middle aged people and upwards who have got away with it for the past 20 years and feel they can do so for the next 20. What steps is the Minister taking in this regard? We are very quick to criticise young people in general, but this is one area where young people are leading. The Minister might indicate later whether he plans to tackle this anomaly in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister about drug testing. We appear to focus totally on alcohol and the effects of drink driving but, unfortunately, drugs are very common nowadays and have the same effect as alcohol. They impair one's co-ordination, visibility, judgment and so on. In countries that have a &ldquo;drugalyser&rdquo; test, road fatalities have been reduced. I am referring to both legal and illegal drugs, people who use class A drugs such as cocaine, heroin or cannabis or people who are genuinely on anti-depressants or amphetamines. Some people who have a severe flu take tablets which can cause drowsiness and then drive. These people still go behind the wheel of a car and think nothing of it. This area should be highlighted. Perhaps the Minister will consider this area when bringing forward plans next year to introduce random breath testing. Perhaps he will use the fantastic opportunity as Minister for Transport during the EU Presidency to launch a scheme in Europe. I assume that if such a test were introduced, people who are convicted of drug driving would not just receive penalty points but would face the same reprimand as people who are caught for drink driving. At the end of the day, these people are in charge of a vehicle that can cause death and are driving, in effect, a very <Col N="1569" />dangerous weapon. We must realise there is a big drug problem in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently welcomed the reduction in road fatalities. However, motorcycle fatalities were shown to have increased. He made the admission in the House six months ago but he has done nothing about the problem. He made noises at the time that he would address the issue of provisional licence holders carrying pillion passengers on motorbikes. This seems to have died a death. I urge him to act on the information available to address the problem and bring about a reduction in motorcycle fatalities.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has been consistent in its call for a dedicated traffic corp. This was referred to previously and also died a death. These measures are fine but they are pointless if the gardaí are not provided with the resources. We should not just focus on drink driving at Christmas time because, unfortunately, people drink all year round. The gardaí should monitor drink driving throughout the year to remind all of us we should not drink and drive.</P>
    <P>I support the measures being put forward this evening. I have not tabled amendments. As my colleague, Deputy Naughten's amendments were not accepted in the other House, I felt it would be a waste of time tabling amendments again. I wish to see the Bill concluded speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in welcoming the Minister to the House to debate this important issue. Road safety has been recognised for many years as being of crucial importance. It is useful that the Minister has identified the difficulty with the Bill and is dealing with it in this way. The Bill, which as Senator Browne said is fairly straightforward, will allow for the implementation of elements of the Road Traffic Act 2002. It will extend to the gardaí power to test people suspected of drink driving.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the speed with which he addressed this difficulty, despite the fact that Opposition members are critical of the fact that it was not noticed at the time. It can happen easily if a Bill is drafted from a specific point of view and it is then discovered that there is a conflict with another aspect of the law. I compliment the Minister and the Department on getting to grips with the problem to ensure the Bill is in place for the vital period around Christmas and that lives are saved.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Browne on his support for the Bill and for ensuring that it will not be delayed longer than is necessary in the House this evening. Some of his other comments are the type of standard remarks we hear from the Opposition. As they are a bit concerned that the Minister is making too much progress, it is difficult for them to find something to complain about. However, we will get over that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure will be a vital tool for the gardaí in their initiative over the Christmas season. It would be correct at this stage to compliment the Garda Síochána on its excellent work and the <Col N="1570" />efforts made to ensure that lives will be saved. Anything that can be done, either in this House or through the Minister, to put in place the necessary legislation to assist the gardaí in their work must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not about penalising drivers or ensuring they are put off the road. It is about education, highlighting the difficulty of drink driving and, I hope, forcing a change in culture. We have all seen the change in culture following the 2002 Bill and the introduction of the penalty points system. Those of us who travel the national primary routes on a weekly basis will readily recognise and accept that the average speed has dropped dramatically. People still reach their destination on time because they plan their journeys better. They leave ten or 15 minutes earlier than they normally would in the knowledge that they must remain within the speed limit, otherwise, more than likely, they will pick up penalty points.</P>
    <P>It is hoped the Bill and the measures the Minister will introduce next year in terms of the random testing of drivers will bring about a culture which will ensure that people will be no longer prepared to take the risk of drinking alcohol and driving a mechanically propelled vehicle. We all recognise the damage drink driving causes. Approximately 70 lives have been saved in the past 12 months since the introduction of the penalty points system, which is a very positive outcome. It is important to consider the cost savings as a result of the reduction in road accidents and the decrease in the number of people being transferred to hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the recent NRA road accident report which gives the facts for 2002. The report estimated that the total cost of road accidents in 2002 amounted to approximately &euro;730 million. This is a staggering figure when one considers the amount of money currently being spent on transport and the money that could be saved by preventing road accidents. Road accidents do not just have a monetary impact on people. The difficulties caused for the families and communities involved are huge. The cost of a single death on the road is estimated at approximately &euro;1.4 million, which is staggering. The cost associated with serious injury as a result of road accidents amounts to approximately &euro;170,000 and for minor injuries approximately &euro;16,000. Anything that can be done not just to save lives, but to save expenditure associated with accidents, will have a knock-on effect, together with the measures taken by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and committees of this House in trying to reduce the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>The report identified that driver error is the cause of approximately 85% of accidents compared to just 10% of accidents which result from misadventure by pedestrians. Clearly, driver behaviour causes most accidents. While it did not go into the details of identifying what percentage of these accidents were directly attributable to <Col N="1571" />drunken driving it did make a stab at indicating that many of the accidents were as a result of it.</P>
    <P>The penalty points system has changed the culture and I have no doubt it will be successful. Another element of the penalty points system is that the publicity has resulted in a greater acceptance of the system by the community and drivers have slowed down. Hopefully the publicity generated as a result of the introduction of this Bill will help in the public relations battle of ensuring people adhere to the law and refrain from driving while drunk.</P>
    <P>The other speakers have indicated they wish to be co-operative in an effort to get the Bill though as quickly as possible. I welcome that and thank the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. We were looking forward to seeing him. It is impressive when legislation is introduced which anticipates a difficulty of a technical breach of the law. Irrespective of what criticisms people may have of the legislation, it is a tribute to his Department that this has been identified and is being dealt with now. There is nothing as sickening and as annoying as to see legislation which has been found wanting and we all have to take responsibility for that. I am happy to support the Bill and certainly will not delay its passage. However, I wish to make a few brief points.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic Act 1994 was unusual in that it was introduced by the party of which the Minister is a member and opposed strenuously by the Opposition, as opposed to the Independent benches. The Government changed and the Opposition moved to that side and suddenly was in support of the Bill and the party of which the Minister is a member was on this side and opposed the Bill. It was an exercise in cynicism. Representatives of both sides reversed positions after the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was never caught in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to speak with a low voice as I do not have a great record in terms of limits arising from the Road Traffic Act over a number of years. I am not speaking from the high moral ground. One of the two amendments I tabled at that time, both of which were rejected by the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, sought a minimum speed on certain roads. People who drive at a speed which is unsafely slow cause huge frustration &ndash; forgive my inelegance of language &ndash; and this should be examined in terms of legislation. The other issue which I had great difficulty with at the time &ndash; it is interesting in terms of what has happened in the meantime &ndash; was the provision in the legislation which required drivers to carry their driving licence at all times, which I felt was an unfair demand. I was assured by the Minister at the time that he could never see a situation where a genuine Irish person driving <Col N="1572" />their car and minding their business would ever be penalised for not having their licence with them. That position has changed radically in the past while. It is no great problem that the position has changed but it is an inconvenience.</P>
      <P>I raised an issue on this with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in another forum. The requirement to carry one's driving licence is common in other jurisdictions. I wish to make a modernising and progressive proposal which has been discussed in another place, namely, that licences should be credit card size. In that way it would be much easier to carry a licence with one all the time as it could be in a wallet with other items. That has happened in other countries. One can get a photograph built into such a card with the information either on a chip or a strip. Our driving licences are not appropriate for carrying around and were never intended to be carried around all the time. If one takes it out of the plastic folder or it falls somewhere it will not survive. There is no reason it should not be in a credit card size format with the appropriate information on a chip or a strip.</P>
      <P>On some of our major roads, particularly the motorways, the speed limit could be marginally increased. I am aware the Minister intends rounding it up for kilometric purposes and I welcome that and I hope he will not be dissuaded to reduce it to a lower figure by others. It is all about safe driving.</P>
      <P>On the issue of safe driving, the national car test should be biased more towards safety. Some of the demands are not safety driven. I support the national car test for the reason that any time I have spoken on the issue of safe driving I have always bemoaned the fact that people with the safest car in the world in terms of pedestrians and drivers get no credit whatever. At least the national car test requires people to have safer vehicles on the road, which is hugely important. For those who fail the test for something small there is not enough flexibility inasmuch as they have to pay for a full test all over again. That is unfair and brings the test into disrepute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was worried when I first heard the Minister mention an extension of the law to provide the Garda with powers to demand a breath test that it would take us down the road of a police state. I am not speaking from a liberal view but from the point of view of an ordinary citizen. I did not like the idea of people being stopped on the side of the road and forced to take a breath test. Having read the explanatory memorandum I am happy it is appropriate that people involved in a traffic accident should be required to co-operate with whatever testing the Garda is carrying out. No fair minded person would oppose that. I am not as comfortable with the proposal that a breath test could be demanded for any traffic offence as it could be overdone, for example, where a person has double-parked for a few minutes. The bar should be raised a little higher in that regard. In general terms, so long as it was not a dropping of the barriers, developments of this type had to <Col N="1573" />take place. Nobody will object to what is contained in the Bill and it would be wrong to delay it in any way.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Bill and will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I welcome the Minister and commend him on bringing the Bill before the House. It has been a tough week on solicitors. Between the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill and the Road Traffic Bill solicitors will find very little to challenge in future when they go to court. This Bill will also make it tougher on drivers and rightly so given that the Minister said that approximately 6,000 drivers who were breathalysed had twice the legal limit of alcohol in their system. That is an appalling statistic given the length of time over which we have been trying to address this subject. People are still willing, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., to go on the road with twice the legal limit of alcohol in their system. I am pleased this Bill has been introduced. As Senator O'Toole said, there is nothing as annoying as to see a Bill found wanting in respect of a loophole in the courts and where solicitors drive a wedge in a Bill and find a loophole for a person to get off. I am delighted the loophole is being closed off.</P>
      <P>While this has been a very tough week on solicitors, it will also make things tougher for drivers. When random testing is introduced and if what I believe to be Senator Browne's proposal is accepted, namely, that one should have to carry a clean medical certificate when driving, a health warning will be attached to driving to the effect that one had better get on a bus or train. This will reduce the number of cars on our roads. The Minister will have to invest a lot more money in public transport when he takes on board Senator Browne's proposals. I welcome the Bill. I will not delay it any longer and I commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome the Bill and, like Senator Browne, I wish it a speedy passage. I recall the Bills about which Senator O'Toole spoke passing through the House and remember making the point that we should have a code of conduct for motorists. It certainly exists in England, where drivers are much better and more driver-friendly than they are here. If one is pulling out from a laneway or a road, a British driver will give one the right of way, but in Ireland drivers put their foot on the accelerator to make sure one cannot pull out. A code of conduct or courtesy code is desirable.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that the penalty points system has been a great success and the Minister deserves great credit for introducing it in spite of much opposition. I heard on the radio one morning that a guy in a motorised wheelchair received penalty points. Has the Minister examined this issue and are wheelchairs still subject to the penalty points system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While drink driving is a very serious offence, I <Col N="1574" />do not believe it incurs any penalty points. Although penalty points are valid for up to three years, a drink driver who has been banned from driving is permitted to drive on the roads again after 12 months. Will the Minister examine this?</P>
    <P>This Bill gives considerable power to the Garda and is closing a legal loophole. Consider the case of people who had been drinking and who had acted very responsibly by going home by taxi or bus but who were breathalysed on the following morning on their way to work. Will the Minister ensure that the Garda cannot be heavy-handed with such people? They may need their cars to go to work, particularly in rural Ireland where we have no great transport systems. I am sure alcohol remains in the bloodstream for quite a long time and, therefore, I do not know what can be done about the matter. I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister well with it.</P>

      <P>I had three little points about which I had intended to write to the Minister, but I did not have time to do so. I am a frequent traveller to Northern Ireland and usually travel on the Enterprise train. Recently, however, I took the bus to Lisburn to attend a meeting and Bus Éireann dropped me at the side of the road outside the town. I just could not understand it. I can understand why the bus does not drive through the town but the shopping centre was just up the road. When I was dropped on the side of the main road, how was I to get a taxi to the conference in Lisburn?</P>

      <P>My second point, which was raised with the Minister before, is that it should be acceptable to pay the toll on the motorway to the North in sterling. Sterling is accepted on the train, so why can it not be used at the toll station when crossing the River Boyne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a bus stop outside my home on Wyckham Park Road. If I decide to take the bus when <Col N="1575" />my car is being repaired and it is a grand day, I have no problem. However, it could be raining when I am coming home, in which case I could have to wait for 25 minutes in the rain for the 48A bus from Stephen's Green. The Minister should provide bus shelters at the bus stops during his term in office. The thought of standing at Stephen's Green in the rain&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the traffic corps, I heard the Minister speaking on the radio one morning recently. He made an excellent presentation, explained his position very logically and set out the legal problems he faced. He was optimistic that he would achieve his goals. In the morning, the gardaí assist motorists through the Barton Road roundabout and Dundrum village. They are fantastic and very efficient. However, why can we not have gardaí doing the same thing in other towns on the national routes? I know Monasterevin, for instance, is getting its bypass but it is bloody chaotic. There are many similar towns that will not be bypassed. Why can the local gardaí not assist traffic through such towns at peak times? If they can do so in Dundrum so charmingly and efficiently, why the heck do they not do so elsewhere?</P>
      <P>Rather than raising these points in a letter to the Minister, I have done so in the Chamber because it is easier.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and compliment him on the legislation. As Senator O'Toole stated, it is important that the Minister is ahead of the posse. He saw a problem arising in respect of the legislation and introduced this Bill to ensure it will stand up in court. This is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a major Garda blitz on the roads in the near future which will put down a marker to the effect that one should not drink and drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this blitz occurs and gardaí are to be seen in force on the roads, we will certainly put down a definite marker and do so quickly. I do not like to mention any particular group but it was brought to my attention on numerous occasions that certain taxi drivers are driving while half shot. I do not use taxis much, to be honest, but taxi drivers are also likely to be of high risk if they are carrying passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke made a point about breathalysing people the morning after a night's drinking. If a person is over the legal alcohol limit, whether coming or going to work, he should <Col N="1576" />not be driving a motor vehicle. This marker has to be put down and put down quickly. Some might say it is easy for me to make this point and that I am lucky and safe because I have a pioneer pin, but I also want to survive on the roads. As a motorist, one is not safe.</P>
    <P>My few points are important. The Minister's excellent work on the points system has made a great difference on the roads. Without it, given the increased number of cars and vehicles on the road, there would be a far higher number of deaths this year than last year. Great credit is due to the Minister, his officials and the gardaí who are enforcing the rules to the letter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators again for giving this Bill a speedy passage. It enables it to start on 1 December and the Garda will now have very important powers, assuming that the Senators approve of the legislation before them. If Senator Browne wants to visit me at home I guarantee to serve a fully baked dinner. He asked about advertising. I support the advertising by the National Safety Council. It is raw but effective and it has brought the message home. I accept his point about young people. I often wonder how so many young people today have such good habits. Those in my constituency do not take cars when they are going out if they intend to drink. They did not learn that from the previous generation which drove regardless so wherever they learnt the lesson it got through to them and we should be proud of that. We have much to learn from them. However, many young people are killed on our roads.</P>
      <P>The issue of drug testing is important. He is right that there is a great deal more to do in this difficult technical area. It is illegal to be under the influence of drugs when driving because rather cleverly all our legislation refers to &ldquo;intoxicants&rdquo; which are defined as including drugs. Our road traffic legislation that bans alcohol also bans drugs. Testing is the problem with drugs because they are not susceptible to breath testing. A great deal of work is being done on this involving saliva testing and so on but there is much more to do. I intend to press on with that as quickly as possible. The Senator quite rightly also referred to motorbikes. I will have a package before the House in the new year in this regard. It is crazy that 60% of motorbike riders do not have full licences. This is also a technical issue but I am determined to stop it.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooley pointed out the need for more education and referred to the cultural aspect of this issue. He is quite right. The penalty points system is not designed only to catch people, it is intended to change the culture and habits so that if one has a licence and wants to keep it one adheres to the rules of the road. The sum of more than &euro;1.3 million per accident is correct. Apart from the human tragedy the economic cost is very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised several issues. I would not support the introduction of a minimum speed. In the current legislation there is a clear requirement to drive carefully and with due care and attention and a garda could take the view that if <Col N="1577" />one was crawling along at six miles an hour that did not constitute due care and attention and could deal with that. I signed the requirement to carry a licence into law on 1 January. The gardaí are enforcing that and assure me that it is part of their armoury. We are progressing the plastic card licence and I am determined that in 2004 we will move to a credit card size licence. The speed limit changes will take effect before the end of next September and apart from going metric we are also changing the speed limit, particularly the 60 mph limit on country roads which will come down to 50 mph. That is the single biggest change. It covers most roads and will be very helpful. The other changes are marginal. I hear what the Senator said about random testing.</P>
    <P>Senator Morrissey is worried about solicitors but I am not going to lose too much sleep over them tonight if he does not mind. He is right about public transport for which he is a keen advocate and for which he is determined to win increased investment. I approve of that and he knows of our plans in that area including the Luas, the metro, buses, intercity rail and so on across the board.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke talked about the need for a code of conduct and penalty points. I agree with Senator Moylan about the morning after raids; if one is drunk one is drunk whether in daylight or whenever. I can see how people might get the impression that it is an abuse but we have to be clear about this otherwise it will not work.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator White for her comments on the penalty points. I have asked the National Roads Authority to talk to the concessionaires about taking sterling on the M1. They should take it because that is the legal tender of the road and we should respect it. I would like to see the concessionaires take it and I will raise it with them again. I do not know why the gardaí are on the roundabout in Dundrum &ndash; maybe it is because it is local to me.</P>

He was correct to strike first before anyone spotted a loophole in the Bill and he should be commended for that. He might look in the future at the delay between people being caught and given penalty points and being issued with the notice. This can take five to six weeks which is grossly unfair. All the points raised today had the single theme of road safety, reducing carnage on the roads and ensuring that families can be happy at Christmas. This year 80 more families will spend a happy Christmas together than did last year. We will do everything we can in this House to ensure that the number of accidents is further reduced.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Rural Renewal Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, for attending the House to <Col N="1579" />respond to the need to extend the rural renewal scheme beyond December 2004.</P>
      <P>The rural renewal scheme was introduced in the upper Shannon area covering areas in counties Cavan, Sligo, Roscommon and all of counties Leitrim and Longford principally because these areas had suffered particular social and economic problems in the preceding decades.</P>
      <P>We must first acknowledge the foresight of the Minister in introducing and developing this scheme with the intention of redressing the imbalance arising from the social and economic deficits to which I referred. We must also acknowledge the considerable progress that has been made in redressing this imbalance over the past three years in particular.</P>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of all organisations involved, the job is only half done, and we should not discontinue a scheme with a proven track record and with the potential to fill the majority of remaining deficits in the areas which it covers.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the scheme has already run for a considerable period and that most parties interested in availing of its benefits should have done so already. However, there have been particular problems which have mitigated against all of the potential being achieved to date. These include a simple lack of awareness among those in the most disadvantaged areas as to the benefits of the scheme and how these benefits could be channelled to their assistance. There is greater awareness now as a result of the efforts of county councils and other agencies. The continuation of the scheme for a further period would permit these latecomers to avail of the scheme's benefits.</P>
      <P>It is an objective of the national spatial strategy to achieve more balanced regional and inter-regional development. In many cases, the tools to achieve this are being developed or are yet to be developed. The rural renewal scheme is a tool already developed, with a track record of achievement and an ability to deliver significantly more in the future. We must recognise its success, accept its potential and use it in the achievement of a key objective of the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>Many families and business people have paced their proposals on the assumption of a reasonably smooth transition in the application of the processes necessary for plan approval. Unfortunately, the time that passed when difficulties arose or planning appeals were lodged means they cannot meet the timeframes of the existing scheme deadlines. This legitimate problem should warrant an extension of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant amount of Government funding made available to various local authorities in the rural renewal scheme areas in the past five years in particular has enabled the provision of new infrastructure capacity for development that would not have been approved a short time ago. Having regard to the principles of sustainability, best use of resources and infrastructure and the <Col N="1580" />consequential potential to fill a deficit in community development, this infrastructure should be used for the extension of the rural renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities in the relevant areas have recently reviewed or renewed their development plans. These reviewed plans make necessary provision to control areas of complaint that have arisen and were in my opinion unfairly attributed to the rural renewal scheme. I said earlier that the renewed and reviewed development plans have dealt adequately with this problem.</P>
    <P>Most of the areas to which this scheme applies have suffered severe population drain over the last 70 to 80 years. Statistics recently produced under the CLÁR programme point to many of the areas in the rural renewal scheme having lost up to 55% of their population from 1926 to 2002. To say that the scheme is promoting unsustainable patterns of rural development is unsupportable. If we look at sustainability in its most understandable form, we should look at the use being made of existing infrastructure such as schools, churches, shops, post offices, community halls, health services and so on, and ensure that there are sufficient people living in any community and making full, cost-effective use of services already there and paid for by the taxpayer. To take this on to the sporting field, many parishes in the rural renewal scheme areas would not be able to muster sufficient bodies to field a football team. We know that in certain areas of County Cavan.</P>
    <P>I know that my Fianna Fáil Oireachtas colleagues in counties Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, Sligo and Roscommon support the extension of the scheme, and many Fianna Fáil councillors have consistently highlighted its value and asked me to urge the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the Minister of State and the Government to grant this time extension which will be warmly welcomed in these areas.</P>
    <P>Let us not stop when the job is half done. I urge the Minister of State to extend the rural renewal scheme beyond December 2004.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, to speak about the rural renewal scheme in the Seanad this evening.</P>
      <P>Prior to introducing the scheme in the budget for 1998, the Minister for Finance had been aware for quite a considerable time of the problems of the upper Shannon area and that the area was not sharing in the economic success enjoyed by much of the country at that time. The 1996 census showed that the populations of both counties Longford and Leitrim had declined while every other county in the State had shown moderate or significant increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it may seem surprising to suggest this, the same problems have also been experienced by particular areas of our larger towns and cities. <Col N="1581" />Although many of them appeared to be growing rapidly and becoming increasingly prosperous, most of the growth was confined to the suburbs with the inner city areas suffering from population declines and increasing dereliction.</P>
    <P>Since the mid-1980s a succession of urban renewal schemes had succeeded in rejuvenating many inner city areas, and for the first time in decades many of these areas have had population increases. The Minister decided that the concept of tax incentives for the rejuvenation of urban areas could be applied to the upper Shannon area on a pilot and targeted basis. He introduced the scheme in the 1998 Finance Act having announced it in the budget for 1998 on 3 December 1997. His objectives for this scheme were to encourage people to remain in the area, to move into the area and to stimulate economic activity there.</P>
    <P>Centred on counties Leitrim and Longford, but also including parts of counties Sligo, Cavan and Roscommon, the scheme offers specific tax incentives for both residential development as well as expenditure on commercial and industrial projects. The incentives for commercial and industrial projects were considered and approved by the European Commission in line with State aid rules as is the normal procedure for such incentives.</P>
    <P>The rural renewal scheme is clearly an attractive area-based tax relief scheme. All parts of the qualifying areas are eligible for the full range of reliefs available under the scheme. By comparison, only certain sub-areas within the towns and villages designated under both the urban and town renewal schemes qualify for relief, and in most cases each qualifying sub-area or site is restricted to a limited range of reliefs.</P>
    <P>The entire designated rural renewal scheme area also qualifies for rented residential or section 23 type relief, whereas only a limited number of areas or sites have been designated for this relief under both the urban and town renewal schemes. The size of qualifying residential properties under the scheme, in the case of both owner occupier and rented accommodation dwellings, is also greater than under most of the other tax incentive schemes. The Minister was careful to provide a full range of reliefs in order to promote a dynamic residential and commercial mix arising from the availability of the incentives under the scheme. It is not surprising, therefore, that the uptake of the rural renewal scheme has been strong to date, although development has been concentrated in some areas more than others. Overall, planning applications have increased considerably and the number of new homes being built in the rural renewal area has increased substantially compared to the situation prior to the introduction of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, new industry has been attracted to the area. This provides much needed alternative employment opportunities in areas where agriculture would have been the main source of employment. The evidence exists to indicate that <Col N="1582" />the scheme has been successful in significantly increasing economic activity in the designated areas. The building industry locally has benefited from increased construction activity, while the knock-on effects for small businesses and traders are also important. Local authorities, community enterprise boards and other local interests have all played their part in promoting the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme has underpinned the regeneration of many of the small towns and villages in the designated area, providing a revitalised and sustainable fabric of rural life in areas that might have lost out had it not been for the vision and foresight of the Minister. The latest figures from the CSO from the census in 2002 indicate that the trend of population decline suffered by County Longford and County Leitrim has been reversed for the first time since the Famine. The scheme has been a success and is due to end at the end of 2004. Those thinking of availing of it should be aware of that point. There are no plans to extend the scheme to other areas. Part of its success is in designating only one area and sticking to that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. My request is simple. Presentation College secondary school in Carlow is awaiting word on a proposed extension. There are 650 pupils in this excellent school and it offers a comprehensive set of educational programmes through junior cycle, transition year, the traditional leaving certificate, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the leaving certificate applied. The school is not designated as disadvantaged, but many of the pupils who attend it are from disadvantage backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Carlow is a growing town and this is having an impact on the school. The staff, parents and students are concerned about the slow rate of progress with the building of the proposed extension to the school. The school also rejects the classification of the project as a band 3 priority. I ask the Minister to look at that classification again with a view to revising it.</P>
      <P>The school does not have a proper PE hall and the hall that is being used has been the scene of many accidents, one of which was serious and resulted in a major insurance claim. As part of the new extension, the school is pushing for a purpose built PE hall.</P>
      <P>The career guidance teacher's office is four square metres in size and the school library and oratory are being used as general classrooms. Special needs students are often taken for tuition in the year heads' offices. There is a severe accommodation problem. I hope the Minister of State will use his power and influence to advance the school's building plans so that they are undertaken as soon as possible. The list for the coming year is being formulated and this school deserves special attention.</P>
