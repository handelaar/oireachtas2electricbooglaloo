      <P>I have received notice from Senator Scanlon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the updated position on the new kidney dialysis unit at Sligo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise two matters. Yesterday the national co-ordinator of the Irish Foster Care Association, Ms Pat Whelan, described the State's fostering services as being in crisis. I ask the Leader to find time next week for a debate on foster care provisions. It is outrageous that, at a time of such public and private opulence, there are in excess of 4,500 children in need of permanent accommodation with foster parents. Many thousands of childless couples are attempting to adopt children from Romania, Russia and other parts of the world, yet there is a <Col N="442" />large group of children in this country who cannot be provided with loving homes. This House has a responsibility to debate the issue and examine the measures being put in place by the Government to encourage more people to become foster parents. I know the Leader will agree that the foster parents providing care are probably the greatest living examples of Irish men and women. They are providing children with a loving and decent home. I am aware that the former Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, introduced a novel scheme to give financial resources to foster parents engaged in this selfless work. The scheme has not been subscribed to as she and others envisaged. </P>
      <P>Yesterday in the House the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, stated he had been asked by the Taoiseach to chair a new working group on Seanad reform. I ask if the Leader was aware of this decision because I certainly was not. The leaders of groups in this House have already embarked on a radical review of the Seanad which will be concluded over the next 12 to 14 months. I ask if the groups will be working in tandem. One would have thought that the Seanad and its Members would have been consulted before the Government took this unilateral decision. I await the Leader's view on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On an issue of procedure, we debated the Finance Bill yesterday afternoon during which the Minister for Finance was open to taking questions and dealing with issues as they arose. Senators Higgins, McDowell and I were of the view that it was a very useful way of doing business. I ask the Leader to consider introducing a type of Question Time in this House. Yesterday's debate provided a good example of a Minister who may not have agreed with Members on either side of the House being able to deal with issues in a Question Time format. Perhaps the Leader will look at the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another procedural matter which has been considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges relates to the court proceedings involving Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin. I am absolutely appalled that the Government does not consider it has a responsibility to the Houses of the Oireachtas to support both Members completely and fully in their attempts. There is a real need for them to be supported. A number of issues arise. There is an appalling editorial in this month' edition of <i>Garda Review</i> which attempts to compare the decisions of both Members with those of the gardaí involved in the Abbeylara case. It behoves every one of us to make it clear that Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin have nothing to hide. They are taking a totally disinterested position to protect the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas and there must be no negative impact on them if they must comply. There is a complete and utter difference in this <Col N="443" />instance. They are not protecting themselves or any aspect of their work. They are simply protecting the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas which is the reason the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses took a stand on the issue.</P>
    <P>It is crucial to make clear this point. I am totally disinterested in this matter. I am not a member of any party. As a Member of the Oireachtas, I am aware that both Members are taking a stand on our behalf. I know my colleagues on the opposite side of the House share my view in this regard. It is absolutely crucial that no one believes both Members have something to hide. There is nothing to hide. They are simply taking a stand on the way we do our business. I would like the Leader to clarify the position. It is my strong advice to both Members that they should come into the Houses and outline the issues to prove they have nothing to hide and that they are simply taking a stand on behalf of all the people. I do not want either of these two decent people to be under threat in any way in their personal lives or have their property threatened if the decision goes against them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an easy way for them to protect themselves. All they need do is come into the House, outline and they will be completely covered. They have chosen to take a stand on principle which we all admire and support. The Government should take a closer interest in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the two Members of the Oireachtas, I support fully what Senator O'Toole said. I do not want to go into too much detail because the matter is still ongoing. I share his indignation that a Garda magazine should suggest some similarities. Whatever our frailties or faults, these two Houses represent the elected representatives of the people, whose job it is, for better or worse, to be responsible for the well-being of the people. Whether we realise it, we are in a most extraordinary position. The reason for the extraordinary privilege of Members of the Oireachtas is our position is extraordinary. We are the elected representatives of the people under a Constitution the people voted freely to accept. It is extraordinary that we must end up in the courts to assert this simple fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since being elected more than 20 years ago, I have heard and supported the most colourful language appropriate to the occasion to denounce the Provisional IRA's assaults on civilians. Among the things that used to appal us most were the two statements, first, that it deeply regretted the deaths of civilians and, second, that unfortunately in a conflict there were sometimes <Col N="444" />civilian casualties. Some 15 innocent people were murdered in Baghdad yesterday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were murdered because someone chose irresponsibly to use lethal force in an area where they could not have been in any doubt what would happen if anything went wrong. It behoves us to say this to people we claim as our friends. They are creating the most appalling conflict in the world. Yesterday the representatives of the Al-Jazeera television network were banned from Wall Street.</P>

      <P>It was said it was a problem about accommodation which was in short supply. Therefore, it is reported to the Arab world that the defenders of freedom will not allow a free medium from the Arab world to report on what is happening in one part of the United States. </P>
      <P>An English language website was set up yesterday. It has been inaccessible because it has been constantly bombarded by the most sophisticated hacking anyone has ever seen. We are supposed to be tentatively supporting a war to defend freedom. What I see is civilians being murdered, a television channel being censored and a website being bombarded, which has nothing to do with the freedom in which I and Members of this House believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the difference between right and wrong and I am very happy to stand up and say so. I denounced the Provisional IRA in this House in language that could not be questioned. I will not be silent and let others do the same things just because they claim the cloak of respectability.</P>

      <P>To repeat what I said yesterday, propaganda from whatever source&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I accused the Senator of anything. All I am saying is that propaganda from whatever source is not helpful.</P>
      <P>It is important that there is no ambiguity as to the attitude of this side of the House to the predicament of Senator Higgins or the protection of the privilege of Members. This has already been affirmed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses. Therefore, there is no ambiguity as to the attitude of either House with regard to the protection and rights of Members. I understand there may be some legal difficulties in this regard but it would be useful if the committee was to meet in the near future to consider the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just heard that prices here are running 12% above the euro zone average. I know we have debated the Finance Bill in the House but there will soon be a need to debate the issue further. According to the Central Bank, growth is slowing and employment appears set to fall. It has given a stern warning in this regard. We need to hear very soon what plans the Government has, if any, to tackle the increasing inflation rate. While we may have approved the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, we should be concerned about sustaining Ireland.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes's remarks in regard to Seanad reform. It appears peculiar that two bodies may be looking at this matter. I look forward to the Leader's response. </P>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's comments regarding the court proceedings involving Deputy Howlin and Senator Higgins who have done honourable work. They could have put the matter on the record but out of a sense of duty they acquainted the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with all the facts before them. If what we hear is true, it is frightful that they may be punished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on fostering. The health boards face great difficulties in recruiting social workers. My health board has had to go abroad, to South Africa, to recruit them. Perhaps career guidance teachers might exhort students to consider taking up this worthy profession. I applaud the intentions of prospective foster and adoptive parents who show great generosity. Social workers play a pivotal role in the whole area of fostering and adoption. The House should debate the issue sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the attitude of the Leader yesterday to my request that the House debate the situation in Iraq and her indication that it would engage in a rolling debate. Will she indicate her intentions in this regard for next week? A debate of perhaps one hour without the presence of a Minister and with Senators allowed <Col N="446" />five minutes to contribute might be considered. We must monitor what is going on.</P>
      <P>There has been a remarkable reversal in British public opinion. Today 67% are against the war. Major contracts have already been awarded by the United States Government to Vice-President Dick Cheney's Halliburton Corporation.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I was accused of histrionics. I make no apology for being harrowed, as are most decent people in this country, by what is happening. For the honour of the Seanad we must place on record two paragraphs from a report by Robert Fisk in <i>The Independent</i> today that will shame the United States and Britain. It states:</P>
      <P>It was an outrage, an obscenity. The severed hand on the metal door, the swamp of blood and mud across the road, the human brains inside a garage, the incinerated, skeletal remains of an Iraqi mother and her three children in their still-smouldering car.</P>
      <P>Two missiles from an American jet killed them all &ndash; by my estimate more than 20 Iraqi civilians, torn to pieces before they could be &lsquo;liberated' by the nation that destroyed their lives. Who dares, I ask myself, to call this &lsquo;collateral damage'? Abu Taleb Street was packed with pedestrians and motorists when the American pilot approached through the dense sandstorm that covered northern Baghdad in a cloak of red and yellow dust and rain yesterday morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A report on pharmacy will shortly be submitted to the Government. I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate in the House on this important issue in view of the implications for the health service and the contribution made by community pharmacy.</P>
      <P>I also support the comments expressed by previous speakers on the court proceedings involving Senator Higgins. It is in all our interests to give careful consideration to the issues raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Leader to let the House know her intentions regarding a rolling debate on Iraq. It is very important that we do not engage in two minute propaganda soundbites from any side of the House on the Order of Business. There must be a balance of views. I could equally quote from a BBC 2 television programme last night about <Col N="447" />the hurt, wrongs and massacres inflicted on the Kurdish people.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Robert Fisk, as quoted by Senator Norris. Mr. Fisk has pre-empted an inquiry. There is no proof that the missile referred to was a direct hit. It could have been intercepted by a patriot missile and put off route.</P>
    <P>We should not be too quick to judge or use soundbites in the House for the wrong reasons. We need a balanced debate, which will only happen if the Leader provides the time, when both sides of the argument can be presented in a fair and proper manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator does not seem to know which side of the conflict holds patriot missiles.</P>

      <P>It is important the House holds a weekly debate on the situation in Iraq. Like other civil minded people, I am abhorred by the brutality and cruelty of the attacks on the civilian communities. </P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to meet the director general of RTE to discuss the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas under &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; at an earlier time. Many busy people consider that the important debates conducted in this House and the Dáil are broadcast at too late a time. They should be broadcast between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. </P>

      <P>Earlier this week the House engaged in a good debate on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. I raised the question of maternity leave regulations which oblige expectant mothers to take four weeks of their maternity leave prior to delivery. An examination of the statistics will indicate that among European countries, Ireland has among the highest rate of premature babies, by two weeks. This arises because women, doctors and employers are obliged by the regulations to indicate a date for delivery. It is often mistaken as they attempt to secure as much maternity leave as possible after birth. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has indicated that a review of the regulations on maternity leave and benefit is under way in Europe. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has responsibility for the regulations in this area, to attend the House and hear the views of Senators. I hope this will be done at an early stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to time pressures, I was unable to participate in yesterday's Private Members' debate on health. I reiterate my support to the Minister. However, it is vital that the BreastCheck programme is rolled out across the country and that <Col N="448" />staff are immediately appointed to the regional radiotherapy centres identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Leader expressed the view that the war in Iraq was illegal. If so, does she and the Government believe President Bush and Prime Minister Blair should be indicted for war crimes?</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance confirmed that there was no prospect of the promised additional 2,000 extra gardaí coming on stream. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House as a matter of urgency to debate the issue.</P>

      <P>I support the request by Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Glynn for an extended discussion on fosterage, child care and social work. Concern about abuse of children in the past has created an atmosphere where people are reluctant to go into social and child care work or to take on fosterage. The people who are suffering are the children who need that care most. I hope we can have a debate on the issue soon.</P>

      <P>I support those who asked for a debate on Iraq early next week. It is important that we try to address this matter from the perspective of an area in which we are involved, namely, the provision of humanitarian aid. The pictures we have seen of the distribution of aid, to date, have been appalling. The Government has said that it will give money for aid and other organisations here are also asking for money. We have aid workers waiting in Kuwait to go into Iraq as soon as possible. We need to look at the issue from the perspective of the part of it in which we are seriously involved.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to come before the House to discuss the appallingly slow implementation of the Mental Health Act 2001. Progress is at a snail's pace and this is causing great difficulties for those working in the psychiatric services and for patients who are not being properly treated under many of the Council of Europe and other conventions.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on transport in light of the controversial comments made by Mr. Michael O'Leary of Ryanair regarding Aer Rianta and in view of the fact that he stated clearly that there is no need for a second runway in Dublin Airport or for a metro or train link to the airport? A debate in the House regarding those comments would be helpful.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify the dates of the Easter recess for those who are not aware of them. The political parties know the dates, but perhaps some of the Independent groups do not. I said in the House that we would break on a particular date, but that is not the correct date. We will break on either 16 or 17 April which is either Wednesday or Thursday of Holy Week. We return on Wednesday, 7 May.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes spoke about the State fostering service and mentioned that there are 4,500 children looking for foster parents. What Senator Glynn said is also important in this context. I agree that there is need for debate. Foster parents perform a selfless task. They know they will not have the child in their care forever, yet they take on the responsibilities and the rearing of that child. A debate on this matter would be useful and worthwhile and we will try to get the appropriate Minister to come before the House. He was here last night in connection with another matter. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" />Senator Glynn spoke about the lack of social welfare advisers, counsellors, etc. in the area. That could be one of the reasons that the numbers of young children needing a loving home are so high. We are fortunate to have a career guidance counsellor in our midst and counsellors should encourage young people to take up the worthwhile profession of social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes also asked about the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and the chairing of the group on Seanad reform. I think the Minister has been asked to chair the group because he is involved with councillors throughout the country. I understand that councillors have been activated by the reports of debate on Seanad reform, which is quite right because it is they who have the franchise. I feel the Minister was appointed in that context. I will endeavour to clarify the issue. We hope to have a meeting next week and will see where it is headed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke about the Finance Bill and the toing and froing of the debate. I was only present for a short period of that debate. Senators McDowell and Higgins, in particular, and Senators Mansergh, White and others who came and went had a free and easy exchange of views. Senator O'Toole suggested this exchange as a model for Ministers in charge of a brief. It would be useful.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the matter of the need for us to express our solidarity with Senator Higgins and of the need for a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. We should have a Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting in order to express our solidarity more strenuously. He also thought that Senator Higgins should read into the record what he told the then Minister for Justice. I think that would defeat the purpose of the point which is that Senator Higgins went about the matter the right way, as he thought, at the time and it turned out to be read wrongly. Senator Ryan supports the two Members &ndash; Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin &ndash; involved. I agree with him in that regard. Any one of us could be in the same situation and we would be glad of solidarity. Senator Dardis affirmed what has been said about Senator Higgins and the need for a Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting. The latter comes under the aegis of the Cathaoirleach. Senator Minihan agreed with the remarks about Senator Higgins.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also mentioned the 15 innocent civilians killed in Baghdad. Everyone in the House would concur with what he said. He also mentioned the website which is being bombarded and the fact that Al-Jazeera has been banned from Wall Street. I do not know anything about that matter, I am merely mentioning what the Senator said.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan spoke about consumer prices and the 12% above average prices we pay here. We may be able to include this in debate on the <Col N="451" />social partnership. I understand that measures to counter inflation are built into that. A debate on the issue would be useful and I hope we can include it in that.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris sought debate on Iraq. He requested that even an hour, without a Minister present, be made available in order that Members may express their views. I will try to see how that can be done. Senator Bannon requested a weekly debate on the subject.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris made an unfortunate remark. He said that he may not be as familiar with the smell of blood as some of the more sophisticated people here. Nobody in the House would concur with that remark. I must point out that nobody in this House is used to that kind of regime or would wish to be part of it.</P>

      <P>Senator Minihan asked about the review of the pharmacy profession. I do not know if the Minister has received the report, but the request is timely and we will seek debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon agreed that RTE should bring forward the transmission time for &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo;. I remember that Deputy Rabbitte, leader of the Labour Party, once said that only two groups of people watched it, insomniacs and drunkards. I think more people are sitting up late to watch it. I will request that it be brought forward.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox spoke about maternity leave regulations. She wants me to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, about what is happening in Europe concerning review of the regulations. She also asked about BreastCheck and mentioned the need for staff for it in the Western Health Board, particularly in the Galway region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to present this important Bill to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed primarily to provide a legislative basis for the granting of full labour market access to nationals of the EU accession states after accession takes place in May 2004. From the date of accession, nationals of these countries will no longer require employment permits to work in Ireland. It also puts in place a safeguard mechanism whereby a requirement for employment permits may be reintroduced in respect of nationals of the relevant countries, should the Irish labour market suffer an unexpected disturbance during a transitional period after EU enlargement takes place.</P>
      <P>I am availing of this opportunity to put the employment permit regime generally on a more sound statutory footing. The Bill incorporates a provision whereby, for the first time, a requirement for employment permits in respect of non-nationals working in Ireland is set out in primary legislation, together with penalties for non-compliance by employers and employees.</P>
      <P>Before going into detail on the provisions of the Bill, I wish to place it in context as part of the general enlargement of the EU, as well as this Government's approach to matters pertaining to economic migration matters. Members will be aware that an additional ten countries, namely, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Cyprus, are to be admitted to the EU with effect from May 2004. From that date, they will be party to the treaties governing the European Communities. However, this does not apply to provisions in relation to labour market access. In this area, given concerns surrounding possible labour flows and possible labour market effects, the EU has put in place a transitional measure, during which each member state will be able to exercise discretion as to the extent of access to their respective labour markets. The exception to this arrangement provides for full access to the EU labour market for Malta and Cyprus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a wonderful opportunity for us, as a people, to extend the hand of friendship and solidarity to these new member states and to forge new alliances with these countries, many of which will find themselves in a similar position to Ireland after we joined in 1973, in terms of economic situation, size and population. The Bill pro<Col N="454" />vides the necessary legislative vehicle to allow us to do that.</P>
    <P>The essential components of the transitional arrangements that have been agreed at EU level apply equally to Ireland and all other member states. The arrangements provide that for two years following the date of accession, national measures rather than Community rules will be applied to the newly acceded member states. In effect, this means that we can choose to be as flexible or as restrictive as we like in relation to labour market access for nationals of these countries.</P>
    <P>Two years after accession, in May 2006, Ireland will have to decide whether it then wishes to apply the full body of rules on freedom of movement, or the <i>acquis</i>. The expectation is that most member states would apply the full <i>acquis</i> at this stage. However, member states may opt to continue the national measures operated in the first two years if they wish to do so and it is expected that this will only happen where granting full freedom of movement may pose a threat to their labour market.</P>
    <P>The transitional period should come to an end after a maximum of five years, but it may be prolonged for a further two years in those member states where there are serious disturbances of the labour market or a threat of such disruption. This case would have to be demonstrated. Finally, national measures in the transitional period may not be more restrictive than the provisions in force at the date of signing of the accession treaty. Austria and Germany have the right to apply national measures to address serious disturbances, or the threat thereof, in specific sensitive sectors in their labour markets, which could arise in certain regions from cross-border provision of services.</P>
    <P>I wish to set the current economic migration situation in the broader context of the Irish labour market on the whole. From 1997 to 2000, Ireland experienced an unprecedented level of growth in the region of 10%, year on year, in both GNP and GDP. This strong performance has brought about an unprecedented growth in the labour force. In the past five years we have seen our labour force grow by 200,000 to a current figure of 1.85 million, while the numbers employed have grown by 300,000 to a current figure of 1.77 million.</P>
    <P>The current level of unemployment is 4.5%, compared with an EU average of 7.9%. This level of employment growth has, in turn, given rise to significant labour shortages and a rapid increase in the number of foreign workers. These have come not only from the countries of the European Union, the citizens of which enjoy freedom of movement under EU law, but also from a wide range of other countries.</P>
    <P>While the longer-term growth potential of the economy may still be reassuring, the short-term outlook has weakened somewhat. This is partic<Col N="455" />ularly the case with regard to unemployment. The year 2002 saw some 25,538 notified redundancies, the highest level since 1988. This constituted an increase of 28% over those notified in 2001 which, in turn, saw an increase of 49% over 2000. The trend is continuing with relatively modest growth forecast for this year and next. However, in relative terms, unemployment is still low and the indications are that we will still have a need for both skilled and unskilled labour from overseas in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>In 1999, 6,000 work permits were issued in respect of workers from outside the European economic area &ndash; a record at the time. By 2002 this figure exceeded 40,000. Persons coming here to work on foot of work permits are fully compliant with our immigration requirements and made welcome in their places of employment and their new communities. Much of this labour migration is of a temporary nature and consistent with the broader pattern of intra-European labour migration. In future we should be able to meet the great bulk of our economic immigration needs from within the enlarged European Union. However, we should also be able to attract particularly skilled personnel from the wider world.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that Ireland's national measures for the transitional period will be to grant full access to the labour market to nationals of the new member states from the date of accession, May 2004. There are a number of reasons for this. First, arguably most important, this will send a strong and unambiguous signal to the new member states that we intend to show solidarity and promote their integration into the Union from the outset. We intend that this should set the tone for longer-term relations with these states.</P>
    <P>Second, there is no reason to believe there will be a large flow of labour migration to this country from these states after accession. Experience to date supports this view. Previous enlargements of the European Union were accompanied by fears of a &ldquo;flood&rdquo; of nationals of the new member states entering the Union which never materialised. The many studies carried out in this area in recent years do not support the argument that there will be large, disruptive flows to the labour markets of most existing member states.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I suggest that, if we choose to restrict access to the labour market by continuing the need for employment permits, these new member states could well feel let down, given the relatively healthy state of our labour market. This would be contrasted with the positions adopted by the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Greece and the United Kingdom &ndash; with which we share a common travel area &ndash; which will all apply full freedom of movement for work.</P>
    <P>Economic migration to Ireland from the accession states has been very positive in recent years. Personnel from these countries accounted <Col N="456" />for about 35% of work permits issued in 2002, or some 13,752, of which some 33% were renewals. While there is clearly a high rate of turnover in personnel, anecdotal evidence suggests that personnel from the accession countries are generally highly regarded by employers because of a strong work ethic and reliability.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House contains a provision that allows for a possible reintroduction of a need for employment permits if there should be a labour market shock warranting such measures. The presence of this clause in no way means that I have a pessimistic assessment of our economic prospects in the coming years, or that I expect an unmanageable influx of migrant workers from the new member states. It is, however, a prudent measure as we move into a new phase in EU enlargement and an uncertain economic climate. Not to avail of the option of a safeguard measure would mean that domestic legislation would in fact be more liberal than the treaties governing the European Union in respect of the freedom of movement of EU workers. It would also run counter to assurances given by the Government in the context of the second referendum on the Nice treaty. Other member states have also indicated that they will avail of safeguard measures allowed by the accession treaty.</P>
    <P>The legislation is a necessary instrument to give effect to the core policy decisions in this area. At present, the employment permit system is run on foot of an order under Article 4 of the Aliens Order, 1946. The Government's legal advice is that this would not provide a sufficiently robust statutory basis for introducing the measures contained in the Bill being discussed. Any legislation to underpin the national measures we propose to introduce for the transitional period must be enacted before 16 April 2003, the date for the signing of the accession treaty. Otherwise, there is a danger that such measures might be held to constitute a more restrictive regime than was in place at the time of the signing of the treaty. This would be contrary to the provisions of the accession treaty. This is the reason this Bill is being put to the House at this time and it is in the public interest that it be enacted before 16 April.</P>
    <P>With this Bill, I take the opportunity to put the employment permit system on a sound statutory footing. Section 2 was first introduced as an amendment to the Immigration Bill 2002, introduced in this House by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform late last year. The introduction of that provision was intended to remedy a very basic defect in existing law &ndash; the absence of a specific offence and related penalty that can be applied to an employer who knowingly employs a person not entitled to work in the State without an employment permit. However, as it is proposed that the Bill before us will be enacted before the Immigration Bill 2002, I am now taking this opportunity to include this <Col N="457" />section in the Bill before us. It will subsequently be deleted from the Immigration Bill 2002. I suggest this gives greater coherence to the proposed measures now before the House.</P>
    <P>We have in recent years experienced what many other developed countries of the western world have already undergone: a growth in illegal economic migration. While the majority of employers and employees abide by all of the rules and regulations of the employment permit schemes in place, there are those individuals who do not operate within the confines of the law and will look to take the easy option wherever possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill states explicitly the requirement for an employment permit where it is proposed to employ a non-EEA national, and creates a criminal offence for both an employee and an employer where a contract of employment is entered into without such a permit. It has long been a source of concern that there is a great legal imbalance between employer and employee when it comes to the law on the employment of non-nationals. No right-thinking person can agree that it is fair that while it is an offence for the non-national, in general, to be in employment without an employment permit, the employer can take such staff on with impunity. Furthermore, it is unacceptable that some unscrupulous employers should be able to gain an economic advantage over compliant employers through illegal employment. The provisions contained in the Bill redress the existing imbalance. They send a clear message to employers, in particular, that exploitative activity of this nature is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Work is continuing on preparing the more comprehensive employment permit legislation agreed by the Government last year and I intend that that Bill should be published shortly after Easter. The current proposals are not in any way a substitute for that Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill contains almost exactly the same provisions as sections 4 and 5 of the Immigration Bill 2003, which has already been passed by this House. Subsection (1) simply restates the present law &ndash; at Article 4(1) of the Aliens Order, 1946 which is to be revoked by subsection (12) of this section &ndash; making it an offence for a non-national to take up or be in employment in the State in the absence of an employment permit issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This reflects a key principle underpinning the economic migration regime in Ireland: that permission for non-EEA personnel to work in the State is a concession granted by the State rather than a right. </P>
    <P>This restriction does not apply to all non-EEA nationals. Subsection (10) lists the categories of non-nationals exempt from this requirement. These categories are as follows: recognised refugees and members of their families who have been admitted to the State to join them; pro<Col N="458" />gramme refugees admitted under section 24 of the Refugee Act; current EU nationals, nationals of the three additional countries of the European economic area &ndash; Norwegians, Icelanders and citizens of Liechtenstein &ndash; and Swiss nationals, all of whom are entitled to participate in the Irish labour market by virtue of membership of the EU or other international agreements; and other non-nationals whose permission to remain in the State includes a condition that they may work without an employment permit. The last category includes, but is not limited to, those who, though not refugees, have been given permission to remain in the State for reasons of a humanitarian nature.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is a new provision which creates a specific offence for an employer to enter into an employment contract in the absence of the necessary employment permit. Until now, it has been an offence only for an employee to take up employment without such a permit, which has been a source of concern to me for some time. Senators will agree that it is right we should take this legislative opportunity to redress the imbalance that has hitherto existed; it makes no sense that, in the context of what can be seen as an exploitative relationship, the person doing the exploiting should go unpunished.</P>
    <P>A measure of the relative degree of wrongdoing on either side of the contractual relationship between an employer and a non-national employee in such cases can be seen in the subsection which specifies the punishments. The lesser offence is that of the employee but it is an offence nonetheless. The employer's offence can be prosecuted as a summary offence, or in the Circuit Court on indictment. If prosecuted on indictment, an employer may be fined up to &euro;250,000 and may face a prison sentence of up to ten years. Subsection (4) places an onus on employers, before they employ a non-national, to carry out a reasonably thorough check to satisfy themselves that the prospective employee does not require an employment permit, or that an employment permit has been obtained if it is needed.</P>
    <P>The fact that employing a non-national without an employment permit is to be a serious criminal offence makes it necessary to ensure there are sufficient powers to enable such offences to be identified and detected. Accordingly, subsections (5) to (9), inclusive, provide powers for the Garda to search premises, by warrant of the District Court if necessary, to punish the obstruction of such searches and arrest without a warrant a person who obstructs. </P>
    <P>The only addition to this section since it last came before the House is subsection (11), which specifies that, if a requirement for an employment permit is reintroduced for nationals of the new EU member states, preference shall be given to applications in respect of such nationals over applications in respect of third country nationals. This is in line with the accession treaty which <Col N="459" />obliges member states to operate any transitional measures on a Community preference basis.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 3 relate specifically to the accession states. Subsection (1) exempts citizens of the accession states from the requirement to obtain an employment permit to work in the State. Citizens of countries which become member states of the European Union after this legislation is passed who are not immediately granted freedom of access to the labour market under the relevant treaty of accession will be granted full access to the Irish labour market under this section. This will, in effect, exempt the eight accession states to which transitional measures apply from the need for employment permits. As there are no transitional measures in relation to Malta and Cyprus, citizens of those countries will be exempt from this requirement under section 2(10)(<i>c</i>) of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3(3) provides that, if the labour market is experiencing or is likely to experience a disturbance, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may make an order providing that section 2 shall apply to some or all of the accession states. This will mean that citizens of these states will require employment permits to take up employment. This subsection has been included as a safeguard in the case of an unexpected shock to the domestic labour market. Such an order would apply during the transition period only and cease to be valid as soon as the full acquis on freedom of movement applies to the states. </P>
    <P>Subsection (4) provides that citizens of the new member states who are already in employment in Ireland at a date after accession would not be affected by a reimposition of a requirement for employment permits for citizens of the new member states. This should ensure such persons would not be at risk of losing their jobs in such circumstances. A six week working period prior to the reimposition is considered appropriate to avoid the possibility of tactically dated employment contracts designed to avoid reimposed regulations.</P>
    <P>I trust that my remarks have conveyed the important public goals to be attained by enacting this legislation. Senators will appreciate the unusual urgency attaching to the legislative timetable in this matter. It is with the greatest reluctance that the Government has had to introduce these proposals at this late stage but legal advice is that this is the prudent approach. I commend the proposals to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his overview of this legislation. As this is a relatively short Bill, I will not detain the House for very long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has outlined the background and purpose of the Bill which will allow full freedom of access to the Irish labour market <Col N="460" />by citizens of eight EU accession countries &ndash; the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia &ndash; with effect from May 2004. It is prudent and proper, as the Minister of State said, that non-nationals working in Ireland will be required to hold a work permit. The Bill provides for fines of up to &euro;250,000 and up to ten years in prison, or both, for employers found guilty of hiring illegal workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the safeguard in the Bill permitting the reintroduction of the permit requirement for workers from countries which are not member states of the European Union if the labour market suffers as a result of the enlargement of the Union. This is a prudent provision in view of the severe warnings received, notably from the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has mentioned that the Government's decision is in line with that in some other EU member states &ndash; Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, Luxembourg and Greece. The fact that about 35% of work permits are held by citizens of EU accession states should mean that demand will drop by an equal amount from next May. This will reduce the pressure on the work permit system and ensure it works more effectively.</P>
    <P>As citizens of a nation with a long history of emigration, we understand young people may need to live in other countries. Thankfully, the era when other countries often offered better working and living opportunities than Ireland has passed. The dramatic change in circumstances is demonstrated by the fact that debates on emigration have been replaced by discussions about immigration policy. It is interesting that Ireland has to consider itself as an economically attractive country and, to that end, this Bill sets out to ensure the imminent increase in immigration is dealt with effectively.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that citizens of EU accession states who account for about 35% of work permit holders will not need permits to work here. The enactment of this legislation will lead to a decrease in the pressure faced by our work permit system and a fairer playing field for those looking for work.</P>
    <P>Cases of employers exploiting the work permit system, by replacing Irish workers with cheap labour from some of the countries I have mentioned, have been outlined in the media recently. Non-nationals have, unfortunately, been treated disgracefully in some cases. Certain employers will no longer be able to exploit the system when the new legislation comes into effect. Our colleagues from the new EU member states will be given better and fairer opportunities in the employment sector.</P>
    <P>I hope the economy does not suffer to the extent that the Government is forced to introduce a transitional period to allow it to reintroduce the work permit system for workers from EU accession states. It seems, however, that the econ<Col N="461" />omic indicators are not as we would wish them to be.</P>
    <P>This legislation will resolve many of the problems that have resulted from the arrival in Ireland of citizens from the accession countries. It will give them the same opportunities when looking for work as citizens of existing member states. It will end the headache faced by both employers and employees when dealing with the procedures involved in acquiring a work permit. What will happen, however, to those persons not from the accession countries or the European economic area? They and their employers will still be bound to a work permit system which will afford to ruthless employers opportunities to abuse the procedure and hire cheap labour to work under often scandalous conditions. </P>
    <P>We need a more coherent and effective immigration policy and not disjointed, last-minute legislation or one Bill dealing with work permits and another with immigration. How will the work permit system operate when the legislation is enacted? Will permits be given to certain sectors? If so, to which sectors will they be given? Will there be capping whereby, depending on labour market pressures, the issuing of permits will be halted? I would like abuse of the work permit system to be prevented by greater enforcement of immigration policies, which will ensure that all non-national workers are treated fairly and equally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in general. I thank the Minister for the outline he gave to the House and look forward to his response. </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister and support the Employment Permits Bill 2003. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the granting of free access to the Irish labour market to nationals of EU accession states with effect from May 2004. I am reminded of a speech the Pope made in the 1980s in which he said Europe had two lungs. He was referring to eastern and western Europe and it is good that fresh life will be breathed into the European continent by the accession of new states to the EU. It will benefit labour markets and provide new opportunities. This Bill is part of that process and it is to be broadly welcomed.</P>
      <P>From the date of accession, nationals of the new member states will no longer require employment permits to work in Ireland. The Bill also puts in place a safeguard mechanism whereby a requirement for employment permits can be reintroduced in respect of nationals of the relevant countries should the Irish labour market suffer a disturbance after EU enlargement. The Bill also incorporates a provision whereby, for the first time, a requirement for employment permits in respect of non-nationals working in Ireland is set out in primary legislation, together with penalties for non-compliance by employers and employees. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" />It is expected that granting free access to the Irish labour market to nationals of accession states after EU enlargement will result in a reduction in work permit processing fees of about 35%, or circa &euro;4 million at current levels. However, it should also result in a major reduction in demand for work permits, thus facilitating better customer service and quality control, together with savings on overtime expenditure.</P>
    <P>Despite the economic downturn and unemployment increasing to 4.4% last year, the number of applications for work permits has continued to climb. Traditionally, Ireland has been a country of net emigration. However, increased prosperity resulted in the number of applicants under the work permit scheme growing from 3,617 in 1994 to 40,321 last year. Over 40% of the permits granted last year involved jobs in low-skill areas such as farming, construction and catering. It is almost certain that the labour market will continue to require immigrant workers to supplement the domestic labour pool. However, it is essential to include the safeguard in the Employment Permits Bill 2003 permitting the reintroduction of the requirements for permits for workers from newly acceded EU countries if the labour market was to suffer a disturbance after enlargement.</P>
    <P>Some 35% of current work permits are held by citizens of EU accession countries, so demand is expected to drop by this amount from next May. The Government's position is in line with other EU member states, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the UK, Spain, Luxembourg and Greece. Fines of up to &euro;250,000, ten years in prison, or both, for employers found guilty of hiring illegal workers are also included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The leading anti-Nice treaty campaigner, Mr. Anthony Coughlan, predicted last summer that the Government could be forced to bear the costs of potentially heavy eastern European migration to Ireland from 2004, without any Dáil debate or public consultation on the issue. The new regime will eliminate any question of a non-EU national being exploited. Following the decision of the Copenhagen Summit last December, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia can join the EU on 1 May 2004.</P>
    <P>It was agreed at that summit that the new member states will receive a rural development package which will be specifically adapted to their requirements and which will have more favourable conditions than those applied to the current EU member states. The amount available for the ten candidate countries is fixed at &euro;5.1 billion for 2004 to 2006. Direct aids for the new member states will be phased in over ten years. They will thus receive 25% of the full EU rate in 2004, rising to 30% in 2005 and 35% in 2006. This level can be topped up by 30% up to 55% in 2004, 60% in 2005 and 65% in 2006. Until 2006, the top-up payments can be co-financed by up to 40% from <Col N="463" />their rural development funds. From 2007, the new member states may continue top-up EU direct payments by up to 30% above the applicable phasing-in level in the relevant year, but financed entirely by national funds.</P>
    <P>Special provisions have been agreed for Cyprus and Slovenia to take account of their internal support systems prior to accession. The farmers from the new member states will have full and immediate access to common agricultural policy market measures, such as export refunds, and cereal, skimmed milk powder or butter intervention, which will contribute to stabilising their prices and incomes.</P>
    <P>The key issues for most people in the accession countries are poverty, human rights and democracy. Ireland, as a country which was, until recently, geographically marginal and economically underdeveloped, has a lot to contribute to this dialogue. The challenge of enlargement is first and foremost a social challenge because most people in central and eastern Europe are chiefly concerned about what impact it will have on their day-to-day lives. In the past decade they have seen their new political freedoms undermined by dramatically increasing poverty and inequality and the devastation of systems of social protection, employment and social services. Enlargement can only succeed if it responds to people's direct needs.</P>
    <P>One of Lithuania's most significant investments has been in its young people. An estimated 8,000 young Lithuanians have already travelled to work in Ireland. The European Union has enlarged on two occasions since we joined. On each occasion, there have been prophecies of mass immigration and economic decline. However, European leaders have refused to set artificial boundaries to European unity which would deny opportunities to non-member states. On each occasion enlargement has not only improved the lot of the new members, but has also enriched the community as a whole on social, economic and cultural levels.</P>
    <P>The fifth enlargement of the EU, which was facilitated by the framework agreed at Nice, offers many benefits for Ireland. We stand to gain enormously from the opportunities of an enlarged common market. Since we export 90% of our goods, we need to be in a position to penetrate new markets to maintain the ability to expand. Our trade with the applicant states has grown sixfold since 1993 and can only grow further as the rate of GDP improves in these states with membership of the EU.</P>
    <P>With enlargement, companies in all accession states will be bound by common regulations ensuring that they can no longer use lower safety standards or poorer workers' rights to secure an unfair competitive advantage. This is a very important point.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" />The &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign for the Nice referendum suggested that enlargement is a threat to Ireland's interests, that it is a poor deal for the applicants and that it would lead to no less than a flood of immigration into Ireland. We must examine the social welfare benefits for immigrants to Ireland. Under EU law, immigrants to Ireland may import three months' worth of benefits from their country of origin while searching for a job here. Under EU law and European Court of Justice case law, immigrants can stay in a country for six months searching for a job but job seekers are not entitled to social welfare benefits in the member state in which they are looking for work. After six months, the legal status of the immigrant becomes very grey and he could potentially be repatriated to his home country. This arises because freedom of movement in the EU extends to workers, but to be classified as such one must have a job.</P>
    <P>If the migrant finds a job, under Irish law he or she must make either 32 weeks of PRSI contributions in one tax year or 52 weeks of PRSI contributions over two tax years before qualifying for social welfare benefit. The immigrant may also qualify for social welfare assistance, which is means tested, if seeking a job in Ireland. If he or she has not found work within six months of receiving benefits, the legal situation of the immigrant becomes very grey. To summarise, anyone who migrates to Ireland will have to work and will not get social welfare benefit for more than six months.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;No&rdquo; campaign tried to scare voters with fairy stories about eastern European immigration to Ireland following the Nice referendum. Academic studies by the European Commission indicate that such fears of large migration are hugely exaggerated. The studies concluded that the numbers of East-West migrants will be small, economic and social policy will act as further restraint on migration, and the impact of migration will be influenced by geography and sectors, with Germany and Austria seeing the largest numbers of migrants.</P>
    <P>The study concludes that about 120,000 immigrants will join the EU labour force per year, compared to annual immigration into the EU of 800,000 in recent years. About two thirds of these migrants are expected to flow to Germany and some 10% to Austria. In a situation in which Ireland is expected to need migrant labour in the medium to long term, some movement of labour from the accession countries to Ireland will bring economic benefits.</P>
    <P>Beyond academic surveys, using common sense it is clear that mass migration will not happen post-Nice. For example, when Ireland joined the EEC in 1973, when we were economically deprived, there was no mass emigration of the Irish to Germany or France. Today, with 4.3 million unemployed Germans and 2.5 million unem<Col N="465" />ployed Spaniards, nobody is talking about mass German or Spanish emigration to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The line of argument about mass immigration into Ireland has been exposed for what it is &ndash; irrational and dangerous. Not only is there no objective proof that enlargement will lead to the flood of eastern workers that some have predicted, it is a short-sighted argument. Membership of the European Union will allow the workers of eastern Europe the opportunity to develop their own economies and build brighter futures at home. If anything is testament to the desire of people to grasp opportunities to build a better life at home it is the return to our shores of tens of thousands of Irish people in recent years, brought about by our own economic transformation. The more integrated eastern Europe becomes, the more likely it is to assist in the suppression of illegal immigration.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, in 1994 Ireland's exports to the applicant countries of eastern and central Europe were worth only &euro;160 million. In the year 2000, they were worth &euro;1,187 million. This represents a sevenfold increase but still represents only 1.5% of our overall exports on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Our overall trade with the applicant countries has grown from &euro;283 million in 1994 to &euro;1,830 million in 2000. Our main trading partners among the applicant countries are Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic. Four hundred indigenous small and medium-sized companies are working in these markets and 60 of these companies have already established local operations. Irish companies are active in a diverse range of economic activities ranging from financial services and construction to commercial radio and public relations consultancy.</P>
    <P>This Bill will make life easier for many people to work in our country and will benefit our economy. I commend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator O'Toole. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House and I welcome the Bill. I am glad the Government has decided to take a generous attitude towards the granting of work permits immediately to people from the EU accession countries. It is the right thing to do.</P>
      <P>After the comprehensive and useful speech by Senator Hanafin I will keep my remarks short. It is just as well that we are going to give these immigrants work permits straightaway because I do not know what we would otherwise do to keep business going in the retail trade, in hotels, restaurants and numerous other areas of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has said that more comprehensive legislation is on the way regarding employment permits in general for people from outside the EU. I hope there is no delay in this because the two areas in which I am involved in <Col N="466" />employment are the university and medical sectors. Delays in getting employment permits in these areas are appalling and it is our loss when, for example, doctors and lecturers in foreign languages have their work permits delayed. I hope this promised legislation will be brought in very shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this legislation and the reference by Senator Hanafin to last year's European debate, when Mr. Anthony Coughlan snowed us under with information about how we would have to deal either with a &ldquo;flood&rdquo; of people from eastern Europe or else keep those people out. That fuelled an unnecessary and dangerous racist-based debate in this country and debased the whole European debate. One of the biggest difficulties we are dealing with in the area of permits is the polarisation of the debate. Some people take a racist view, demanding that foreigners be kept out, while others, who strangely enough describe themselves as liberals, take the view that anyone who wants to come into this country should be allowed do so without question. </P>
      <P>In running a civilised, developed country, what we need is a civilised, open and humane managed policy. In countries where I have looked at this issue, managed policies have worked. As a country, our first duty is to our citizens, and then to citizens of our fellow member states. Policies need to be balanced with consideration for refugee, immigration and asylum issues. We need a humanitarian policy, one we can be proud of, to deal with those issues.</P>
      <P>Work permits are essential to economic development. They must relate to the economic needs of a country and to its labour force needs at any given time. There is nothing wrong with saying, for example, that we need specific numbers of plumbers, teachers and members of other professions, with people to be admitted on that basis of qualification. Yet some people will insist that we are racist if we employ such a managed policy. There has been no understanding as to what precisely Government policy is in this area. It has changed from month to month. There is nothing wrong with change if we know the basis for it and the context in which changes are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important issue involves the need for competitiveness while remaining anti-exploitative. We must ensure that Irish industry and the country's economy are competitive while also ensuring that workers, wherever they come from, are not exploited. One of the great difficulties recently has been that many projects to provide infrastructure in this country have been won by non-Irish companies at a price that has undercut European Union industry, essentially because they exploited workers and were not required to deal with health and safety, environmental and other regulations at home. All those countries and all those of us who supported enlargement <Col N="467" />under the treaty made the point very carefully that many people were voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; because they did not want eastern European countries, industries and people undercutting them and taking jobs in Ireland. That was ridiculous, nonsensical and illogical thinking.</P>
    <P>The whole point of the treaty is that every European Union country must comply with all the environmental, health and safety, maternity and other regulations. In that way we create a level playing field which protects Irish industry. There is no doubt that it creates competitiveness strains and certain difficulties for people on all sides early on. However, we have gone through that in this country to bring Irish standards of living and <i>per capita</i> GDP up to European levels. We have managed to do that in recent years, and the same thing will happen in the eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>We ask two things of the Minister. Now that there is a policy to manage the matter, which is to be welcomed, let us also make clear to the world that people coming in will not in any way be exploited and that, regarding competitiveness, whatever countries they come from will be required to meet all the basic European requirements. That means that we are all playing on the same pitch and that people must deal with exactly the same issues. If we do so, people on both sides of the House with moderate views of the world, who are against racists, and those with no policy, can say that what we are doing is sensible and managed, looking after the European Union and after Ireland and its citizens. To do so, we ensure that permits are granted where necessary.</P>
    <P>There is a slight lacuna between now and the implementation date next year, and I ask the Department to loosen its examination of people from those countries in the interim. I recently came across someone from the Czech Republic who was working in Limerick. The person was there legitimately, having applied and done everything by the book. However, he had not received his permit by the time his visa ran out. The only legal and honest route open to him was to leave the country and come back in again. When he did so, he was stopped at immigration, even though he was doing things the honest and open way. The immigration officers in Shannon listened to his employer and, more or less as a favour, allowed him back in. We should not concentrate on those countries over the next year. Let us look at the wider picture and get things moving in that direction. By doing so, we will have a managed policy. We can then argue about its management from here.</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be differences of opinion. There is nothing wrong with that, but at least there is a basis on which we can make our decisions and do business together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this Bill. I am delighted that the Minister has given us such <Col N="468" />a comprehensive overview and understanding of the history involved, as well as where we are going. No one in this House would have thought ten, 15 or 20 years ago that we would speaking about this subject today. What we had been speaking about for years was emigration and parents asking where they could find jobs for their children at home. Now we must manage the workforce that we require to come to this country.</P>
      <P>Speaking as someone who has used the work permit system over recent years and continues to do so, I ask the Minister to examine a few aspects of it. When people hear about exploitation, they sometimes think that it is only by employers. However, the present regime allows for extreme exploitation of permit holders entering the country. If one has to advertise in the morning for a permit holder, that person is living overseas. Irish employers cannot get in touch with such people. An agency from abroad will see the Irish advertisement, contact employers and say there is no charge to them. However, they charge &euro;100 or more per week out of the applicant's wages, perhaps for the first 12 months. I saw it in operation in my own business until two or three years ago when I learnt how to use the system properly. Permit holders were being exploited by their own people, who had come to Ireland, learnt the system and returned with a wad of details on up to 1,000 potential applicants. They would offer to provide an employer with any one of those people. If an employer wished a person with one hand, two hands or even three, they could find such a person for a price. They were charging the permit holder. Such is the level of exploitation.</P>
      <P>It currently takes six to seven working weeks to employ a permit holder in this country. I cannot see why a simple four-page form sent to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with very few questions on it &ndash; there are only about ten, which amounts to very little for any employer to fill in &ndash; should take four to six weeks to be approved. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spoke here about the Refugee Act 1996 and what he wishes to do about non-nationals entering the country. He promises to deal with applicants within five to ten working days, though the information that he must glean and the determination to which he must come are far more onerous. It is the same situation if one wishes to hold on to a permit holder. The process also takes six weeks for an existing permit holder working in this country who wishes to remain for a further 12 months. The Minister should clarify if the suggested grace period will cover people who have applied for a permit six weeks from 16 April or those who have been granted a permit by that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have come to this country have been wonderful. Their work ethic is admirable &ndash; similar, I suppose, to that of the Irish who went abroad in recent decades. Many Irish industries <Col N="469" />would not have functioned over the past few years of tight labour markets without immigrant labour, and it is a good thing that it was available. The Bill and the accompanying explanatory memorandum say that our permit system requirement might be filled by the enlarged European Union, which has ten applicant countries, and that is absolutely possible over the next few years. It will save employers as well as permit applicants themselves the grief of having to wait six weeks. Any employer who goes through this process would prefer to employ an Irish or European Union citizen tomorrow than wait six weeks to find out whether he or she will get a person in. That period must be shortened since it is far too long. Given that the fee is now &euro;500 or &euro;600, no one should have to wait so long for a response from the Minister's Department. I ask him to examine the issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, the provisions of which are timely. It will allow a level playing field for all employers. It is regrettable that there are unscrupulous employers in some sectors who make foreign nationals work very long hours. However, if that is dealt with as a criminal offence, my business and every other will know that, if there are such people working in other companies, at least they are there legitimately, with everyone on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>I speak from real life experience and do not rely on anecdotal evidence. This country's requirement for permit holders will exist for some time to come. I advertised a job recently which carried a salary 20% above the minimum wage, required no experience and was offered in an area of Dublin with a supposedly high rate of unemployment. Of the 23 applicants for the position, only one was from Dublin 15, seven were from other parts of the country while 15 were non-EU nationals who came through agencies which I would like to see taken out of the picture. The Department should permit non-EU nationals to come here on a three month holiday visa to apply for jobs. Agencies are visiting FÁS offices everywhere, taking down lists of the available jobs and charging people for the information. I would rather see a system which allowed people to come here to apply directly to employers. As someone who has watched the current system operate for many years, I am amazed at how long it takes to process applications. It cannot be right that it takes six weeks.</P>
    <P>There are areas in which the Department could fine tune the legislation. I welcome very much the provisions being made which will, for once and for all, put matters on a statutory basis which lets employers and employees know what the rules are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's provisions to give people from the accession countries full access to the labour market in 2004. Its wish to send an unambiguous signal that we <Col N="470" />intend to promote integration from the outset is a positive objective but the safety clause is contradictory in that context and demonstrates an ambiguity about our economic circumstances and an unfair attitude to those involved. In effect, we are saying they are welcome but only if the labour market needs them. They are chips in an economic card game and if things go wrong for us, we will get rid of them. It is not very humane to treat people as economic units rather than as persons who can also contribute to our society culturally and socially.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's speech pointed to contradictions in our employment policy. He admits there is no reason to assume we will be flooded and that previous experience has proved such fears to be unfounded. I accept that an economic downturn is possible but it is wrong to treat people as mere economic units. We should welcome them and promote integration rather than treat them as safety valves if we fail economically. If we do, it will be our fault generally and the Government's, in particular. We will have wasted the opportunities our economic boom provided.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about competitiveness, encouraging foreign investment and the growth of indigenous industry, we should stop cutting back research and development funding at third level. We should avoid threatening to introduce third level fees and do more to make part-time education more accessible and affordable. If we wish to become more competitive and ensure continued growth, why are we cutting back and failing to make improvements in these areas? If we can sustain economic growth, there will be jobs for our own people and a need for others to come here to take up employment. If there is a downturn, the provisions of the Bill will mean that those who come here in 2004 will pay for our mistakes. The Government says we can get rid of community employment schemes because the jobs market is so healthy while introducing all sorts of restrictions in this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has stated her intention to introduce legislation in the near future to address economic migration. I agree that we need an immigration system but the Government has adopted a crisis management approach and failed to take positive steps to construct an open and encouraging framework. It seeks to control the process negatively through a system which criminalises people instead of promoting positive economic policies. There should be a green card system in regard to which the Labour Party has made proposals. The present work permit system means that people are indentured to one employer. They find it difficult to transfer from one work permit to another. There are restrictions in place which the Government should address with comprehensive legislation rather than by reacting to trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" />The question of penalties for employers who employ non-nationals came up during discussions on the Immigration Bill 2002. I do not disagree with penalties for employers but the legislation proposed was heavy-handed. I made the point to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that it was possible an employer might inadvertently employ a non-national whom he or she was not setting out to exploit. It is ironic that I would make such a point to the Minister given recent news. I do not understand the reason penalty provisions which recently featured in the Immigration Bill also feature here. To delete the provisions from the other Bill because the Employment Permits Bill will be passed first is to adopt a very <i>ad hoc</i> approach to law-making. It must be possible to provide for consultation between Departments. The scenario indicates a lack of planning on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>We should welcome those who come to work here and put in place a humane and positive system. The Government has not as yet introduced any such system. I agree with Senators who say those who are here legally and illegally should be treated humanely by Departments.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy John Browne, and express my gratitude to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, for his contribution.</P>
      <P>The Employment Permits Bill 2003 allows for full freedom of access to the labour market by nationals of new EU member states with effect from May 2004. It ensures that on joining the European Union, nationals of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia will no longer require work permits to take up employment in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debates in connection with the second referendum on the Nice treaty the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave commitments in regard to the requirement in this legislation. However, when canvassing for the referendum, I found that people were concerned that we were giving concessions to applicant states which were not being given by other larger member states of the European Union and that our approach was more than generous. An assurance was given at the time, now included in the legislation before the House, that we would have a fail-safe mechanism whereby if we found after a period of time, given the freedom of movement of non-nationals inside the European Union from the new applicant states, that the numbers became very difficult to manage, we could put a brake on the number of applications. Some would say that is putting the cart before the horse. However, I believe the Minister should recon<Col N="472" />sider this and consider putting the fail-safe mechanism in place from day one. We could then assess the number of applications from the applicant states and would not be obliged to accept all applicants, irrespective of their ability to work, interest in getting employment, or the number of vacancies in the economy.</P>
    <P>There is a perception abroad that we have thousands of immigrants and asylum seekers in Ireland. I have checked the figures and found that there are about 39,920 people from the applicant countries already in the Republic of Ireland. That is quite large a number. The number of jobs available should dictate the number of applicants accepted from the day one. If, for instance, there was a concerted campaign to bring in 50,000 people from the applicant countries to flood the employment market here, we would have no opportunity of preventing this. Irrespective of discussions that took place at the time of the referendum, circumstances have changed radically in terms of opportunities, and Ireland is an extremely attractive location for asylum seekers &ndash; there are about 20,000 Romanians in the country, although Romania may not be successful in gaining entry to the European Union, having accepted only 16 of the 31 chapters for accession which must be accepted before 2004.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of the Bill in relation to permits is very acceptable. It is right and proper that there should be control in this regard and that it is being inserted in primary legislation. The restrictions on employers giving employment to those who do not have proper permits are appropriate. The legislation is quite strong from that point of view. Furthermore, permit holders &ndash; there are quite a number in the town and county of Roscommon &ndash; have created opportunities and given tremendous support and assistance to the economy. They are employed in the meat, poultry and catering industries, areas of the economy where it is very difficult to get staff. They are making a contribution to the success of the economy. I accept this fully and very much welcome and respect them in every possible way. As a member of a county council and Member of the Oireachtas, I am always available to listen to any case they make. I also believe it is vital that they are given the best possible conditions of employment in the State when they are here. It is very important that they are respected in every possible way in relation to employment. Most of them are extremely happy and have made homes here and received hospitality from the people.</P>
    <P>The Bill will statutorily control the issue of permits and strengthen the position in relation to employers who take on employees without proper documentation and permits. That is very welcome. No Member of this House would object to the main thrust of the Bill. On Committee Stage, the Minister should look again at the commitments given in relation to the Nice treaty. The people voted for it but they did not vote for it on <Col N="473" />the basis that there would be free access to the Irish market on 1 January 2004. They voted for it on the basis that we would expand and develop our markets in the applicant countries. There is a downside and a plus side. The plus side is the opportunity to expand markets. We let down the applicant countries by voting down the first referendum and did ourselves no favours in terms of marketing our goods in the applicant countries. We have rectified the situation. Our exports will have access to markets in the applicant countries while their exports will have access to the European Union. Ireland will be in a crucial position when it assumes the Presidency of the Union on 1 January 2004. As it will be the first country to welcome the Prime Ministers and Ministers of the applicant countries, it is win, win, for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I must express the concerns of many people, however, that we are being perhaps too generous in the provision of open access to a small economy for the thousands who may come in. We do not know how many will come. Will the floodgates be opened? Wexford &ndash; the whole south-east &ndash; will be one of the first places they will come to and we will have no opportunity of saying, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;. If they are here already, we cannot retrospectively restrict them.</P>

Fianna Fáil is the party which steered through the second referendum on the Nice treaty. It is in favour of European expansion. It used Ireland's membership of the European Union for the benefit of this country. It is clear, however, that we must also protect the interests of the economy and the people.

      <P>This Bill has been brought before the House with what could in other circumstances be referred to as undue haste. It was published on Monday and is here for consideration today. I have been concerned at the haste in which other Bills have been brought before the House without adequate time being given for research purposes. I hope it will not be repeated in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" />I support the Bill because it provides a safeguard for our labour market and is an important legislative initiative. The enlargement of the EU from 15 to 25 states, with the resultant freedom of the citizens of these states to work within the Union without employment permits, will have an as yet unknown effect on our economy, which is in a current state of decline. The Tánaiste has acknowledged that she could be making changes to the Bill if the situation deteriorates further. She has shown a lack of confidence in the economy in statements made in the media. That is disappointing and it sends out the wrong signals.</P>
    <P>It is important that the situation is constantly monitored and that controls be put in place during and after the transitional period from the first day of accession in May 2004. The changing profile of the Irish labour force in recent years, with an increased presence not only of EU workers but also of migrant workers from outside the Union, has been necessitated by our changing economic profile. These people have brought a range of skills and strengths that have added greatly to our overall well-being.</P>
    <P>I welcome the expansion of the EU, with the resultant broadening of the European base. I sincerely hope that the current split within Europe may pass and that the expanded Union will work to solidify our common goals. I am concerned that the future of Europe could be threatened by the war in Iraq.</P>

I welcome them and other applicant states into the European Union because their entry will be mutually beneficial. They regard Ireland as one of the most pro-EU countries in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The blame for the blip that occurred during the first referendum on Nice rests with the Fianna Fáil-PD Government for not presenting the facts properly to the people. Luckily, Fine Gael took over and organised a proper campaign which ensured that accurate facts were delivered to the electorate. The people trusted Fine Gael and my party ensured that the treaty was ratified at the second attempt. The party has been complimented for the stance it adopted and the manner in which the case was argued. Former Taoisigh <Col N="476" />such as Garret Fitzgerald and John Bruton threw their weight behind the second referendum.</P>

      <P>This is acknowledged throughout Europe and by the applicant states. I predict that in the not too distant future it will also be acknowledged by the Irish electorate who will dump the current Government and hopefully replace it with a Fine Gael-led Administration.</P>
      <P>As a country that saw unprecedented emigration in the not too distant past, people here are familiar with the notion of working outside their own country. We should have a positive attitude to a free access policy within Europe. However, without the ability to foretell future growth or decline, it is imperative to put measures in place to protect our workforce. Work permits must be reintroduced if circumstances change.</P>

      <P>During the second debate on the Nice treaty, I met people from eastern European countries who found it very difficult to understand how a country like Ireland, with its history and the challenges that confronted it over the centuries, would not welcome those countries into the family of nations. We are all familiar with the names of the applicant states often because they are associated with sad periods of history. Mention of Czechoslovakia or Poland was generally in the context of oppression. Many of those countries suffered the worst excesses of communism, but they still retained their sense of independence and a vision that one day they would have control of their own destinies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a young state but an old nation. We should remember the base of deprivation from which this country began. We depended on other nations to come to our aid and to show solidarity. <Col N="477" />The very word &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; is associated with Poland. We should remember the troubles and trials its people endured. It was thought at the time that theirs was an impossible task and that they would never break loose from the grip of the oppressor, but they succeeded in doing so.</P>
    <P>It is the fight after freedom has been achieved that is the most difficult of all. People need to be encouraged and given a sense of hope. They must be given the support to help themselves. Many emerging countries do not fulfil their expectations as quickly as they may wish. That was true in Ireland's case. The decades immediately after independence and after the excitement of gaining control of our own destiny were difficult.</P>
    <P>Much of our infrastructure had been destroyed and there was the legacy of dependence which results from a country being occupied. We must refer to that background in this context.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Nice treaty I always explained to friends from eastern European countries that Ireland was not being unsupportive or unhelpful. This legislation underlines that fact. The similarities, in many senses, have been mentioned. We appear to have a similar focus on quality of life. We have many of the same traditions which we had to keep intact against all the difficulties. Because we are far removed from each other and because of the political situation it has not always been possible to develop the relationships we would have liked during the years. I visited many eastern bloc countries before the fall of communism and it was obvious, even though the people had to conform, that they never accepted the situation in which they found themselves.</P>
    <P>We must demonstrate to our own people that many of their fears are not correct. We are talking about fine dedicated people who want to be part of the family of nations. We should not characterise them as if they were coming as beggers, lacking in education and not equal to ourselves. That would be a very wrong message in which we all have a role to play. The language we use, the manner in which we debate the issue and the efforts we make to interact when they come to this country are important. Let us demonstrate their worth because they have much to contribute. They are able in many ways to encourage us to maintain our own culture and traditions. Wherever they provide employment or services, they will be able to compete with any at home because of their background and because they welcome opportunities.</P>
    <P>People are very critical at times and try to minimise how good America was to us. It was particularly good to us in the most difficult years. We have highlighted some of the difficulties Irish emigrants experienced but in the end they were very successful, both in the creation of wealth and the part they played in the Legislature and international affairs while based in America. We should not underestimate the fact that we, too, <Col N="478" />needed help, assistance and acceptance. We have that tradition in Ireland and must be careful to respond to it.</P>
    <P>If we look at the labour market in Ireland, there are still difficulties in many areas in getting people to fill particular jobs. I have had direct experience of this. We recently found it difficult to employ two extra staff because there was no interest in the work. This is also true in the catering area in which many non-Irish nationals are employed. My experience of them is that they are courteous, helpful and anxious to do a good job. What more do we want? </P>
    <P>The negativity associated with the Nice treaty debate always worried me. The countries concerned will overcome the challenges. They will surmount the deprivation and eventually be international trading partners. It is important for us to forge relationships with them, even for purely mercenary reasons, because we will want them as trading partners. If we leave a legacy of misunderstanding that in some way we did not want to be part of their development, we will suffer in a trading sense. There will be other countries which will step into the breach at that time. We were lucky that for more than a decade we had been interacting with communities within them. We have exchanged delegations on many occasions and had many cultural and social exchanges. There was a knowledge of Ireland. It is not as if we were a small peripheral player. In many ways they looked to us for answers during the years. We are lucky, therfore, to have created that relationship with them.</P>
    <P>The legislation we are debating states clearly where we stand. It will no longer be a matter of people feeling they are not welcome or there is some illegality attached to their being here. We are accepting them as full partners in the European Community. Never before was European solidarity more necessary. This is an opportunity for us to put down a marker. Ireland was pro-European before there was a European Union. We interacted with European countries through the centuries, which explains our current status. It shows once again that we are a mature state and an ancient nation. It is important that this message goes out. I compliment the Government on the speed with which it introduced the legislation and how well crafted it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a lot of what Senator Ó Murchú said and disagree with the tenor of what Senator Leyden had to say. I am concerned about the use of words such as &ldquo;floodgates&rdquo; and &ldquo;being too generous&rdquo;. This proposal is in our national interest. There are two aspects to the Bill, both of which I welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It makes sense to establish a right of entry for new citizens of the European Union from the date they join. This move will benefit Ireland. There will be more referendums and if we are to win them, we must point out the benefits. I was <Col N="479" />an illegal worker in Europe in the 1950s. I do not think young people recognise the benefits we get from the European Union. We must, therefore, take every opportunity to declare them. Such a privilege is likely to be of greatest benefit to the new countries in the early years before they have an opportunity to build their economies to the point where they can provide full employment for their citizens. I welcome the legislation from that point of view. I also welcome it because it makes good economic sense to have a united Europe with free movement of labour.</P>
    <P>The other main plank of the Bill relates to those who will still be subject to the work permit regime, in other words, people from outside the EU area. If we are not careful in this regard, what happened to Turkish workers in Germany in the past 48 years could happen here. They were called &ldquo;guest&rdquo; workers who never assimilated because they were told they could work in the country, that they would be used while they were needed and, as soon as they were not needed, that they would be sent home. We have taken steps to ensure we are protected if there is a downturn in the economy in the first couple of years. I hope we will not have to use this clause but it is wise to include it.</P>
    <P>I have one concern which the Minister of State may be able to answer. What will happen to someone who comes here to work and cannot do so? Will they be able to avail of social welfare benefits in the first couple of years? Does the generosity to which Senator Leyden referred extend to this aspect?</P>
    <P>If we are to sell ourselves to the rest of Europe and sell the benefits of Europe to our citizens to ensure their support in future referenda on European Union treaties, we must show the benefits we get from being members of the Union. This means welcoming the applicant countries as member states and making their citizens feel welcome here. There are economic benefits to this approach. It makes sense in a balanced economy to fill vacancies at the best price. This argument is not always easy to understand. If we are to be economically successful we must ensure value for money in the products and services we produce and in the jobs we offer.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú and others referred to the difficulties in getting employment, even in terms of securing applications for well paid jobs. I am pleased to note in recent years that while Irish people are not prepared to take up some forms of low paid employment, others are. Some jobs do not exist if the rate is too high. Petrol pump attendants were phased out because it was no longer economical to employ people to serve petrol. Self-service stations became the norm. That trend may make sense, not only in garages but also in other areas. However, we should seek to ensure that these types of jobs continue to exist and that Irish people are encouraged to work in <Col N="480" />them. If that is not possible we should welcome others in Europe who may wish to fill any vacancies.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill. The precautions taken by the Minister indicate a recognition of the dangers and that the necessary steps will be taken to address them should they arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. J. Browne Mr. J. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minster of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, who had to attend an important function. I thank Senators for their contributions to this important debate.</P>
      <P>I am happy the Government has decided to facilitate freedom of movement for the purpose of work by nationals from what will be the new European Union member states with effect from May 2004. This will help to strengthen further the mutual benefits to be gained by Irish society and by nationals of the accession states in the economic field. It will also put on a more secure footing the movement of persons for work from central and eastern Europe that has occurred in recent years. This will be of benefit to both employers and employees concerned.</P>
      <P>The safeguard provisions should serve to reassure those who might be concerned at the prospect that migration flows may be sufficient to cause a disturbance in the labour market at a later stage. We will have the same safeguard options as other member states in a similar position. I am sure Senators will agree that this is a good time to remedy the defects in the existing legal basis covering the granting of employment permits. At present no effective penalty can be imposed on an employer who knowingly employs a person in respect of whom a permit is needed or where such a permit has not been obtained.</P>
      <P>While there is general welcome for the Bill, concerns have been expressed about various aspects. I am sure that on Committee Stage, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will consider some of the suggestions made. Like the rest of us, she does not have a monopoly of wisdom on the best way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan raised a number of points. Employment law will be enforced in all cases. After EU enlargement, recruitment from the wider world should mainly be confined to skilled labour. This will reduce the possibility of exploitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Morrissey and others referred to the exploitation of the work permits system. Concentrating most of our immigration needs within the enlarged EU should reduce the capacity for exploitation by charging for permits. In this regard, problems with the processing time was referred to. At present more than 1,000 permits a week are processed. Although the economy is <Col N="481" />slowing, there is an increasing demand for permits, from 3,000 applications in January 2002 to 4,000 in January 2003.</P>
    <P>However, employers will have to undertake forward planning. It is the Department's intention to revert to a pattern of issuing permits within 15 working days. As public representatives we will always be subject to pressure from employers seeking overnight decisions. However, given the huge number of applications to the Department it is practically impossible to proceed on that basis. In my constituency there is a huge influx of migratory workers, especially in the summer, when there is a heavy demand for labour in the soft fruit industry and other areas. Applications are usually left to the last moment. While permits will be granted, employers, especially in the fruit industry, should apply in time. Otherwise everybody will be blamed if permits are not granted when required.</P>
    <P>While work permits for truck drivers are granted, insurance for the drivers is often not provided because a driver's licence does not comply with Irish licence requirements. This is an example of the kinds of delays inherent in the process. They must be addressed. There should be less bureaucracy and more openness.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy expressed her unease about the safeguard clause. There is nothing in the legislation that provides for the expulsion of non-nationals if there is an economic downturn. However, it is prudent to be able to regulate new entrants in such circumstances. Senator Tuffy also referred to the introduction of a green card system. The case for Ireland requiring it is not proven, but the Government has an open mind. We should be able to meet most of our needs from within an enlarged European Union. In debating issues of this kind we sometimes tend to forget that Ireland is a member state.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry expressed concerns about medical personnel and recruitment to the universities. Medical personnel can get working visas and authorisations outside the country without delay. They do not need work permits. The Department has reached agreement with the conference of the heads of Irish universities on the position of academic staff and researchers. There will be a more open and streamlined system in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole talked about the managed system. It is not sacrosanct but may change. The work permit system is flexible and reflects general European practice. This differs from the policies of the settlement countries such as Canada and Australia. Further change is not ruled out in this area. We will inform employers that we are obliged by the treaty to give preference to nationals of accession countries between now and the accession time.</P>
    <P>The Minister will go into more detail on Committee Stage. I thank the Senators for their contributions today. We look forward to a continued enlightened debate on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2002: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry in Ireland. The financial services industry plays a major role in the economy, giving as it does direct employment to about 50,000 people and providing the wide range of services and products that are so vital in a modern economy. As the industry has changed and grown during the years, there have been considerable changes in the legal and regulatory framework to keep pace.</P>
      <P>In recent years the distinctions between banking, building societies and insurance have become blurred at the edges. Firms in each of these sectors are increasingly active in overlapping markets. Banks have moved into areas of insurance and the provision of mortgages. Life insurance companies are now strongly focused on long-term savings products. A complex mix of intermediaries also operate in the market. As the sector becomes more and more integrated, regulation needs to take a more integrated approach.</P>
      <P>The Government has recognised that the regulation of the financial services sector has not been helped by the multiplicity of regulatory bodies with differing regulatory powers and functions. In a small country like Ireland there is a powerful case from both an effectiveness and efficiency perspective for building a critical mass of skills relating to financial regulation in a single location. This is particularly the case because of the increasing complexity of risk management throughout the financial sector.</P>
      <P>In the regulation of banking, insurance and investment firms fundamental changes are under way internationally in response which will change the way regulation is done. The skills required of regulators will expand dramatically. We need a centre of expertise in Ireland where those skills can be developed. The Government does not intend to wait until after the Basle II exercise in the banking sector and the Solvency II process in the insurance sectors are complete before recognising and acting on this. We wish to act now to restructure regulation in order that the expertise can be in place as the new regulatory approach emerges internationally over the next four to five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach the Government has decided to <Col N="483" />adopt builds on the view of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, as set out in its report, Review of Banking Policy: The Regulation and Supervision of Financial Institutions, of July 1998. The committee stated it believed a single, independent, regulatory authority should be established and given supervisory powers in relation to all commercial, friendly and voluntary bodies which handle funds or financial transactions, including electronic transactions, on behalf of third parties or other institutions in Ireland. In 1998 the Government agreed, in principle, to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector and established an implementation advisory group &ndash; known as the McDowell group &ndash; to advise it on how this could be achieved. This Bill has drawn very heavily, though not entirely, on the work of the group.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the structure adopted by the Government will work well because it will provide a one-stop-shop for consumers, business and the financial services industry by having the regulation of insurance, banking and credit unions under the one roof; facilitate the proper co-ordination of the complementary functions of prudential regulation and consumer protection; place the interests of consumers at the heart of financial services regulation by giving the authority specific responsibilities in this regard and creating a statutory position of consumer director; provide an effective framework for Ireland to meet its obligations under the statute of the European system of central banks; and provide for the operational autonomy and direct accountability of the new authority in relation to the bulk of its regulatory tasks.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with a more detailed description of the Bill. Its main purposes are to provide for the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority within the overall new structure of the Central Basic and Financial Services Authority of Ireland; to assign functions to the new authority as the single regulator for the financial services sector &ndash; this will provide a one-stop-shop by having the regulation of insurance, investment intermediaries, banking and credit unions as well as certain other functions under the one roof; to strengthen the consumer focus of regulation by giving the authority specific responsibilities in this regard and creating a statutory position of consumer director; and to establish the Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The broad structure of the Bill is as follows. Part 1 contains the short title of the Bill and provisions for the commencement of the measure. Part 2 provides for the amendment of the Central Bank Act 1942 for the purposes of reorganising and renaming the Central Bank of Ireland. This Part, in addition to amending and repealing the text of the 1942 Act, as appropriate, inserts additional Parts and Schedules into the 1942 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" />The provisions relating to the regulatory authority are set out in a new Part IIIA of the 1942 Act to be inserted by section 26 of the Bill. Chapter 1 of this new Part provides for the constitution, functions and powers of the authority. Chapter 2 provides for the statutory position of consumer director; while Chapter 3 provides for the appointment of the Registrar of Credit Unions.</P>
    <P>A new Part IIIB of the 1942 Act contains certain provisions relating to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and its constituent parts, including the new disclosure of information requirements. Part VIIA of the 1942 Act, as inserted by section 28 of the Bill, is divided into five Chapters and deals with the Financial Services Appeals Tribunal. Section 29 on page 97 inserts a new Part VIIIA into the 1942 Act and sets out the provisions for making regulations and orders under the Act.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill amends the 1942 Act by amending and inserting additional Schedules into the Act. There are also three Schedules to the Bill. Schedule 1 sets out the consequential amendments to other Acts; Schedule 2 sets out the consequential amendments to the European Communities regulations, while Schedule 3 specifies the savings and transitional provisions which have effect.</P>
    <P>At the heart of what is proposed in the Bill is the establishment of a new entity &ndash; the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority &ndash; as a constituent part of a new Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, known as &ldquo;the Bank&rdquo;. The new authority will manage the regulation of financial institutions in Ireland. In essence, it is to take on and develop the financial services supervisory functions of the Bank and, in addition, take on the regulation of credit unions and the insurance sector as well as consumer protection functions.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the main provisions of the Bill as they relate to the regulatory authority. The authority will be established under the proposed new section 33B of the principal Act and will operate as a constituent part of the new bank. However, it will have its own chairperson, chief executive and consumer director, and up to seven other members, and will have independent functions. The non-executive members will be appointed by the Minister for Finance following consultation with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the chairperson will be appointed by the Minister for Finance from among these members and the chairperson, chief executive and some authority members will also be members of the board of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. The authority will have its own budget. It will submit its annual report to the Minister for Finance, who will lay it before each House of the Oireachtas and, in recognition of the unique role played by credit unions in Irish society, a separate statutory <Col N="485" />post of Registrar of Credit Unions is also provided for.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the Minister appointed an interim authority, on a non-statutory basis, on 16 April 2002, the chairperson of which is Mr. Brian Patterson. The role of the interim authority includes the selection of a chief executive for the IFSRA, working with the chief executive-designate and advising and assisting the Ministers concerned and the Central Bank in preparing for the establishment of the regulatory authority. The work of the interim authority will help ensure that a smooth transition to the new regulatory arrangements takes place as soon as possible. The posts of chief executive-designate and consumer director were filled recently on an interim basis after an open competitive process facilitated by independent executive search consultants. It is the Minister's intention that the members of the interim authority will form the new regulatory authority when it has been established under this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is essential for the new regulatory authority to be properly and adequately funded if it is to be able to fully exercise its powers and functions. The McDowell group considered this issue and favoured funding by industry. Accordingly, the Bill gives the chief executive of the authority, with the agreement of the authority, power to make regulations to impose levies. However, these regulations can only come into effect if they have been approved by the Minister for Finance. There will be a consultation process to consider the fee or levy structure. If it should happen that the funds raised from the fees and levies imposed prove to be inadequate for the authority to perform its functions, the bank may provide the authority with funds to meet any shortfall.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the vital issue of consumer protection. The McDowell group gave detailed consideration to the questions of prudential regulation and consumer protection. It recommended that the single regulatory authority, SRA, should be given statutory responsibility for prudential regulation and for consumer issues relating to financial institutions. The group also recommended that responsibility for approval of bank charges should be transferred to the SRA and that a statutory position of consumer protection director should be established within the SRA.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the consumer director will have the lead role in the exercise by the regulatory authority of the consumer functions transferring from the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, as well as various other new and existing functions. The provisions contained in the Bill reflect this intention, particularly the requirement that the consumer director will be a member of the regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>The responsibilities of the consumer director are provided for in the Bill. In essence, they are to monitor the provision of financial services to consumers and also to exercise important con<Col N="486" />sumer protection powers under the Consumer Credit Act, the Investment Intermediaries Act, the Stock Exchange Act and Central Bank and insurance legislation. The Bill also sets out the reporting arrangements, etc., of the consumer director. In this regard, I draw the attention of Senators to the new section 33V(6), which will be inserted into the principal Act by section 26 of the Bill and which provides that the consumer director can report directly to the regulatory authority on any matter.</P>
    <P>The new section 33C(3) to the principal Act explicitly states that the mandate of the regulatory authority is to promote the best interests of users of financial services in a way that is consistent with the orderly and proper functioning of financial markets and with the orderly and prudent supervision of providers of those services. Therefore, the regulatory authority and its consumer director will have a strong consumer mandate which will encompass the following: monitoring the provision of financial services to consumers and monitoring the extent to which competition exists among providers of financial services in so far as it affects consumers of those services; increasing public awareness of the availability, costs, risks and benefits of financial services; issuing and enforcing codes of conduct, regulations, directions, etc., to financial services providers with regard to the conditions under which they provide services to customers &ndash; namely, advertising, information to customers, terms of contracts, cooling off periods etc.; control and monitoring of customer charges, other than interest rates, imposed by credit institutions and <i>bureaux de change</i>; licensing of moneylenders, including approval of the interest rates charged; compensation arrangements in respect of financial services providers who cannot meet their obligations to customers; and promoting, in general, the best interests of users of financial services. In addition, a second Bill will provide for an ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints against financial institutions and a consultative panel for consumers of financial services</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the post of Registrar of Credit Unions. At present, the Registrar of Friendly Societies has responsibility, among other things, for the general regulation and financial supervision of credit unions. The McDowell group recognised the valuable contribution and the unique role of credit unions in Irish society, about which I fully agree. The annual report of the Registrar of Friendly Societies for 2000 &ndash; the latest available &ndash; shows that there were some 438 credit unions in Ireland as at 31 December 2000.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement is characterised by a large number of quite small, community-based credit unions providing fairly limited services to their members. However, credit unions, as a group, are a significant player in the financial services market. Some individual credit unions have <Col N="487" />grown into quite large operations which are now significant providers of services of a financial nature. More than 50 credit unions had assets exceeding &euro;25 million according to the 2000 annual report. It has been reported that there are currently around 2 million members and assets of almost &euro;7 billion.</P>
    <P>The McDowell group considered that all financial service providers should, in principle, be dealt with by a single regulatory authority and that a compelling case would have to be made for the exclusion of any provider from its remit. In regard to the credit unions, the group recommended that the approach which would best address the unique characteristics of the credit union movement would be to have the existing functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies, in relation to credit unions, brought into the single regulatory authority. The group considered that this should be done in a manner that would recognise and be supportive of the uniqueness of credit unions and also give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of a single regulatory authority, while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise.</P>
    <P>The McDowell group recommended that these concerns should be addressed by the establishment of a statutory position of Registrar of Credit Unions within the single regulatory authority. The Bill provides for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the McDowell report and is consistent with recommendations of the World Council of Credit Unions that credit unions should be regulated by the same entity as the wider financial sector.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Irish League of Credit Unions has had a concern that by placing the registrar within the regulatory authority structure, there would be an implication that they would be regulated in the same way as much larger financial institutions. This is not the case. However, officials and the Minister had intensive discussions with the ILCU and the Bill was amended in the Dáil to copperfasten the requirement that the authority must deal with them in a manner which has regard to their special nature and the particular legislation that applies to them.</P>
    <P>In his statement to the Dáil in July 2002 in relation to the report of the inspectors appointed to inquire into the affairs of Ansbacher (Cayman) Limited, the Minister referred to the constraints on banking regulators arising from the confidentiality provisions contained in EU and national legislation. He stated that it was his intention to make significant change in the area of confidentiality by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Bill. These proposals are contained in section 33AK to be inserted in the principal Act. The emphasis of this section, as inserted into the Bill during Committee Stage in the Dáil, is on the obligation to disclose information to other statu<Col N="488" />tory bodies where there is a suspicion that the law is being broken.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of this section is the core provision. It stipulates that the bank must report to the relevant authority &ndash; for example, the Garda, the Revenue Commissioners or the Director of Corporate Enforcement &ndash; if it comes across any information that leads it to suspect that a criminal offence or a breach of the Companies Acts or the Competition Act has been committed. The bank need not report if it is satisfied that the institution concerned has reported the information to the relevant authority. As tax evasion and failure to report money laundering of the proceeds of tax evasion are criminal offences, Senators will readily appreciate the significance of this provision in light of the DIRT and Ansbacher investigations.</P>
    <P>I now turn to another element of the group of recommendations contained in the McDowell report. The group agreed that, where functions are being transferred to the single regulatory authority, relevant enforcement powers which relate to those functions should also be vested in the authority. The group considered that the ability of the single regulatory authority to regulate any financial market without being able to impose civil sanction to enforce the same would result in ineffective regulation. The group recommended that, in the first instance, the single regulatory authority should have power to impose sanctions on a financial services provider for breach of the relevant regulatory code. The group also identified a need to set up an appeals system for financial institutions which wished to appeal against the imposition of such sanctions</P>
    <P>The group recommended that a tribunal should be established at the outset of the new regulatory arrangements and that this should be facilitated by the inclusion of the necessary provisions for the establishment of the tribunal in the legislation providing for the establishment of the SRA. Accordingly, the Bill contains provisions for the establishment and operation of the Financial Services Appeals Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for procedures for hearing and determining appeals. It also provides for references and appeals to the High Court and for other miscellaneous matters relating to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the IFSRA will draw the majority of its initial staff from the regulatory departments of the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, including the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Registrar of Friendly Societies. The Bill provides for the permanent transfer of staff from the Department to the new authority, subject to their agreement. The staff of the entity, whether working in the IFSRA or elsewhere, will be employees of the reorganised bank, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. The board of the bank is required, with the agreement of the chief executive of the regu<Col N="489" />latory authority, to arrange for employees of the bank to be assigned to the authority. These provisions should ensure the authority will operate effectively and efficiently from the outset.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the McDowell report contained a package of recommendations in regard to financial regulation. The Bill deals mainly with the establishment of the IFSRA. The Minister for Finance intends to publish a second Bill later this year to implement the remainder of the recommendations contained in the McDowell report. The main provisions to be included in the second Bill are to establish a statutory financial services ombudsman; to establish consultative panels of the financial services industry and consumers; to address issues arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the review group on auditing; and to make additional provisions for codes of practice by the new authority and the penalties applicable where the codes are breached.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two basic points in conclusion. The Bill is concerned essentially with putting in place the basic structures for regulation and part of a package of measures rather than stand-alone legislation. As regards the basic structures for regulation, I am confident that the new structures provided for in the Bill give us the best of all worlds. On the one hand, there is a new regulatory authority &ndash; the IFSRA &ndash; with a clear consumer mandate, and, on the other, there is an organic linkage to the authority responsible for stability and monetary issues. There is also a structure in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland which facilitates efficient use of resources and mobility of staff. The Bill also provides for clear accountability, both within the new structures and to the Oireachtas. The measures incorporated in it and the proposed second Bill will together lead to more efficient regulation, with a stronger consumer focus than heretofore. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am vehemently opposed to this Bill which proposes to include two conflicting interests in one umbrella authority, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. The fact that &ldquo;regulatory&rdquo;, the operative word, is included in the authority's name is a clear acknowledgement of where its key emphasis will lie. It is obvious that the new authority will have a focus on regulation, as it will be an adjunct to the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although some institutions have slipped through the net, the Central Bank has been quite successful as a regulatory authority. The most glaring instance of a financial institution slipping through the net is Enron but I can also cite the Allfirst and Ansbacher examples. I welcome the measures announced by the Minister today to ensure there is greater regulation in cases like Ansbacher which is the subject of ongoing delib<Col N="490" />erations in another forum. Certain financial irregularities received a great deal of attention at the time but have slipped from the memory of people other than investors who lost money. Hundreds of innocent investors lost money as a result of the Tony Taylor affair, for example. Many pensioners who invested pensions and gratuities on the understanding their investments were secure lost money that they had put away for a rainy day.</P>
    <P>While the Central Bank has had a reasonably good record in relation to the regulation and supervision of the prudential sector, it has a poor record in the area of consumer protection. Its primary focus has been on ensuring the maximum solvency of the financial institutions which come within its remit. The key barometer in determining whether a financial institution is healthy, solvent and secure is its profits. Such institutions do not make apologies for the fact that their interest in taxation matters and consumer interests is negligible or non-existent. Perhaps I should revise my comment that they have little interest in taxation &ndash; there was quite a degree of whinging from the banks when a paltry levy of &euro;300 million was foisted on them in last December's budget.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is being asked to take on a new function and area of responsibility. It is being asked to protect the interests of consumers, despite the fact that this area has been almost alien to it in the context of its prudential responsibilities. Such a role is alien to it, given that it has acknowledged that its core responsibilities lie elsewhere. It has been argued vehemently and cogently in the Dáil that the two areas do not sit easily together and I share this opinion. In such a competing situation which interest will take precedence? I suspect that the Central Bank's regulatory role will inevitably win the day. The two interests are poles apart &ndash; they are diametrically opposed &ndash; and driven by two imperatives.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has observed the performance of the Director of Consumer Affairs could not be unimpressed by her fearless and determined stand in taking on some of the strongest and mightiest organisations in the interests of the consumer. Under this Bill, however, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is to be subsumed into the new IFSRA which, in turn, is to be a subsidiary of the Central Bank. I note the Minister of State's comment that the Government hopes and intends the director will take a leading role in the new authority. I would like to believe this but I do not think I can as the director is to be one of a number of people on the authority under the aegis and vigilant supervision of the Central Bank. It will be a case of Big Brother.</P>
    <P>One of the strange aspects of the Bill is the length of time it took to reach this House. It was discussed on Second Stage in the Dáil on 18 June 2002, nine months ago. I do not know what happened in terms of what one might call legislative digestion but nothing has happened to the Bill <Col N="491" />since last June other than the fact that it has been ploughed through Committee, Report and Final Stages in the other House. It has arrived in the Seanad in the dying days of March 2003. In the Dáil last June the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>This Bill deals mainly with the establishment of IFSRA. I intend to publish a second Bill later this year to implement the remainder of the recommendations contained in the McDowell report. The main provisions to be included in the second Bill are to establish a statutory financial services ombudsman; establish consultative panels of the financial services industry and of consumers; address issues arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the review group on auditing; and make provisions arising from a review of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 dealing with confidentiality of Central Bank information. I must stress, therefore, that this Bill is, first, concerned essentially with structures and, second, is part of a package of measures rather than stand-alone legislation.</P>
    <P>Nine months later there is no sign of the legislation which the Minister promised would be published before the end of 2002. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said today that the second Bill would be brought forward &ldquo;later this year&rdquo;&ndash; he used the exact same term that the Minister for Finance used in the Dáil in June 2002. When will it be brought forward? Can the Minister of State give a definitive deadline for when the legislation which has been promised as part of the process of allaying people's fears will be introduced? What happened to it? Where were the draftspeople? Why was there a rethink? What is the revised publication date? Why was it decided not to introduce a single consolidated Bill containing all the provisions of this Bill and the other promised and long overdue Bill? It does not make sense that two separate Bills will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>The refusal of the Minister to take cognisance of an excellent report commissioned by the Oireachtas committee which strongly advocated moving responsibility for consumer protection to a dedicated, independent Director of Consumer Affairs does not make sense either. The Central Bank actually suggested that all the functions it previously had in respect of consumer credit should be given to the director. It does not regard itself as having a role in consumer protection.</P>
    <P>The merging of consumer protection with prudential regulation under the overall aegis of the Central Bank which has disavowed any interest in consumer affairs is manifestly not in the best interests of the consumer. I am very much on the side of the consumer on this issue. While the Director of Consumer Affairs has undoubtedly rattled some cages in the process of protecting the consumer, there are glaring problems that have <Col N="492" />to be addressed urgently. For example, there is appallingly sparse information on financial products. Legislation was promised to address this. It would involve a stand-alone Bill which we have not seen. We have to acknowledge that the director is grappling with the issue but still has a considerable distance to go.</P>
    <P>Car insurance serves as another example. Apart from its grossly excessive cost, how many of us have received notification from our insurance companies seven days before the expiry dates of our policies that our insurance payments are due within seven days? This gives one no opportunity to shop around. The entire insurance industry, not only car insurance companies, is operating as a cosy cartel. The companies decide on a price structure and there is absolutely no competition in the market. They have one over a barrel and should provide one with, say, a three week period within which one can shop around for a better price. Stand-alone legislation could be introduced to address this area of gross abuse.</P>
    <P>The issues of bank interest and borrowing should be addressed. One must acknowledge that interest rates on loans, including mortgages, have decreased. In spite of progress in this regard, bank profits in Ireland are double those in other countries. The McDowell report is the font of all wisdom. I have read it and, as the Minister will know, it includes a section comparing Ireland with other jurisdictions. It examined the kinds of regimes that operated in 19 countries in terms of consumer interest and the prudential sector. It emerged that 16 of the 19 countries had shied away from the merger of regulation with consumer interest. As they did not regard it as the appropriate model, why should we introduce it here?</P>
    <P>One of the most bewildering aspects of the report is that, after having found that 16 of 19 countries did not favour the model, it recommended that the kind of agency proposed in this legislation was appropriate for this country. I do not see how one can accommodate two diametrically opposed interests in the one authority, one dealing with regulation of the prudential sector and the other dealing with consumer interest. It should be a case of, &ldquo;Ne'er the twain shall meet&rdquo;. I am in favour of one-stop-shops but the one-stop-shop proposed in the Bill makes no sense whatsoever. Therefore, I oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. The decision on the regulatory authority was one of the most difficult and important made by the previous Government, and today's debate partly reflects the one which took place over two or three years. It was a very important decision and held up for some time until the Government clarified the direction in which it wanted to go. As an observer in a previous capacity, without having been involved directly, I was always of the view that one could <Col N="493" />not separate the regulatory and consumer protection functions. Senator Higgins said the two were at opposite poles but I am not sure that is true. The worst prejudice to the consumer is if a financial institution collapses and he or she loses money.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that legislation of this importance is not rushed through both Houses. One has to move carefully. It may be true that other much larger countries have adopted different models but we must ask what suits a country of this size with its specific culture. The legislation provides the correct answer to this problem. There is no doubt that regulation was very dispersed with sections of Departments such as the old Department of Industry and Commerce and its more recent manifestations having roles to play. There is merit in bringing the functions together.</P>
      <P>The legislation gives a new role to the Central Bank which has devolved upwards some of its functions to the European Central Bank, although it is still important to have expert monitors and advisers to Government, both on input and the implications of the European Central Bank's decisions. Given the increasingly complicated and sophisticated world of finance, expertise needs to be developed. In the general Civil Service staff inevitably move from section to section, thus not staying sufficiently long in particular roles to gain expertise. Therefore, it is correct to transfer the responsibility from the Civil Service proper to the new, expanded authority.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins quoted the Central Bank giving evidence that it had not been involved in consumer protection. That may be true of the existing Central Bank, but the legislation provides for a new authority &ndash; it will, to a certain degree, be a hybrid authority &ndash; that will assume responsibility for this function.</P>
      <P>The IFSC has grown in the past 15 years. It has been a tremendous success and one of the things it has praised is the fact that we have light but effective regulation in this country. A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> referred to it as a &ldquo;global entrepreneurship monitor&rdquo; and praised the Government's pro-business strategy. The article also stated that, in terms of regulatory functionality, Ireland is fifth among industrialised countries. The Bill will further improve the position in this regard.</P>
      <P>For a country of Ireland's size, there is huge merit in having a one-stop shop system. In the early years, the IFSC was, <i>de facto</i>, facilitated with a kind of one-stop shop system through IDA Ireland. There are approximately 50,000 people employed in the financial sector, although probably no more than 20% of them are employed at the IFSC or are connected with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It makes good sense to establish an interim authority in order that any teething problems can be ironed out. It is good that the financial industry will be the principal beneficiary of the legis<Col N="494" />lation. Companies involved in the industry need a respected regulatory framework to allow them to function and make profits and it is correct that the authority should, in the main, be funded by the industry. It is easy to criticise banks in respect of the profits they make, but healthy banking institutions are needed. That does not mean that one necessarily endorses all charges levied by banks. For example, in many cases the normal overdraft charge has remained constant at 10% or 11% at a time when there has been an overall drop in interest rates.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Central Bank's report, which was issued yesterday. There were a number of demands on the Order of Business that certain matters covered in the report should be debated. This is one of the opportunities to do so. What the report has to say about inflation is particularly significant. There have been some suggestions that inflation is rising and if one takes the figure for last month in isolation, that is true. However, inflation is on a downward trend and that is confirmed in the report. In that context, the report cites significantly reduced pay increases, indications of pay restraint in sectors facing competitive pressures, weaker demand and falling rents and states that income growth has been subdued. It is also stated in the report that there are signs that inflation is easing.</P>
    <P>The report further states &ndash; this will be relevant to the debate on social partnership &ndash; that &ldquo;The prospects for a further deceleration in wage inflation in 2003 have been improved by the relatively modest wage increases proposed under the new national wage agreement.&rdquo; Even in the case of the housing sector, it has a positive view on recent developments and states:</P>
    <P>.&nbsp;the removal of the first-time buyers grant will reduce demand in this sector and the emergence of excess supply in the rental market will restrain investor demand. In line with risks for the economy in general, the balance of risk in the housing market is on the down side.</P>
    <P>The report also points out that the decline in headline inflation is somewhat masked by increases in indirect tax rates and certain charges.</P>
    <P>The report contains an interesting assessment of the employment situation. It makes the point &ndash; which has been repeatedly made by Senator Higgins in recent days &ndash; that employment last year was boosted by public sector growth. Obviously that will not be the case in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>It is interesting, in light of conditions improving in the long term, that the report indicates that only 19% of the workforce is engaged in the education, health, public administration and defence sectors. We are ahead of Portugal, Greece and Spain, but behind all other EU partners, in terms of the size of our public service. Sweden is top of the range at 31%. In relative terms, we do not <Col N="495" />have an overly large public service. I accept that our defence forces are small in comparison with those of many of our partners and this may account for some of the difference. Overall, however, we should not be of the opinion that, particularly in comparison with those of other countries, our public service is bloated.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank's average projection for unemployment this year is 5.75%, which is somewhat disappointing. I had hoped it would not rise above 5%. On the financial situation, the bank forecasts that, based on announced plans, the general Government debt will remain at 34% to 35% to 2005. This compares favourably with other countries and provides a sound basis for improvement.</P>
    <P>I hope the new Central Bank will continue to issue its regular reports and that the proposed regularity authority will produce reports on a parallel basis. We have been very well served by the Central Bank. This new legislation will eliminate any ambiguity in regulatory interventions if untoward things happen in the financial sector. What we will have, as a result of this legislation, will be an integrated authority, where, hopefully, the right hand will know what the left hand is doing and where there will be a reasonable degree of co-ordination. The balance of advantage is to have one body, rather than two separate bodies. On that basis, I support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. What a Bill and what a great deal of work its drafting must have involved. I thank the civil servants who have given us some idea of the amendments that were made to it in the Lower House.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with the substantive provisions of the Bill, I wish to protest about the way it has been drafted. The form in which the Bill has come before us makes it a legislative monstrosity. The propensity of the draftsmen to endlessly amend laws, rather than repeal or re-enact them, has always been a major barrier to accessibility. The Bill, the purpose of which is to put in train a fundamental reorganisation of the Central Bank of Ireland, inserts enormous swathes of amendments into an existing Central Bank legislation. The resulting Act will be truly ghastly, unnecessarily difficult and almost impossible to understand. It will require the reader to constantly jump between two different volumes and perform feats of mental gymnastics. I cannot stress too strongly that it does not have to be this way. At best, the Bill is an example of incredibly lazy drafting, while, at worst, it is an attempt to obscure the position and make matters difficult to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arts Bill 2002, which is going through the Oireachtas at present, exemplifies a simpler, clearer and more open solution to the problem of making significant amendments to an existing Act. It repeals the two previous Acts and starts <Col N="496" />over. The benefit of this is that, for the next 30 years or so &ndash; I do not know for how long the new Act will hold sway &ndash; all our arts legislation will be neatly contained in one document and its constituent parts will be readily accessible.</P>
    <P>In contrast, this Bill is a textbook example of how legislation should not be drafted. It will place on the Statute Book a separate Act that will be completely incomprehensible. This will, quite gratuitously, create a barrier to people's understanding of the legislation and will act as an obstacle to those who will have reason to refer to the legislation in the future. The person who conceived of this approach belongs to the era before the strategic management initiative, which was established six or seven years ago. He or she belongs to a culture which believes that members of the public have no right to easy access to the machinery of Government or to the laws by which they are governed. I hope that this is a one-off aberration and is not a signal of a new direction the Government proposes to take in regard to future legislation. The Bill, in its current form, sends a message to the people that they will not welcome.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on this topic by repeating a point which I have made on numerous occasions. If we expect people to take an interest in the political process, we must make it easy for them to do so. We have been criticised for the decrease in the numbers of people who vote in elections. The latter seems to have happened quite regularly in recent times. Various efforts have been made to encourage a higher turnout at elections. We are often criticised and informed that people do not understand or do not take an interest in what happens in the Houses or in the legislation introduced here. When we behave bring in legislation of the sort before us, we make it difficult to encourage them to do so. I urge that this be the last item of legislation to take such a convoluted form.</P>
    <P>The most contentious issue in the Bill is whether the proposed structure for financial regulation is the best route to take. Is the Central Bank the right body to look after the interests of the customers of firms operating in the financial services sector? I have experience of the Central Bank. I am probably one of the few Members who has visited the mint at Sandyford and the Central Bank itself. I did this prior to the euro changeover, when I was a member of a group in Europe which represents retailers. The group was concerned because, as a result of the flexibility of the process, the regulations introduced by the 12 participating nations were different. It wanted to ensure that certain steps would be taken to ensure that the central banks in each country would introduce the euro in a way that would make the changeover work. I was favourably impressed on that visit. The representatives of the Central Bank were receptive and understanding and my Dutch colleague, who was acting on behalf of the retailers, was impressed with its cus<Col N="497" />tomer-driven approach. The fact that the changeover went so well is evidence of that.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about whether the Central Bank is the right body to represent customers. From that point of view, what we are doing is similar to placing responsibility for the Office of Consumer Affairs under the aegis of IBEC. The latter is a producers' and employers' organisation and it is not part of its culture to place the interests of customers first. However, it would be extremely foolish of the members of IBEC to disregard those interests. Similarly, the Central Bank has always been more of a producers', rather than a customers', organisation. Its role has not been to represent the banks, but to regulate them. It has always seen its main job as keeping the banks in business, in order to sustain competition, by protecting them from anything that would threaten their ability to survive. That is right and proper and it is an essential function that the bank has performed very well.</P>
    <P>The limited view the bank takes of its role was highlighted during the DIRT inquiry, when those responsible for running it admitted, quite frankly, that they were aware of what was going on in respect of DIRT but that they did not consider it part of their job to do anything about it. The issue appears to be whether it is possible to join together two such disparate tasks as regulating the financial sector and looking after the customers' interests? I am not sure that it is possible and my instinct is to be rather sceptical about it.</P>
    <P>I will provide an example from the telecommunications sector which may be relevant. When the legislation to establish the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation came before the House, I argued that the role envisaged for the regulator was not active enough to ensure that customers' interests drove the activities of the office. The role as set out in the legislation was essentially one of maintaining a balance between those who wanted to compete in the telecommunications sector. I argued that it should involve actively encouraging competition rather than letting it develop of its own accord. I suggested that perhaps we should not have a regulator but that the State should regulate, drive competition and encourage outside interests to enter the sector because this would be to the benefit of customers.</P>
    <P>I did not win the argument, but I suggest that later events proved me right. The regulator found that her hands were tied because she did not have the power to do what soon transpired to be the obvious and necessary things required. The less than satisfactory situation that exists in the telecommunications sector today &ndash; with high costs, etc. &ndash; is due to the curtailment of the regulator's power in the past five years. It would have been better if we had done things differently and encouraged more competition, rather than merely ensuring that there was a balance between those already operating in the sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" />The Central Bank's traditional role has been to keep the banks in business and ensure competition. I agree with that objective, but we are now expecting the Central Bank to make life difficult for the commercial banks by taking the customer's part against them. I have some experience in this area because I was involved in unsuccessful efforts a few years ago to establish a bank, to compete through supermarkets, with other banks. The initiative involved the amalgamation of financial services between my company and TSB. It was a great attempt to encourage competition, but it did not succeed. Some people felt we never should have become involved in the sector in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The essence of effective competition in any marketplace is the ease with which customers can change suppliers. In the grocery business, which I know something about, that happens to a large extent. It is easy to take one's business to a retailer that is to one's liking and also to chop and change between service providers. People have the choice of shopping with me or with my competitor down the road because there are no barriers in place to prevent them making that choice. That is not the case with banks. Moving one's bank account is an enormous hassle which anyone who has not done so will discover if they dare to try. This need not be so, but the banks have deliberately designed the system in order to retain business. There is nothing to prevent banks creating artificial barriers to stop the customer from exercising choice, but we can change that if we wish.</P>
    <P>If one lives in a small town, one will be familiar with the different banks and there might be some embarrassment involved in changing from one to another. The real problem with transferring one's account relates to standing orders, etc. We could provide that when a customer elects to change suppliers, the paperwork would be carried out by the existing bank within a short period. The process could be triggered by the new bank when the customer signals his or her decision to transfer an account. All that would be involved would be the making of simple requests for the details regarding standing orders and so on. This is the sort of requirement on which a regulator would insist if customer interests were at the top of his or her agenda.</P>
    <P>Competition in this case means having the freedom to change banks and anything that is a barrier to that should be removed. In the UK, there is a regulation that makes it simple and fast for any bank customer to move their account. I have no doubt the Central Bank will include customer interests as one of several items on its agenda, but I have noted that it should be the priority.</P>
    <P>Will enough be done to achieve what is intended by the legislation? I take some encouragement from the structure proposed in the Bill to create a regulatory body that is separate from the Central Bank proper, even though it will be <Col N="499" />under the bank's control. We must ask, however, if the separation provided for will be enough to allow the regulatory body to pursue its agenda and ensure that customer service is the driving force in the process. I doubt if anyone can be certain that will be the case. The best we can hope for is that awareness of the need to prioritise the customer's agenda is kept alive. If we find over time that the structure this legislation puts in place is not effectively looking after customer interests, I hope we have the courage and determination to revisit the issue and put matters right. I welcome the Bill, but I do so with a degree of scepticism and concern mingled with hope that the Minister's obvious intentions will be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials. I am pleased to see the Bill before the House and I welcome the principle of establishing a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector. I compliment the McDowell group, the work of which formed the basis on which this legislation has been brought forward.</P>
      <P>I wish to take up Senator Quinn's point that there is an urgent need to consolidate the Central Banks Acts along the lines of the excellent work carried out in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The points made by Senator Quinn are valid and should be taken on board. There are currently six Central Bank Acts in operation and the Bill before the House will constitute a seventh. A further Bill will come before the House by the end of the year which will operate alongside the eight statutory instruments which have been put in place to implement EU directives concerning credit institutions. In addition, the Central Bank and the ISFRA will be responsible for the implementation and oversight of a further 25 Acts that deal with financial institutions and 27 statutory instruments that implement EU legislation.</P>
      <P>As Senator Quinn stated, there is a huge amount of regulation governing financial institutions and I am of the opinion that matters will become quite difficult if we do not set about consolidating them into one item of legislation. That matter should be given serious consideration.</P>
      <P>Under section 5A(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill, the Central Bank will be tasked with promoting the development within the State of the financial services industry. The IFSRA will be given the function of promoting the best interests of users of financial services. Rather than create a scenario in which these functions might clash, it might be appropriate to provide that the Central Bank and the IFSRA address both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new section 33J to be inserted in the principal Act, the regulatory authority will have the power to impose levies on regulated institutions to provide it with sufficient funds to perform its functions. The new section 33J(5) provides that the levies collected from credit unions <Col N="500" />shall not exceed the total amount of the costs incurred in performing the 25 functions and exercising the powers of the bank under the Credit Union Act 1997. Is it intended to allow the levies imposed on other sectors to exceed the costs of regulating them? Assuming it is not, all financial services providers should be treated equally in the legislation.</P>
    <P>It is right that the legislation provides for resources to be used efficiently, effectively and economically by the Central Bank and its constituent parts. Regulation and supervision should also be cost effective and the burdens imposed should be proportionate to the intended benefits. This is normally achieved through a regulatory impact analysis coupled with periodic independent reviews, but the Bill does not appear to provide for such mechanisms.</P>
    <P>The new section 33AJ(2) provides that the Central Bank, the ISFRA and their staff, members and agents are excluded from liability arising from civil suits brought in the context of anything done in the performance of their functions or powers unless an act or omission was in bad faith. Where wilful misconduct or gross negligence occurs, the exclusion from liability appears to apply, which is a point that should be examined.</P>
    <P>I highlight also Schedule 1, which contains some 80 pages of consequential amendments to the legislation. Schedule 2 contains a further 19 pages of consequential amendments to statutory instruments which implement EU directives. Perhaps the Minster of State to indicate whether these amendments are consequential or whether substantive amendments to existing legislation are included. If there are substantive amendments, they should be clearly identifiable.</P>
    <P>Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act is being amended by altering the definition of charge. A further worthwhile amendment to this section would be to substitute the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; for that of &ldquo;customer&rdquo; where it occurs. This would have the effect of confining the legislation to dealings with consumers, which would be in line with the intent of the consumer credit directive and clear up a long-standing legislative anomaly.</P>
    <P>Looking at the amount of legislation we have now is, as Senator Quinn said, similar to a form of gymnastics. We need to be very careful to get it right. We should not bring forward legislation for the sake of it, particularly if it is not compatible with existing legislation. This Bill implements a portion of the McDowell group recommendations. Further recommendations of the group will be forthcoming at a later stage. It is important that its work is fully implemented. However, I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to consolidating the various Acts as has been done in the area of taxation. It would be a worthwhile exercise from the point of view of <Col N="501" />both consumers and those responsible for the implementation of the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a well-known cliché about the extraordinary shape a horse designed by a committee would take. There is a degree to which this agency is a classic and not very aesthetically appealing fudge and compromise between two fairly strong-minded Ministers neither of whom, at least superficially, was prepared to be seen to lose. I agree with Senator Higgins that ultimately the Minister for Finance got his way but it was by way of a fairly ugly fudge &ndash; I mean that in the aesthetic sense. I am not implying anything else.</P>
      <P>The contradictions in the area of regulation deserve to be increasingly addressed by the Oireachtas because it is strange that two passions seem to have simultaneously emerged in most western democracies. One is a huge passion for deregulation. The other is an equally huge passion for the effective decoupling of the State from any activities and the substitution of the role of the State with the role of independent regulators. This is happening in relation to telecommunications and electricity. There is this wonderful passion for the elimination of regulation, on the one hand, while, on the other, there is an increase in belief in the efficacy of regulation.</P>
      <P>I am not persuaded about the efficacy of regulation. I say this from a considerable personal and professional interest in the environment. There is a standard argument about regulation that the regulator will never know as much about an area being regulated as the area does about itself. The environmental regulator will never know as much about an industry that he or she is regulating as the industry itself. The electricity regulator will never know as much about electricity generating as the electricity generators know, because if the electricity regulator was as knowledgeable and expert as the people he or she was regulating, he or she would be in the business of generating electricity. If the environmental regulator knew as much about the intricacies of the pharmaceutical industry as those working in the industry, the environmental regulator would be running a pharmaceutical plant for much greater reward and considerably greater benefit to himself or herself. That is the standard argument that has been used for the past 30 years about environmental regulation and it is one that applies universally. The regulator can never be as expert as the regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our experience of regulators and regulation sadly tends to confirm this. Most of what the Central Bank was supposed to do in the area of financial services was prudential regulation. However, for quite a while it had a token consumer regulation role also in the sense that it regulated bank charges before the Director of Consumer Affairs took it over. Consumer regulation did not loom in its thinking. The truth is that in every one of the scandals that emerged and which have <Col N="502" />affected the whole of the financial services area it said it did not know, thereby confirming the validity of the opinion that a regulator rarely knows as much as those being regulated. It seems, therefore, that unless regulators have a clear and unequivocal primary function, to protect the consumer, the balance will be weighed in favour of the interests of the regulated. It is the classic dilemma.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister of State's script, the mandate of the regulatory authority is to promote the best interests of users of financial services &ndash; which means those of consumers &ndash; in a way that is consistent with the orderly and proper functioning of financial markets and the orderly and prudent supervision of the providers of those services. When those interests have to be balanced, whose will have the heavier weight? Whose is the easiest to leave out? Who will have the least organised lobby, the least organised publicity? It is clearly the user, the consumer. That is inevitable because, to again push the environmental analogy, the consumer is the point source of information whereas the regulated are organised institutions with a profile, resources and a continuity of interest in these matters, which means that they will have a continuous feedback into the regulating bodies. Therefore, the definition of what represents a way that is consistent with orderly and proper functioning will almost inevitably and without any malice or wrongdoing by anybody be balanced in the interests of the regulated rather than consumers. Once that balance is allowed to be taken into consideration there is a fundamental argument about this legislation. Co-opting the Director of Consumer Affairs &ndash; I will come to the credit unions later &ndash; into this essentially regulatory process will inevitably guarantee that the balance of interests will be weighed in the direction of the regulated rather than consumers. Again, this is not a criticism of the Director of Consumer Affairs, though that office did fail on a major issue.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have a succession of evidence that regulators, while they are supposed to have a brief to look after consumer interests, inevitably end up with what they see as a balanced position. There is a classic example in the city in which I live. The Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, now subsumed into ComReg, has continuously succumbed to the arguments of a cable television service, allowing it to do things which are in breach of its contract and charge fees which are quite exorbitant. There is no particular reason other than an historic one cable television should cost more in Cork than anywhere else in the country but it does because nearly 20 years ago the service was being transmitted by a long cable from the Comeraghs to Cork involving considerable investment. That was given up years ago and satellite television services are now used but the regulator still allows a <Col N="503" />rate of charge for the service based on an antiquated and out-of-date argument.</P>
    <P>I am not implying the regulator is misbehaving. I am saying the regulator has listened to the consistent, intense lobbying by the regulated and compromised between them and the rights of consumers &ndash; to integrate the regulation of the system, the technology or the processes as in the financial services with the regulation of what should be a sole priority, the rights of consumers.</P>
    <P>Let somebody else who is totally independent look after prudential regulation. If consumers' rights are a dominant issue and concern, they should be the sole concern of somebody. Let some other person argue with the Director of Consumer Affairs about prudential regulation and, if necessary, let the Oireachtas be the final arbiter. To pretend that consumer interest regulation and prudential regulation can be integrated in one institution is to cede the argument to the regulated. That is a long-standing view of mine. Even with independent consumer interest regulation, extraordinary things can happen.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs in the last Oireachtas. One of the areas of interest for the committee was the transition to the euro for which the rate of exchange was fixed about three years before notes and coins came into use. Most of us had assumed that the permanent fixing of the exchange rate would mean that since there was minimal cost to the banks and zero exchange risk there would be a dramatic drop in the cost to the consumer of acquiring currencies. However, the banks succeeding in persuading the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs that other costs would be incurred. To compensate for the loss of profits made from the alleged risk of currency uncertainty, charges for acquiring French francs or German marks rose. The consumer was only at best marginally better off. The Director of Consumer Affairs accepted the argument that being slightly better off was acceptable.</P>
    <P>The European Commission intervened with some equivalent of dawn raids on some of our more prestigious banks. After a lot of huffing and puffing the charges which the Director of Consumer Affairs had ruled to be reasonable mysteriously turned out not to be needed after all. The banks persisted even longer with the charges accruing to withdrawals of, for instance, French francs from an ATM in France. They charged a 3% levy on such withdrawals until the European Union intervened. They then conceded that the same charges would be applied to ATM use elsewhere in Europe as are charged in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It must be clarified unequivocally that the regulator in the area of consumer interests is a champion of the consumer, not a champion of a balanced position. I have great respect for the present Director of Consumer Affairs but it is extremely difficult for even the best of regulators <Col N="504" />because the regulator never knows as much as the regulated. That is one reason I would have preferred to see a separation of the prudential regulation of financial services from consumer interest regulation. I am sceptical about regulators generally. I am even more sceptical when there is a perceived or real potential conflict.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are another focus of legitimate concern about which the Minister of State has spoken at length. Most accept that there were gaps in the regulation information. I was intrigued by the Minister of State's speech. I know he has up-to-date information. He has said there are 438 credit unions. The report for the year 2000 of the Registrar of Friendly Societies is the last available from that body. How can there be proper regulation if the information available to the Oireachtas is almost three years out of date? That is an argument for a new look at the regulation of credit unions.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between credit unions and other financial institutions. They are run by volunteers who are not there to make money for themselves. Such institutions cannot be integrated with a financial services sector run by individuals who grossly overpay themselves. They regard financial services as the area in which to get rich quick. To a degree, it is a semi-protected market. The same ethos, values or regulation to deal with financial services delivered through the volunteer credit unions cannot be applied to financial services in which individuals are very highly rewarded. It does an injustice both to the credit unions and those asked to regulate them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on Second Stage and the interest they have shown in the Bill which allows for the continuation of this country as an attractive and soundly regulated location for the financial services industry. I accept that it is a complex and technical measure. In that respect I have sympathy with Senator Quinn's comments. I will deal with that issue.</P>
      <P>The Bill will establish a new entity, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, to manage the supervision of financial institutions in Ireland. While it will operate within the Central Bank of Ireland's legal structure, it is important to emphasise that the new authority will have independent functions with its own chief executive, chairperson and board.</P>
      <P>The new authority will unite the supervision of the major sectors of the financial services industry, in particular the supervision of insurance undertakings will now be carried out by the same institution as the supervision of banks and the funds industry. There had been a degree of fragmentation in the regulation of these bodies. I share the views of Senator Ryan about the credit union movement and will deal with that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" />The Bill will place added emphasis within the supervisory structure on the consumer interest. A new position of consumer director will be established. The office of the parliamentary counsel has identified and listed the specific enactments and regulations under which the regulatory authority is to perform functions of the bank, amended and restated the provisions of the 1942 Act, repealed and amended other Acts consequential on the provisions of the Bill and amended the European Communities legislation.</P>
    <P>I will respond to specific issues raised by Senators. Senator Higgins complained about the delay in dealing with this measure from the time of its introduction. No Oireachtas committee was established until some time after the convening of the new Dáil. Therefore, while the measure was introduced on Second Stage as one of the first measures of the new Dáil, the necessity to establish the committees imposed a considerable delay in progressing the measure. The Senator also raised the question of bank charges, of which I am advised that the Competition Authority is conducting an investigation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the promised Bill dealing with panels of experts and the ombudsman, the heads were published with a consultation document in July 2002. Extensive comments were received. Accordingly, the heads have been revised to take account of what were very helpful comments and submissions on the measure and the Bill is now with the parliamentary counsel for drafting. The target for publication in mid-year is realistic.</P>
    <P>The core issue raised by the Senator and touched upon by Senators Ryan and Quinn relates to the Government's decision to integrate prudential supervision with consumer protection which should be distinct policy objectives. As the Senators pointed out, the Central Bank is responsible for prudential supervision of financial institutions operating in the State such as banks and building societies, while the Department supervises the insurance industry. The Director of Consumer Affairs has certain responsibilities under the 1995 Consumer Credit Act. Due to legal and confidentiality requirements, there has been a well highlighted difficulty in the full exchange of information between regulators. I am sure Senator Ryan would enjoy that justification.</P>
    <P>The McDowell group believed strongly that separating consumer issues from the prudential regulator had two important disadvantages. First, it left unresolved the legal problem of passing relevant information from the authority to the Director of Consumer Affairs and, second, the advantages of a one-stop-shop would be lost in that there would be two official bodies dealing with different aspects of financial services regulation. The group concluded that, given the requirement imposed by the relative EU law, the best mechanism for providing for the maximum flow of information between prudential regulators and those concerned with consumer protection was to combine both functions within one <Col N="506" />authority. The Government considered this restriction in the exchange of information was unacceptable. Because of this and other considerations, it decided to implement the structure before the House today. It is important to stress in the light of comments made by various Senators that this is not the existing Central Bank, standing as is, or amended by this legislation. A new authority is being established under the legislation which will have a special relationship with the Central Bank which is being transmogrified by the legislation.</P>
    <P>The question of how best to deal with the issues arising from combining the functions of prudential regulation and consumer protection was dealt with comprehensively in the report of the McDowell group. A number of options were examined. The group examined the issue of protecting the interests of clients of financial institutions, both at the level of protection of consumers' interests in the context of solvency and at the level of the individual consumer and his or her relationship with the particular institution. The relationship between these levels was examined, especially from the point of view of the obligations imposed under EU law in relation to the prohibition on disclosure of information to the relevant authorities on issues for which it had no statutory function. The ability to disclose information is very important, as seen in the DIRT inquiry. In the end, the expert group took the view that the consumer's interests would best be served by combining the functions of consumer protection and prudential regulation in one body.</P>
    <P>Various other options were examined. Separate authorities for prudential regulation and consumer protection &ndash; two competent authorities, one having a consumer protection function and the other a regulatory authority with a subsidiary responsible for consumer protection &ndash; were ruled out as it was only within the entity which combined the prudential regulation function with the consumer protection function that the disclosure of information between the two could be done within the provisions of EU law.</P>
    <P>Apart from this issue, the Government was of the view that the integration of the two functions provided for the advantage of the one-stop-shop. In the context of Ireland being a relatively small jurisdiction with a limited pool of expertise in the case of financial regulation, it is important to build a critical mass of skills relating to financial regulation in a single location. This is of major importance to the country. It also places the interests of consumers at the heart of financial services regulation by giving the authority specific responsibility in this regard. What is at stake is not simply a restatement but a redefinition of the role of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh referred to the International Financial Services Centre and the tremendous success it has had and the importance of light regulation. This is a balance which must be struck in this matter. He used it as a basis for urging us <Col N="507" />to proceed with great caution in this area. I agree with him that it is important to be very cautious. However, we have considered the report and made our decision on that basis. There is a transfer of some but not all of the Central Bank's functions. No doubt, a sound banking sector is essential to our prosperity.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the form of the drafting. When I was first tasked with introducing this measure on Report Stage in the other House a few weeks ago, I had sympathy with his point of view. The McDowell group recommended that a single regulator should be set up which should be followed by the consolidation of the relevant legislation. The Minister for Finance has decided to adopt this sequence. He has promised that the relevant legislation will be consolidated. This sequence will allow the authority to have a full say in the consolidation exercise. It is proposed to enact the second measure which I outlined to Senator Higgins and, at its conclusion, consolidate the entirety of the legislation. There will be consolidation of all Central Bank legislation into one piece of legislation with the financial legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that the complexity of the legislation before us is very striking. The parliamentary counsel had a very difficult task to perform. The practical need to ensure the regulator was established not just on an administrative basis but also on a legal basis was very important to the Government. There is a sequence. Following the enactment of the legislation dealing with the ombudsman and the panels, there will be consolidation of the relevant financial legislation. Consolidation is very much on the agenda.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also raised the question of reporting and the frailties in the performance of the Central Bank disclosed at the DIRT inquiry. The Minister accepted amendments in the other House which strengthened the reporting obligations.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points raised by Senators. The question of credit unions was also raised. The credit union movement has occupied a unique niche in a very competitive and fast-changing financial environment. Credit unions foster a habit of saving and thrift. There is no doubt the movement is based on a very admirable principle of self-help and mutual co-operation and that there has been a tremendous record of impressive growth in recent years. Voluntary effort is a particular feature. The Bill as initiated provided that the functions of the Registrar of Friendly Societies would be carried out independently by a registrar of credit unions.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan has drawn attention to the fact that the recent report and statistics available to us go back to 2000. I understand the delay is linked to the time it takes to obtain information <Col N="508" />from the relevant credit unions. I suppose when one is dealing with a voluntary organisation, this can often be a difficulty. Those of us who seek to register party branches or cumann in a calendar year are more than aware of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill as initiated provided there would be a registrar of credit unions loosely within the overall framework of the regulatory authority. Both the members of the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, established in April 2002, and the Governor of the Central Bank were unhappy and expressed reservations about the reporting arrangements for the Registrar of Credit Unions within the new regulatory authority. They argued that they contradicted the principles of good governance. The Minister felt obliged to look again at the provisions and amendments were tabled in the Dáil which altered the reporting relationship of the registrar, bringing the position more fully within the framework of the authority. This matter on which the Minister had very detailed discussions with the league can be looked at on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On 16 December 2002 the Minister set out in detail the amendments he proposed to make to the Bill, their impact and the reasons he considered he had no choice but to propose them. A delegation from the league held a subsequent meeting with officers from the Department of Finance to examine possible wordings to ensure the ethos, characteristics and uniqueness of credit unions could be safeguarded in the Bill. The officers met the league on a number of occasions in January and a draft text was agreed. The league confirmed it was satisfied and the Bill was sent to the parliamentary counsel for drafting. It is now before the House.</P>
    <P>The supervision of credit unions by the new authority should not be viewed as a threat to the movement but should be seen as a development that will work to the advantage of the credit union movement and member customers of credit unions. The concerns expressed by the league have been taken into account by ensuring any directions given by the registrar must be within the scope of the Credit Union Act 1997. The Bill provides that the regulatory authority will be obliged to have regard to the particular nature of credit unions, having regard to the 1997 Act and the voluntary ethos of credit unions. I understand the league has written to all credit unions stating that while it has a preference for the Bill as published, the new amendments mean that the authority will have to take into account the unique nature of credit unions and the decisions affecting them. I can make available a copy of the league's statement to Senators if they wish.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points raised by Senators and thank them for their attention. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter with the Minister of State because of the situation at the kidney dialysis unit at Sligo General Hospital, which facility is located in a house at the rear of the hospital. It is totally unsuitable and conditions are cramped. Until recently no advance could be made on the project. The nurses have now moved to the nursing school, as a result of which space has become available at the hospital. I record my gratitude to them. The unit is now ready to move as soon as funding is available. Will the Minister of State prioritise the project because it has caused a lot of concern, particularly in the last three years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Scanlon for providing me with the opportunity to clarify, on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, the position on renal services at Sligo General Hospital. I also acknowledge what was said by Senator Feighan.</P>
      <P>The Minister has identified renal services as among the main acute hospital services for priority development. He has provided additional funding of over &euro;15 million for the period 2000-03 to develop renal services and increase capacity in this area. This includes an additional &euro;1.8 million provided this year for the further development of the services. The principles underpinning this investment are to ensure services are available regionally in order that patients do not have to travel long distances and ensure an equitable availability of treatment choice for patients, irrespective of their geographical location.</P>
      <P>The need for an initiative of this nature is highlighted by the anticipated growth in demand for renal services having regard to demographic and epidemiological factors. The demand for such services is expected to increase substantially over the next decade and it will be important to ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place to meet this demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key principles underpinning developments in this area are: capital investment where there are identified capacity constraints; additional revenue funding where there is scope to absorb more patients and provision of additional consultant nephrologists where required to improve access. Against this background, the Minister has established a review group to formulate a national <Col N="511" />strategy for renal services and set out a framework for future service delivery, while building on the existing development plan. Dr. Liam Plant, a nephrologist at Cork University Hospital will chair the group. The terms of reference for the review have been finalised and a broad representation of all interested parties will be invited onto the group. This initiative is in line with the commitment made in the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness &ndash; a Health System for You, that a national review of renal services would be undertaken.</P>
    <P>With regard to services at Sligo General Hospital, the Senators will appreciate that responsibility for the provision of services at the hospital rests with the North Western Health Board, NWHB. Renal services in the region are provided at Letterkenny and Sligo General Hospitals. The renal dialysis service at Sligo General Hospital is being provided in temporary accommodation. I <Col N="512" />note what Senator Scanlon said about the movement from that accommodation and will convey his views to the Department. The Minister has been advised by the board that the development of the new renal dialysis unit at the hospital is a priority.</P>
    <P>I understand the board is reviewing its priorities for capital development projects under the indicative funding notified to it by the Department under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Having regard to the high priority which the board attaches to the development of the new dialysis unit at the hospital it is to be hoped the project will proceed at an early date. The Government will continue to invest in the development of high quality, equitable and accessible hospital services, including dialysis services, in order that those availing of services continue to receive timely and appropriate care.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.05 p.m. until 2.30&nbsp;p.m. on Tuesday, 1 April 2003.</P>
