      <P>I have received notice from Senator Mansergh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to make a statement on the Government's policy on the viability of small rural post offices.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to indicate the steps she will take to get replacement jobs following the job losses in Square D in Ballinasloe.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mary Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reasons he has taken no action following the serious reports of staff shortages at St. Mary's Home for the Mentally and Physically Handicapped, Drumcar, County Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="2" />I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Environment and Local Government to act immediately to restore the physically disabled person's grant in north Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected the matters raised by Senators Mansergh, Ulick Burke and Henry to be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose a vote of sympathy on behalf of my party and, I am sure, many others to the family of former Senator Peggy Farrell of Roscommon. Mrs. Farrell was appointed to this House by the then Taoiseach, the late Jack Lynch, in 1969 and served until 1973. She was the outgoing president of the ICA and had formidable business acumen. She ran her own business in Roscommon town where she lived until she passed away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" />I knew Peggy Farrell well as she was in the adjoining constituency. While she was known nationally through her work with the ICA, she was also well known locally. She was a member of the national body for small businesses. She was also well noted as an articulate spokesperson and had a sharp &ndash; in the correct sense of the term &ndash; and focused way of looking at matters and making her opinions known. She contributed to many debates in this House. I met her at a function once and think she was getting tired of being the &ldquo;ICA woman&rdquo;. She had undoubted skills with which she wanted to be credited, as she was, both here and in business.</P>
    <P>We have a fine record of paying tribute to former Members. To her husband, Gussy, and three children, Michael, Jan and Jill, I offer, on behalf of my party, our deepest sympathies. They will dearly miss her presence. I am sure the Lord will welcome her to His kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad, I offer our condolences to Fianna Fáil and the family of the late Peggy Farrell. The death of a former Member is always an occasion when colleagues on all sides will remember the person and pay tribute to his or her contribution to national politics. Peggy Farrell was a Member of this House from 1969 until 1973. I was born in 1969 and did not know her well, but my colleagues, particularly those from Roscommon, have told me she was a formidable female politician at a time when it was very difficult for a woman to be in politics.</P>
      <P>While this House has one of the lowest percentages in terms of women in politics in any EU country, it was appalling in the 1960s and 1970s. County Roscommon is quite unique in this respect as it had a number of other female politicians at the time. Joan Burke, a former Fine Gael Deputy, and Peggy Farrell were both outstanding female politicians. Those women got into politics when it was difficult to do so.</P>
      <P>Peggy Farrell was an employer in Roscommon town. Rather than merely talking about jobs she created them, which was a tremendous achievement. She was involved in the ICA for many years and was a former president of the association.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I would like to be associated with the tributes that have been paid to her memory. I would also like to offer our deepest sympathy to her family, her three children and her husband. I would like her memory to be cherished and remembered forever in this House of which she was a fine and distinguished Member for four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>None of us on the Independent benches knew the late Senator Farrell. Nevertheless, we would like to be associated with the expressions of condolence to her family and her party. As is always said on these occasions, people come and go through these Houses. Such <Col N="4" />people took part in the development of this country, this nation, this House and legislation, which makes us who we are. In that sense, it is utterly appropriate that we should pay tribute to people who have given time to public life.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell could have done many other things, but she chose to spend her time not working for herself but making a contribution as a public representative. This is a time to remind ourselves and others of the importance of public representation and of attracting and maintaining good people in it. That is what we remember today in expressing our condolences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know the former Senator Farrell, but on behalf of the Labour Party I would like to express our sympathies to her husband and children. The former Senator was an exceptional person because, as Senator Hayes said, women were rare in politics in those days and female business people were even rarer.</P>
      <P>I knew Roscommon slightly in the middle to late 1960s. To set up a business there and create employment in those days was a considerable achievement, given that it was not the most attractive investment climate. As I recall, it was a poor county.</P>
      <P>We, in the Labour Party, would like to pay tribute to the late Peggy Farrell because, as Senator O'Toole said, we should pay tribute to all those who have given service, which was often thankless. She made a contribution to Irish life. The ICA in which she was very involved has also made an enormous contribution to Irish life. We would like to be associated with the tributes and the expressions of sympathy to her family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join others in expressing our sympathy and support to the family of the late Peggy Farrell. It is not readily appreciated nowadays how formidable an achievement it was in those days to become president of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, which was and still is a major national organisation. The late Peggy Farrell obviously revealed fairly formidable and forceful qualities in becoming president of that association. It is notable that several presidents of that association from that period went on to achieve national distinction in politics and, subsequently, in other areas.</P>
      <P>The late Peggy Farrell contributed greatly to the welfare of her community and contributed significantly to the proceedings of this House. We join in extending our sympathy to her husband, her children and her party colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my deepest sympathy to the family of the late Peggy Farrell. She hailed from Bantry in County Cork and was formerly Peggy Spillane. She came to Roscommon as a poultry instructress where she met and married her husband, Gussy Farrell, a local business man. She died on 17 January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peggy Farrell was a Senator from 1969 until <Col N="5" />1973. She was president of the ICA. She established and was involved in An Grianán and in the Sliabh Bán co-operative, Strokestown. She established a successful business and gave extremely good employment in Roscommon and had tremendous respect for employees. I remember her efforts in this regard as being open, broad and imaginative.</P>
    <P>During her period in the Seanad from 1969 to 1973 she spoke on important issues such as the European Communities Act, the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act and the Redundancy Payments Act. She took the Fianna Fáil Party Whip, which was not obligatory as she was appointed by the former Taoiseach, the late Jack Lynch. She was involved in local politics in Roscommon where she became secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann in Roscommon town, which showed her commitment to and involvement in politics.</P>
    <P>Peggy Farrell was also involved until recently in the county enterprise board and the Confederation of Irish Industry and was a founder member of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association. She was known the length and breadth of Ireland.</P>
    <P>She was a devoted wife, mother and grandmother, a great friend of mine and an inspiration to all who came in contact with her. She was until recently active in developments in Roscommon town. Peggy will be sadly missed by her family and the people of Roscommon. She will be especially missed by her husband, Gussy, her son, Michael, and daughters, Jan and Jill. She lost her son, Donal, some years ago. She had many crosses in life in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am privileged to be in a position to be associated with all the fine tributes to her in the Seanad. We extend our deepest sympathies to her family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the kind remarks about the late Peggy Farrell. She was ICA president and, as Senator Leyden pointed out, started the Sliabh Bán co-operative which assisted people in County Roscommon interested in handcrafts to market their products. She was a business lady of repute and ensured women's affairs were brought to the forefront in a rural county such as Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I had the honour and privilege of serving with Peggy on the county enterprise board. When she had a view, she certainly spoke her mind. She was loyal and, when she put her forensic mind to analysing submissions to the county enterprise board, we were assured that the best result would be achieved.</P>
      <P>On my election to the Seanad, I received a touching letter from Peggy which I appreciated. People like her will be missed in rural counties such as Roscommon. I would like to be associated with the remarks made about her.</P>

      <P>I would also like to be associated with both the vote of sympathy to <Col N="6" />Peggy Farrell and the kind words said about her. I remember when she was appointed because, having contested a general election unsuccessfully, one had one's eye on the Seanad. I remember the occasion she was appointed and took note of the valuable contribution she made to the Seanad. I am pleased to be associated with the vote of sympathy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate in this House concerning the ongoing situation in Iraq, particularly in light of last night's speech, which I heard in full, by President Bush to the US Congress. It is important that the Government put on record its response to that very detailed speech. It is also important that a debate take place in this House. I suspect there are many views among Members on all sides concerning the likely aggression by the United States of America and its allies against Iraq. Such a debate would be important, given the creeping anti-Americanism that is taking hold here. This does not serve the country well and it does not serve international affairs well. The Government should set out its response to these matters in the House at some point either tomorrow or early next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader and the Government Chief Whip to facilitate Opposition Members concerning a timetable of legislation. In the other House the Government Chief Whip sets out a timetable outlining the Bills that will be brought forward in each session. As the Leader is aware, we welcome Government Bills that are introduced in the House. However, it is important <Col N="7" />for spokespersons on both sides of the House to know in advance when such Bills will be taken so that appropriate amendments can be tabled. I welcome the considerable time set aside to debate the Immigration Bill and in that regard, the Order of Business, as set out, has my support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to remind ourselves how world views can change so rapidly. This is germane to the points just made by Senator Brian Hayes. Innocuous as it may seem, one of the papers laid before the House and listed on today's Order Paper might remind us of distant events which occurred all of nine months ago. It contains names about which we no longer hear now that President Bush has decided to focus his attention on another part of the world. The paper in question, No. 33, relates to the prohibition of financial transfers to Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda and the Taliban of Afghanistan. Senators will remember those people. They were main players on the world stage a short time ago. They were the people that were going to threaten the security of the world. They are no longer convenient and we are now looking at somewhere else in the world. That is another reason the points raised by Senator Hayes should be addressed. There needs to be some sense of logic to what we are doing.</P>
      <P>Before the recess I made reference to crime, especially in the city of Limerick, and highlighted the fact that the particularly horrific murder of a security guard should have been afforded the same level of importance as the shooting of Veronica Guerin in Dublin. This is opening the floodgates for those who believe they are above and beyond the law, who can do as they wish and who can take life at a whim. Everything we have seen has proven that point. It is not my intention to make a political point. Yesterday, I listened to a radio interview with Limerick's chief superintendent. He was one of the most impressive speakers on that issue I have heard for a long time and he knew what he was doing.</P>
      <P>We should give a clear signal to the people of Limerick and other places that this is an issue of national concern and importance. For most Members the question is not whether the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, was asked for resources, but whether enough is being done or if further action is needed to prevent the problem spreading around the country. Violent crime, by which I mean murder, has increased to levels beyond our worst expectations.</P>
      <P>I wish to correct an inadvertent error I made on the final day of the last session when I neglected to offer my thanks to the Leader and Deputy Leader of the House for their extraordinary work during the session. Having looked back at the record, I am embarrassed by my failure to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I benefit from Senator O'Toole's efforts as much as anybody else. I apologise, a Chathaoirligh. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we devote the first two hours of today's business to a debate on the Government's decision to allow the use of Shannon Airport for the transit of US munitions to the Middle East. The country is in a state of confusion as to the public position on the matter. Until last week it was one of &ldquo;denial, denial, denial&rdquo;, yet suddenly it has changed to one of &ldquo;permission, permission, permission&rdquo;, which is not coherent.</P>
      <P>In the context of Iraq, will the Leader find out the reason the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2000, which was passed in this House nearly three years ago, has still not passed through the other House? Given current concerns about weapons of mass destruction, the least we could do is meet our international obligations by passing the legislation. This House did its job. Perhaps the Leader will find out the reason legislation we all agreed was good has not been passed in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to a topic close to the heart of Senator Quinn, namely, the 22 reports or statements of accounts on today's Order Paper. With one exception, which covers the period ending August 1999, all the statements of accounts are for 2001. Will the Leader raise with the Government the need to change the ethos of public bodies to require them to report within an appropriate timeframe in order that their reports remain relevant to current conditions? The reports in question are a year, <Col N="9" />if not 18 months, out of date, which is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I fully share Senator O'Toole's concerns about crime. While I do not usually raise the issue of crime to avoid scares, it is clear that the level of organised, violent crime in various parts of the country, in particular in this city and Limerick, deserves immediate attention. It is a matter of regret that concerns about the status of Connacht rugby are to be debated when the House does not have time to debate the appalling crime problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Hayes for the House to debate the situation in Iraq and express its concern that the United States might act unilaterally without the backing of a UN resolution. The difficulties elsewhere in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Palestine, should be included in such a debate. With the election of a new government in Israel, it is hoped progress can be made to reach a settlement which will end the slaughter on both sides.</P>
      <P>The Fischler proposals on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are another important matter. They will have a profound effect if they go through in the form they were published. It is important that the House should debate this issue because it has implications beyond the farm gate in terms of employment and the prospects of the meat processing and dairy industries, about which we need to be conscious. It would be appropriate that the House should give serious attention to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House for a debate on crime, which has been highlighted by recent events in Limerick. I refer to the call by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors for more help. The association stated crime was almost out of control and unless its members received the necessary assistance, the situation would get worse. When will the Minister provide the extra 2,000 gardaí promised prior to the general election as they are badly needed?</P>
      <P>There have been a number of incidents recently involving taxi drivers. This is a serious and worrying issue for women and young girls, in particular, who must travel in taxis at night and rely on them as a safe means of transport. However, many taxi drivers are not upstanding members of the community and a regulator should be appointed to monitor the industry. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss this issue?</P>

      <P>Will the Leader request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to update us on the position on the many missing persons in the State? I have raised this matter on several occasions and was prompted to do so again when <Col N="10" />I heard a new group had been established by the sister of the one of the missing persons. It is known as the Jo Jo Dollard Memorial Trust Fund. She was a young woman from Kilkenny who disappeared a number of years ago and nothing more was heard about her. There have been many other cases and a great deal of hurt, suffering, trauma and uncertainty has resulted. It is important for us to support these family groups.</P>
      <P>A debate in the House could lead us to refocus on the issues involved because the public also has a role to play. We should not write off missing persons as statistics. We must revisit these cases and the Minister could help to bring us up to date on them.</P>

On Committee Stage of a Bill, issues that are different but similar can sometimes be discussed with the agreement of the House. I understand we are debating the Fine Gael motion, though Fianna Fáil Members may want to agree with it. Other Members may have different views, but we should be clear about what we are doing tonight and ask Fianna Fáil to support the Fine Gael motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the clarification. The fact that Fine Gael has chosen this issue for Private Members' Business clearly indicates why that party is in Opposition. We are on the verge of what could be a world war, but both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil feel that events involving rugby in Connacht are most worthy of discussion. I completely disagree. If one considers the way the two principal parties have treated Private Members' Business, it is about time they surrendered their rights in this area to the Independent group, which treats it seriously. The Government and Fine Gael deal with all kinds of extraneous matters and rubbish in their Private Members' time. That shows it is not taken seriously.</P>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business in the spirit of what has been said. Senator Brian Hayes referred to United States aggression against Iraq and he is perfectly correct to do so. Why did he then proceed to talk about creeping anti-Americanism? It is perfectly reasonable to be against aggression. I am against aggression&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="12" />Even if it has escaped the attention of the two major parties, there are serious matters which can be considered. For example, the difficulties in which the country has been landed as a result of the legislation on compensation for victims of child sex abuse. This is now going to present taxpayers with a potentially enormous bill and, as a taxpayer, I do not see why we should be obliged to pay it. I could argue that due to the operation of criminal law in Ireland I was abused by the authorities. I had my youth taken away, but I am not looking for compensation. If the bill amounts to &euro;1.52 billion, then taxpayers will be very annoyed with those who allowed it to happen.</P>
    <P>Crime has been mentioned and, in particular, the situation in Limerick. It was stated authoritatively on the radio this morning that many of the guns being used by crime families in that city come from republican paramilitaries. That is a matter the organs of State ought to address and we should be discussing.</P>
    <P>There is a young man in Blackrock operating a free-for-all at weekends where for &euro;40 for men and &euro;25 for women people can drink themselves absolutely stupid. This flies in the face of the policy enunciated by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of Ryanair stealing money from its clients to the tune of &euro;29 million in the last year.</P>

I ask for this debate in the light of the independent report commissioned by the St. John of God Brothers on St. Mary's Home, Drumcar, County Louth. Such a debate could help us examine our attitude, as a people, to the care of the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
      <P>I support the call by a number of Senators for a debate on the impending war in Iraq and suggest that the situation in the Middle East as a whole could be discussed. As Senator Brian Hayes said, it is possible to hold differing views and be pro-American but anti-war. We should have the opportunity to express our views on this very important issue.</P>

    <P>Will the Leader of the House ask the relevant Minister if, in the light of the court judgment in the Rundle case yesterday, he is now looking at a potential review of the Residential Institutions <Col N="13" />Redress Act? In the light of the potential massive exposure now possible as a result of the judgment, does the Minister consider the board now has a function? In seeking clarification on the matter I ask whether legislation will be forthcoming. The exceptional courage of the individual who took the case should be acknowledged.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to raise with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, an intrusion by British army helicopters during an Ulster GAA fixture last Sunday between Armagh and Monaghan at the Crossmaglen Rangers GAA grounds, Crossmaglen. I was at the match and three helicopters hovered over the pitch, landing and taking off again at the army base. The noise of the aircraft was deafening and a great annoyance to the players and the large attendance present at the game. I ask the Leader to convey my concerns to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs without delay. I am convinced that the peace process will only work when there is an end to all military activities, particularly in the south Armagh area, and people can go about their daily activities in a normal way.</P>

In common with other Senators, I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House. I am particularly concerned about the huge unevenness and wide variation in the handling of cases relating to child pornography and the downloading of material from the Internet. It is to be noted that a distinguished and learned District Court judge recently refused jurisdiction. I would like to hear the opinion of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on which court is the most appropriate to hear such cases. Some judges are acting as though they are patrons of various societies. No matter how meritorious, I wonder what is the basis in law for such huge sums being made available to admittedly worthy charities. I would like the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come before us and outline where he sees this going in the future.</P>

I noted that in the last session there was an extraordinarily malign tendency for scripts to be read by Members throughout all debates. It is a particularly bad trend in this House. There is a case, however, for certain people being confined to scripts. Senator O'Toole and perhaps Senator Norris would benefit from being scripted on all occasions.</P>

I gather that last night the sticking point was that, for the third time, members of the public service were being asked to increase so-called productivity in return for the exorbitant benchmarking payment and that for the third time, the issue will be fudged. For the third time, they will not increase productivity. They are refusing to do so and will run rings around the Government, as Senator O'Toole always does.</P>

The productivity of this country has been fantastic under the national agreements of the past 15 years; we never saw its like before. Earlier today, I heard some union representatives express reservations about the agreement on the radio. I hope a comprehensive conclusion will be reached involving all parties and I encourage the Government and the social partners in that regard. I congratulate the president of ICTU, Senator O'Toole, on his role in the process. I hope there will be an agreement. Far from being a denial or bypassing of democracy, the process is an amplification of it. My definition of democracy is maximum popular participation in the government of the country and social partnership contributes to that.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on Iraq. It is a simple matter to call on Iraq to fulfil the United Nations obligations. The weapons are there and the reason we know they are there is that, in many cases, the west sold them to Iraq.</P>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on the partnership talks that are taking place at present. The unions and the partnership approach to national agreements have played no small part in the growth and welfare of this country. I wish Senator O'Toole well in his endeavours.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange an early debate with the Minister for Education and Science about the situation faced by many communities, parents, boards of management and students? The Minister has confirmed that only 12 national schools out of a total of 840 will be <Col N="18" />upgraded in the coming year. This is an indication of total disregard for the plight of students at primary level. It is now time for a complete reappraisal. The Minister has given us an indication &ndash; and nothing more &ndash; of where people stand, after it has been requested for many years. There is total uncertainty among the public and the boards of management as to where or when, if ever, projects will commence.</P>

This lack of resources is mirrored throughout the country. I ask the Government to honour at least one its promises, namely, that of providing an additional 2,000 gardaí.</P>
      <P>I also request that the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House to explain the Government's policy on people with disabilities. There have been major cut-backs in the Department, which are having devastating effects on families of people with disabilities. These people had to take to the streets in order to air their grievances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes requested a debate on the Iraqi crisis, particularly in light of President Bush's State of the Union address last night and the sentiments it evoked. Senator Hayes referred to a creeping anti-Americanism he sees emerging in this country. I am not anti-American, but neither am I in favour of the war on Iraq. It is easy to equate that disapproval of war with a sentiment against a particular country, but it does not necessarily follow. However, I <Col N="19" />take on board the Senator's concerns about the need for a debate on the Iraqi situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes also made an interesting point about the need for Members to know at least a week in advance &ndash; or at the earliest opportunity &ndash; what legislation will be dealt with in the House. I agree with him in this regard and I will take this matter further. I have a general idea of all the Bills that are to be presented to the House and of whether they are being initiated here or in the Dáil. It is something I was very insistent upon throughout the last session. We find ourselves faced with a raft of Bills and to obtain the necessary time to debate them will be another matter. However, Members should know about them in good time so that they can prepare for debates.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole echoed Senator Hayes's comments about the Iraq. A view is being put forward by the American authorities which links al-Qaeda to Iraq. The first we have heard of this has been in the past few days. It is obviously another pretext for the Americans to go to war at a time when they are finding that people in many countries are not in favour of doing so.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to crime in Limerick. I also heard the views of Limerick's chief superintendent, who was very open and expert in the way he spoke about the situation. There is a general call for a debate on crime throughout the country, with particular regard to Limerick.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, which was seconded by Senator O'Meara, to debate the situation at Shannon Airport instead of debating the Immigration Bill 2002, which is also very important. The Senator also asked the reason the Dáil had not passed the Containment of Nuclears Weapons Bill. I do not know but can ask. He further asked for a debate on crime and the reports of public bodies. It is a matter of finding time for everything.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis raised the matter of Iraq. He also raised the effect of the proposed implementation of the Fischler proposals.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry raised the issue of crime and the need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House for a debate on the matter. She also stressed the need for the Minister for Transport to tell us about the taxi regulator. I do not accept her comments on taxi drivers. We should not brand all of them in that way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú called for a debate on missing persons in order to revive interest in such cases. We will see if it is possible to get the Mini<Col N="20" />ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House for such a debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris did not approve of the topic for debate selected by the Fine Gael Party for Private Members' time tonight. It is an important issue for many of us and we are proud to debate and agree with it. We think it is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>Senator O'Meara asks if there will be a review of the<b></b>Residential Institutions Redress Act in the light of what has now emerged of the likely cost of judgments under the Act. As far as I understand, there is no indication of a review taking place in the near future.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien raised the matter of the GAA match in south Armagh which was drowned out by the noise of British army helicopters. This was a very unwelcome intrusion into a wholesome participation in an afternoon's sporting activity. I will bring the matter to the attention of others, as the Senator requested.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan brought up the matter of Iraq. He also raised the issue of the disparity in sentencing and asked that it be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

    <P>Senator Ross spoke about the malign tendency to read scripts. I am reading this because Senators made their points one by one, but I do not normally read scripts when I speak in the Seanad. It is very easy for us who have had experience, but there are many new Members in the House who are eager to contribute and get their ideas into the Official Report.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is by way of an advance party, so to speak. It brings forward, in a simple and relatively unrefined way, the principle which will be covered in much greater detail by the Bill on employment permits being developed under the aegis of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>It has long been a source of concern that there is a great legal imbalance between employer and employee when it comes to the law on the employment of non-nationals. No right-thinking person can agree that it is fair that, while it is an offence for a non-national in general to be in employment without an employment permit, the employer can take such staff on with absolute impunity. The new section in this amendment redresses that imbalance. It sends a clear message to employers that exploitative activity of this nature is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will not knowingly grant an employment permit where the employer in question is attempting to substitute personnel from outside the European economic area for Irish or other EEA personnel. Not to have a legal sanction against an employer who is illegally employing non-EEA personnel would mean there would be no effective legal sanction to counter undesirable labour substitution. This would certainly help to erode the social consensus in support of legal economic migration, which has been in existence here in recent years. In time this could constitute a threat to social equilibrium at local level. In that context, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has expressed concerns regarding labour substitution to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and has reiterated these concerns in the context of the current partnership talks.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of the new section simply restates the current law &ndash; at Article 4(1) of the Aliens Order 1946, which will be revoked by subsection (13) &ndash; making it an offence for a non-national to take up or be in employment unless there is an employment permit issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This restriction does not apply to all non-nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (11) lists the categories of non-national that are exempt from the employment permit requirement and whose employment therefore is not encompassed by this provision. These categories are: recognised refugees &ndash; paragraph (<i>a</i>) &ndash; and members of their families who have been admitted to the State to join them &ndash; paragraph (<i>b</i>); programme refugees admitted under section 24 of the Refugee Act, which is also covered in paragraph (<i>b</i>); EU nationals, nationals of the three additional states of the European <Col N="29" />economic area &ndash; Norwegians, Icelanders and citizens of Liechtenstein &ndash; and Swiss nationals, all of whom are entitled to participate in the Irish labour market by virtue of our membership of the EU or other international agreements; and other non-nationals whose permission to remain in the State includes a condition that they may work without an employment permit. The latter category includes those who, though not refugees, have been given permission to remain in the State for reasons of a humanitarian nature as well as those whose basis for remaining in the State is that they are parents of Irish citizen children.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) is new law. It makes it an offence for an employer to employ a non-national to whom this section applies unless the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has issued an employment permit. I am sure Senators will agree it is right that we should take this legislative opportunity to redress the imbalance that has hitherto existed. It makes no sense that, in the context of what can be seen as an exploitative relationship, the person doing the exploiting should go unpunished.</P>
    <P>A measure of the relative degree of wrongdoing on either side of the contractual relationship between employer and non-national employee in this situation can be seen in subsection (3), which specifies the punishments. For the employee, the offence is minor, triable summarily in the District Court and subject to a maximum fine of &euro;3,000 and/or 12 months' imprisonment. The employer offence, on the other hand, can be prosecuted either as a summary offence or in the Circuit Court on indictment. If prosecuted on indictment, an employer may be fined up to &euro;250,000 and may in addition face a prison sentence of up to ten years. This approach reflects the Government's view that there is scope for an employer to commit wrongs of a considerably greater magnitude than those committed by an employee. I accept, of course, that this is not likely to be the situation in all cases.</P>
    <P>The effect of the defence set out at subsection (5) is to place an onus on all employers, before they employ a person, to carry out reasonably thorough checks to satisfy themselves either that the prospective employee, if a non-national, does not need an employment permit or else that an employment permit has been obtained.</P>
    <P>The fact that employing non-nationals without employment permits will now be a criminal offence &ndash; and potentially one of great seriousness &ndash; makes it necessary to ensure that sufficient powers exist to enable such offences to be identified and detected. Accordingly, subsections (5) to (9) of this new section provide powers for a garda to search premises, by warrant of the District Court if necessary, to prosecute for the obstruction of such searches and to arrest an obstructer without a warrant.</P>
    <P>This amendment is, as I have said, an interim measure while the development of the main Employment Permits Bill continues between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employ<Col N="30" />ment and the parliamentary counsel to the Government. I am pleased to have been able to facilitate my Government colleague by bringing forward this interim provision. Its presence in the Bill underlines the seriousness with which the Government generally views the exploitative behaviour of employers and gives a clear signal to those who are taking advantage of vulnerable people. We are saying with this legislation that we will not tolerate this form of abuse and we will say it again in an even more targeted way when the new Bill comes on stream. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3)(<i>a</i>), to delete &ldquo;both, or&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;both&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the idea of legislating to prevent the employment of illegal persons, but the provision in this section is extreme. Many Irish people have worked illegally in other countries over the years. We need controls, but we also need balance and this section is not balanced. The penalty in subsection 3(<i>b</i>) is excessive and is anti-business in nature. The Minister said the Government intends to publish a Bill on employment permits. There should be a proper system for economic immigration into this country, involving the issuing of green cards. Until that is done, we should not be heavy-handed with employers.</P>
      <P>Many people come here as economic migrants, which was the only reason Irish people went to other countries. We should have a fair system. The current system is not fair, it is restrictive and the issuing of work permits means that employees are indentured to one employer. We recently saw the case of the Brazilian workers who suffered extremely bad employment conditions. When they had to give up that work, they had to return to Brazil. They could not seek other jobs here without getting additional work permits. That system is too restrictive.</P>
      <P>We need to allow asylum seekers to work after a reasonable period and we need to do more to help countries whose people have to emigrate for economic reasons. We need to do more about our overseas development aid, which we recently cut back substantially. All those things should be in place before we become heavy-handed in the manner being employed here.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 12 seeks to allow for the fine, which will not exceed &euro;3,000, and the 12 months' imprisonment because that is reasonable. However, subsection (<i>b</i>) is unreasonable and amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 12 seeks to eliminate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>As an employer who has employed permit holders, I would be delighted to see this provision included in the Bill. I am only too well aware of employers who have exploited this system and agents who seek permits under false pretences. Those permits are then sold on, thereby duping innocent people &ndash; if they can be called that &ndash; entering this country. There is a huge trade in permits. I became aware of an example today in my own business when I was approached by somebody with a false permit. The law needs to be draconian to bring home to employers that they cannot have someone on their premises who is not employed in the correct fashion.</P>
      <P>It is anything but anti-business. It is pro-business in that it ensures that employers operate on a level playing field and cannot avoid looking after employees they bring into the country by, for example, not paying taxes on their behalf or failing to get proper tax clearance certificates for them. I am aware of cases of employees still paying emergency tax after eight months on the books.</P>
      <P>A draconian law would have a similar effect to the penalty points system in transport and would lead to this whole area being tightened up. People pay heed to the law when it is severe. Having seen at first hand the abuses that can take place in what can best be described as the market in permits, I welcome the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister and Senator Morrissey. Business is undermined when some employers do not play by the rules. Senator Tuffy referred to economic migrants. As we have a common travel area with Britain, this does not really arise, but, as is clear from the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, the United States actively encouraged economic migration from this country.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Morrissey's point on minor penalties. It is not just a question of the law being heavy handed. The judge in each case will decide what is appropriate in the circumstances. By and large, judges do not act in a heavy handed manner. As far as I have observed, they rarely avail of maximum penalties. A fine of &euro;1,000, &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 is of no consequence to the employers in question and will not deter them from taking risks. The case for this section is well founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2001 some 2,600 work permit employees changed employer and the figure is likely to exceed 3,000 in 2000. There is no question, therefore, of people being handcuffed to a particular employer. If the measure was draconian or anti-business, I would be the last to propose it. One must distinguish between legitimate business and unfair business. Those who obey the rules deserve to be protected from competition from those who flout the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of bonded labour, which was the phrase used, one has to bear in mind that some<Col N="32" />body who is working collusively with an employer in a workplace, be it in a domestic situation, a hotel, a small business or even a farm or stud farm, is immensely vulnerable to being exploited and is in a position to have his or her wages driven down and the right to join a union severely curtailed. He or she is also effectively open to being expelled from the country for the slightest act of insolence or disagreeability towards the employer. The provision is protective of employees because to allow employers to exploit employees or face small penalties compared to significant economic gain would give rise to grave difficulties and would expose employees to serious exploitation.</P>
    <P>While I accept the penalties on indictment are severe, one must remember that for a case to go on indictment the Director of Public Prosecutions would have to be of the view that it was of such seriousness as to warrant a jury trial and that the penalties available in the District Court were not appropriate for it. It is hard to think of a particular case which could involve imprisonment. If, however, somebody running a large vegetable farm, for example, was found to have employed 25 people in appalling circumstances for a long period, that person should face very serious penalties, especially if it was to transpire that the employees had the threat of exposure or being dumped out of the country held over them every time they asked for economic justice. This measure is good news from an employer perspective, but even better news from a worker perspective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more inclined to accept the Minister's comments on the issue of collusion between an illegal alien and an employer if people had more options to come here to work. These options are limited under the current system.</P>
      <P>On the points made by Senator Morrissey, employers need employees, which is surely the primary reason an employer would employ someone. The Senator is confusing the issue of exploitation with those raised in the amendment. It is a different matter. We had the recent case, for example, of Brazilian workers being exploited, despite having permits. We also have underage children working, yet we do not take such a heavy-handed approach to their employers.</P>
      <P>If we had a proper green card system and a system which allowed asylum seekers to work, these provisions would be more acceptable. I agree we should do more to protect employees' rights, but that is a different issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 40,000 work permits were issued in 2002, of which 16,500 were renewals. This means 25,000 economic migrants entered the country in 2002 and were facilitated with work permits, a very significant inflow. I ask Senator Tuffy to have regard to the interests of workers here, who have to be protected against unfair competition. Whereas one might reason<Col N="33" />ably argue that in working the individual act of an individual illegal migrant is understandable and is motivated by economic need, the cumulative effect of employers taking on people whom they can exploit and whose wages they can keep down because of the inequality of bargaining power is to enable employers to drive down the general level of wages which ought to be paid in a particular sphere and to undermine organised labour's capacity to defend the rights of legitimate workers in those fields.</P>
      <P>The amendments are misconceived and it is appropriate to hold out to employers very serious sanctions in order that they do not doubt that the State will not tolerate under any circumstances a deliberate breach of the law by employers in circumstances where, until now, the only person committing a criminal offence has been the unfortunate employee.</P>

      <P>The amendment would create open season on the labour market by providing that all non-nationals entitled to be in the State would be free from the obligation to obtain an employment permit. The wording would exempt all non-nationals and then particularise a group of non-nationals, somewhat redundantly, who would be exempt on particular grounds. Thus, many non-EEA nationals who would come here on a holiday or a short study course, for example, would, under this amendment, be potential employees in the State and would be entitled to take up work as the opportunity arose.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be delighted to know my speaking note suggests this is a buccaneering, free market approach and, in so far as that shows a change of heart on her behalf, I would almost be sympathetic to it. However, there would be chaos if everybody who came here for a holiday or study course could take up employment. It would not have a beneficial effect.</P>
      <P>Many changes have been made to the rules governing work in the State for non-EEA nationals, which have considerably eased restrictions on entering the workplace, but there is also a need to provide sufficient safeguards to protect the best interests of the domestic workforce. The freedom of movement of EEA nationals and their dependants is not an absolute right but is subject to public policy concerns and this applies to EEA nationals and their dependants who come here to work. We are some way off global freedom of access to the Irish workplace and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in particular, would agree the amendment would not be in the interest of Irish workers.</P>

      <P>The position is that this happens on occasion but it is entirely informal and, strictly, <i>ultra vires</i> for a tribunal member to express such a recommendation. However, the view of the tribunal member in such a matter is irrelevant since he or she is there to determine one fact only, that is, whether the applicant who is appealing to the tribunal is entitled to be considered a refugee. An entirely separate procedure follows a rejection of an appeal. The individual in question is written to and notified of the rejection and is informed that he or she has the right to make an application to remain in the State on a humanitarian basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances representations made by the failed appellant are carefully considered on an individual basis by officials advising the Minister and by the Minister himself or herself. I do not see why we should begin to blur the distinction and ask the tribunal, whose job is to determine appeals on a point of law for the pur<Col N="36" />pose of the 1951 convention, to rove outside its function and express policy or humanitarian opinions. It is not employed to look at those issues. Strictly speaking, if it was receiving evidence, it might be argued in so far as it was not directly relevant to its sole and primary function &ndash; to determine people's status under the convention &ndash; it might be trespassing outside its remit.</P>
    <P>If one is appealing against the applications commission decision, one wants a hearing where the issues are straightforward and narrow, where one's lawyers understand them and are not under pressure to bring extraneous matters, such as the state of one's health, family circumstances and so on, before the tribunal, even though they might well inspire the Minister to exercise his or her humanitarian powers under the Act. If a statutory entitlement was to be established on the part of the tribunal member to make recommendations of this kind, the scope would be widened, <i>de facto</i>, of all tribunal proceedings to sweep in every factor which could be relevant to the humanitarian aspect. The tribunals would be lengthened and people asked to deal with questions twice when once would be quite sufficient.</P>
    <P>Senators may be aware that there are negotiations at Justice and Home Affairs Council level of the European Union for a proposed Council directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third party nationals and stateless persons as refugees and as persons who would otherwise need international protection. This proposal sets out minimum standards relating to eligibility criteria for refugee status and subsidiary protection in the European Union and the entitlements of the persons who qualify for such protection. When the proposal is fully adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council other than refugee status, it will, in effect, define a protected status other than refugee status other than under the 1951 convention which states can offer to persons found to be in need of such protection. It is expected that the proposal will be adopted by the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>Some tribunal members informally express an opinion. If I was to formalise this into a statutory regime, they would have to amplify the scope of their hearing to deal with all humanitarian concerns as it would be unfair to give them a function and at the same time not allow the party to provide the material to them to exercise that function. The present situation is quite satisfactory. If and when the European Union comes up with a subsidiary protection code, that, too, will have to be transposed into Irish law in a manner which will go some way towards addressing the Senator's concerns.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following new paragraph;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) in section 8(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) after &lsquo;after' by <Col N="37" />the insertion of &lsquo;such person has had a reasonable opportunity for access to legal advice subsequent to'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment would allow an asylum seeker the opportunity to get legal advice before being interviewed on arrival in the State, which is reasonable. We recognise in our legal system that people should have the right to legal advice. We should secure this for persons, particularly asylum seekers, who are very vulnerable when they get here. Distressing circumstances may have led to their coming. The amendment is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is opposed. The interview conducted by an immigration officer under subsection 8(1) of the Refugee Act, 1996 takes place where a person arriving at the frontiers of the State seeks asylum and is for the purpose of establishing certain basic facts: whether the person wishes to make an application for a declaration under section 8 of the Refugee Act, 1996 and, if he or she does so wish, the general grounds upon which the application is based, the identity of the person, the nationality and country of origin of the person, the mode of transport used and the route travelled by the person to the State, the reason the person came to the State and the legal basis for the entry into or presence in the State of the person.</P>
      <P>Where necessary and possible, the interview is to be conducted with the assistance of an interpreter. A record of the interview is kept by the immigration officer or authorised officer conducting it. I do not see how the information requested at this interview requires access to legal advice. It is very straightforward: &ldquo;Who are you? What is your nationality or place of origin? How did you come to Ireland and by what form of transport? Why did you come to Ireland? Have you got a passport, visa, work permit or anything that may show a legal basis for entering the State?&rdquo; That is within the range of questions that an immigration officer would ask any intending entrant to the State.</P>
      <P>It is only where the person indicates that he or she is seeking protection, or otherwise indicates that a fear of persecution underlies his or her unwillingness to go back that he or she is told, as required by section 8(1) of the Refugee Act, of the possibility of applying for asylum. If the application is made, clearly the person is one who must be admitted to the State under section 9 of the Refugee Act, 1996. Every immigration officer is given training to ensure he or she is fully aware of the requirements of the Refugee Act, 1996. The UNHCR has also participated in training in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the person seeks asylum he or she is subject to the provisions of the Refugee Act, 1996 and will have access to a fully independent investigation body, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, a fully independent appeals body, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, and legal representation at both investigative and, if necessary, appeal stage. He or she is also entitled <Col N="38" />to consult the UNHCR representative to Ireland. Under section 11(8) of the Refugee Act, 1996 an asylum seeker is given written notice of these and other entitlements and obligations that apply to the investigation of an asylum claim.</P>
    <P>The practicalities of the proposed amendment would require the permanent presence of a legal representative at each port and airport in the State where non-nationals are authorised to enter. I am satisfied that a legal representative is not required to mediate an interview under section 8 (1)(<i>a</i>) any more than such a service is required where an application is made &ldquo;in-country&rdquo; at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner where the vast majority of applications are made. The amendment advocates a system that is unnecessary and wasteful of resources that are better deployed in the investigation of the application.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements were adequate to meet the stringent human rights standards of Deputy Joan Burton when, as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, she piloted the Refugee Bill through the Oireachtas. If section 8(1) was good enough for her, then it is good enough for me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be a reasonable measure. The Minister said most people present themselves at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner to apply for asylum. However, it is different for someone who has just arrived in the country. We are creating barriers for those applying for asylum. It would be helpful for them to have legal advice as they are asked about the legal basis for their presence. Making them aware of their legal rights would be a positive step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator looks at the section, far from being a barrier, it is facilitating. It requires certain matters to be drawn to the attention of potential asylum seekers. We could have a situation where no interview could take place under the section at Dublin Airport, Dún Laoghaire or anywhere else unless a lawyer was present.</P>
      <P>To make any sense of the amendment it would be necessary for the immigration officer to draw to the attention of the person that they could have a lawyer present and to give them lists of lawyers. Asylum-seekers are hardly going to say that they want eminent senior counsel or solicitors known to them. It would mean in effect that the whole process would grind to a halt and any capacity to make a fairly instant appraisal of the situation or to sort out whether they were dealing with an application for asylum or not would have to be deferred until lawyers became involved in the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That then carries with it the unmentionable factor of cost. How much would it cost to have a solicitor summoned to Dublin Airport at half past one in the morning to deal with one person who has come in on a flight? We cannot have a situation where there is just one lawyer who is a State <Col N="39" />employee. We would immediately be told that it would have to be a lawyer of choice quite independent of the whole procedure and presumably it would have to be somebody chosen from a panel. The implications of paying lawyers' fees to people to get up out of bed to explain a very basic interview to an asylum-seeker would, in my view, be equally frightening in economic terms. I am opposed to the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This consists of a set of amendments to the Refugee Act, 1996, which are designed to address the problems of abandoned cases in a way that preserves the standards of fairness to individual applicants of the present arrangements but at the same time improves on the efficiency of the system, an improvement which is in the interests of asylum-seekers as a whole and in the interests of the taxpayers who fund the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feature of the Irish asylum process is the high proportion of cases where the independent Refugee Applications Commission is unable to complete the investigation of the asylum claim because the applicant turns out to be unavailable. Over 6,000 applications were withdrawn last year alone, a figure equivalent to 52% of all asylum applications lodged in 2002. Some 12,677 interviews were scheduled between January and December 2002. I want to make it clear that these are scheduled in circumstances where the preparation is done by the official in question. Very frequently, arrangements are made for lawyers and interpreters to be present. These arrangements are made and a time is provided in very dignified and decent circumstances in the ORAC offices in Dublin. Of the 12,677 interviews, only 5,997, that is 47%, proceeded. Of those who did not show for interview, a total of 1,380 failed to attend again on the second time of asking. That is the equivalent of 12% of all asylum applications lodged in 2002. Senators will perhaps be surprised to hear that in some cases the investigation of the asylum claim cannot even get off the ground because the applicant, having made the claim at the point of entry in the State, subsequently fails <Col N="43" />to attend at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The number of cases on hand where it has become apparent to the commissioner that the application cannot be processed is 992 and that number is rising all the time. This is a situation which was not envisaged by the framers of the legislation but is one of the realities of the asylum process that must be addressed now in this set of amendments.</P>
    <P>The time within which these cases are being dealt with is coming down very quickly. I was at a Bar Council seminar recently where a complaint was made that the process was happening too fast rather than too slowly, which had been the old complaint. Applications are currently being considered which were originally made in October and November of last year. As the process speeds up, what are we to do in the face of a 46% no-show rate?</P>
    <P>That present process deals in a very fair but not always particularly efficient way with asylum claims that are not pursued by the applicants. The Act requires quite properly that each applicant be called to interview as part of the process of investigation. Each interview has a number of overheads as well as the commissioner's authorised officer who has spent a considerable amount of time preparing for the interview by examining the file and carrying out necessary country of origin research. In other words, if a person says that they are from, for example, Nigeria or Somalia, the officer dealing with the case has to read up on the political situation in the country concerned or whatever form of persecution is suggested and be well-informed so that he or she can ask intelligent questions and can understand the answers and put them in context.</P>
    <P>The applicant is entitled to have a legal representative present at the interview and there will often be an interpreter present. Support staff in the commissioner's office will also be involved. One of a suite of purpose-designed interview rooms will be reserved for the meeting. All those resources are funded by the State and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>The applicant is notified in writing at the address which they supplied to the commissioner, or the latest address which the commissioner is aware of, well in advance of the interview and they are informed of the place and time of the interview. The applicant's transport costs are met by the community welfare officer. If the applicant had been the subject of direct provision in, for example, Tullamore, their transport costs are made available in advance. The reception and integration agency provides overnight accommodation in Dublin where that is necessary, where for example, the interview is scheduled for early in the morning.</P>
    <P>I want people to understand the present situation. Unfortunately some television broadcasts show historical footage of crowds outside the old <Col N="44" />Mount Street office as indicative of the situation. A very different situation exists now. There is a very humane arrangement in Burgh Quay in terms of accommodation, seating and a ticket system. People are not treated unfairly or inhumanely; every possible arrangement is made for people who want to pursue their claim, including travel, overnight accommodation where necessary and all the arrangements, including the provision of lawyers, which I mentioned earlier. If the applicant does not turn up, obviously the State resources committed for the interview are completely wasted.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act, section 11(9) requires that he or she be given another chance and another interview must be arranged involving the commitment of the same amount of resources for a second time. Only if there is a second no-show and the commissioner arrives at the conclusion that the applicant has no further interest in seeking asylum does she accordingly recommend that the applicant should not be declared to be a refugee. It is not just during the first investigation that this occurs. While it is during that stage of the process that most abandoned cases occur, Senators will be surprised to know that 11% of appeals made to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are also withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;45 million of taxpayers' money is being spent on the processing of asylum applications, including the provision of legal advice and other immigration functions. With such high withdrawal rates it is certain that considerable resources are being wasted on individuals who have no interest in actively pursuing their asylum applications. Senators will be aware that there is a consistent and substantial volume of asylum-seekers who simply make their original application and then disappear into the woodwork.</P>
    <P>I also remind Senators that this all takes place against a backdrop where from the earliest stage in the process every applicant is told, almost invariably in a language that he or she understands, of the obligation to co-operate with the investigation and to keep the Refugee Applications Commissioner informed of every change of address. All letters are sent by registered post in order to ensure delivery, yet still the commissioner and her staff face a high proportion of abandoned cases and no-shows. We must have in place a system for investigating asylum claims that gives each applicant a fair chance to make his or her case and to assist the commissioner in investigating the application. I believe that we can maintain the proper standard of fairness but do so in a way that allows for more efficient deployment of resources in the investigation of claims, allowing for more claims to be brought to finality in a quicker time. That is in the interests of all asylum seekers and particularly of those who are refugees, who will be recognised more promptly as such and will thus be able to take up the rights and entitlements afforded to them in Ireland at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" />Let us now look in detail at the set of amendments to the Refugee Act proposed in the amendment before us. As an aid in that process, I recommend to Senators the unofficial restatement of the Refugee Act, incorporating all its amendments to date, which has been available on the Department's website for over two years, well in advance of the recent Statute Law Restatement Act.</P>
    <P>There are three amendments proposed to section 9 of the Refugee Act. The first of these, which replaces section (2)(<i>b</i>) of that section, is a merely technical amendment consequential on subsequent amendments to the Refugee Act in this package dealing with applications deemed withdrawn. We will deal with these in a moment.</P>
    <P>The second amendment to section 9 is the first element of substance in the package. It replaces the existing subsection (4A) of section 9, requiring the applicant to keep the commissioner informed of a current address. The innovation is at paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the new subsection, which deals with the situation where an application for refugee status is made but no address is given and the applicant is never heard from again. By that new provision, an applicant who does not have an address in Ireland when applying has five working days &ndash; in effect, a week &ndash; within which to give an address to the commissioner.</P>
    <P>It is natural that someone who has just landed in Ireland and made an application for asylum to the immigration officer at the port would not have an address to supply at that time, but the supports to applicants provided through the Reception and Integration Agency mean that within a day or two every applicant will have an address &ndash; even if only that of a reception hostel &ndash; to provide to the commissioner. Without an address, the commissioner is helpless and there is no point in her staff wasting futile effort in the application. No step can be taken because no notice can be given to the applicant, so this provision means that the application in those circumstances will now be treated as withdrawn. This provision will allow the commissioner to dispose of the growing number of cases of this kind already on hands &ndash; in the region of 900 at present, some dating back over two years &ndash; without further expenditure of resources.</P>
    <P>The third amendment to section 9 makes it an offence, punishable by a fine of up to £500, &euro;635, or up to a month in prison, to fail to supply an address or a change of address. Whereas this is a criminalising step, I make no apology for making this omission an offence. If it is the responsibility of the asylum seeker to assist in the investigation of the application, as is abundantly clear from authorities ranging from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to our Supreme Court. For an asylum seeker to hold himself or herself incommunicado and aloof from the asylum investigation is, to my mind, an abuse of that <Col N="46" />process and of the hospitality afforded by the State.</P>
    <P>It can safely be said that most asylum seekers are allowed to stay in the State only because they have made an application in circumstances where, but for the application, they would be rightly refused permission to enter or remain in the State. The position is, therefore, as follows. If a person comes to Ireland claiming asylum, he or she obtains certain privileges on that account. They can invoke this panoply of procedures, but we are imposing a co-relative obligation to keep the asylum process &ndash; which they have invoked &ndash; voluntarily, informed of their whereabouts in order to ensure that there is a clear duty on them to co-operate with the process.</P>
    <P>The next three amendments are to section 11 of the Refugee Act. The first of these is to subsection (1). It is merely a technical amendment and we will come to the substance of it later.</P>
    <P>The next amendment deals with the terms of the notice &ndash; to which I have already referred &ndash; given to all applicants, almost invariably in a language they understand, setting out how their asylum claim will be investigated, what are their entitlements in that process and what are their obligations in that process. The new provisions are concerned with the last element &ndash; their obligations in the process &ndash; and are there to warn them of the consequences of failure to co-operate, which later provisions of this amendment will spell out. The purpose of this notice is to ensure fairness &ndash; in this case, fair warning of the consequences of non-participation in the investigation of the claim.</P>
    <P>We now come to the substance of this set of amendments, replacing the existing provisions dealing with &ldquo;no-shows&rdquo; at interview with new subsections (9), (10) and (11). The new subsection (9) spells out that an applicant may withdraw the asylum claim. While applicants have been voluntarily withdrawing their applications all along, it is no harm to have the fact of withdrawal and the process for achieving it set out in statutory form.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (10) addresses the situation where the applicant fails to attend for interview. Unless the applicant has a reasonable explanation for not turning up and gives it either before the date fixed for the interview or within three working days after the no-show, there will now be no second chance. All applicants will be told that they should attend for their interview or their claim for asylum will be at an end. Ample notice is given for interviews and times and dates are provided. There is normally plenty of opportunity to rearrange if enough notice is given of a pressing reason &ndash; for example, medical reasons &ndash; that a particular date cannot be met.</P>
    <P>Even if advance notice cannot be given in any particular circumstance, there is still a fair opportunity to offer an explanation after the date has been missed. If an applicant's child got sick on the day, for example, or if there was a domestic or <Col N="47" />personal emergency, such as the applicant being admitted to hospital, he or she would have a period &ndash; three days after the event &ndash; to offer an explanation. After that, however, there must be an end to the matter. This subsection provides that end. Failure to attend for interview is a direct demonstration of the applicant's lack of co-operation with the asylum investigation process and is dealt with in a direct way by subsection (10).</P>
    <P>The new subsection (11) fittingly deals with more indirect forms of non-co-operation in a less direct fashion. The form of non-co-operation of the kind referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>) will generally, but not always, manifest itself when a letter to the applicant about some aspect of the claim for asylum is returned by An Post marked &ldquo;not known&rdquo; or &ldquo;gone away&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) covers a situation where the Minister becomes aware that the applicant is missing. This may come about because the Reception and Integration Agency notes an absence from assigned accommodation or the Garda Síochána may indicate that an applicant has not been observing a requirement to report once a week to a member of the force under section 9(5) of the Refugee Act or discover, in the normal course of events, that an applicant is no longer at the address supplied. In any such case, once the Minister passes this information to the commissioner, he or she will write asking the applicant whether they are still pursuing their application. In the event of no reply to this &ldquo;one last chance&rdquo; being received, the application is deemed withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I will take this opportunity to alert Senators of my intention to bring forward a Report Stage amendment to paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the proposed new section 9 (11) &ndash; as inserted by paragraph (<i>c</i>)(iii) of this amendment. At present, the amendment provides that one of the forms of non-co-operation which could lead to an application being deemed withdrawn is where the person is found in breach of section 9(4) of the Act of 1996. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (4) of that section prohibits an applicant from entering employment or carrying on a business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of his or her application. Although this amounts to a serious breach of the terms on which asylum is being sought, it is not my intention that the withdrawal provisions of this amendment should apply in these circumstance as such breaches do not necessarily result in the person being missing or unco-operative.</P>
    <P>The amendment I will bring forward on Report Stage will make clear that the provision will apply in respect of paragraph (<i>a</i>) of section 9(4), that is, where the applicant leaves or attempts to leave the State without the permission of the Minister. For the same reason, I will also be bringing forward a similar amendment to the proposed new section 16(2B), as inserted by paragraph (<i>e</i>)(ii) of this amendment. I want to make it clear, there<Col N="48" />fore, that engaging in work will not be a ground upon which the application will come to an end because it might be that a person for some reason &ndash; out of foolishness or ignorance of the law, for example &ndash; would be tempted into a casual act of employment in breach of the provisions and it might be unfair in those circumstances to say that that brings down the guillotine on that application in its entirety. However, if somebody leaves the State without permission, that is an end of his or her application. There cannot be a situation where people can come to Ireland, make an application and then go to Britain or somewhere else without informing the Minister or obtaining his or her consent to do so and still claim to be an asylum applicant in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 13 of the Act set out what is to happen when an application is withdrawn by the applicant or deemed to be withdrawn. The first of these, the new subsection (1A), spells this out in detail. First, naturally enough, the investigation ends. Next, the report on the investigation, which is prepared in all cases, includes a recommendation that the applicant not be declared a refugee. Finally, no appeal lies from that recommendation. This is a perfectly logical arrangement. If a person withdraws a claim, it makes no sense that they could appeal their own decision. Similarly, if they act, or rather fail to act, in a way that leads to the inevitable conclusion that they withdraw their claim, it does not make sense that they could appeal against their actions or omissions.</P>
    <P>There is a further reason for this. The appeal tribunal exists to deal with cases which have already substantially been heard. If somebody does not proceed with a case, allowing them an appeal would effectively turn the appeal tribunal into an office of first instance where it would have to go through all the same procedures again. In those circumstances, that would pervert the process of an appeal.</P>
    <P>The second amendment to section 13, which amends subsection (3) of the section, follows through the logic of that consequence by ensuring that where the application is withdrawn or deemed withdrawn, the negative recommendation is sent straight to the Minister. There is no need, unlike the normal case, to wait for the appeal period to expire.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Refugee Act contains the provisions dealing with appeals and is amended in three respects in this group of amendments. The first is consequential on the fact that no appeal will lie from the negative recommendation given where an application is withdrawn at first instance. The second puts in place provisions similar to those for the first instance investigation where the applicant appears not to be co-operating with the appeals process. As with the first instance, an applicant who is not responding to letters, has left the country or is otherwise not at the address supplied or is failing to meet a requirement to report regularly to a garda will be <Col N="49" />sent a last chance letter. Failure to respond results in the appeal being deemed withdrawn. I will bring forward a further amendment to the proposed section 16(2B) which will restrict its application to the cases covered by paragraph (<i>a</i>), that is, where the applicant leaves or attempts to leave the State without the permission of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The final amendment to section 16 replaces subsection (9), which at present provides that an applicant can withdraw his or her appeal. The new provision, as well as including that right, spells out the consequences of an application being withdrawn or deemed withdrawn. The tribunal terminates the appeal and the matter goes straight to the Minister with the original negative recommendation which had been the subject of the appeal.</P>
    <P>The last amendment of this group, which refers to section 17 of the 1996 Act, deals with the final outcome of an application that is withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn. The outcome is that unlike the position where the Minister has discretion under section 17(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Refugee Act to grant a declaration of refugee status where the recommendation is negative in the normal course, under this amendment the Minister must refuse to grant a declaration where the negative recommendation arises out of a withdrawal or deemed withdrawal. An applicant whose application has been disposed of in this way may seek the Minister's permission under section 17(7) of the Act to make a fresh application. However, each such application has to be considered in the light of the applicant's previous history of co-operation with the investigative process. The door is not completely slammed shut. One may make a fresh application, but that application would be considered with some circumspection where there had been a history of failure to co-operate with the first investigative process.</P>
    <P>This set of amendments demonstrates the Government's approach to the asylum process and the offering of protection to refugees. The approach is characterised by a number of features. First, we are committed to honouring our obligations under the Geneva Convention and to giving the protection of the State to those who need it. Second, we are committed to a fair system that gives every opportunity to each person seeking genuine protection to get that protection. Third, we will deliver that fairness as quickly and efficiently as we can. Fourth, we will deal robustly as well as fairly with abuses of the asylum system.</P>
    <P>We owe it to refugees in need of Ireland's protection to make sure they get protection and we owe it to taxpayers to ensure that they get protection through an efficient and fair system that also deals effectively with claims that have no merit. That is what the amendments deliver and I commend them to the House.</P>

      <P>The time limit in the amendment is unreasonable. I accept the Minister's point that it is necessary to promote efficiency and prevent the waste of resources. We need quicker processing of applications for the benefit of asylum seekers, but a five working day time limit is too tight. It does not allow for any latitude. We propose a time limit of two months. It is more reasonable. The Minister says asylum seekers will have the means to have an address, but that will not always be the position and we should provide for such situations. Two months is the right time limit.</P>

      <P>I am shocked by this amendment. The State is being more than accommodating in dealing with this problem. If somebody is seeking asylum, it is in their interest, and those of the State and taxpayers, that we have an efficient system for doing so. The Minister has described travel and overnight accommodation arrangements. What more can any Department or country do to expedite this matter? The last thing we want to see again is footage such as that shot in Mount Street a number of years ago. The situation now is far more dignified. It is perverse to propose an amendment that would extend the time to two months and draw out the asylum procedure. These people are not working and they must want their asylum applications to be expedited. I cannot understand this proposal.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Morrissey that a two month period is grossly excessive. I cannot imagine what could happen in the remaining seven weeks which could not happen in the first working week or five working days. I might consider, before Report Stage or perhaps when the Bill is brought before the Dáil, varying the five days upward, but I could not agree to a term of two months. That would be to make a nonsense of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters have improved dramatically. This might not have been clear to the Senator when she put down this amendment. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal is now dealing with applications made originally in October and November of last year. To permit a two month delay for people who are falling by the wayside would undo all that good work and send the wrong signals to asylum seekers, society at large and to the people who have worked extremely hard &ndash; I pay tribute to them for that &ndash; to get the system running so smoothly and quickly. To tell them, when they are obliged to deal with a case within, effec<Col N="51" />tively, two or three months as a matter of course, that the applicant can take two months to decide to give an explanation for why they did not attend for an interview would be to introduce an imbalance into the process.</P>
    <P>I will consider whether the five days is too short a period, but there are no circumstances in which I will make a significant enlargement. I will certainly not consider a two month period.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister considers revising the time period upwards and making it reasonable. This is not about forcing a delay in the asylum application process. The idea is to allow for circumstances where an asylum seeker might not be able to comply. This provision, with other restrictions in the section, puts up barriers to asylum seekers. Everybody wants to speed up the application process. Asylum seekers do not want the process to be delayed unnecessarily, but the amendment is to allow for circumstances where it might not be possible for them to comply. We are not suggesting that there should be no time limit, merely that it should be reasonable. I urge the Minister to revise the time period upwards to a reasonable level. However, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment at this stage.</P>

      <P>In case I have misled the House, the effect of the amendment would be to allow a period of two months for the person concerned to establish an address at which he or she could be contacted. If I allowed that period to take effect, effectively, many people would be at liberty to keep us in the dark as to where they were staying and remain at large in our society for a two month period. One could not exist in Ireland for two months without having some address, especially when the RIA will provide overnight accommodation instantly as of right. Allowing people a two month period to find an address at which they propose to be corresponded with would not add anything to the system. It would merely lead to further chaos.</P>

    <P>In paragraph (<i>b</i>)(ii), in the proposed new subsection (4A)(<i>b</i>), after &ldquo;withdrawn&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;unless the applicant is accommodated under <Col N="52" />direct provision in which case it shall be the duty of the Minister to inform the Commissioner of the applicant's address&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has provided accommodation for an asylum seeker, it is his duty to notify the commissioner of the address.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment because it would introduce another stage of bureaucracy. If a person was fixed up with direct provision, somebody would have to notify the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister, in turn, would have to notify the Refugee Applications Commissioner of the address of the individual. This would add two bureaucratic steps to what is fairly and squarely the obligation of the applicant. Persons in direct provision will have access to relevant materials and will already have been notified of their obligations under the system. Why should responsibility be cast upon the Minister? If he or she did not find out where individuals were, the system would fall down because he or she would fail to notify the commissioner of the location of a person.</P>
      <P>We have to employ common sense and grasp the following: if one comes to Ireland seeking asylum, one is undertaking a series of obligations, one of which is to co-operate fully with the asylum process. We are not going down the road the Tories are suggesting in Britain of putting people in detention, or the Australian route. We have taken the position which I support of leaving asylum applicants at liberty within our society, free to move here and there and spend their time as they wish. We have provided for them with direct provision of accommodation. However, the corollary of this is that the onus is on the asylum applicant to provide information for the Refugee Applications Commissioner in order that he or she can correspond with him or her. This strikes a fair balance.</P>
      <P>If the Minister was detaining people in centres around the country &ndash; a move which nobody in this House would advocate at this point &ndash; I could appreciate him or her being obliged to notify the Refugee Applications Commissioner of where a person is. However, since the person is, effectively, at liberty, though obliged to reside in the accommodation provided by the State, it is reasonable to require him or her to keep the commissioner fully up to date as to where he or she is at any given point.</P>

If we oblige the Minister to find addresses &ndash; people probably have multiple addresses &ndash; it would only serve to increase <Col N="53" />delays and costs. We have been told that the system is costing the Exchequer &euro;45 million.</P>

I am not legislating for morality but for a crisp, firm, legal duty. This is not a <i>desideratum</i>, to use a Latin phrase, but a <i>sine qua non.</i> As far as the policy of the Act is concerned, there is a clear unequivocal legal duty. In some cases a failure to comply with it is punishable. Once the process is invoked an asylum applicant must see it through.</P>

      <P>Again I am opposing it. The purpose of this is to provide clarity and certainty. If I were to accede to either of these two amendments, I would be saying that there was a further period in every case in which people could re-open the case. The term used in the amendment is &ldquo;reasonable excuse is subsequently furnished&rdquo;. We would then see people going down to the Four Courts to determine whether an excuse was reasonable or not, bringing a massive potential for delay.</P>
      <P>What I am saying is that once an interview is fixed one will be notified of it in advance and have all the period right up to the interview itself to cancel that interview on reasonable grounds. There will also be a period of grace after the interview to explain why one did not show.</P>
      <P>It has to be emphasised that this hearing is a matter of central importance. It is not something for the idle convenience of someone to attend if he or she has nothing better to do. It is a solemn occasion where one is putting to the State the grounds for application. One simply cannot say that one can do so in his or her own time and he or she will come back later and explain why he or she did not turn up on reasonable grounds. This would create an area of uncertainty in which every file would have to remain open and if there was an argument as to what was or was not a reasonable ground we would all end up in the Four Courts disputing the issue with the Refugee Applications Commissioner not to extend the time.</P>
      <P>These are strict time limits and they are meant to be understood as such because, as I have said already, this is a solemn occasion in which a person has invoked the protection of the State, claiming the protection of the 1951 Geneva Convention. The date upon which the application is made to the applications commissioner is of central importance in that process. It is not just some casual interview in a relaxed process, it is a solemn occasion into which significant resources are put by the State. I am not content to have a situation that can be dealt with casually by people who feel they can get away with delaying, frustrating or drawing out the process.</P>

We do not know what circumstances could arise leading to the applicant not responding within ten days. Two months is a more reasonable period. The overall time limits in this section are unreasonable.</P>

      <P>The Senator is asking to extend the time limit, but surely we should be seeking to reduce the length of time. I am sure the applicant will be in the country and the circumstances for the applicant making an appeal are not going to change. I do not understand why they could not make that appeal within ten days. I doubt the value of increasing the period to two months. I do not understand the motive for extending the period of an appeal mechanism. Surely it should be about reducing, not extending, the period.</P>

      <P>Senator Morrissey has raised the issue of speeding up the process and I do not disagree with this. We must allow for circumstances where people may not be able to comply with the requirements. Most asylum applicants want their case to be speedily dealt with.

    <P>I believe the time should run from the time of the receipt of the document rather than from its <Col N="58" />sending by the commissioner.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment because it would not work. If the applicant is unco-operative, and this is the kind of case we are dealing with, he or she simply has to deny receiving the notice or attempt avoiding receipt by failing to provide information about a change of address. This would effectively undermine the entire asylum process and would only serve to reward the unco-operative applicant.</P>
      <P>If receipt rather than sending was the trigger, then the organs of the State dealing with this matter would never know with certainty when the clock started ticking. That being the case, it would be almost impossible to prove in court compliance with the statutory time limits. It would be a matter of speculation as to whether something was eaten by the dog, mislaid or not delivered. I cannot envisage circumstances where it would be possible for the State to enforce this law to say the time started on one date and ended on another. That would not work.</P>
      <P>When one is dealing with cases of non-co-operation it is more sensible and rational to have a verifiable date from which the clock starts ticking, rather than leaving it to the non-co-operative person to establish this.</P>

Allowing people to appeal against the consequences of their own actions is equally untenable.

      <P>&ldquo;(iii) the insertion in subsection (3) (as amended by the Immigration Act, 1999) after &ldquo;under section&rdquo; of &ldquo; 12 or&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be that where an asylum application had been found, on investigation at first instance by the independent Refugee Applications Commissioner, to be manifestly unfounded, the applicant should be entitled to an oral hearing. I do not agree with this proposal. If anything the system should be made more rigorous rather than being loosened in the manner suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the plain English meaning of the expression &ldquo;a manifestly unfounded claim for refugee status&rdquo;. It means a claim to be recognised as a refugee that is made by a person who not only is not a refugee at all but that fact is obvious <Col N="61" />on the most cursory investigation; in other words, a claim that is self-evidently devoid of merit.</P>
    <P>Where the Refugee Applications Commissioner recommends that an applicant for refugee status be refused under section 12, on the basis that it is manifestly unfounded, the applicant, notwithstanding that the commissioner could find no merit in his or her application, is given an opportunity to make an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal on the papers.</P>
    <P>In making its decision, the tribunal will have before it any submissions made by the applicant and the material supplied by the commissioner in the course of the investigation. Before deciding on the appeal the tribunal, if it considers that it needs further information on certain aspects of the case, may use its powers under section 16(6) of the Refugee Act 1996 to request the commissioner to make further inquiries and to furnish the tribunal with such further information as the tribunal considers necessary within such period as the tribunal may specify.</P>
    <P>This is, by any reasonable yardstick, a fair appeals mechanism for cases which are found at first instance to be devoid of substance and manifestly so. The manifestly unfounded nature of these cases will often emerge where the applicant has failed to co-operate with the investigation of his or her claim, has told lies, failed to turn up for interviews or has generally failed to produce any evidence that he or she is in need of protection. The second pair of eyes provided by the independent member of the tribunal is a more than sufficient safeguard against deserving cases slipping through the net. Should the tribunal disagree with the recommendation of the commissioner, that recommendation is set aside and the case is remitted to the commissioner.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary and it would be undesirable to permit an oral hearing in such cases. It is difficult to see what value exists in providing an oral hearing where the applicant has so clearly failed to come anywhere near the required standard.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to seek an immediate meeting with the IRFU in order to discuss the future development of rugby and to explore avenues which will guarantee the continuation of professional football in Connacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" />I am aware that a similar motion has been placed on the Order Paper by Fianna Fáil Members. There is a degree of support from all parties for this matter and it is important that we debate it in the House. Last week more than 2,500 people attended a public demonstration in Dublin. There are those in the House who believe it means nothing, is a matter of no importance and should not be debated. I disagree. Substantial numbers came to the capital city to demonstrate on an issue important to them and the people they represent in their region. If that cannot be debated, articulated and ventilated in this or the other House, it is a travesty of democracy. I contend that the motion before the House in the names of my colleagues and supported by others on all sides of the House is in order, that it is right that we should reflect the views of those who took to the streets of Dublin for that protest, and that we ensure the debate is monitored in the House.</P>
    <P>This is an issue of public concern. The State, through the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, gives public funding to the Irish Rugby Football Union. It is only right and proper that it be monitored to ensure the public receives value for money and also that there is a level of responsibility within the IRFU as to how that money is allocated. Latest reports suggest the Government is considering the development of a national stadium with the IRFU and the Football Association of Ireland. It is, therefore, appropriate at this stage to put these questions to the IRFU through the Government, which will respond to the debate in due course.</P>
    <P>It is right, as we ventilate public anger on this issue in the debate, that we remember that rugby football and its development is important to the country. The IRFU has probably done more than many organisations on a 32 county, four province basis to ensure all strands of opinion on the island are adequately reflected. That is one of the great strengths of rugby in this country. It is a 32 county game, which is a proud tradition. It reflects all four provinces. That is the reason it is unacceptable that professional rugby in Connacht would be discarded, jettisoned and put to one side and the reason we are debating this matter and using this opportunity to send a strong message to the IRFU before a final decision is taken on the matter.</P>
    <P>I must declare an interest. For my education I was sent west to Garbally College, Ballinasloe. I have the unique distinction of having a Connacht branch junior cup medal, not as a player but as a substitute for the final. The management took the correct decision to ensure I would not get near the pitch for the semi-final and final. I remember the importance of my school to Connacht rugby and the development of the game within the province.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look on this issue as one that affects rugby throughout the country. I know rugby supporters throughout Ireland have given full support to the Connacht branch and the posi<Col N="63" />tion it and the supporters of Connacht rugby within the province have taken. This is an issue, of which the bureaucrats and bigwigs who manage rugby in this country will have to take cognisance and remember before a final decision is taken.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this is a matter of money and that the IRFU must engage in a cost-cutting exercise over the next two years to ensure its accounts are brought back to a healthy financial position. While that is a matter for the union and not the House, it would be wrong for the union to think it can put Connacht rugby to one side. Its budget &ndash; about &euro;1.8 million &ndash; represents a small fraction of the overall budget and is puny compared with the amounts given to the other three provinces, Munster, Leinster and Ulster. I understand that, on average, they receive about &euro;3.8 million each from the union. The level of financial strain Connacht imposes on the union cannot be compared with other provinces.</P>
    <P>The professionalisation of rugby has helped the game, especially in Connacht because, for the first time, we see regular interprovincials and European tournament games on television. The advancement of rugby on TG4 has been of great benefit to the sport and those who believe in its promotion. This is an issue on which politicians should be able to comment given that substantial sums are invested in TG4 to prop it up. We have a right to make our views known. A key part of that programming is the Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Ulster games seen regularly on television. One cannot simply disengage one of the four provinces at the stroke of a pen because one is involved in a cost-cutting exercise. One cannot have a Connacht branch without a Connacht team. That is the position the vast majority of rugby supporters throughout the country hold.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when the game went professional the Connacht branch, with other branches, reached an agreement with the IRFU at senior management level that it would meet a number of standards required in the professional era. A regular ten to 12 players on the Connacht team are home grown and do not come from outside the province. That is a startling statistic when compared with the other provinces, many of which have a greater dependency on players from outside. Many of the Connacht players have come up through the system. A huge benefit of professionalisation has been the significant investment in youth rugby and a number of those players have come through to senior level. I understand ten of the 40 players on the youth squad come from Connacht. In my day, no more than six or seven schools were involved in Connacht rugby, whereas 12 competed at senior cup level last year. That is a major advance.</P>
    <P>The IRFU has often said not enough people attend Connacht matches. Per head of population, a much greater number of people attend <Col N="64" />matches involving Connacht than attend matches involving the three other provinces. European Cup matches on Friday evenings at Donnybrook have been particularly successful, with 6,000 to 7,000 spectators coming to see Leinster play. On equivalence, this should mean that approximately 2,000 people should attend Connacht matches. However, between 3,000 and 4,000 regularly attend games involving the province. On a per head of population basis, Connacht has managed to play its part.</P>
    <P>If the Irish Rugby Football Union makes this decision against the wisdom of people who love the game throughout the country, against the wisdom of people in Connacht and against sports fans everywhere, it will signal the end of that organisation and the end of rugby in this country. That is why the unanimous position taken on all sides of the House will send a strong signal to the Government to intervene and ensure the public's view is respected and the right decision is reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I am glad the House is showing cross-party interest in this subject. I sternly disagree with the people who rubbished this motion earlier today. The IRFU is a national organisation and is responsible for fostering games on a 32 county basis. While I am conscious that all sporting organisations are suspicious when politicians involve themselves in debates concerning the ordering of their work, in this instance we are asking the Minister to meet the IRFU and discuss its proposals in light of the fact that the Government is contributing to all sports, including rugby, at national level. As a result, it must take a more than passing interest in how these funds are utilised for the benefit of the greatest numbers who want to participate in whatever sport they wish.</P>
      <P>I am firmly convinced that this is not a question of money. If that was the case, there would be simple way for the IRFU to resolve the difficulties in which it believes itself to be. The cutbacks could be made across the board at national level. Why is it singling out the weakest link by pointing to Connacht? People in the west are used to this type of behaviour. It is a regrettable decision on the part of a national organisation that has benefited from Connacht rugby to an enormous degree throughout the years.</P>
      <P>In proposing the motion, Senator Brian Hayes declared his interest in that he won a Connacht junior cup medal playing with Garbally. That school has contributed several international players, most recently Noel Mannion and previously Ray McLoughlin, Dick Roche&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and Ciaran Fitzgerald, who captained Ireland. They all came up through the ranks and represented Connacht. If this IRFU <Col N="65" />proposal goes through, it will end the aspirations of many young people now involved at youth and school level who want, first and foremost, to represent their province and later their country. That parallels the aspiration of people who play Gaelic football or hurling to represent their county. If any other organisation was to cut off participation for any of those counties' involvement in provincial or All-Ireland championships, there would rightly be uproar.</P>
      <P>It was significant that so many people from Connacht &ndash; including many players &ndash; and other areas assembled last week to request the IRFU to think again. Deputy Glennon, a former Member of this House and a former international rugby player, gave welcome support to the professional players in Connacht.</P>
      <P>If the IRFU thinks Connacht rugby is the albatross around its neck, it should consider the figures. It took some &euro;1.8 million to run Connacht rugby last year. That compares to &euro;3.4 million for Leinster and &euro;3.8 million for Munster in the same period. Connacht is not the cause of any financial difficulties in which the IRFU might find itself.</P>
      <P>There is concrete evidence of success from the expenditure of that money. Connacht has been designated as a development province. From 2000 to 2003 the number of schools in Connacht participating in rugby at any level has increased from seven to 43. The number of under-21, provincial and international players has increased by 50% in the same years. Some 31 Connacht players have been involved in youth internationals in the past three years. That has increased from a figure of perhaps five or six in previous years. Young people aspire to participation at that level.</P>
      <P>The number of clubs that are providing facilities has grown over the years. These take many young people away from other distractions. If that avenue is denied to youngsters in Connacht, the efforts and endeavours of recent years will have been for naught.</P>
      <P>The small parish of Monivea represents a cathedral in the desert. The people who live there support hurling, Gaelic football and soccer as well as rugby. That is what participation in sport should be about. I ask the Minister to take immediate steps to convince the IRFU to allow professional rugby to continue in Connacht, otherwise we will once again be presented with the concept of &ldquo;to hell or to Connacht&rdquo;. This is not acceptable. Commentators, players and the people have all indicated their support for retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan" hpid="Mr. K. Phelan Mr. K. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by the Fine Gael group. Rugby in this country has come on by leaps and bounds in recent years. We have progressed from a stage where we were becoming the whipping boys of the Five Nations Championship, as it was then, to being more than able to hold our own against the French and <Col N="66" />English and even beating the current world champions, Australia, only a few months ago.</P>
      <P>This progress has been due to a number of factors. Through the development of youth, the introduction of the professional game, improved organisational standards and a more professional approach to the administration of the sport in general, we have converted rugby in Ireland from an international laughing stock to the envy of a number of our fellow nations. In this regard the IRFU deserves to be praised. However, for all its previous foresight it appears it has developed short-sightedness in recent weeks. I have no doubt that curtailing the professional game in Connacht would set the game in this country into reverse.</P>
      <P>We have all been engaged by the progress of our four provincial sides in the various international competitions which are now such an important part of the game. Less than two weeks ago the country was gripped as Munster achieved what seemed like an impossible result by reaching the quarter finals of the European Cup following the team's titanic performance against Gloucester. How many more such days can we look forward to if we cut off one of the national game's provincial limbs? While it is true Connacht has not enjoyed the same level of success as the other three provinces and does not seem likely to do so in the near future, by ending the professional game in the province we are giving up on the very hope this could happen one day.</P>
      <P>Being a supporter is always about hope. Only one team can win any given championship. Its supporters can celebrate, but for the others all that remains is to dream of what might have been. If the professional game goes in Connacht, the province's supporters will be deprived of this dream and anything approaching a level playing field. In a sense, the goalposts will have been moved for Connacht rugby.</P>
      <P>What would become of rugby in the province if the proposal was accepted? The idea is to concentrate on the development side. Why would young players in the province be encouraged to engage in a sport when they were being clearly regarded as second class citizens in comparison with their counterparts in Leinster, Munster and Ulster? Would they continue to play knowing that they would have to move to another province or even another country if they wanted to progress to a higher, professional standard of play? Would former Irish international greats such as Ray McLoughlin and Ciaran Fitzgerald, or even Colm Rigney from my county, have come through such a system if it had been in place in their day? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, the fragile state of rugby in Connacht would be shattered and the recent progress achieved by the province completely undermined. Only a short time ago there were seven clubs playing the game in the province. As a direct result of the funding and development of the game, that total now stands at 40. How long will <Col N="67" />that figure be sustained if the game is being undermined by the very body responsible for its development? We will see a drain of talent from the province with English clubs and the other provinces cherry picking the best youngsters at an early age and developing them under their own systems. Connacht will no more be able to compete with these sides than an Eircom League side can compete with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester United.</P>
    <P>The IRFU has been considering this idea on the basis that it cannot maintain expenditure at current levels. It views Connacht as the easiest cut it can make. What needs to be asked is whether such drastic action needs to be taken and if this is a case of the IRFU discriminating against Connacht. Some facts need to be considered when considering these questions. Despite the need for urgent cuts, the IRFU has already booked 88 rooms in the Westin Excelsior Hotel in Rome for the upcoming Six Nations Championship match against Italy. Given that the players and coaching staff will take up only a small portion of those rooms, the question needs to be asked as to the reason the IRFU is bringing so many officials to the game, especially when it is supposed to be trying to cut costs</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first example of such excessive spending by the IRFU. It appears such a block booking is normal for the association whenever the national side plays abroad.</P>
      <P>Another point which suggests possible discrimination against Connacht is the fact that none of the other provinces has been asked to make a presentation on cost cutting. Surely each of the other provinces would be able to tighten its belt to some extent in an effort to save the professional game in Connacht.</P>
      <P>The IRFU estimates it will run up a loss of &euro;7 million this year, whereas cutting the cost of the professional game in Connacht would only amount to an estimated saving of &euro;2 million. What is the sense in this? Surely a wider view of the problem needs to be taken by the IRFU. Surely it should not cut off its nose to spite its face. I urge the Minister to bring all his influence to bear with the IRFU and, if necessary, withhold grants from the association if it is unwilling to adopt another approach to this matter.</P>
      <P>The professional game in Connacht is essential for the good of the game, not only in the province but also throughout the country. We cannot neglect one area for the sake of taking the easy option. The IRFU needs to think of another way of handling its problems and avoid critically injuring the game in Connacht. It should be remembered that once one amputates a limb, one cannot replace it.</P>

      <P>In the early 1980s when I was playing Gaelic football and soccer with enthusiasm, a rugby club called East Connacht was founded in Carrick-on-Shannon. The club generated considerable interest in north Roscommon, south Sligo and Leitrim and many of my friends were involved in it. The highlight of the year was the game against Loughrea or Creggs which the team invariably lost.</P>
      <P>We used to enjoy our trips to Dublin. At the time Ireland was doing very well and won the triple crown. Connacht rugby, however, was not taken seriously. When asked, for example, in Old Wesley rugby ground for which team we played, no one had heard of East Connacht. Nevertheless, we enjoyed following Ireland and participating in the sport. This was during a time of virtually no under age rugby or coaching when Connacht rugby was dismissed. In the past 15 years there has been a renaissance with professionals finally coming into the game and clubs such as Buccaneers, Creggs, Monaveigh and Galwegians all contesting. At last Connacht rugby has come of age.</P>
      <P>With the IRFU facing a major budget deficit of &euro;4 million this year and as much as &euro;7 million next year, it is easy to float the idea of reducing the professional playing pool from 120 players to 90. One does not have to be a genius to understand the proposal targets Connacht players and Connacht rugby. This is unfair given that many players want to play for the province and gain access to the all-Ireland team by doing so. I wonder if the proposal is related to Connacht becoming a threat to the old school of rugby. We are being told to tighten to our belts, which we have heard before, and that &euro;2 million can be saved by getting rid of Connacht rugby. I have been impressed with all aspects of Connacht rugby, particularly the success it has enjoyed. If Irish rugby is to continue, it must include an input from Connacht.</P>
      <P>Journalists such as Brendan Fanning argue that Connacht has done precious little to save itself. The tone of his recent article was very unsympathetic to Connacht's cause and the amount of work done. Are the people concerned really interested in rugby in an all-Ireland sense? George Hook said it was not a Cromwellian attack on Connacht but if one is surrounded by 27 counties which believe they will be all right while the five counties in Connacht must do without, one would rightly think it is an attack on the west.</P>
      <P>My interest lies in the proliferation of rugby clubs in Connacht and ensuring they are vibrant and that people in my area can participate in the game, unlike what happened 20 years ago. If one travelled to Dublin then and was asked where one was from, one would not be taken seriously. However, we are being taken seriously now but need funding and support from everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted there is cross-party support for the motion. Rugby, Gaelic football and soccer are <Col N="69" />played in Creggs, on the Galway border with my county, and such clubs have been part of the renaissance in the west. I do not want them to be forgotten. I am delighted there is nationwide support for the petition, on which there are 3,500 signatures. I am also delighted with the support for the motion, which is deserved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely uncomfortable about the motion. While I support it because it is important, I have grave difficulties about the propriety of the Houses of the Oireachtas discussing the affairs of the Irish Rugby Football Union other than in circumstances where State funding is involved. I have always stuck to the belief, even when there were difficulties with apartheid in South Africa, that sport and politics should not mix. That might be a counsel of perfection but, to the degree that it is possible, that should be the case. That is the reason I was pleased that the other motion on the Order Paper acknowledged the responsibility for the administration and development of the game of rugby rested with the IRFU. That was an important addition to that motion and, while it is not before the House, it is an important statement that should be on the record.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in rugby football since I was a teenager. I have played and refereed the game at a high level. I refereed games in the Sportsgrounds in Galway on wet days and at Galwegians RFC at a time very few people and virtually no politicians had an interest in the future of rugby football or its welfare in Connacht. It was left to a few people such as Billy Glynn, Malcolm Little, Paddy Beattie and Senator O'Rourke's late husband to carry the flag. This issue must be put in context, even though I support the motion.</P>
      <P>The IRFU has done a remarkable job developing the game since it turned professional. It is recognised as a model by other unions. By comparison, the debacle in Wales is at the other end of the scale. One of the reasons for the debacle and the significant debt of the Welsh union, which has resulted in performances on the field not being what they should be, is that there are too many senior clubs which will not agree among themselves as to what they should they do. They should reduce the number of clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Irish provinces have become clubs in the professional era competing in the Heineken European Cup and the Parker Pen European Shield, identifying with one's province is still important and we have a tradition that goes back 128 years. A total of 13,000 adults are playing rugby football in Ireland, 7% of them in Connacht, which receives 19% of funding from the union, apart from the administrative funding budget, of which the province gets 26%. However, the administrative structure is the same irrespective of the size of the province. The cost of the professional teams this year will be &euro;19.9 million while the union's income will be &euro;35 mill<Col N="70" />ion. More than half of the money is going into the professional game which is as it should be.</P>
    <P>We are able to compete at international level. We can hold our heads up high because we can beat the Australians and the English at Lansdowne Road but we are able to do so on the basis of the strength of the provinces. Tom McGurk made an important point in an article he wrote in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, which is inherent in the attitude of all the provinces. He stated:</P>
    <P>In the world of professional rugby where money and transfer fees know no frontiers, Munster remains rooted in the sacred old amateur tradition of playing for the place you come from. It is the parish against the world as the expensive international superstars of Gloucester discovered last week, the furious pride that comes with performing for your family and your friends in front of your neighbours.</P>
    <P>That is central to what Irish rugby is and long may it remain so. That is the reason Connacht must be protected and developed. There are five provincial sides in New Zealand and three in Australia where 46,000 adults play the game. There are three provincial sides in Scotland and we know what happened in Wales given the mess the union is in there having continued with nine senior clubs.</P>
    <P>The focus in the debate has been on the control of spending but I have heard nothing about increasing revenue. There must be ways to do so. The commercial possibilities associated with Connacht, Munster, Leinster and Ulster are not being exploited to the extent they should be in terms of merchandising and so on. Perhaps there is a source of revenue in terms of sponsorship and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Phelan made reference to the travelling blazers. I attended the game between Ireland and Italy three years ago. It was the first game we played in the Six Nations Championship. We stayed in a magnificent hotel, the Cavalieri Hilton, which overlooks the Vatican. It was a splendid place but one could not move for blazers. That has a disruptive effect on the team because all the blazers want to tell the players how they should play the game the following day when they accost them in the many hallways of hotels. I doubt that Manchester United bring all the board members and their wives and everybody else when they travel to play a European Cup match. Perhaps the union might examine this issue.</P>
    <P>I return to the sense of place and players going out to lay down their lives for their families and neighbours. It comes to this sometimes in Munster and perhaps also in Connacht. That is one of the reasons towns such as Carlow and Naas have developed senior clubs. There is a sense of place that cannot be found in the senior clubs in Dublin and it explains why prominent clubs such as Wanderers have not performed. Galwegians were top of the All-Ireland League Division One. Refer<Col N="71" />ence has been made to Ciaran Fitzgerald, a player from that club who has captained Ireland to the triple crown and the Lions. Ray McLoughlin is another who could be credited for modern international forward play.</P>
    <P>Tradition counts in general and on the field of play. It is reflected in the performance of the national squad. Not long ago Lansdowne Road was like a morgue on match day. Roy Keane got it right when he said the prawn sandwich brigade was present to an unhealthy extent because they could pay the exorbitant ticket prices. At one time one could not sell a ticket above face value or one would be drummed out of the union. However, nowadays clubs can put them on the market and accept whatever amount they like for them with the prawn sandwich men occupying the ground. That has been reflected in performances on the field. The fact that they did not provide prawn sandwiches carried Munster to victory because they had ordinary folk behind them.</P>
    <P>The Connacht team must continue. The IRFU must ask itself a fundamental question. Can it afford not to sustain Connacht rugby?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on the appropriateness of the motion were made known on the Order of Business, an issue to which I will return. If I thought this was an appropriate place to debate the matter, I would enthusiastically endorse much of what has been said. Perhaps as a coded way of talking about the overall neglect of Connacht and the west generally it has some appropriateness.</P>
      <P>I am a great believer in the role of the State in all areas of development and I am considerably sceptical about much of the ideological determination to withdraw the State from many areas of activity. I believe in the role of the State in issues like funding sport and other sorts of voluntary activity. However, in order for that to work successfully one has to be extremely careful not to let a situation develop where the State believes it can tell voluntary groups what they should do in detail with those resources. There has been considerable controversy in recent years about the Arts Council, with some people suggesting it had too much autonomy and that broader issues of policy ought to be determined elsewhere. I am pragmatic enough to know that if one has an attempt to tell a sporting organisation how it should do its business, that will be done by a civil servant, not a Minister. No Minister is going to get involved in that sort of detail, even though he may go through the rituals.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about the priorities involved in spending two hours of the time of one House of the Oireachtas debating an issue like this and the idea that political power should be invoked to attempt to influence decisions by a voluntary organisation which has not done anything illegal. The IRFU is doing nothing illegal; this is a matter of its choices and priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" />Everyone present who is concerned about this has plenty of ways of giving support to Connacht. They do not need to discuss it here. With all due respect to Connacht, the country and the world has bigger problems than the future of professional rugby in Connacht. I say that as an enthusiast for sport and as an active participant when I was able, though I had probably retired from active sport around the time Senator Hayes was born, to judge from his announcement this afternoon. However, every morning the Leader says there are many issues to be debated and that we do not have time to reach them all. There is the possibility of war and how we have drifted into a situation where there is massive traffic in armaments and military personnel through the country under an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement and without proper debate. People in the third city in the State are living almost in terror about who is in charge of their city. Those are just the current issues but I could go on forever.</P>
    <P>This issue is not high enough on my list of priorities to justify the time of the Houses of the Oireachtas being devoted to it. I say that with every respect for those who feel strongly about it, but there are other fora and means for dealing with it. The absence of other Labour Members is probably an eloquent statement of their views of this issue. Though I will not speak for them, this is a waste of the time of the Seanad. It is a suggestion that we cannot think of things that are serious enough to debate or that this matter is more important- &ndash;</P>

      <P>I am delighted to be here for this excellent debate. Any debate benefits from disparate views but not views which try to make us feel we are of such low quality. I affirm the rights of Private Members' time strongly. The party which has the two hours each week is dictated by Standing Orders but since entering the House I have never heard one party dismiss another party's motion in such a perfunctory way. It is regarded as a particular party's business to pick a motion and debate it. The Senator and his party have put down motions and amendments to Bills with which I profoundly disagreed or which I found trivial and outrageous. However, that is my opinion.</P>
      <P>A Senator has every right to put down a motion in Private Members' time and seek debate on it. Members then speak for or against the motion; that is the kernel of debate. By patronising Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which put down a similar motion, Senator Ryan has exceeded his rights as an individual. He may complain about the motion or oppose our point of view but he cannot say a motion is trivial or nonsense in the way he did.</P>

      <P>We know there are many other issues to deal with, but we would be foolish to think that with one sweep our voices could settle all those issues overnight. We would be foolish to think Saddam Hussein is trembling in his bunker or President Bush is holding his wife's hand because they are terrified of Seanad Éireann. That is ridiculous. It is necessary that we discuss matters of provincial, national and international concern and we are debating an issue here of provincial and national importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before addressing the mistake the IRFU is making I declare my own interest. For 18 years my late husband was secretary of Athlone Rugby Club. He then served as president for two years and was a delegate to the Connacht branch for many years. I went on the march and a rather <Col N="74" />foolish reporter asked Senator Feeney and me what either of us would know about rugby. The individual in question took on the wrong women. I understand Senator Feeney's late husband played for Sligo. We regard the time we spent, albeit with our spouses, as time well spent.</P>
    <P>Athlone has now developed into Buccaneers, a joint Ballinasloe and Athlone rugby club which is doing fine. Senator Ryan said we can have no interest because this matter has nothing to do with the body politic and Senator Dardis made a very fine point on that. Rugby receives grants and last year the Buccaneers premises and grounds received up to &euro;500,000 in Government aid to build a new clubhouse and develop the grounds.</P>
    <P>There is much debate at present about the IRFU and its plans for a national stadium in the future. I do not doubt that the Government will be called on to provide handsome sums of taxpayers' money to this project. We should do the same for all sports. The IRFU proposal for Connacht is disgraceful and is an abandonment of the game. The idea that the professional team would be taken away is a bad headline for young people to read. As Senator Ulick Burke said, many second level schools in Connacht have developed the game.</P>
    <P>The IRFU will say that Connacht has been designated as a development province for rugby. That will be fine until the game is developed and there is no professional side to represent the province. It is quite a dangerous tactic on the part of the IRFU. I wrote to the president of the IRFU, Mr. Don Crowley, who is from Galway. I believe it is part of the plot that they will pursue this proposal while he is in office and if it gets past him, the game will be over.</P>
    <P>We marched to the headquarters of the IRFU last Thursday. I was privileged to speak at the meeting along with Deputy Kenny and Bobby Molloy, a former Deputy and Minister. I was delighted to put forward our point of view. We have four provinces &ndash; four green fields &ndash; in this country and who is to say that one province is to be wiped away at the behest of a group of people sitting in a privileged street in the centre of Dublin? What an elitist decision for the IRFU to make and what a note of preferment has been introduced to its debates. It wants to impose that decision on the poor people of Connacht. However, they are no longer poor and are no longer going to sit down and take it. Cromwell told us 400 years ago to go to hell or to Connacht and we went because there was nowhere else to go. The people of Connacht want to keep their game of rugby at the highest level. They have shown that they can do it. They have shown spunk and determination.</P>
    <P>The meeting of the executive of the IRFU will take place on 6 February and the vote will take place then. I ask Senators to imagine a vote that says: &ldquo;We are going to remove from Connacht the high level of professionalism which has been achieved.&rdquo; I can imagine what would happen if <Col N="75" />this was proposed in any other sport or club in Ireland. The Acting Chairman wants me to stop talking and I always obey the Chair.</P>
    <P>I am glad to assert that any grouping in this House which has Private Members' time granted to it has the right to put forward a motion. It is quite incorrect to see matters otherwise. I was amazed by Senator Ryan's attitude to other people's time; it is not his time. We are expected to fall in with the Senator whenever he wishes to put forward a motion.</P>

      <P>I live in a city which has one senior club and one junior club &ndash; Waterpark and Waterford City &ndash; and which would not be classified as a major centre of rugby excellence. The clubs that are involved in playing and developing the game are doing a tremendous job. They are not ostracised, but rather encouraged by the Munster branch in developing the game in a city like Waterford.</P>
      <P>The IRFU should adopt similar tactics in regard to Connacht. When one hears that the number of clubs in Connacht has risen from five to 43 or 45, or whatever is the correct figure&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. The IRFU and the Connacht branch should be complimented for that. The proposal is a deterrent and certainly not an encouragement for those schools in the Connacht region. Anybody who is any good at schools level aspires to represent their province at inter-provincial level. I cannot understand why the IRFU would adopt this policy because of cost cutting. It would be similar to the GAA saying that because there is only one excellent hurling team, Galway, in Connacht, that the province will be amalgamated with another province for the Railway Cup or even debarred from competing for the cup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of what are referred to as &ldquo;blazers&rdquo;, because I served as president of the Schoolboys' Football Association of Ireland and of the FAI youth committee for a number of years. Our policy regarding &ldquo;blazers&rdquo; was that only three would travel with the teams because that was all we could afford. When one hears of 66 rooms being reserved, the mind boggles and the cost-cutting <Col N="76" />measures should be directed at situations such as that.</P>
    <P>On radio recently I heard the president or secretary of the Connacht association speak passionately about the clubs in his province and the need for professional rugby there. Participation in the Parker Pen competition has given exposure to Irish rugby in Wales, England and France. The Connacht team have been tremendous ambassadors for the country in all their visits abroad. We all shared in the success of Munster rugby, and, indeed, the success of Ulster rugby as Ulster is the only Irish team to have won the competition to date. Please God we will share in the further successes of either Munster or Leinster in this year's competition.</P>
    <P>I support the motion. Connacht rugby should be encouraged and the professional aspect should be continued. I urge the IRFU to direct its cost-cutting efforts at aspects other than getting rid of professional rugby in Connacht. It would be a retrograde step for Connacht, for the IRFU and for Irish rugby.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Minihan. I support the motion. I commend the Fine Gael group in the Seanad for putting down the motion and the Leader and my group for putting down a motion in parallel which agrees fully with their sentiments.</P>
      <P>I was shocked, to say the least, that the IRFU proposes to exclude Connacht. I do not believe it will become a reality. It is totally unacceptable that the IRFU should turn its back on a province like Connacht in an era when rugby is expanding and developing in the province. I come from an area close to the Creggs rugby ground which has provided tremendous opportunities for people in the Creggs area. Many people in the Roscommon town area play in Creggs and I have a link through that.</P>
      <P>We should be proud that the IRFU is a 32-county organisation, but it will no longer be a 32-county organisation if the IRFU excludes Connacht. Like the Leader of the Seanad and others, I went on the march last week. I was delighted to take part in that march which indicated the depth of opposition to the proposal. Deputy Jim Glennon also participated. Although he represents a Dublin constituency, he felt the injustice of the proposal strongly enough to come along.</P>
      <P>The headquarters of the organisation are in Lansdowne Road and if the IRFU is short of funds, I would respectfully suggest that it dispose of that property and use the grounds in Lansdowne Road for office accommodation. It seems a reasonable point of view.</P>

    <P>I heard the suggestion that we in Connacht form 7% of the total population. I do not know to which population they referred &ndash; I presume it was the rugby population. At any rate, they spoke of a 93:7 split. That means that rural areas would be excluded from all policies. If the Government <Col N="77" />pursued that type of policy, where would we be today? We would not have schools or Garda stations.</P>

      <P>There is massive investment in the west. It is important that we retain our professional team. It does give great leadership to young people and something to which to aspire. One should bear in mind that there are 3,075 school rugby players in Connacht &ndash; that is a phenomenal number of young players &ndash; and there are 43 rugby playing schools in Connacht. Many years ago there were very few rugby playing schools in the west, but now those schools are proud to be playing rugby as well as GAA and soccer. It is a phenomenal change of attitude. Between the ages of 7 and 18, there are 2,734 under age club players in Connacht. That is where expansion and development will come from.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that we have been joined by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. I hope he will meet with the IRFU. I look forward to his response to this debate. With his interest in the game within his own constituency and throughout the country, he will bring some sanity to this issue. It is a form of apartheid for the IRFU to turn its back on a major region. We were flabbergasted to say the least. I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach would agree that this is a unacceptable decision.</P>
      <P>I want to voice my support and state that I marched last week with a group where there was a massive turnout. I would appeal to the IRFU to ensure that if there are to be cutbacks, they will be made across the board throughout all the provinces. If the IRFU proposes to turn its back on Connacht, it should bear in mind that if there is a vote in this House on funding for the IRFU, I will vote against it. I ask the Minister to take stern action. I ask him to withdraw funding to the IRFU if they decide to renege on the development of rugby in the Connacht region. If the IRFU took such a decision, it would not be representative of the wishes of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am glad he is here for this debate. Initially I had not intended to speak on this issue. I felt there were enough people from the west and from Connacht to eloquently outline the issues on the Private Members' motion, but having listened to Senator Ryan I decided I would have to speak and take issue with the points he made.</P>

If there is a strong sense of feeling about particular issues, it would be remiss of us not to highlight those issues in this House, if for no other reason than to bring them to the attention of the relevant governing bodies.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to interfere in the internal workings of the IRFU and I fully accept that that is not our business, but I will accept the right of any public representative to represent the views of their electorate. If we were to follow Senator Ryan's line of argument, we would be betraying our moral responsibilities as public representatives in not highlighting those issues. Therefore I fundamentally disagree with Senator Ryan's train of thought. If he were here in the House &ndash; he has left having given us a diatribe for a few minutes &ndash; I would suggest to him that we will note with interest the issues he raises on the Order of Business and in Private Members' time in the future and we will equally judge their suitability.</P>

      <P>I have a fond interest in all sport, be it rugby, Gaelic football, hurling or whatever, and I value its importance to society and to the social development of our young people. The tradition in Ireland, be it in rugby or GAA, of club, parish, town, county, province and country is a tradition that young people aspire and work up to. It is a chain that is clearly established in one's progression as a sportsman. To remove part of that chain would be wrong and would go against the social fabric in Ireland which young people like to work up through. Whereas I do not want to interfere with the workings of the IRFU and believe it must manage its own affairs, it should not interfere with the chain clearly established in Irish life and in sporting circles. In GAA, in rugby or in any sport, people like to aspire to the next level.</P>
      <P>We pride ourselves on having an identity, be it of club, town, parish or province. Senator O'Toole is constantly telling us he is a Kerryman, for instance. We in Munster are proud to be Munster people and we are proud to be Cork people when it comes to an all-Ireland final. We do not want this removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members of the Seanad for providing this opportunity to discuss an issue which has excited the interest and concern of many rugby and general sports enthusiasts, not just in Connacht but also throughout the country. The extent and intensity of the debate, not just in the media but also in sports clubs and at social gatherings in recent weeks, are yet another reminder of how important sport is to Irish people and how deeply it affects us in our daily lives.</P>
      <P>The independence and autonomy of the national governing bodies of sport are a fundamental principle of Irish sports policy. Successive Governments have during the years sought to preserve this principle and not interfered in matters that are essentially internal and the business only of the sports organisation, its management and members. Clearly, there can be situations where the interest and intervention of the State are desirable and necessary. Sports organisations are subject to the laws and regulations of the land the same as everyone else and fully accountable, for instance, in the case of any Government funding received.</P>
      <P>The question of the IRFU's intention to withdraw its funding from the Connacht professional squad, while essentially an internal matter for the organisation, has caused a great deal of concern and anxiety and is, no doubt, worthy of debate in the Seanad. Developing and sustaining a professional sports set up are most demanding and expensive undertakings for a sports organisation. The changes that had to be managed when professional rugby union became a reality in 1995 were seismic in their impacts. The challenges must have seemed daunting for an organisation which had been based on an amateur ethos and structures for well over a century. Those charged with the administration and development of the game in Ireland had to react quickly and make the changes necessary if Ireland was to survive as a viable rugby nation with a thriving domestic game and the potential to compete realistically with the giants of European and world rugby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent successes of the Irish national team, including the defeat of the world champions, <Col N="80" />Australia, as well as the outstanding performances of the provincial teams, typified recently by the <i>Boy's Own</i> heroics of Munster against Gloucester and the unbeaten run of Leinster in the European Cup, are examples of what has been achieved by the IRFU in these difficult times. We should also not forget the high quality performances in Europe this year by Connacht. The success of Ireland's rugby teams in international competitions is important to us, not just in sporting terms but also in the attendant boost to our spirits and morale. The enormous contribution that sport makes to the economy is not always fully appreciated in the drama and emotion that usually characterise discussions and media coverage of major sports events in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Irish rugby plays no small part in the economic arena. An economic impact study commissioned in 1998-99 showed that four international rugby matches played annually in Ireland created at least a &euro;60 million contribution to the economy. More than half of this figure was export revenue generated by overseas visitors. These figures confirm that, given the increase in the number of international test matches and the growing number of European fixtures, rugby is now a major contributor to tourism and the economy. The public relations and promotion for Ireland as a tourist destination through the international activities of Irish rugby have a lasting value.</P>
    <P>However, this success has been bought at a price and meant a huge investment by the IRFU in terms of money, manpower and initiative at all levels of the game in Ireland. The achievement and maintenance of consistently high performance levels in international rugby are built on the early identification and nurturing of talent and the availability of top quality coaching and development in schools and clubs, using top class training and match facilities, with referees of the highest standard available.</P>
    <P>Irish rugby plays an important role in delivering a health dividend for the country. Through its club structure it has also delivered significant social benefits in terms of helping to provide our young people with a healthy and enjoyable outlet for their energies. In addition, the skills, relationships and responsibilities intrinsic to rugby and the club structure have had a positive effect on the development of individuals and the development of the community.</P>
    <P>The Government, through my Department and the Irish Sports Council, has worked closely with the IRFU in recent years in the development of Irish rugby. Since 1998 grants to the value of &euro;6.8 million have been allocated for the provision of new and enhanced facilities for junior and senior rugby clubs, including funding for the provincial rugby grounds in Connacht and Munster. In total, since 1998 the IRFU has received &euro;11.5 million from the Government in current and capital grants. In the 2001 budget the Government allocated a special fund of over &euro;3 million to be used in the encouragement of greater under age par<Col N="81" />ticipation in the major field sports, Gaelic football, hurling, soccer and rugby. Since then the Irish Sports Council has been working actively with the governing bodies, including the IRFU, in developing and funding programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation and raising standards of performance among young players, including special interventions in areas of social and economic disadvantage. In 2002 the Government, through the Irish Sports Council, contributed over &euro;3.75 million to the IRFU for the development of young players through a wide variety of programmes.</P>
    <P>The IRFU has around 214 clubs and 254 schools catering for a total playing population of around 79,000. It fields four professional teams at provincial level, employing directly 120 full-time professional players, as well as a further 38 players under academy bursary contract. In terms of wages alone, this is clearly a heavy financial burden which has to be met from the IRFU's funds, unlike soccer, where the weekly wages of the professional players are paid by the clubs, not the governing body. It is clear that the IRFU is faced with a difficult situation. Rugby in Connacht has expanded and improved greatly in recent years, with a growing number of players involved and an increasing number of schools now playing the game.</P>
    <P>The Connacht provincial team has also performed excellently in European competition, spurred on by a large and enthusiastic following from all over the west. A glance at the AIB Division 1 league table will show Galwegians and Buccaneers in fourth and sixth places respectively. This is surely an indication of how well Connacht rugby is doing and must bode well for an even brighter and more successful future. I am confident that the people in the IRFU who will make the decision on the future of professional rugby in Connacht will bear these facts in mind. The IRFU has met the great challenges of the changeover to the professional game with sensitivity, skill and good judgment.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister, I have met the officers of the IRFU on many occasions in relation to all facets of the game of rugby, including the proposal for a new stadium and the bid by Scotland and Ireland to host the finals of the European football championships in 2008. At all times I have been struck by the professional and honourable approach taken by the IRFU in its dealings with the Government. I have no doubt but that in dealing with the current issue it will also bring these qualities into play. Its performance during the bid for the European championship finals was, to say the very least, patriotic.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust wisdom and good sense will again prevail in the best interests of Irish sport, the great game of rugby and Connacht. I will meet the IRFU to discuss this important and sensitive issue. However, it would be wholly inappropriate to contemplate the withdrawal of any funding currently being provided for the IRFU <Col N="82" />through my Department for capital purposes or through the Irish Sports Council for programme purposes in the current sensitive situation. The IRFU is listening attentively to the points of view being expressed by all participants in the debate on the future of professional rugby union in Connacht and will evaluate carefully its options before reaching its decision. It has demonstrated its capacity to act decisively and with foresight to support the game of rugby in Ireland in this turbulent era and it is only right that it should be given the space to make whatever decisions it considers necessary to ensure the continued development of the game in this country.</P>
    <P>I am certain the views of Senators will be taken on board by the IRFU and I will be glad to help ensure the outcome of this debate will be brought to the attention of the Irish Sports Council and the IRFU. On my way into the House the Leader inquired about the state of rugby in Kerry. I informed her that some decades ago Ireland was disappointed to have only one player on the international Lions team. There was great disappointment in Kerry at the time because it had only one player on the team also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>When I heard the moral sermonising from these benches today about what might or might not be appropriate to debate this evening, I was reminded of my first year here and meeting somebody who I thought might enter national politics. He informed me that he had decided not to do so because he was putting his family first. It knocks one for six to hear moral certitude of that kind. It took me some time to figure out that to work for one's country or community is also to work for one's family. This idea of only having one issue or priority at any one time is what I call the &ldquo;parish priest syndrome&rdquo;, namely, if one has to do two jobs in one day then it is a busy day.</P>
      <P>My choice would have been to debate the Iraqi crisis this evening, but that does not detract from the validity of the motion before us. It was not from Dublin or Cork that the phrase &ldquo;gods make their own importance&rdquo; came. If we do not highlight the importance of issues ourselves, nobody else will. This is an important issue that does not have much to do with sport.</P>
      <P>The last occasions on which I marched against the IRFU was in 1970. I recall speaking outside Lansdowne Road that day and saying that if these people turn their backs on the coloureds and blacks of South Africa, it is only a matter of time before they start turning on someone else. It took 30 years, but I was eventually proven right. It is now the turn of Connacht. To paraphrase Cromwell, it is to hell with Connacht as far as the IRFU is concerned at present. I never trusted that organisation. I always had doubts about it and what is happening confirms my feelings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Uneducated as I am, it is my view that the game will never be right until they get the shape <Col N="83" />of the ball right and that will take a couple of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister touched upon one point I would love him to have developed, namely, that rugby plays an important role and delivers significant social benefits in terms of helping to provide our young people with a healthy and enjoyable outlet. I would not stand here and defend the reduction of a grant towards sports and leisure facilities in any part of Ireland &ndash; from inner city Dublin to Tory Island &ndash; because there is a social dividend in investing in sport.</P>
      <P>This issue not just about representation for Connacht. That is important, but there is also the matter of providing people with an outlet through organised games. That is why the GAA, the IRFU, the FAI and all the smaller sporting groups are important; they provide a way for young people to express themselves in a positive, progressive way, rather than in a negative, damaging way.</P>
      <P>This is a hugely important aspect of the debate and must be attached to every discussion about sporting activity. We often hear people interviewed on radio and television saying, &ldquo;There is nothing for the kids to do around here.&rdquo; That is what this matter is about. We are pulling back further from the part of Ireland in question. Governments have thought it important enough at times to establish a ministry devoted to developing the west and we have passed legislation to develop infrastructure there. This issue has to be placed in that context. We should consider the Connacht rugby team as part of a wider picture.</P>
      <P>Taxpayers' money is going to the IRFU. I accept that the IRFU must look after its own business and we should not interfere. However, if the Government is giving money to a national body, it does so with the clear understanding that the money is going to be invested throughout the nation as a whole. The money should not be given to one side of the country and taken away from another. I do not know how we get around this in practice, but it might be better if the Government simply allocated a certain amount of money to each of the four provinces.</P>
      <P>There are things we can do and points that we can make. All sorts of suggestions were made to the GAA recently when people felt it was not sharing its assets with the nation. The same could be said of this matter and we should take a strong and clear view on it. It should be particularly important for public representatives from places other than Connacht to speak because this issue concerns everybody. This is about people standing together and making a judgment on what we need to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" />Another issue, which I do not have time to deal with now, is the professionalisation of the game. I have discussed the impact of this with a number of people, including Deputy Glennon. Once a game becomes professional, it must confront issues like industrial relations, career prospects, insurance, family responsibility and a variety of issues that did not previously arise as matters of concern. It changes the whole nature of the game. If people decide to go down that route that is their choice, but there will be fallout. As we have seen, part of that fallout is that there is a lack of money to invest at the lower levels.</P>
    <P>For Members, this issue is more about participation than about the position of Connacht in the AIB league or how well it is doing in European competition. These are important issues, but what we want to do is cultivate and develop that sense of place. There is no argument that people with a sense of place and of commitment to a place are least likely to commit damage to that place or its people. That is the reality and representing one's club, town, village, county, province or country is what gives a sense of place and of being nationalist in the best sense &ndash; not in the negative way in which that word has come to be used in recent times.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely important matter. The issue regarding Connacht rugby is much wider than the amount of money that is being made available to people in the province to play with an oval ball. That is the issue upon which we are focused, but if we stand back we can see a broader picture. We can see a part of the country which is deprived of infrastructure, which has poor roads and railways, which is beautifully attractive geographically but which is struggling to make itself attractive in other ways. We need to compensate by positively discriminating in favour of such areas. That is the only way we will deal with a variety of issues.</P>
    <P>The urbanisation and, more importantly, the &ldquo;Dublinisation&rdquo; of this country is being hastened by this kind of decision. There is a strategic issue, rooted in the policies we have for the development of rural areas, involved here. This issue is as important as closing a railway, of not putting in place a road or not building a school. This is infrastructurally and socially important and is also important in terms of health and of giving people &ndash; beginning with young people at under age levels &ndash; a sense of purpose in their lives. The sense of purpose they have in playing a game at one age may translate later into something like their educational progress and eventually into being a healthy, involved, active citizen. Social capital is invested by people who give their time to underage rugby, for example, and these people also need a vote of confidence at national level.</P>
    <P>This motion touches upon many aspects of life and living and we do not need to apologise to anyone for tabling it. The Iraqi crisis is a more important issue, but we cannot talk about it every day. I would have debated Iraq today, but that <Col N="85" />does not diminish in any way the importance of this issue to many people who feel let down and deserted and who already feel that politicians in Dublin do not care much about their local needs. This is an example of reaching out and saying to people that this may not be the most important issue in the world, but that it is important and that we understand their position and are standing with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief, but wish to make a few points on this important issue. I compliment the Fine Gael group on its Private Members' motion. We have a right to vote against the motion of any party but I do not think we have the right to oppose its choice of topic. I take a dim view of the expressions of a particular Member to that effect earlier. It left a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>Players in the west and the midlands should have the right to their aims and aspirations in getting to the top in the game of rugby. I compliment the current rugby stars for what they are doing at national level. This evening we are trying to influence the IRFU to make the right decision on professional rugby in Connacht.</P>
      <P>While personally my commitment has been to the GAA, I compliment those who are involved in promoting rugby among young people. If those young people were not involved in playing rugby or some other sport, we would have far greater problems. It must be acknowledged that the State currently spends very little on this great work.</P>
      <P>Rugby is a great spectator sport with a high tally of scores. It is important that we record some of the points put to us by the Connacht branch of the IRFU last week when we met them in Buswells Hotel. The IRFU is a 32-county organisation charged with promoting, fostering and developing the game in all four provinces. That must be recognised. Why is it considering taking professional status from Connacht? It would be very wrong to do so.</P>
      <P>The development plan objectives for 2000-05 have all been met on target in Connacht. The senior team has had a 60% success rate. The branch has developed the local grounds and infrastructure and increased the player base as well as the number of clubs and schools. Previous speakers have also outlined this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Connacht was the first ever Irish provincial team to win in France and England, a breakthrough for this country in rugby terms in 1997. It put down a marker that we had clubs capable of success at international level. It won two Celtic League quarter finals and two European Shield Parker Pen quarter finals. All this suggests that the Connacht branch is doing an excellent job. In the Connacht schools interprovincial competition of 1999-2000 they won three games, drew one and lost three. In 2000-2003 they won nine games and lost three. That is positive proof that they are moving in the right direction. There were between seven and 18 under age club players in Connacht in 1997 out of a total of 1,540. There <Col N="86" />are now 2,750 players, which is again proof of the work being done in the area.</P>
    <P>In my own town, as with other midland towns on Saturday mornings, there are many people involved in rugby training for young people. The work they are doing must be recognised and supported. There is an opportunity for rugby in the closed season of the GAA during which GAA players can keep fit by playing rugby. Not everyone will make the top grade but it is a chance for players who wish to experience other games.</P>
    <P>The IRFU currently has 214 clubs and 254 schools catering for a total playing population of around 79,000 people. Tonight's debate is focused on the professional game of rugby in Connacht. This must be supported. Perhaps we are not getting the full story. There was a rumour that a particular international competition was looking for only three teams from Ireland and the easy way out was to go the current route. I support the motion and plead with the IRFU to continue to support rugby in Connacht. I have no doubt that if it does so it will be richly rewarded at international level in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion and I compliment my colleagues who put it down. I applaud the unified approach taken by the Government side, which has meant that the motion reflects the thinking of all of us in regard to the crazy decision by the IRFU to undermine one particular province that was quite successful in its rugby activity.</P>
      <P>Buccaneers is one of the Connacht teams whose players come from both Athlone and Ballinasloe. Over the past two years Ballinasloe has lost in excess of 500 jobs and if this dimension is taken out of it as well, surely it sends the message that nobody cares.</P>
      <P>I see at first hand in Newcastlewest the great work done at under age level in rugby. At present, Limerick is generating much publicity in the media. This is very unfortunate and is doing a lot of damage to the community, particularly in regard to tourism. As the Garda chief superintendent said, there are eight or nine families involved in trouble. There is a multiplicity of rugby clubs in Limerick city catering for people regardless of their social status. Is it not a pity that the families causing all this heartbreak and bad profile for Limerick are not involved in under age rugby, soccer or GAA clubs? It would be a more fertile ground of activity in which to display themselves. Limerick has an international reputation as a rugby city; Thomond Park has always been regarded as the cradle of rugby.</P>
      <P>This is a timely motion on which the debate has been good spirited. We might influence the thinking of the IRFU, which should not proceed to undo the good work done in Connacht by making a rash decision that would be detrimental to rugby in the province. I disagree with what Senator Ryan said. It is almost as if Fine Gael should seek his consent when it wants to table a motion. I would hate to see that evolving.</P>

      <Col N="87" />Iraq is important and we have seen and read the acres of newsprint generated in recent times.

We would be giving ourselves lofty powers if we thought we could do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis said he disagreed with mixing politics and sport. We must rise above this. I do not think this is mixing politics and sport. I compliment the Seanad on dealing with the motion which is timely, pertinent and relevant. Sometimes motions before this House are timelier than those in the Lower House. This is good motion which should be supported.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to take the opportunity to defend the people of Connacht. I grew up in the province and will defend it to the ends of the earth. Many of my friends in Galway will remember the first rugby match I went to with my husband. He was my boyfriend then, but we nearly broke up before the end of it when I asked him if the team which had put the ball over the bar had scored a point. I think he thought I was not on the right playing pitch.</P>
      <P>When one sees a five year old child asking for a Connacht rugby jersey on his Santa list, one can see the difference sport can make to the lives of every family and community. I will happily admit that I do not know an awful lot about rugby and have never attended an international game in Lansdowne Road but this does not mean I do not believe the IRFU's plan to take away Connacht's professional squad is in any way justified or equitable.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to hear the Minister confirm that he intends to meet the IRFU to discuss this important and sensitive issue. He also said he was certain the views of Senators as expressed in this debate would be taken on board by the IRFU. I hope it is listening very carefully.</P>
      <P>Any kind of sport is the lifeblood of both urban and rural communities. When children and young people are playing sport, they are not hanging around on street corners, dabbling in drugs, drinking themselves stupid or getting into trouble. It is often hard for those living in rural communities to find other outlets because of a lack of facilities such as cinemas etc. The local sports hall, club and matches give occasion for people to come together. Even the AGMs of local rugby clubs are reasons for them to get together and have contact with the outside world. That is what Connacht rugby means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" />I am familiar with the Connemara team. I am familiar in so far as I know it has been successful but I do not know its name. That does not matter, I know it exists and is doing a good job in the community. It is giving young people in the area something to look up to. We defend the right to have this.</P>
    <P>The message to the IRFU is clear: hands off Connacht rugby. We want to maintain our professional status. If the IRFU touches it, it will be the downfall of the union.</P>

      <P>I commend Fine Gael for tabling this motion and my party colleagues for tabling a supportive motion. I express my full solidarity with the Senators from Connacht. Rugby is one of the sports in which I have an interest; my grandfather presented a cup that is still played for by clubs in Tipperary. I played the sport for a few years.</P>
      <P>Any national organisation, voluntary or otherwise, should operate on the principle of inclusion. I am astonished to have to come to this House to defend the fourth green field &ndash; the fourth green field being Connacht. Rugby is not played as the most sensitive of sports &ndash; one has only to think of the studs on the boots &ndash; but &ldquo;to Hell or to Connacht&rdquo; is not a policy that should recommend itself to any organisation. We had a good discussion in this House before Christmas about single gender golf clubs. The same principle applies here. We must have inclusion.</P>

      <P>I reinforce what Senator Mansergh said. In our last debate on tourism I was very opposed to the Irish Open Golf Championship being held at a club which discriminates against women. Now we have a sports organisation which has been given money by the State discriminating on a provincial basis, which is even smaller than discriminating on a gender basis. I urge the Minister to take this issue seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing time with Senator Feeney and me. It is difficult to cover everything I want to say in two minutes. Some 1,500 people marched in relation to what is happening to Connacht rugby and one can only agree with their views in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said that all sorts of suggestions can be made. I am delighted that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has agreed to meet the IRFU in relation to this matter. I hope he will keep all avenues open. Several suggestions could be made and many avenues could be explored in this regard. This is an issue in respect of which we cannot afford to remain silent. I have not played rugby, but I was delighted to use the <Col N="89" />training facilities of many rugby clubs in Munster, Ulster and Connacht more than 25 years ago when I played football. I always take great pleasure in slagging off a former president of Castlebar rugby club, Donagh Barry, who comes from the constituency represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and who said rugby is a sissies' game because the players have to throw the ball to each other, tee it up on a peg to kick it and lift each other up to catch it.</P>
    <P>I realise what the people of Connacht have done to promote the game. Several Senators referred to the fact that rugby is played in 43 schools in Connacht. I was lucky enough to go to a secondary school where hurling was played. I refer to Ballinafad college, which has since closed and which was the only school in County Mayo where hurling was played. When entering competitions in Connacht, we had to play against teams in Galway. Some 43 national schools now play rugby in Connacht. That is unbelievable. When I was in secondary school, Garbally was probably the only college where rugby was played. There were certainly few others.</P>
    <P>I support this worthwhile motion. Some 1,500 people walked to the IRFU buildings to protest over what is happening. This is about having four professional rugby teams in Ireland, it is not about Connacht, which is the fourth professional team, having an identity. We must put our weight behind those involved. I have no doubt that a solution can be found. I am delighted the Minister said he will meet the IRFU in the near future and I hope he will keep all avenues open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thrilled to support the motion. Senator O'Rourke, other Members &ndash; including Senator Higgins &ndash; from the other side of the House and I were happy were happy to be involved in the protest march from Baggot Street to the offices of the IRFU. Without telling Members my age, for the past 23 years I have been proud to be associated with club rugby, school rugby and provincial rugby, at junior and senior level, in Connacht. I know from where my colleague, Senator Ulick Burke comes, given that he taught in a school which is renowned with school rugby in Connacht.</P>
      <P>My late husband was capped on three occasions for the province. My 21 year old son has two caps for Connacht to date. My second son has a cap for school rugby in Connacht. I am extremely proud of them. There is a cup &ndash; the Frank Feeney memorial cup &ndash; dedicated to the memory of my late husband for which juvenile teams from Connacht and Northern Ireland compete every May in Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the IRFU goes through with what it intends to do, I would hate to think where this would leave juvenile rugby, school rugby, club rugby and junior rugby in Connacht. The IRFU has said that what it intends to do will not affect them, but anyone in his or her right mind would know that they will be affected. These children and young <Col N="90" />men do not have anything to which to aspire. I see that in my son, who is playing junior rugby in Connacht. He spent three months in New Zealand during the summer being trained by the All Blacks in Christchurch. He does not have anything to which to aspire. He would like to think that he could try out for the Connacht senior team, but if there will not be such a team I can see him losing interest in the game.</P>
    <P>I can understand at one level the predicament facing the IRFU. Why does it not tap into its revenue potential and develop a commercial focus, which is something it lacks? In particular, the merchandising of the Connacht team gear is abysmal. Prior to the march last Thursday we went down Grafton Street to try to buy Connacht caps or scarves, but we could not get them. We had to pay an outrageous amount of money for jerseys with short sleeves. Dublin sports shops do not stock Connacht merchandise. It is a shame that the IRFU does not run the merchandise end of its business a little better.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday and I hope I am giving credit to the right person for this. I think it was Gerry Thornley who said, &ldquo;If you have got to trim the fat, don't cut off the limb&rdquo;. The IRFU should take note that we will not take this sitting down and we intend to fight.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all the Members who contributed to this debate. Some 16 Senators contributed, which represents more than 25% of the membership of the House. Due to time constraints, some Members who wished to contribute were not able to do so. If ever there was an issue about which Members, representing people throughout the country, feel strongly and in respect of which they want their opinions heard, it is this one. I am happy the debate was held in the main in that spirit despite the rather latent contribution from Senator Ryan.</P>
      <P>I wish to say to Senator Ryan and others that it would have been my intention today to have a debate on Iraq. With respect to the Leader of the House, the time for such a debate should have been provided by the Government. We have a debate on such matters day in and day out. I will not have Senators lecture my party and other Members about issues which we can or cannot discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan holds the unenviable belief that politics began the day he was elected and that the rest of us are here as some kind of supporting cast to him and others. I say to him and anyone else from a certain small section of Dublin 4 who believe they have a right to lecture us on these matters that we will not accept lectures from them or anyone else. We will stand on our own two feet. If ever there was an issue which engendered common cause and a sense of partnership on all sides of the House, it is this one. When the IRFU changes it mind about this crazy decision &ndash; I believe it will do so &ndash; colleagues on all sides <Col N="91" />of the House who contributed to the debate on this issue will be able to take credit.</P>
    <P>This has been an important debate. I thank many of the Members who made excellent points. Senator Feeney, in an excellent contribution, spoke from the heart about her personal involvement in the Connacht branch and in Connacht rugby. She may not know that I spent six years in Garbally and was taught by the Senator to my right, but I will leave that for my memoirs in 20 years' time.</P>
    <P>The point the Senator Feeney made about merchandising is correct. It is related to a point made by Senator Dardis. What is the problem with the IRFU and its constituent branches that they cannot get their act together and get more money in to provide the services their members want?</P>
    <P>Senator Kieran Phelan raised an important point about accountability. There is the matter of the IRFU's current expenditure in terms of what Senator Cummins referred to as the &ldquo;blazer brigade&rdquo;. Given that the IRFU is trying to cut back on its expenses, is it correct that it should pay top dollar for some 88 rooms in respect of an upcoming match? I was not aware of this important point.</P>
    <P>Another important point was made by the Minister about the Irish Sports Council which should make its views known on this issue because it has given good advice to the Government in recent years about capital programmes. As we heard from the Minister, the IRFU has received &euro;11.5 million since 1998 for its capital programme. What is the view of the Irish Sports Council on this issue given its specific remit to help organised sport in parts of the country where social and economic problems must be confronted? Most importantly, the Minister said in his contribution that he would meet the IRFU.</P>
    <P>Sometimes in politics we question our relevance. If any good comes from this, which can only be the decision to reinstate Connacht professional rugby in full, I hope this debate will have played a role. We represent the people who elected us, the ordinary people who, as someone once said, have their dinner in the middle of the day. They want us to raise these issues in the Houses. We are frequently chastised by the media for not raising issues of relevance to the people. If ever there was such an issue, this is it, on which we have heard a common voice bar one nasty intervention. That is the role the Seanad must play if it is to have any meaningful role in democracy.</P>

      <P>I want to focus on one issue, namely, improving the viability of rural post offices through automation. This is a tale of two post offices, one urban, one rural. The urban post office is smaller in terms of space and just up the road from my house in Killiney, which is not a disadvantaged place. It has recently been automated and business has increased by about 40%. I contrast this with the post office in Newcastle, County Tipperary, which is a fine village and very close to where Liam Lynch fell at the end of the Civil War fighting for the republican ideal. The nearest village, Ardfinnan, is about seven miles away while Clonmel is nine. The post office is important to this vibrant village which has a new crèche and whose GAA club is inclusive and covers many sports not directly related to Gaelic games. There are insidious pressures on post offices to close and rationalise. I understand this post office has difficulty obtaining the forms for manual operation.</P>
      <P>We have recently published the national spatial strategy. We are also concerned about meeting our Kyoto Protocol targets. Surely we want people in villages not to have to make unnecessary journeys to places seven or nine miles away. A village like Newcastle is not asking for an industry nor even for decentralisation, merely an automated post office. I have been invited to a conference in Connacht entitled, Rural Ireland: Connecting to the Future, about the benefits of technology for people living in rural areas where the benefit is possibly even greater than in a town where one only has to go to the next bus stop down the road to find another larger post office.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Government on this issue because it has a responsibility to have what is called across the water &ldquo;joined up&rdquo; government where the left hand knows what the right hand is doing. On the one hand, there is not much point in the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, working hard on rural development while, on the other, State agencies are closing vital facilities in villages.</P>
      <P>I am an admirer of An Post and Mr. Hynes as they do a good job, but I ask him to re-examine the position where people are keen and raring to make viable something which will make a real and substantial difference to a village such as Newcastle and, I am sure, dozens of other villages.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Mansergh for sharing time with me. Why has the Government subvented An Post to the tune of &euro;12.5 million over the past two years when, as I understand, it is being used to pressurise and coerce postmasters and postmistresses to retire early from their post offices or continue on an agency basis? The criteria for obtaining this agency status are to sell stamps or pay pensions and open a minimum of one day a week. This will not ensure a continuing service in rural Ireland. Instead, it will be the death knell. Will the Minister intervene with An Post to ensure the money is spent more wisely, for example, in the promotion of rural post offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Mansergh and Feighan for raising this matter. One of the first commitments given by Senator O'Rourke as Minister in June 1997 concerned the post office network. She promised that there would be no forced closures of post offices. The position of Government has not changed since. We remain committed to a viable and competitive post office network.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the White Paper on Rural Development which formally and unambiguously recognised for the first time the special role of the post office network in the community and gave an explicit commitment, not alone to the retention of the post office network but also to its use for the most comprehensive range of State services to all citizens. The programme for Government also commits us to supporting rural post offices. Such a commitment also recognises, however, that services must respond to changes in rural society. The post office network must be modernised to meet the needs of rural customers. This requires the support of all the key players, including postmasters.</P>
      <P>To begin the modernisation process, Mr. Phil Flynn was asked to act as an independent chairperson to progress discussions between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union on the sub-post office network. Specifically, he was asked to review the financial and business environment of the network and examine options and make recommendations on the sustainable development of the rural network in the context of An Post fulfilling its obligation to provide a nationwide service. Under his chairmanship, the views of An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union on the changing financial and business environment were fully explored and the possible options for the sustainable development of the rural post office network examined in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his report Mr. Flynn set out a wide range of options, conclusions and recommendations which included an increase in the remuneration of sub-postmasters, the determination by the Government of a financial framework to ensure the viability of the existing post office network or an agreed modified one, the progression of nego<Col N="94" />tiations on the conversion of sub-post offices to agency status, investment in the rural network, as well as the Government taking the necessary steps to maximise the amount of its business channelled through the network.</P>
    <P>It was in the light of the recommendations in the report, especially the onus put on the Government's role, that an interdepartmental group was established to assess the options for the long-term viability of the post office services. This group's report provided the framework for the development of a viable post office network service which meets the requirements of both the customer and the operator. In the context of the report, the Government, in line with the Flynn recommendations, agreed to the introduction by An Post of postal agency arrangements and to increase the share capital of An Post by &euro;12.7 million on the basis that this would facilitate the implementation of the overall package of reforms, in particular, through payment of a special increase for sub-postmasters. A pilot scheme for the conversion of 26 post offices to an agency basis and voluntary severance terms under the scheme were subsequently introduced by An Post with the agreement of the Irish Postmasters Union. This pilot scheme proved very successful and is now being rolled out on a nationwide basis.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the restructuring process is to allow the postal services to be perceived as an attractive business opportunity, operating on a viable financial footing and meeting the needs of the community, both in rural and urban areas. All parties agreed that the basis for determining postmasters' income had to be restructured if we were to avoid closures and continue to provide a comprehensive high quality service. The pay increase for postmasters, which has since been implemented, is part of the restructuring of the operators' income levels.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to overlook the positive side of developments in the network in the face of the undoubtedly severe financial difficulties An Post is experiencing and which were clearly anticipated in both the Flynn and interdepartmental reports. Business has grown by more than 34% in An Post since it was established as a commercial State company. Prudent investment in automation has equipped the company to be at the forefront of the electronic payments revolution. This is reflected in the agreement with the banks in 2001 in relation to bill pay facilities and the company's success, against stiff competition, in winning the contracts with the ESB for counter payment services and mobile phone top-up through the company's PostPoint service.</P>
    <P>A further very positive development for the network and especially the rural customer, given the number of bank branch closures, is the joint initiative with the AIB giving the bank's customers access to their accounts through the automated network. Furthermore, An Post is developing enhanced financial delivery service proposals under the Government's e-commerce <Col N="95" />initiative and the broader e-government agenda. A pilot scheme providing public information kiosks has been introduced in CLÁR areas. The Government has already directed that the social welfare payments contract with An Post should continue and approved an increase in the fee payable to An Post for this service.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises, as do An Post management and unions, that the company is facing severe financial difficulties which have worsened as a result of a number of factors, including the recent downturn in the economy. All parties also recognise the urgent necessity for cost reductions and other measures to ensure the company overcomes these difficulties. Despite these difficulties, the board and management of An Post and the Government are committed to the post office network providing a financially viable, high quality and competitive service to its customers, particularly in rural areas</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. Few towns have suffered so badly in recent employment history as Ballinasloe. It is regrettable that as far back as two and a half years ago the Tánaiste established a task force representative of all the agencies and said Ballinasloe would become an industrial development priority for the future. Two and a half years on, no commitment from any Government agency or the Government directly has brought a single job to Ballinasloe. While some jobs have been created in the town, that was as a result of the initiative of a local private personal group which was formed as a direct result of the situation.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago 385 jobs were lost at Square D, which had been a very good employer. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. As far back as October the Government knew there were difficulties with regards to this company, yet nothing was done. At the time the national spatial strategy was introduced it was aware of this, but Ballinasloe was bypassed. On the day of the announcement that we were to lose those jobs the Tánaiste said Galway was only 40 kilometres down the road and Athlone only 16. That epitomises the total insensitivity on her part to the plight of those who lost their jobs, their families and the total hinterland represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to indicate what positive steps are to be taken. There is no point hearing again jargon and clichés regarding the establishment of another action group or task force involving all the agencies. I acknowledge the efforts and endeavours of our county manager, Mr. Donal O'Donoghue, with regard to co-ordinating the resources available at local level to bring about a change. While I know we cannot get a replacement overnight for the 385 jobs lost, we want to give an indication to the those who are in a state of shock and mourning regarding <Col N="96" />their futures. Many young people who were in employment just a few weeks ago are packing to move from an area which has been neglected by the IDA &ndash; whether based in Galway or Athlone &ndash; Enterprise Ireland and all the other agencies.</P>
    <P>The recent census statistics clearly indicate that we are living in a town and region in decline. Ballinasloe is a town which has passed through the Celtic tiger years without any measurable growth. I call on the Minister for State to ask his colleague at the Department of Finance to extend the pilot scheme operating very successfully in the upper Shannon region to the middle region to incorporate Ballinasloe and Portumna and the catchment area in between. The incentives which have proved so successful in the south Leitrim area and regenerated a rural area in decline could kick-start a new era in Ballinasloe. They would give the injection of inward investment that the town has been lacking from any State agency or Government in recent years.</P>
    <P>We heard the Tánaiste indicate there would be decentralisation to Ballinasloe. Even if this was announced tomorrow, it would be two or three years before it would take effect. It would bring people in. We want replacement jobs for the families which have been left without anything for the future. The Tánaiste has given a commitment on the part of the Government that there will be immediate action to bring about a change, to bring industry and employment to Ballinasloe. Employment will come more rapidly if the Government clearly indicates that it will now designate the Ballinasloe region as an area earmarked for inward investment and growth, where local people can respond and bring back life to a town which has many positive aspects and where there is industrial peace. We had two flagship companies, AT Cross and Square D, in which rarely, if ever, there were industrial disputes and the quality of their workers was always recognised.</P>
    <P>With regard to the role of IDA Ireland locally, this must be redirected. There is something wrong at the headquarters of IDA Ireland because it will not accept the advantages of Ballinasloe and instead promotes investment in Galway or Athlone. Other people, cynics perhaps, would argue that these other areas are made more attractive for political reasons.</P>
    <P>During a recent reception for a deputation from Ballinasloe, the Minister stated that the Government is in favour of immediate action. We have heard about prioritisation before, but no action was taken. The only course of action which would lift the gloom in Ballinasloe would be a clear statement from the Government that it will extend priority designation to the town in order to encourage inward investment and investment from within the community to return life to the town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I have come to the <Col N="97" />House on behalf of the Minister. I was also present for the debate on Connacht rugby, during which everyone indicated their support for the province. No insensitivity was intended when the Minister made the comments to which the Senator referred. I hope my response will be devoid of the clichés and jargon which concern him.</P>
      <P>The announcement by Square D on 15 January 2003 of plans to close its Ballinasloe plant by the end of June 2003 with the loss of all 387 jobs on its books cannot be described as anything other than a severe body blow for the members of the workforce, their families and the local community. It is a priority for the Minister to ensure that everything possible will be done to find new investment and new sources of employment for Ballinasloe, although I am aware this will not be an easy task.</P>
      <P>Established in 1971, the Ballinasloe facility manufactures the Square D brand of electrical circuit breakers sold primarily in North American markets. The closure decision, according to the company, reflects significant change in market demand for circuit breakers, resulting in over-capacity in manufacturing operations at the group's North American division. A number of the group's North American manufacturing operations have already been moved to Mexico.</P>
      <P>In an effort to lessen the impact of the closure, the North American division of the parent company, Schneider Electric, has stated it is committed to working with IDA Ireland and the Irish authorities to find manufacturing firms interested in the Ballinasloe plant, which may be in a position to offer suitable job opportunities to a well qualified workforce, assist Ballinasloe employees obtain new jobs, provide outplacement assistance and job search training, offer counselling and information to employees on company paid benefits and provide five weeks' severance pay per year of service in addition to statutory redundancy entitlement. The agencies under the remit of my Department are also working to lessen the impact of the closure.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has been aware of the difficult market conditions being experienced by the company for some time and began to intensify discussions late in 2002 when it became apparent that the company was in difficulty. IDA Ireland has already brought one potential client to view the plant and will continue to explore other possibilities as well as seeking out other potential clients. FÁS, the national training authority, has already been in contact with the company and is to meet the company management with a view to offering its services to all staff.</P>

It is very positive that, despite taking a decision with serious implications for Ballinasloe, the company has acted responsibly in terms of <Col N="98" />what it is offering to do. Many other companies have walked away without paying workers their entitlements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>FÁS will register people as job seekers, provide career information and guidance and carry out a training needs analysis. It will provide a range of training courses designed to meet the skill needs of individuals to enhance their employability, while also providing the area with a skilled workforce. Enterprise Ireland began discussions last week with the company to discuss supports for any possible start-ups by local senior management.</P>
      <P>The industrial development agencies were working hard in Ballinasloe prior to the closure announcement. IDA Ireland was already active in the promotion of Ballinasloe for new inward investment, with the key focus being on providing international standard property solutions in the town to attract new companies. In light of the closure of Square D, IDA Ireland has now finalised plans and a planning application has been lodged with Galway County Council for a new 27,000 sq. ft. technology unit on IDA Ireland's 30 acre business park in Ballinasloe. When planning permission is granted, construction will be undertaken by private developers and IDA Ireland has already begun to actively market this facility as well as promoting the Square D facility in the town.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of &euro;120,000 for the work in progress at the community owned enterprise centre and it is understood there is still some space available for potential projects. The Galway county and city enterprise board has been actively involved in industrial-community development in Ballinasloe. During 2002, considerable progress was made with the area community development group with £63,000 allocated to the small business development park which now houses four start-up businesses. Over the past three years, Ballinasloe has received some £350,000 in support from the county enterprise board.</P>
      <P>At Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and Galway University, there are enterprise platform programmes with places available for staff of Square D who may have an idea to start up their own manufacturing/international traded services businesses. This programme affords the opportunity to develop business plans and carry out market research for ideas before starting a business. A similar new programme is about to commence in the Athlone Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to development in the Galway area, it is significant that five new IDA Ireland investment supported proposals announced in 2002 will ultimately provide almost 2,200 high quality jobs in the health care and internationally traded services sector. The companies concerned are <Col N="99" />Abbott, Churchill, Medtronic, Micros and Net IQ.</P>

      <P>Recognising that urban environments are generally more attractive for mobile investments, IDA Ireland has adopted a target of having 50% of all new greenfield investment located in the Objective One region. IDA Ireland has sought to encourage investments in defined sectors to specific regions, which seeks to build on the relative advantages in different towns. An essential part of this endeavour has been the refining of IDA Ireland property offerings, a key tool in winning investments.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland has designed and developed high quality business parks, fully serviced to international standards, and continues to do so. In Tuam, IDA Ireland has acquired 27 acres and is currently carrying out site development works after which it intends to have a high quality facility provided by the private sector. At Loughrea, it is upgrading land to make it more marketable and in Gort it has a 20,000 sq. ft. high-quality building which it is actively promoting for suitable projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While IDA Ireland is convinced that it has excellent quality property solutions in the larger towns in the county, it is also cognisant of the slower inward investment climate that has prevailed for the past two years. This has also had an impact on jobs in existing client companies. Much progress has been recorded in recent years in many of the companies attracted here, in the shift up the value chain of many of these and in many aspects of our competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Costs are a major issue for all companies. They have moved out of line with our competitors and this impacts heavily on lower technology businesses. Hence, IDA Ireland has a major emphasis on the health care and internationally traded services sectors. There is now a well developed health care cluster in the west region, particularly in Galway, which includes companies such as Transition Optical in Tuam, StarGuide in Oranmore and Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott in Galway City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Working with the third level institutes in the area, Enterprise Ireland has approved £2.6 million for the development of campus incubator <Col N="100" />units at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Galway and &euro;695,000 for units in NUI, Galway. A sum of &euro;2.54 million has also been approved for the development of units at Athlone Institute of Technology. These incubation centres support the development and expansion of campus company activity, encourage and support the commercialisation of research and development carried out in the institutes of technology and embed the institutes of technology as major supports for the development of high-tech companies in the regions.</P>
    <P>All State agencies under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will continue to work closely in the interests of developing Ballinasloe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and the Minister of State were alarmed, as were many others, by the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday, 27 January written by Mark Hennessey on what can only the described as a serious staff crisis at St. Mary's Home, Drumcar, County Louth. It is a home for the mentally and physically disabled run by St. John of God's Hospital Order which runs many such institutions and psychiatric hospitals. Nothing that I say should be taken as a criticism of the order which does splendid work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the brothers in the order commissioned an independent report into St. Mary's highlights their great concern for those for whom they care. That they should make it public demonstrates how serious are the problems outlined in the report. It is to their great credit that they have informed all of us. I am worried that this is not the first report commissioned by them and, while the previous reports did not receive such <Col N="101" />public attention, they have been forwarded to the Department of Health and Children. Their difficulties have been highlighted in the past and I am at a loss to understand the reason the Department did not address their concerns previously.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the report is that there is a severe shortage of staff. The independent investigators who examined the organisation of St. Mary's stated there was a shortage of approximately 100 people in the home. This had led to a lack of stimulation of inmates during the day which meant the main problems arose at night when it was more difficult to deal with them. The investigators also stated excessive restraint was used on patients, particularly through the use of straitjackets. Some patients were restrained in all-in-one suits. There were specific problems at night also because there was an even greater shortage of staff. Members of staff pointed out that consultants always prescribed the restraint but I am sure they only did so because they believed it was the last measure they could prescribe.</P>
    <P>Caring for patients such as those in St. Mary's is extremely difficult. I am a member of the board of Peamount Hospital where there are such patients but they are not as severely disabled as those in St. Mary's. It is often difficult to prevent them from harming themselves or others, the reason physical restraint must be sometimes used. The only alternative is to sedate patients in order that at night they are not in a position to move and cause damage to themselves or others. Many of the patients are in wheelchairs or bedridden.</P>
    <P>Is the shortage of staff due to a lack of interest in filling these difficult positions or a lack of funding? Money is not allocated to institutions such as St. Mary's by the Department directly but by the health boards. However, the Department is ultimately responsible for what goes on at the home. Fantastic work is done by the staff with the patients. Is it difficult to recruit staff to fill the vacancies or is not enough money getting through to hire staff, as I believe to be the case?</P>
    <P>The superior of the order must have been desperate to have made the position public. Other hospitals have similar difficulties but they have not publicised them. Therefore, I commend those in St. Mary's for making their problems known. There is no inspectorate for the approximate 200 facilities which cater for those who are intellectually and-or physically impaired. During the years these institutions have been declassified because it has been agreed by the inspector for mental hospitals that the people concerned are not mentally ill, although, regrettably, in time some of them become mentally ill. The inspector supervises and inspects only those institutions which house the mentally ill. The occasional institution comes under the remit of the inspector, for example, St. Joseph's, Portrane.</P>
    <P>The Government has invested significantly in this area over the past three years to improve conditions in units and provide more facilities <Col N="102" />but, by the Department of Health and Children's own admission, there are still people who are not being catered for. According to the Department's waiting lists, 1,711 are seeking residential places while 800 need day care and 1,000 respite care. Some of those who care for patients at home are well into their seventies and eighties and their great concern is what will happen to the patients, who are aged between 40 and 60 years in some cases.</P>
    <P>This situation will get worse, not better because such patients are living longer and there is an improved survival rate among babies born prematurely but who have a high morbidity rate and babies with congenital and genetic defects. Older people become most difficult to deal with because they become bedridden. There is a major problem in this area and I hope the Minister of State's reply will not outline all the Government has done. I recognise what has been done as the Government has made a significant effort but I am concerned about the report on St. Mary's. The administrators must have been at the point of despair to have released it. Is there a shortage of money or, worse still, can staff not be recruited to work in such institutions? Is it not essential that an inspectorate for these institutions should be established immediately?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who is replying to a similar Adjournment debate in the Dáil, I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to reply on behalf of the Minister and Minister of State. She has demonstrated a clear understanding of the seriousness of the problem through the questions she asked.</P>
      <P>The Government has made a significant level of additional funding available to services for persons with an intellectual disability and autism. In 2003 additional funding of &euro;13.3 million will be allocated to the services. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;188 million, which has been made since 1997 and is built into the ongoing budget base. Between 1997 and 2002 approximately 1,700 new residential, 470 respite and 3,000 day places have been provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite this significant and unprecedented investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services, in particular, even though the number in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late twenties and early thirties requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. <Col N="103" />This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.</P>
    <P>Due to the changing profile of those who have been in services for many years, there is a need to review issues such as staffing levels and skill mix. For example, an increased need for additional night cover has arisen in many agencies because of the more dependent profile of the residents due to old age, illness or behavioural issues. An ongoing review process has been under way for a number of years with the health boards and voluntary agencies, with funding allocated annually in recent years to meet these identified needs.</P>
    <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, which is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health service.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the provision of funding for organisations providing services for people with <Col N="104" />an intellectual disability or autism in the north-eastern region rests, in the first instance, with the North Eastern Health Board. The situation at Drumcar will be discussed at a meeting between the Department of Health and Children and health board representatives on Tuesday, 4 February in the context of the board's service plan for 2003. A meeting between the Department of Health and Children, the health board and St. John of God's representatives is also scheduled for the following day. Within the resources available to the health board this year, the Minister is hopeful progress can be made at these meetings on the most pressing problems facing Drumcar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no money available to any of the health boards for an emergency such as this. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Health and Children to address the situation regarding an inspectorate for these institutions immediately.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 January 2003.</P>
