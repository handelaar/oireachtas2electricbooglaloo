      <P>I have received notice from Senator Terry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide a primary health care centre in Mulhuddart at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to respond positively to the letter regarding legal representation for the McBrearty family, the terms of reference of the Morris tribunal and other related matters, which he received from Amnesty on 18 December 2002.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No.&nbsp;2, statements on Iraq, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, all other Senators will have ten minutes and time may be shared. A tentative finishing time of 1.30 p.m. is proposed because I have managed to speak with only one of the Whips. The debate may continue for a short time beyond 1.30 p.m., depending on how it develops. We shall monitor events as they unfold.</P>

      <P>I welcome today's open-ended debate, which I compliment the Leader for providing. It is an opportunity for every Member to have their say on this very important international issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Education (Welfare) Act, passed by this House and the Dáil in 2000, has not come into effect. The 30 to 40 truancy or school attendance officers provided under the Act are no longer performing their roles because of a bureaucratic <Col N="334" />mess involving the National Education Welfare Board and the union. This is scandalous. Children in Dublin and every other city and town play truant every day, but we do not have any facility to follow up on them to ensure that they get back into mainstream education. I ask the Leader, who is a distinguished former Minister for Education, to intervene directly with the Government with regard to this matter. Legislation produced by both Houses of the Oireachtas and enacted for over two years is not in effect and this is having dangerous consequences.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, over 8,000 students were on the streets of Dublin to oppose the mooted abolition of free third level fees by the Minister for Education and Science. As a former Minister for Education, will the Leader explain her views on the matter in light of the new, independent role she enjoys in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should be reminded that the legislation to which Senator Brian Hayes referred was substantially amended by the Seanad. When we proposed to shorten the commencement date, this House was given undertakings that the Act would come into operation very quickly and that everything was in order for it to proceed. Unfortunately, that was not the case.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue related to the Shannon River Council Bill, with which the Cathaoirleach will be familiar and which I expect Fianna Fáil Members to support with alacrity since it originated with the distinguished Members on the Government side. Senator Daly, an experienced member of the Fianna Fáil group, brought forward the Bill with the support of the House. However, when the Government was elected to power, I regret to say that, in an amazing turn of events, it ignored the legislation.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter without any attempt to embarrass the Cathaoirleach. Many Members of the House come from constituencies on both sides of the River Shannon. The Government should indicate when it intends to reintroduce the legislation. I have sought to raise the importance of the issue at other fora in an attempt to focus attention on it. I would appreciate it if the Members on the Government side supported the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week Senator Browne raised the issue of lack of funding for and proposed closure of educational centres in various areas throughout the country. I hope the Leader will be able to address the Senator's concerns. In the context of the modernisation required at all levels of the education sector, such centres are crucial. This is a matter <Col N="335" />of extreme importance and I look forward to a response in respect of it.</P>

      <P>She is also a most distinguished Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>On yesterday's Order of Business, I inquired about the Government's plans to amend the Freedom of Information Act. This morning's revelations that the Department of Education and Science has used virtually every possible exemption to refuse disclosure of information on the peculiar agreement between the Government and the religious orders on the question of compensation is a cause of concern. For example, the Department has invoked the provision on privacy when the religious orders have indicated they have no difficulties with the disclosure of material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader ascertain if there has been a change in Government policy on what should be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act and are today's revelations a prelude to amendments to the Act? The possibility of limitless public exposure to compensation claims in this area and the protection of the religious orders is extremely serious. Apparently, the public is not <Col N="336" />to know the basis of the agreement between the orders and the Government.</P>
    <P>To clarify a point that arose yesterday, anybody who knows me would be aware that I did not suggest that there should be armed soldiers on the streets. I said I was astonished &ndash; I continue to be &ndash; at the priorities of the Government with regard to the issue of crime. Last night, three teenagers were shot in Dublin. I presume they were accused of misbehaviour. If it transpires it was an act of armed vigilantism, it will be a further symptom of the decline in confidence by citizens in the capacity of the State to protect them. That should be the central priority of the Government, rather than the defence of United States military interests at Shannon Airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that what has happened at Shannon Airport is not a measure of the declining capacity of the State, rather it is the wilful destruction of property and the need to protect it.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago I called for a debate on agriculture and I am surprised my request did not receive more support. The Fischler proposals will have a profound effect not only on farming, but also on the processing industry and the entire economy. It is important that the House give immediate and serious consideration to this grave matter so that our views can be communicated to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the views expressed by my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes. There is huge resistance to the Government's attack on the youth of the country, evident in the abolition of the summer school fees and the increase in college registration charges by almost 7%. Yesterday, approximately 10,000 young people from all parts of the country converged on this city to protest against the proposed return of third level fees. I understand the Minister for Education and Science is preparing a report and it is important that the House debate the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There was widespread surprise at the announcement on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; by the general secretary of IMPACT that there is a dispute between education welfare officers in Dublin and the Education Welfare Board. To the best of my knowledge, this morning's announcement is the first indication of the dispute. Those who have been directed and given guidance and who are, therefore, empowered and obliged to attend for work are sitting in their offices. While a transition period can be painful, in this instance from the position of attendance officer to edu<Col N="337" />cation welfare officer, I call on the education welfare officers to return to full duty in Dublin &ndash; they are on full duty elsewhere in the country &ndash; pending the outcome of negotiations and in the interests of children who are most at risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>As a grammarian, I deprecate the intervention of Senator Ryan because his reformulation of the phrase &ldquo;distinguished former Minister&rdquo; suggests that the distinction resides principally in the office rather than the person.</P>

      <P>A question for the Leader of the House, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on the dispute involving the former school attendance officers. I understand approximately 40 are involved and they are anxious to work. However, they need to be recognised as education welfare officers. This is crucially important because, as was said in the debate to which Senator O'Toole referred, children, particularly in deprived areas, who slip through the net once are often gone for good if they are not caught quickly. Moneys raised by the CAB should be returned to these areas to fund the Breaking the Cycle scheme up to university level.</P>
      <P>Despite the protests outside the Oireachtas yesterday, I support the Minister for Education and Science in re-examining the question of third level fees. Funding should be channelled directly to those in need of grants and there should be means testing of fees to help those who most need this education. The current system provides a nice cushion for the middle classes, which was not the intention.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to note that, as I understand it, all Members received a letter in the form of a circular from Jive Ace Productions. The Church of Scientology is at it again. We should give consideration to this matter because, even though the leaflet makes no reference to scientology, it suggests its involvement in anti-drugs campaigns, etc. It is sinister that the Church of Scientology can conceal its identity in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We should debate the issue, particularly in terms of the involvement of the Church of Scientology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I reinforce the request made yesterday through the Leader to the Minister for Finance to make a statement on the state of the public finances and the economy. Examining the Exchequer returns I discovered that tax revenue <Col N="338" />rose by 10% in the first month of this year. This is very healthy, even compared with good years, and something one would never have discovered from the purveyors of gloom who, like Old Testament prophets, are the sort of people on whose faces, as the Leader says, one never sees a smile.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Dardis's request for a debate on agriculture. It is very important that the farm organisations are part of the social partnership agreement because there are many challenges and difficulties ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes. The Leader of the House and other Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats politicians should come clean regarding their positions on the introduction of third level fees. Despite what people like Senator Norris are saying, the available evidence shows that the participation rate of people from all social backgrounds has improved since the abolition of third level fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately not among the most deprived sections of society. This is absolutely true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Leader to raise with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, the health and safety concerns of construction workers who marched in Dublin yesterday. It is a matter of concern that only 20 inspectors have been appointed to cover the entire country at a time when the construction industry is working at 100% capacity. The Minister of State must consider the deeply felt views of many workers in the construction industry regarding health and safety matters with a view to having the main contractors take responsibility for health and safety on their sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in requesting the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Science to explain to the House how he intends to resolve the dispute between the school attendance officers and his Department. This issue is having an effect on our streets. I listened to a report on the radio this morning on children as young as 12 years who refuse to go to school and for whom no one is taking responsibility. The Leader should also ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to intervene in the matter. The children concerned are falling through the education net and will fall into crime. Dealing with them at a later date will cost the State considerable amounts of money whereas if money were spent on intervening at an early stage, serious problems would not be created.</P>

      <P>I support the call of Senator Dardis that the Minister for Agriculture and Food be invited to come to the House as soon as he possibly can in order that discussions can take place on the Fischler proposals and their impact on farming, the agriculture industry and rural Ireland in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader outline to the House the Government's intentions regarding the mooted proposals that An Post cut postal deliveries to three or four days per week and the suggestion that different postal rates would apply to different parts of the country? Surely that would be blatantly discriminatory against everyone living beyond the Pale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for the implementation of the Education (Welfare) Act and to have the officers working as soon as possible. When the legislation was passed in the Oireachtas, I understood the officers would be working from July of last year. As Senator Fitzgerald said, it is regrettable that they are working in their offices but not on the ground. When the legislation comes into effect, I hope the local committees will be incorporated in the system and their local knowledge used by the education welfare officers when they take up their positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only when I rang the Department of Social and Family Affairs on behalf of my local GAA club that I discovered that the student summer job scheme had been abolished. This has come as a thunderbolt. Community organisations have their projects and schemes in place and there was an anticipation that a good scheme offering 200 hours of community work at the princely sum of &euro;770 would be available this year. This is a retrograde step which should be debated in the House. Summer is four months away and the collective will of the majority of Members of both Houses could reverse this decision. The economy is contracting, jobs are going, it is difficult to get into the United States and opportunities for students are negligible.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader invite the chief executive officer of Irish Rail to outline to the House what has been done to upgrade the railway lines? I know the company's slogan says it is getting there but last Monday many of my constituents complained about the Dublin to Sligo line. The train from Sligo was 20 minutes late getting in to Dublin and half an hour late getting back <Col N="340" />from Dublin to Sligo. There was no heat on the train and no one from Irish Rail explained the position to the passengers. This is inexcusable. An apology should be forthcoming from the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Leader indicate to the House who is responsible for monitoring licences issued by the Environmental Protection Agency for the disposal of litter? Yesterday, in the Leader's neighbouring county sludge was illegally disposed of. The sludge originated from local authorities. Carriers of litter and refuse are supposed to be licensed hauliers, yet last Thursday evening near the Leader's doorstep a truck carrying a consignment of litter being, I think, illegally transported from Cork to Northern Ireland overturned. The driver of the truck disappeared, indicating that something was wrong. On examination, some of the litter was found to have originated in Departments and agencies. When the Minister was here yesterday, I asked him to reply and he went silent. He was upset that I had asked him the question.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Feighan, but first I acknowledge the vast improvements on the Dublin to Sligo railway line. I am sure Senator Feighan would acknowledge these also. However, there has been a great disimprovement in the service on the line. We no longer have a dining car on the Sligo to Dublin train and will not have one until matters improve radically. I add my support to Senator Feighan's call for the Leader to get some answers for us from the Minister. The train from Dublin to Sligo is like the slow boat to China.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Brian Hayes, O'Toole, Bannon, Terry and Kitt inquired about the Education (Welfare) Act, which was to be implemented in June 2001. In one way or another, it is a disgrace some of the provisions contained in the legislation are not being implemented. I understand, however, that, with the exception of the part to which Senator Hayes <Col N="341" />referred, the Act has come into force in its entirety. I hope to obtain from the Minister a definite answer about that section of the Act by Tuesday next.</P>
      <P>This matter was debated on radio this morning. The confidence or boldness of the young fellow who responded to the interviewer was evident. Those children do not give a damn whether they are at school or not and that is folly on their part. This is another matter for the education welfare officers, whose job it is to identify those playing truant. These officers cannot do their work at present because of what seems to be an inter-union dispute.

      <P>Senator Ryan asked if it is proposed to amend the Freedom of Information Act. The Department of Education and Science deals with CORI on behalf of the Catholic schools and institutions. I do not know if it is proposed to amend the Act in terms of dealing with that issue, but I can inquire about the matter on the Senator's behalf. I am confident that whatever information exists will be revealed, but in what fashion I do not know. Senator Ryan also referred to the behaviour of armed vigilantes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Hayes, Bannon and Tuffy sought a debate on college fees, a matter on which Senator <Col N="342" />Norris holds an opposite point of view. Senator Norris referred also to the circular he received from the Church of Scientology which puts itself forward as a drug-busting organisation, but which, in fact, is intent on implementing a much more malign manifesto. I agree with the Senator it is a scary organisation. While the Church of Scientology did not write to me, it wrote to Senator Dardis. That organisation was exposed on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; by Joe Duffy, who did a good job in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senators Mansergh, Dardis and Callanan requested a debate on agriculture and, in particular, the Fischler proposals. Senator Mansergh also called for a debate on the financial figures. To show the generosity of Fianna Fáil, it is hoped that, in our Private Members' time next week, we will have a debate on one of the two matters to which the Senator referred.

      <P>Senator Terry requested that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come before the House. We will be enticing him to be present for an open debate in the near future.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan raised the matter of An Post. I did not hear any proposals from An Post that it is about to reduce its service to three or four days. There is an onus on An Post to have a universal service to every area of the country every day, except Saturdays and Sundays. I do not know where that rumour arose, but to my knowledge there is no veracity to it.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins raised the issue of the summer jobs scheme. I read about it in either the Estimates or the Budget Statement. It was announced and in the public domain. The Senator is of the view that it has only come to light now. It was a good scheme and did much good work in the area of sporting facilities, particularly around the country. An announcement to the effect that the scheme would be brought to an end was certainly made.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan wants the chief executive officer of Irish Rail to come before the House. That would not be appropriate, but the person in question could go before the Joint Committee on Transport, which, to use a travel term, is the &ldquo;appropriate destination&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy the House is having this debate and I am anxious to hear what Members have to say. I will be happy to respond if they have particular queries they want addressed.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, presented to the Security Council the evidence which President Bush had promised in his State of the Union Address at the end of January. A considerable volume of material was put before the international community and it would be premature to attempt to put forward an assessment of it this morning. We have been given a lot to consider. Equally, the weapons inspectors have been given information which will assist them in their work and Iraq has been put on notice of the pressing areas in which its co-operation with that work must be improved if it is to meet its obligations under international law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current crisis has been a long time in the making. The international community has given Iraq every possible opportunity to comply with its obligations. For more than ten years Iraq has been under sanctions intended to compel it to <Col N="344" />comply. When it became clear that these sanctions were causing undue hardship to the population of Iraq without having the desired effect on the regime, the system of sanctions was reformed so as to minimise the hardship on the civilian population of Iraq and focus the impact as closely as possible on Saddam Hussein's administration and its military support.</P>
    <P>A key area where Iraq has failed to meet its obligations is that of weapons of mass destruction, in particular chemical and biological weapons. These weapons have been prohibited under international law for almost 80 years and Iraq's Government bears the distinction of being the only regime to have used chemical weapons since the prohibitions were put in place.</P>
    <P>Conscious of Iraq's unique record in this matter and the terrible consequences which might follow if it continued to flout international law, the international community put special measures in place to ensure Iraq renounced these weapons once and for all. In the end, after many years of obstruction and partial co-operation, Iraq refused to co-operate with the UNSCOM inspectors, accusing them of bias and espionage. In response the UN Security Council created a new structure, UNMOVIC, and a new framework for its operation. Iraq was offered an opportunity to co-operate with an inspections process which had taken its grievances into account and offered a clear incentive for co-operation in the prospect of the suspension of sanctions. That was in 1998. It is only now, in 2003, after repeated threats of dire consequences that Iraq has finally begun to co-operate with UNMOVIC and permit the inspections with which it has been long obliged to co-operate.</P>
    <P>Iraq has been given every opportunity to meet its obligations as a responsible member of the community of nations. The international community has tried every possible means of peaceful compulsion. Even at this late stage, in what we all recognise as a gathering crisis, it is still open to Iraq to resolve its problems by complying with its obligations.</P>
    <P>Ireland very much wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis. The use of military force must only be a last resort when all other means have been exhausted. Recognising this, Ireland, with our fellow members of the Security Council, worked hard to ensure the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1441 on 8 November last. As the Government has repeatedly stated, the purpose of Resolution 1441 was both to place fresh pressure on Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations and to give a final opportunity for the matter to be resolved within the UN framework and without resort to military force. In the months before Resolution 1441 was adopted there was a widespread expectation that the United States would resort to the unilateral use of force. Today, by contrast, the Security Council is dealing with the issue and efforts are still under way to ensure a peaceful outcome.</P>
    <P>The possible consequences of a war are dread<Col N="345" />ful to contemplate. Quite apart from the terrible suffering to which the ordinary people of Iraq would be exposed, there would be a serious risk of destabilising an already volatile region. The sense of victimisation felt by many in the Moslem world would be deepened, support for terrorism could grow and economies would suffer. The Government does not wish to see war take place. In every forum available to us we have spoken out and used our influence to urge the parties to find a peaceful solution. We will continue to pursue this approach.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of deep regret for the Government that the people of Iraq have suffered such terrible hardship as a result of their Government's deliberate and persistent violation of successive UN Security Council resolutions aimed at preserving international peace and security. In every way open to it, Ireland has worked to ensure UN sanctions are administered in such a way as to ensure the humanitarian and long-term economic interests of the people of Iraq are secured, while ensuring the necessary controls are in place to prevent Iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>During its term on the Security Council Ireland was active in developing Resolution 1409 which was adopted in May 2002 and seeks to target sanctions against the Iraqi regime while minimising their impact on the civilian population. In particular, the provisions of Resolution 1409 were intended to ensure continuing availability of medical supplies for the most vulnerable sectors of the Iraqi population, including mothers and children.</P>
    <P>In addition to the work which it has done at the United Nations, the Government has also sought to assist the vulnerable sectors of Iraq's civilian population. In 2002 Ireland allocated &euro;150,000 in assistance. This money is being channelled through the Irish NGO, Trócaire, for an emergency programme targeting children and mothers in an emergency nutrition intervention. Ireland has provided &euro;467,500 in bilateral humanitarian assistance in 2001-02.</P>
    <P>I also emphasise that from the outset the sanctions regime did not seek to impose restrictions on the importation of humanitarian supplies. The actual implementation did, however, involve some very undesirable results which Ireland has worked to remove. With the adoption of the Oil for Food Programme in 1996 Iraq was given a workable mechanism by which it could trade unlimited quantities of oil in exchange for humanitarian goods for its civilian population. The UN Secretary General has confirmed on a number of occasions that the improved funding level for the Oil for Food Programme means that the Government of Iraq is in a position to address the nutritional and health needs of the Iraqi people, especially those of children.</P>
    <P>The head of the Office of the Iraq Programme, Mr. Benon Sevan, has repeatedly advised the Security Council and, in November last, visiting members of the Joint Committee on Foreign <Col N="346" />Affairs, of the obstacles the Iraqi Government has put in the way of the effective operation of the Oil for Food Programme. By withholding effective co-operation from the Oil for Food Programme, through such means as politically motivated embargoes on oil sales and refusals to prioritise purchases under the programme, the Iraqi administration has contributed in large part to the shortfalls in the provision of essential supplies to the Iraqi people.</P>
    <P>The fact remains, however, that the most effective way of easing the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people and avoiding any escalation in the current situation would be for the Iraqi Government to act immediately to meet its obligations under the UN charter by complying fully with the demands placed upon it by the Security Council. So far, Iraq has shown little sign that it truly intends to do so. It has failed to give a believable account of its production and acquisition of chemical and biological weapons material and, most importantly, a believable account of what has become of it. It is time that it did so. It is not the inspectors' job to search for evidence of Iraqi non-compliance. It is for the Iraqis to prove that they have, in fact, done what they claim to have done. It is for them to set the record straight once and for all.</P>
    <P>I now wish to address the issue of use of Shannon Airport by foreign military aircraft and personnel, in particular, US aircraft and personnel. A comprehensive account of the Government's position on this matter was provided for the other House by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, on 29 January. It remains the case that the Government is acting to ensure full compliance with all relevant Irish legislative provisions. In summary, these are the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, as amended in 1989 and section 317 of the Defence Act 1954.</P>
    <P>The 1952 Air Navigation Order sets out specific stipulations by which foreign military aircraft are permitted to overfly and land in the State. It is in accordance with these stipulations and on the basis of advance clearance requests that US military aircraft have been granted permission by successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs to refuel at Shannon Airport over a period of decades. Arrangements concerning US overflights date from 1959 and were put in place by then Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken. Reflecting security considerations which prevailed during the Cold War years and which have since been upheld by successive Governments, these arrangements require that such overflights be unarmed. Moreover, in the vast majority of cases, they relate to ordinary supplies and equipment. The US Embassy supplies <i>post hoc</i> statistics of the overflights on a monthly basis.</P>
    <P>The 1973 Air Navigation Order, as amended, governs transiting military personnel on board civilian aircraft and falls under the responsibility <Col N="347" />of the Minister for Transport. In summary, any civilian aircraft seeking to overfly or land in the State requires the permission of the Minister for Transport to carry military weapons or munitions.</P>
    <P>Section 317 of the 1954 Defence Act governs the wearing of uniforms within the State by foreign military personnel. Such personnel are forbidden to enter or land in the State while wearing a uniform, except with written ministerial permission.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure all of these provisions were being fully complied with, a full review of their day-to-day implementation was initiated under the direction of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. Improvements to the existing arrangements have been introduced with the full co-operation of the US authorities. It should be recognised that the Government has done more than all its predecessors put together to ensure the practices and arrangements built up over many years are operated in strict compliance with the precise legal requirements.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to comment on any individual cases currently before the courts, it would be remiss of me not to reiterate the Government's serious concern at the recent violent incidents at Shannon Airport which I condemn unequivocally. A line must be drawn between peaceful protest and acts of trespass and the infliction of wanton damage to property. Violent acts in the name of pacifism are surely a contradiction in terms.</P>
    <P>The recent breaches of security at Shannon Airport have been taken with the utmost seriousness by the US authorities. It now seems as though these irresponsible acts may have economic implications for the people of the Shannon region. US World Airlines has decided, as an initial reaction, to redirect some flights. The reality is that the practice of US aeroplanes landing at Shannon Airport, maintained for decades under successive Governments, has brought employment and income to the wider Shannon region and generated revenue for Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>Following the Government's review of security arrangements at Shannon Airport, appropriate security measures have been taken to make sure there is no repetition of such events. The use of Army personnel in support of the Garda Síochána is a measured response intended to ensure security. We want to maintain Shannon Airport as a safe, secure and reliable destination for all its users. I hope the carriers involved will now be assured that there will be no repeat of the recent security breaches.</P>
    <P>These steps, together with the improvements made by the Government in full co-operation with the US authorities to ensure full compliance with relevant legal requirements, should also assure Irish citizens that our responsibilities are being taken seriously. In the meantime, the Government stands by its commitment to allow for further debate on all aspects of the unfolding <Col N="348" />situation in the event of military action being initiated against Iraq.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's discussions have given us a great deal to think about. However, some things are as clear now as they have been from the outset. The Government has the highest confidence in the UN inspectors and they may be assured of our wholehearted support. We look forward to their return to the Security Council on 14 February to report on how Iraq has responded to the issues put forward in their report of 27 January. As they carry their work forward from today, we expect they will be put in a position to take full advantage of the new information which the United States has made available and hope all countries with such information will now come forward to assist in the tasks which lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The international community, acting collectively, must continue to put pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations. It must continue to be clear to him that no other options are open to him. This is the only way in which conflict can be averted. I place great stress on the need for collective action. The Government is committed to supporting the authority of the Security Council. Resolution 1441 states the Security Council will consider the question of whether Iraq is in material breach of its obligations and decide what further steps may be needed. We believe this is the course which will be followed. On behalf of the Government, I strongly urge Saddam Hussein to respond immediately and without further delay or evasion to the demands of the Security Council. There is still one last opportunity to ensure peace will be preserved.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate as it is important for Members of the Oireachtas to express a view on the issue about which there has been much discussion in the media as well as political discourse and activity outside the Oireachtas. It is, therefore, opportune for us to express our views also. Any semi-literate student of international politics would want to see a regime change in Iraq, thus providing the Iraqi people with a fresh start, free from the control of the dictator, Saddam Hussein. However, no one in Europe or the United States wants a war in Iraq. We all realise the suffering and loss of life that would result from such a conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best summary of a case against war was made by the former US President, Jimmy Carter, when he accepted the Nobel peace prize. He stated: &ldquo;Sometimes war is the lesser of two evils, but war is still always evil.&rdquo; That is a good starting point. In our natural opposition to military conflict we can sometimes become so blind that we <Col N="349" />fail to see the wood for the trees. We are currently in danger of allowing ourselves to believe the conflict over Iraq is little more than a macho trip by President Bush or some sort of American bid to secure additional oil resources. This view is both wrong and dangerous. There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Iraq, or between the elected President Bush &ndash; unsatisfactory as his electoral success may have been &ndash; and the mercilessly savage dictator, Saddam Hussein. We should not speak of both in the same breath.</P>

      <P>We do not have to be on the side of war but if the choice is between an American view of the world or Saddam Hussein's view, then I know what side I am on. Ireland has major historical, political, economic and social links with the United States. We owe a huge historical debt of gratitude to the American people. We should use our friendly political links with the United States to good effect in this international dispute to try to ensure calm is maintained for as long as is practically possible.</P>
      <P>We cannot ignore, however, what the United Nations has reported about Iraq. In 1999 the United Nations reported that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons sufficient to kill several million people. It also found that Iraq had produced over 25,000 litres of anthrax and had over 40,000 litres of other biological toxins. I have no doubt that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and fear that, unchecked, he is exactly the type of tyrant who would be willing to use them.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget that this is the man who has kept an evil grip on his own country for many years, a grip strengthened by fear and torture. Let us not ignore the stories from Iraqi refugees and defectors who have told us of the forced confessions obtained by torturing children while their parents watched helplessly. Let us not ignore what has been reported by international human rights groups. The Iraqi people have been tortured by this unelected dictator by means of electric shock, burning with hot irons, dripping of acid on their skin, mutilation with electric drills, having their tongues cut out and being raped. We have all read about the 100% support for Saddam Hussein during the recent election; we know the value of that election &ndash; nil.</P>
      <P>Saddam Hussein is the cause of the current conflict. He is the person who invaded Kuwait in 1990 and the person who has used poisonous gas on his people&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris will have an opportunity to reply.</P>
      <P>Saddam Hussein was not forced to use poisonous gas against his people. He has played ducks and drakes with the United Nations since 1991. I have no doubt that his regime is not fully co-operating with the current weapons inspection in Iraq.</P>
      <P>Colin Powell presented an assessment to the Security Council yesterday. I am sure it will not satisfy everybody. Any reasonable student would have to concede many questions remain to be asked and answered. If it is a question of credibility, I would tend to take the words of Colin Powell rather than those of Saddam Hussein who has raised a smokescreen over his activities and plans since 1991.</P>
      <P>We must concentrate, at this stage, on what the United Nations must do. It must be centre stage in resolving this dispute. It is paramount, not only to the current dispute but to future conflicts worldwide, that the United Nations does not lose its nerve or purpose. The demands made of the United Nations regarding Iraq have, clearly, not been met. I am in favour of giving the weapons inspectors more time to come up with the answers but the international community must send out a clear and strong message that Iraq must disarm and must do so now.</P>
      <P>The relevance and value of the United Nations will be judged not by its ability to keep the United States from going it alone but by its ability to enforce on Saddam Hussein the checks and restrictions sought since 1991. It is important for us that the United Nations remains a powerful vehicle for progress and peace. It must not be white-washed by Saddam Hussein on a continual basis, as has happened since 1991.</P>
      <P>We have experienced too much unwillingness in the 20th century on the part of the international community to deal with dictators and tyrants, resulting in war and strife on a savage scale. If the United Nations is to keep the peace and restore order it must operate from a position of unity and strength. The international community, which in the last century did not deal with tyrants such as Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot and others would be making a very dangerous start to the new millennium by failing to deal with the Iraqi dictator.</P>
      <P>We must look at where we go from here. A second UN resolution must be sought if the Iraqi response to the weapons inspectorate is not sufficiently clear. It is important from the United Nations point of view that a second resolution is agreed. The European Union has a key role to play in this and it would be helpful if it had a united voice. The difference between European countries is one of emphasis rather than major policy and that was evidenced last week when a number of them signed a letter &ndash; we were not asked to do so &ndash; in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" />It is important that the Minister and Government forge a single voice at European level. We are a neutral country but we should not be neutered on this issue. We must hold a strong view on it. The genesis of our view must be to bring about what the United Nations and international community have tried to achieve since 1991, the removal from Saddam Hussein of the ability to hold and use weapons of mass destruction.</P>
    <P>The people of Iraq need a new start. The middle east peace process needs fresh emphasis. We must recognise that the consequences of war in Iraq and the Middle East will be serious.  We must send out a message from this House and the community that Saddam Hussein, the person at the core of the problem, must respond immediately to the UN demands to disarm.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to debate this important issue. I encourage people to speak their minds in this debate. There has, over the last month or so, been a reluctance on the part of people who hold different opinions to speak out because of a significant weight of media pressure and media opinion which takes a very anti-American position on this issue. That is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>I speak as someone who is independent on this issue but who has reached a conclusion which I would like to see regarding international affairs. We have spent too much time talking about President George W. Bush, against whom there is an unfortunate prejudice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect Senator Norris's right to speak and he should permit me to do so also. We must speak about tolerance and respect it in what we say. There is an unfortunate prejudice, not just in the area of policy, against the President of the United States. There is something near racial in the comments I have heard in recent times against the American people and their President.</P>
      <P>The debate on Shannon has been a distraction from the core issue, resolution 1441 and those resolutions passed in 1991 of which Iraq has been in material breach for the past decade. That is the core issue, not our predisposition or otherwise towards the American administration or what takes place in Shannon. We must concentrate on that issue, as pointed out by Senator Bradford.</P>
      <P>Since the fall of the Iron Curtain two colossal blocs have tried to administer a form of security and control in the world. Dangerous weapons of mass destruction, some of them produced for the West &ndash; Senator Norris is right to point that out that appalling contradiction &ndash; may fall into the hands of terrorist organisations or rogue states. Rogue states do exist and Saddam Hussein's regime is one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be conscious that everything has changed since the events of 11 September. The <Col N="352" />United Nations has a specific responsibility to ensure that such rogue states disarm quickly and to the full competence of the United Nations. That is why we must get back to resolution 1441 and the resolutions passed in 1991. That is the key issue in terms of bringing some form of stability to the region and international relations.</P>
    <P>Disarmament is an issue which goes to the heart of whether global terrorist organisations can possess this weaponry and we must concern ourselves with it. Senator Bradford rightly put on the record of this House some of the characteristics of this regime. The Iraqis are a proud people. They are at the heart of civilisation. The historical architects there have made an astonishing contribution to world civilisations throughout the centuries. In many respects they are a democratic people. The Iraqis stood with the allies, unlike us, during the Second World War. There are many examples of the Iraqis as a very civilised people who want the opportunity for democracy, but as long as the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein exists, such an opportunity will not be presented to them. I ask the United Nations, through the Government, to take action to ensure its own resolve on this issue is enforced.</P>
    <P>I read yesterday resolution 1441 and I would encourage others to do so before speaking on the issue. It is clear, in terms of the commitment it puts on the United Nations Security Council, what we want to see happen before we are satisfied the Iraqi regime is competent to have such weapons. The key aspect is the final paragraph which states that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations. How long will this issue continue? Whether or not one believes the substantial evidence put before the Council yesterday by the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, how long can we continue to allow this regime to be in possession of such weapons? Senator Bradford referred to anthrax and all kinds of other biological warfare material.</P>
    <P>This is a security issue on which we must concentrate. I await with anticipation Dr. Blix's report to the Council on 15 February. The world must take action against these states, particularly against these regimes, where a continued diplomatic effort has been unsuccessful in depriving these regimes of the weaponry in question. I say that from an independent perspective, having recently studied the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues on the other side of the House, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House and thank him for his elucidation of the current situation as he sees it. I will not dwell too much on yesterday because it has been fairly well aired by the Minister and by the contributions so far, other than to say there is a growing body of evidence which suggests that the Saddam Hussin regime is being economical with the truth. Like Senator Brian Hayes, I await the Blix report on 14 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" />I compliment the Minister of State on repeatedly restating the Government's position in regard to possible conflict in the region. He said in his speech that the possible consequences of a war are dreadful to contemplate, that Ireland very much wants to see a peaceful solution to the crisis, Iraq has so far shown little signs that it intends to co-operate and that it has failed to give a believable account of its production and acquisition of chemical and biological weapons material and, more importantly, a believable account of what has become of it.</P>
    <P>The current crisis over Iraq is creating dissent across the world. There is a consensus, however, that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant. He has been responsible for personally directing the execution of thousands of his citizens, using chemical warfare against the Kurdish minority, laying waste to the most fertile land in southern Iraq, persecuting religious minorities, developing biological weapons and, worst of all, manipulating the UN sanctions to deprive innocent babies and children of essential medical assistance. These are the facts of the Saddam Hussein regime.</P>
    <P>The Iraqi people live in terror of this despot whose intelligence services are reported to employ more than 20,000 personnel. They supervise every aspect of life. The result of the recent election, when 100% of voters supported Saddam, sent a powerful message to the rest of the world of the embracing totalitarianism of Saddam's regime. The Iraqi people cannot get rid of this man on their own. The various peace groups and anti-war activists, who agree he should be removed, cannot get rid of this man on their own. If he refuses to co-operate with the UN weapons inspectors, and the United Nations Security Council passes a second resolution finding Saddam Hussein in material breach of UN Resolution 1441, sadly military action will inevitably follow. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, spoke in the Dáil last week and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has spoken here today, restating that the Irish Government does not wish to see war take place. I believe that is the overwhelming view of the people of this country and many other concerned democracies across the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>He does, however, go on to state that we as a country are determined to discharge our international obligations both in trying to avert conflict and in carrying out the decisions of the Security Council. Membership of the United Nations and the primacy of the Security Council have been a central plank of Irish foreign policy since 1946 when Ireland first applied for membership. It was the continuation of a foreign policy position, initiated at the League of Nations in the 1930s, when Ireland had a distinguished and proud record of participation in that now unfairly maligned body. Eamon de Valera was a former president of the League of Nations and the last <Col N="354" />secretary general of the League of Nations was another Irishman from Belfast, Seán Lester. Both men did more to establish Ireland's independent foreign policy than they have been given credit for even to this day. It is particularly relevant, in light of the criticism levelled at the Government over its interpretation of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, on which the Minister went into some detail, that under this order the Minister for Foreign Affairs has full discretion in the granting of permission to foreign military aircraft to fly over land in this State. I believe he has used that discretion wisely.</P>
      <P>There is a famous philosophy attributed to a British diplomat who stated that in foreign policy matters his country did not have friends but interests. I would not go so far as to describe Irish foreign policy in such stark terms, but we have a special relationship with the United States. It would be folly in the extreme, damaging to our economic interests and a source of hurt to the millions of Irish Americans if we were to refuse to help America in its time of need. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, leaders of industry and those operating services in the Shannon region have all spelt out the consequences of turning our backs on our American cousins. The United States is a good friend to Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the immediate aftermath of the 1916 Rising, the Irish poet, W.B Yeats, wrote, &ldquo;All is changed, changed utterly, a terrible beauty is born.&rdquo; That quote could have been written following 11 September 2001. The events of that awful day have entered the psyche of the American people from the President down. I suggest that we in Europe have not fully grasped the impact of 11 September on America and its people. It is a country at war. Every utterance of President Bush since then is full of the imagery of a wounded nation determined to exact a terrible revenge, hence the war against terrorism, the axis of evil speech and many other such speeches by the President since 11 September. The mindset of President Bush is best understood in his answer to a question at the Blair-Bush press conference in Washington last Friday. When asked why he wanted war, the President replied, &ldquo;After September 11, the strategic vision of our country shifted dramatically. We now recognise that oceans no longer protect us, that we are vulnerable to attack and that the worst form of attack could come from somebody acquiring weapons of mass destruction and using them on the American people or on our friends in Great Britain.&rdquo; The President continued, &ldquo;I realise that the world has changed and my most important obligation is to protect the American people from further harm, and I will do that.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Brian Hayes said, the President is much maligned. When one looks at his profile, one sees that he is a committed Christian. He says a prayer before the start of his Administration's Cabinet meetings and he holds Bible studies in the White House. He has denied funding to agen<Col N="355" />cies that are directly or indirectly involved in abortion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not involved in abortion. It was a scandalous abrogation of his moral responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>These facts do not indicate that he is intent on wreaking destruction and havoc on innocent women and children in Iraq.</P>
      <P>Despite America's hurt and awesome military might, the Bush Administration needs to understand that unilateralism has had its day and that the rule of law among civilised states supersedes all other considerations. A set of rules must be established and accepted before military intervention can proceed. UN Resolution 1441 sets the framework for how to proceed. If the US Administration believes it has the right to launch a military invasion of a sovereign country without a second resolution, the view of America's friends and foes &ndash; that the US believes might is right and American interests take precedence over civilised world order &ndash; will be confirmed. I cannot, however, accept the view that inaction on Iraq will ultimately see the situation resolved or will lead to Saddam Hussein going into exile, thus paving the way for a new democratic regime.</P>
      <P>When I hear calls for non-intervention at any cost, I remember what happened in Bosnia and Rwanda less than ten years ago. The course of Balkan history, with its record of intolerance among its constituent entities, influenced the decision of the West not to get involved in military action in the early 1990s. The collective failure of resolve on the part of western Europe, including Ireland, led to the evil of Slobodan Milosevic. Who remembers the long trail of peace brokers, temporary ceasefires, sanctions and international mediators?</P>
      <P>The declaration of six safe areas for Bosnian Muslims, protected by lightly equipped UN troops, was followed by the events of 11 July 1995. The world watched in horror as the Bosnian Serb army, led by the war criminal Ratko Mladic, entered the safe haven of Srebrenica, disarmed the Dutch UN force and separated men and boys from women and small children before taking them away to their deaths. A small UN force was brushed aside a year earlier in the tragic country of Rwanda. The world turned its back as millions were slaughtered there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We share a collective blame for the failure to provide a strong UN mandate that may have averted such genocide. During those terrible times, however, some people advocated inaction and objected to the use of force. In recent days, we saw the smiling face of Tony Benn as he sat across from Saddam Hussein and reported that the dictator did not have any weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Benn's claim that Saddam Hussein is telling the truth reminded me of the comments of another respected peace activist, Neville Chamberlain. When Mr. Chamberlain <Col N="356" />returned from Munich in 1938, he smiled and famously promised that there would be &ldquo;peace in our time&rdquo;. Chamberlain believed Hitler, just as Benn believes Hussein. Such memories make resolute opposition to military intervention aimed at removing Saddam Hussein's regime difficult to accept for me and others with have faith in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>On an international level, the UN is the only game in town. The role of the UN as a world moral police, and as an enforcer of civilised order when necessary, must be strongly supported by a small country like Ireland. Despite its size, this country has always punched above its weight internationally. Ireland received an overwhelming vote of confidence in 2000, during the election to the UN Security Council. I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, Ambassador Ryan and our diplomatic staff at Iveagh House and the United Nations. During Ireland's two year term on the Security Council, we rewarded those who showed confidence in us by taking a firm stance in relation to human rights issues and by placing an emphasis on Africa and the developing world.</P>
    <P>The recent election by a huge margin of an Irish woman to the International Criminal Court is another indication of Ireland's standing in the eyes of the world, particularly at UN level. I wish Ms Maureen Harding Clark every success in her difficult job. The principled and statesmanlike position taken by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Government in insisting on adherence to the primacy of the UN as the final arbiter on this difficult issue is to be applauded and supported. It is in keeping with the majority view in this country and reflects an abhorrence of war as a means of resolving conflict.</P>
    <P>The consequences of war in Iraq would be devastating not only for the long-suffering people of that country, but also for the Middle East as a whole. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, amplified this concern in his contribution. In this respect, I applaud the regional initiative on Iraq that has been taken in the Middle East. A joint declaration was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey in Istanbul on 23 January last. The Ministers expressed their common resolve to attain a peaceful solution to the problems in Iraq and called on the Administration in that country to make irreversible and sincere attempts to fulfil its responsibilities in relation to peace and stability in the region. They also called on Iraq to conform with UN Resolution 1441 by demonstrating a more active approach to providing an inventory of information and material concerning its weapons of mass destruction capabilities. The Ministers further called on Iraq to adopt a policy that will unambiguously inspire confidence among its neighbours and to take firm steps towards national reconciliation to preserve that country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.</P>
    <P>The Arab leaders share the Irish view that the Iraq issue is a multilateral one that affects the <Col N="357" />entire region. They reaffirmed that the actions to be taken by Iraq will represent a step towards the goal of making the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, as stated in UN Security Council Resolution 687. I understand that individual Arab countries are in regular contact with Baghdad, conveying the seriousness of his position to Saddam Hussein. I hope these initiatives and those of other peace-minded countries will ultimately bear fruit and so help to avoid conflict.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has outlined that as a small country, all we can do is to continue to press for the supremacy of the Security Council and the United Nations. The UN is the bulwark against totalitarianism, unilateralism and any designs on war that the Administration of the world's only superpower may have. I am sure the Government will agree that the stabilising influence of our close friend and neighbour, Tony Blair, has been considerable in terms of ensuring that the elements of this debate are not lost in the war rooms of Washington. I am sure certain elements in the US Administration would have taken action by now, but for the restraining influence of Mr. Blair and countries like Ireland that are friends of the US and that wish to ensure that unilateral action is not taken.</P>
    <P>We hope and pray that there will be a peaceful resolution to this conflict. If such a resolution is not found, the innocent people of Iraq, such as women and children, will suffer the most.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt. I am glad that he is here because he is a decent man with firm liberal principles. It is dangerous to use the word &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; in the United States of America at present. It was not with surprise but with cynicism that I discovered that a motion I tabled last week under Standing Order 29 was not regarded as an urgent matter by the Seanad. Such rulings need to be questioned.</P>
      <P>Many people who have spoken against the looming war in Iraq have been challenged to place their credentials on the record and perhaps I should do so before I give reasons for my opposition to it. Unlike the overwhelming majority of those who place themselves in the camp of the warmongers, I have opposed Saddam Hussein from the beginning. I believe that I have <i>locus standi</i> in relation to this issue. For example, I was the only Member of the House to oppose selling beef to the Iraqi army in the early 1990s. While Senators on the Government benches at the time told me that my position might have been a moral one, they asked whether Ireland could afford to adopt it. As it turned out, we did the immoral thing and when Saddam Hussein welshed on the deal, the taxpayer ended up with a bill of more than £100,000 to add to the immorality of the Government's actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to Baghdad two years ago as a member of an all-party delegation and had a stand-up row, face to face, on human rights issues with the for<Col N="358" />mer Foreign Minister, Dr. Tariq Aziz. I pointed out to him that his regime was not exactly virginal in terms of aggression but I also pointed out that when they fired their Scud missiles across the borders at Israel, the only good thing about it was that they could not shoot straight and most of the out-of-date and ineffective missiles landed in the sand. It is absolutely absurd to suggest, when ten years ago at the height of his military strength he could not even land a missile in Israel, that Saddam could attack New York. It is nonsense. I also smuggled into Baghdad over £2,000 worth of drugs for the children's hospital in Baghdad. Therefore, I have earned the right to speak with some sympathy for the Iraqi civilian population.</P>
    <P>Saddam Hussein is a monster, something on which we can all agree. I know he tortured people. There is plenty of evidence that he is psychopathic. He murdered his two sons-in-law after guaranteeing them safe passage back from Switzerland but who put him there? It was the Anglo-American axis which inflicted him on the unfortunate Iraqi people in pursuit of their own foreign policy aims. It was also they who armed him with chemical and biological weapons which were used on the Kurds in 1988. Moreover, those of us with clear political memories will recall that after this &ndash; in full knowledge of Saddam's crimes against his own people &ndash; Mr. Donald Rumsfeld &ndash; the Dr. Strangelove of the present American Administration &ndash; actually went to Baghdad and embraced Saddam, knowing him to be a mass murderer.</P>
    <P>Senators may recall the notorious incident of the &ldquo;Supergun&rdquo;, which was actually capable of landing chemical, biological and nuclear warheads on Tel Aviv. It was built by a British firm, Matrix Churchill, with the connivance of the then British Government, as was subsequently proved in a series of law cases. In other words, the very forces posing today as advocates of human rights, the American and British Administrations, are clearly complicit in Saddam Hussein's crimes against his own people and his neighbours, although now, opportunistically and with revolting hypocrisy, it suits them to attempt to play the moral card.</P>
    <P>Saddam was given the green light for the invasion of Kuwait. Let us be frank about Kuwait also: looking for its border, one finds a line starting at the coast, going straight up, turning at right angles, turning again at right angles and hitting the coast. It was drawn by a British cartographer in 1919, neatly enclosing massive oil reserves for the benefit of European and American oil interests. It is not a naturally occurring border. Kuwait was historically part of Iraq, about which there is no question.</P>
    <P>Although their hands are already drenched in the innocent blood of Iraqi children, Messrs. Bush and Blair seem to want more. I say now from the Upper House of the Irish Parliament that if they really want to know whether Saddam Hussein still has chemical, biological or nuclear <Col N="359" />weapons, let them look at the invoices of their own commercial industries in their own countries where they will find the records of what they sold to him. In this sentiment I am joined by a fellow Dubliner, a very remarkable man, Mr. Nelson Mandela, on whom we were honoured to confer citizenship of the city. That is what he has to say about it and he knows something about imprisonment, torture and international injustice.</P>
    <P>Who is the real terrorist? Saddam Hussein's evil wings have been clipped to such an extent that he can no longer realistically be regarded as a threat. The record, however, of the Bush regime is interesting. It welshed on the International Criminal Court, the very court to which Senator Mooney correctly drew our attention and to which we were honoured to have a senior judge appointed from this country. The Bush Administration did not want any part of it, which suggests that it wants Americans to be allowed to commit war crimes with impunity &ndash; they will not subject themselves to its operations.</P>
    <P>The Bush regime welshed on the Kyoto Protocol in order that American industry could continue to pollute the world. It welshed on the agreement negotiated under President Clinton that sought to contain the development of chemical and biological weapons in order that America could continue their manufacture. Anthrax is being manufactured at 70 sites in the United States. It indicated in recent weeks its readiness to use low-yield nuclear bombs in the attack on Iraq. Most certainly, this regime inspires terror.</P>
    <P>Are the people of Baghdad not terrified as they wait, helpless and afraid, for the thing they know they cannot stop? They are terrified even to use municipal bomb shelters in the light of the fate of those unfortunate civilians incinerated in the Amiriyah shelter during the Gulf War. I found it astonishing to hear a self-styled expert on RTE radio the other day referring unchallenged to &ldquo;some civilian casualties&rdquo; in this incident. Four hundred people, including seven members of one entire family, were incinerated by one of the &ldquo;bunker-buster&rdquo; bombs that landed on the shelter.</P>
    <P>Let us have no more Orwellian newspeak. If we are to commit filthy acts, let us acknowledge the filth of what we are doing. Leaks in recent days from US sources indicate that the first assault, even before the waves of hundreds of missiles directed at Baghdad, will consist of intense microwave radiation intended to interrupt military communications. In view of what it does to machinery, what will it do to the civilian population? How would the population of Dublin feel if they were about to be microwaved? We are aware of the intense public campaign against electricity pylons and mobile phone masts. Are we to regard the Iraqi people as less than human?</P>
    <P>After yesterday's performance at the United Nations, it is clear that there is no smoking gun. The USA has, in fact, shown itself to be in contravention of both the letter and the spirit of Resol<Col N="360" />ution 1441 because it did not provide evidence of mobile laboratories or the alleged infection and death of 12 technicians to the monitoring team under Dr. Blix. This requirement is contained clearly and specifically in Resolution 1441: &ldquo;All Member States [are requested to] give full support to UNMOVIC and the IAEA . including by providing any information related to prohibited programmes or other aspects of their mandates.&rdquo;. The Americans have not done so. It would be useless to apologise afterwards to the estimated 500,000 civilian casualties who will be affected almost immediately, most of them children. Moreover, the fourth Geneva Convention, which is also part of international customary law and which, therefore, cannot be derogated from, requires the proper protection of children in circumstances of war. This is about to be flouted once more in a myriad of ways.</P>
    <P>I am not anti-American. I love what decent Americans stand for and know there are many millions of decent Americans who are strongly opposed to the waging of this war. It is worth noting that the democratically elected representatives of more than 40 cities throughout the USA have already passed resolutions against it. Moreover, every major religious denomination in the USA &ndash; except for the Southern Baptists &ndash; has issued a proclamation questioning unilateral action by the USA, including the United Methodist Church, a religious affiliation claimed by both President Bush and Vice President Cheney.</P>
    <P>Let us look at America's foreign policy record of recent years. Let us recall the covert involvement of sinister American forces in the overthrow of the democratically elected Government of Chile and the murder of its head of state, the late Dr. Allende. Let us remember the unprincipled use of drug money to destabilise the neighbouring state of Nicaragua. Let us remember the aggression against the people of Cuba in the Bay of Pigs incident. Let us call to mind the fact that in recent months we have once more had the spectacle of the CIA attempting the overthrow of a democratically elected South American Head of State, President Hugo Chavez, in the interests of American big business. To paraphrase a former American President &ndash; it is the oil, stupid. That is what this is about &ndash; not human rights.</P>
    <P>Vietnam is now acknowledged generally as a huge mistake which caused great loss of both American and Vietnamese life. What use is that acknowledgement to the dead? In Kampuchea, up to 500,000 civilian citizens of a neutral country were done to death by illegal bombing raids and the architect of this, Henry Kissinger, has in recent days had the gall to pop up as an expert on Iraq.</P>
    <P>With regard to American expertise on Iraq, I recently had the pleasure of meeting one of the Bush Administration's advisers. A charming gentleman, I asked him when he had last been to Baghdad. He acknowledged that he had never been in Iraq. I assumed he read the Iraqi news<Col N="361" />papers, only to discover that he could neither read nor speak Arabic. That is a big help.</P>
    <P>The other allegation used to justify war against the defenceless people of Iraq is that the regime is complicit with the al-Qaeda network. This, as anyone who knows anything about the Arab and Muslim world, is complete nonsense. However repulsive Saddam Hussein's regime is to us in the West, it is, at least, equally repulsive to Muslim fundamentalists precisely because of its secular nature.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that this war is stopped. I acknowledge the courage of those in the peace camp at Shannon and, in particular, their apparent willingness to go to Baghdad to act as human witnesses by placing their own lives in jeopardy. If I thought that action such as that of Mary Kelly would help to stop the war or prevent the deaths of innocent Iraqi civilians, I would drive to Shannon airport this minute with a hatchet on the back seat of my car. I remind the House of the judgment in the Trident Ploughshare case in Liverpool some years ago when a woman peace activist who disabled a Hawk fighter, that was being sold by the British to the Indonesians so they could paste the unfortunate East Timorese into the ground, was held by a jury to be worthy of acquittal because what she did, although technically illegal, was calculated to prevent an infinitely greater crime.</P>
    <P>Mr. Bush has ignored the basic message of the arms inspectors &ndash; that they need more time. They have indicated that the Iraqi regime is now co-operating. Mr. Bush derides this as passive co-operation. What precisely does he expect? Is it realistic to expect a creature of the CIA such as Saddam Hussein willingly to incriminate himself? Would this not in itself be a violation of one of the anchors of the American Constitution, the 5th amendment, under which no American citizen can be required to incriminate himself or herself?</P>
    <P>What of the aftermath of the war, when the UN has once more been subverted and bypassed? It is understood that depleted uranium is to be used, as it was in the Gulf War, with disastrous consequences for many ordinary Iraqi citizens. I have seen the effects of this in the unusual rates of cancer among women in the Basra region. I have also visited hospitals where scores of children were dying of leukaemia and simultaneously deprived of the necessary treatment which might give them a change of survival.</P>
    <P>General Colin Powell, that apostle of human rights who, although black himself, helped to institutionalise discrimination against gay people in the American army, has indicated that the United States will &ldquo;administer the Iraqi oil fields in the interests of the Iraqi people.&rdquo; I will believe that when I see it. One can bet one's last dollar that the oil fields will be administered in the interests of American business and the American economy. We will have a situation just like Afghanistan where, having installed a criminal regime to terrorise the people, Americans took against it and tried to squash the monster they themselves <Col N="362" />had created, but in fact merely left the unfortunate civilian population worst off except for a small area around Kabul. Do any of us here know about the human rights of the ordinary Afghans or of the continuing abuse of women in all centres outside Kabul? This is the kind of fate that awaits the Iraqi people and this is yet another among the many reasons why all decent people must oppose this war.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to debate the situation unfolding in Iraq. It is timely we should do so because we have responsibilities we must face up to. We must creep out from some of the hypocritical rhetoric being promulgated in the name of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I am not a warmonger, do not advocate war at all costs and support pursuing every possible avenue to ensure that UN Resolution 1441 is implemented. Military action should be a last resort. As a nation, we have contributed greatly to trying to create a stable peace in the Middle East. We should congratulate our Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána who have contributed to that peace and played an active role.</P>
      <P>The events now unfolding are not only a test of our individual character, but the character of the nation as a whole. In debating this subject, we should not be so quick to dismiss into memory the events of 11 September 2001 &ndash; a terrorist attack which was a chilling wake-up call for more to come. I have no difficulty in the use of Shannon for the build-up of troops in the Gulf if that show of force and flag-flying prevents a war. In that case we would have done a good day's work, in accordance with UN mandates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled at Senator Norris's comments about driving to Shannon with a hatchet in the back of his car. That is the irresponsible type of leadership that should not be forthcoming from any elected public representative. Do we stand idly by or learn from our mistakes? Those who advocate inaction and non co-operation are the same people who would have advocated the same inaction in the face of Hitler, Milosevic and others. We would have had ethnic cleansing at will by so-called leaders. Our choice is whether we support a western-style democracy based on tolerance, freedom, openness and opportunity, respecting the rights of individuals within civil society, or we identify with the opposing model &ndash; a violent, political and ideological fundamen<Col N="363" />talist one that tolerates no opposition and accommodates no diversity.</P>
    <P>With the advent of global media coverage of events as they unfold, the terrorists' market has widened. Not only can an atrocity affect their target, their victims and the wider community, but those removed by location can be terrorised by viewing these events as they happen.</P>
    <P>President Bush referred to the first war of the 21st century in the wake of the 11 September attacks and vowed to rid the world of this evil. Countries lined up offering support &ndash; some were more willing than others and others backed down from initial <i>carte blanche</i> support to conditional support. Western democracies were in turmoil as the task in front of them unfolded. We should look at the area of terrorism in the context of the new world order. People are too quick to sweep this under the carpet.</P>
    <P>What is a terrorist? In biblical times, Jewish dagger men, who were violently opposed to the Roman occupation of Judea, concealed weapons under their cloaks and mingled in crowds to assassinate supporters of the Roman empire. Terrorism is therefore nothing new. Until the 11 September attacks in New York and Washington, terrorism, in terms of the number of people killed, was on the decline. However, more people were probably killed on 11 September than in the previous 20 years worldwide.</P>
    <P>Who are these people that killed thousands and thousands of civilians they had never met? Where do they come from? They are mostly young males but they have little else in common. Today's terrorists are as diverse as the nations from which they come. They can be highly educated, working class or at the bottom of the socio-economic scale. Their goals range from the narrow political desire of the Real IRA to drive Britain out of Ireland to the wide-ranging desire of al-Qaeda to halt the spread of western culture and promiscuity.</P>
    <P>Sometimes different terrorist groups work together. There have been numerous summit meetings of terrorist groups but, more recently, radical Islamic groups have excluded non-Islamic groups from their summits. One must remember that terrorist organisations have infiltrated the western world, some of which are active and some of which have sleepers lying in wait for their day. In the interim they become part of the community they are about to terrorise. This could be for one month, one year or even longer. When one's neighbour unexpectedly turns out to be a suicide bomber or terrorist, it is the ultimate weapon. It is not only these terrorists we should fear but all the mutually supporting groups and organisations also. They may have different goals and objectives but they have a common bond &ndash; the desire to inflict terror to achieve their aims.</P>
    <P>Terrorist organisations breed off each other. That is their strength. No individual organisation could survive without the finance, weaponry, technology and training that it acquires from <Col N="364" />another. That they all help each other is their lifeline and what makes them the force that they are. They trade in a currency of terror. Greed among business people allows them make financial investments or buy the equipment or expertise they require. Tolerance of terrorists' causes, turning a blind eye or supporting them, if only in a tacit way, by subscribing to one of their shadowy umbrellas for relief does not make for pleasant co-operation among states. States should face up to their responsibilities in facing down the regimes within their own countries.</P>
    <P>One might ask the reason I have spoken about terrorists. I firmly believe the public and many politicians grossly underestimate the dangers associated with them. The public must be educated about the actions of terrorists and the ever-increasing network of organisations working throughout the world. We must also examine our consciences and make a serious effort to address the wrongs in our society and the injustices that lead to the formation of terrorist organisations, not them all but the majority. We have to look at root causes such as previous wars, religious differences, poverty and famine. Foreign policy should address these issues.</P>
    <P>Consider terrorist networks and the root networks that support them. While terrorist networks might be evil, the root networks are not. They comprise people who live with oppression, repression, poverty, hunger, despair and hopelessness. They are desperate to survive and experience terrible suffering. Hatred feeds the network of terrorism. President Bush says he has declared a war on the perpetrators of the attacks of 11 September 2001 but the war was declared years ago by Islamic fundamentalist organisations. The attacks were merely the latest and most terrible escalation of this ongoing war.</P>
    <P>Certain Islamic leaders see themselves as the new fundamentalists of the world. They see it as their duty to expand by conquest the portion of the world ruled by Islam until all the world will be under the rule of Islamic law. The attacks in New York and Washington are, therefore, no more than a warning to the United States and the countries of the western world meant to terrorise them so much that they will not stand in the way of fundamentalist organisations as they expand their sphere of control.</P>
    <P>I have listened in recent weeks to the rhetoric of the Green Party and Sinn Féin on the question of Iraq and the use Shannon Airport. I have heard of the greening of Sinn Féin but I am now, for the first time, hearing of the &ldquo;Sinn Féining&rdquo; of the Greens on recent radio performances. I will take no moral lectures from Sinn Féin about people in uniforms or carrying weapons or about this democracy and the Government being in breach of the Constitution and the Defence Act. An organisation which supports its own private army and which has for 30 years put paramilitaries carrying weapons on the streets is in no position to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" />The question of neutrality is not black and white and never can be. I am a supporter of our position on neutrality but if I was asked if I was neutral in the face of genocide and mass murder, I would say I was not. As a human being and a Christian, I have based my opinions not on ideas formed in my armchair but from my experiences of having served in the Middle East as a peacekeeper and seen the atrocities and their aftermath. As a parent and an Irishman, I will not stand up and say I am willing to turn a blind eye to such atrocities.</P>
    <P>We need to know where we stand and where we want to stand as a society. We need to revisit our Christian values and stand firm. We are facing one of the greatest dangers ever to have faced the world. We should not blink or hide under the covers but stand up and take our rightful place as a nation and stand firm in the face of terror. This country has a leading role to play. We have a proven track record in UN operations in the international field and a growing reputation, particularly because of the manner in which we conducted our business in recent years on the Security Council. We have no option but to accept the fate that has befallen us and play our part.</P>
    <P>I have posed many questions, questions that many sovereign governments are now trying to consider. As they do so, each individual should use this period of reflection to answer some of the same questions. We are all in this together. The ball is firmly in Saddam Hussein's court and it is his decision. We should continue to use every diplomatic effort to bring about a peaceful solution to the problem. However, if the occasion arises, when hard decisions have to be made, we should not be found wanting and hide behind the rhetoric of those supposedly speaking in the name of the people. We are a more mature nation than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That Saddam Hussein is a brute goes without saying. It would be a wonderful world if we were rid of all the brutes but unfortunately the world is not rid of them, nor has it been in my adult life. Brutes have been kept in power in various parts of the world because it has suited the interests of one major power or another. Superpowers have intervened to prevent the departure of brutal abusers of their peoples. When there were two superpowers, both intervened. We all know what the Soviet Union did on many occasions in eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened carefully to what has been said. If we are to make the judgments we should about this issue, we must ensure that the principles we apply have universal validity. While not suggesting a moral equivalence between the United States of America and Iraq, I am not prepared to accept the positing of a moral dichotomy in which one is perfect and the other is dreadful. One is dreadful, but the United States is firmly allied to many of the most repressive regimes in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia is a totalitarian state gov<Col N="366" />erned by a single family. All dissidence is suppressed and religious intolerance in the name of Islam is encouraged in a fashion which is contrary to the basic principles of that religion.</P>
    <P>For 1,300 years, Islam showed remarkable tolerance to Jews and Christians. Until quite recently, Islam had a far better record of tolerance for religious minorities than had Christianity. As any record of the lives of north African Christians and Jews from the last 1,000 years will show, while their lives may not have been perfect, serious religious persecution was unknown. That said, the primary ally of the United States of America in the Middle East is a country which suppresses all manifestations of Judaism or Christianity in the name of Islam, a religion it uses to sustain an oligarchy that is corrupt to the core.</P>
    <P>It is right to deal with and confront the horrific human rights abuses in Iraq, but we can either be pragmatic or we can base our perspective on morality. If we take the latter course, the only acceptable morality is one we attempt, within reason, to apply universally. I watched the western world tolerate brutality in East Timor for the best part of 30 years. That brutality was initiated with, at the very least, the complicity, if not the active engagement, of most of the western powers. I read about the negation of democratic revolution in Guatemala, I watched the overthrow of a democratically elected government in Chile and I saw the destruction of the most exciting experiment in social justice and democracy in Nicaragua in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that we have a moral obligation to ignore actions carried out in the name of democracy by a country with which we are friendly when those actions effectively undermine that principle. This is not to play down the horrors in Iraq, it is simply to say that when one introduces morality into political rhetoric one enters dangerous territory. While morality in politics is dangerous, though perhaps there should be more of it, selective morality is worse. There is no moral basis for suggesting that the Iraqi regime is much worse or more evil and threatening than half a dozen other regimes, some of which are allied to the United States of America. That cannot justify the scale of military action against Iraq that appears to be contemplated.</P>
    <P>We do not know what weapons stocks Israel possesses and we do not know what it has developed in terms of chemical and biological munitions. We do not know what the USA has developed in this area for the simple reason that when an international convention was established, that country refused to permit inspections of its facilities. Furthermore, the USA destabilised the United Nations organisation which was attempting to implement a convention on chemical and biological weapons.</P>
    <P>I do not say these things because I do not like America, I say them because they are facts which underline the necessity of approaching this issue through the use of reason. We must contemplate <Col N="367" />the consequences of any chosen approach, even if that approach is indifference. We are well aware of what Saddam Hussein is like. While I do not wish to discuss the USA further, I resent its use of the phrase &ldquo;the free world&rdquo; to describe itself and its allies, particularly when its primary ally in the Middle East is a corrupt family oligarchy. The USA was quite happy to have Turkey as a member of NATO when brutal military regimes were in power there. I do not say this to suggest moral equivalence, I wish to convey that to start using the rhetoric of human rights, freedom and morality to justify something is dangerous. If such language is used selectively and cynically, it fails to convince and it undermines the concept of morality. That is what concerns me in this debate.</P>
    <P>There is no moral equivalence between the USA and Iraq in terms of their being places to live, but there is no absolute moral distinction to be made either. While we are faced with obvious questions, we can forget what they are when we dress the issues up in so much language. Perhaps I do it also. We must ask if Iraq poses a threat to its neighbours or the rest of the world, to which the answer is, probably, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Iraq is not a very nice country and it has an appalling Government which is capable of being extremely nasty to its neighbours. It demonstrated that when it attacked Iran, ably assisted by the United States of America.</P>
    <P>How great is the threat posed by Iraq? That is not an academic question, even if it seems to be. Only if the threat is enormous in scale can the human and political consequences of military action against Iraq be justified. If every nasty country that posed a threat to its neighbours was to become the target of the scale of military build-up we have seen, there would be dozens of countries under threat.</P>
    <P>While I find it difficult to be fair to President Bush, he has, at least, used rhetoric which suggests that the scale of the threat is great. However, one should read the statement Secretary of State Powell made to the UN yesterday. Some of it is compelling. We have never doubted that the Iraqi regime is dishonest. That was made clear during yesterday's presentation. It is also no surprise that the regime is less than enthusiastic about the inspection process. However, unless Secretary of State Powell can produce evidence to show that what he described yesterday is happening on a large scale, it must be asked how his presentation could justify the scale of human suffering that will be a consequence of military action. How could the possibility of some things happening justify what will inevitably happen?</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts there will be horrific consequences if there is military intervention. There will be horrific short-term consequences in terms of civilian casualties and it is unknown what the Iraqi regime might do to its own people. It is easy to say this is the fault of Saddam Hussein, but the killing of civilians, either accidentally or deliber<Col N="368" />ately, is also the fault of those who take action. To justify it requires evidence.</P>
    <P>The old traditional Roman Catholic concept of the just war would have made most of the wars of the last two millennia unjust. Nevertheless, the concept is valid to this conflict. The professor of moral theology at Maynooth expressed the unambiguous view that none of the conditions of a just war could currently be said to be met in terms of the threat posed by Iraq. It is an interesting position, given that some of my colleagues have mentioned the Christian tradition. I am fascinated that a country whose political institutions appear to be Catholic seems able to ignore those who offer guidance about the morality of this conflict. That is why I am sceptical about the moral basis for military intervention. The short-term consequences will undoubtedly be large-scale civilian casualties. I and my party are not convinced that the weight of evidence in terms of non-compliance suggests a sufficient threat that would justify such losses.</P>
    <P>There are other medium and long-term consequences to be addressed. The Minister of State referred to some of these but I invite him to explain why the threat posed by the Iraqi regime is greater than the long-term danger of permanent political instability in the region as a consequence of military action, a danger we claim to be trying to prevent. I also invite those in this House and elsewhere to confront the moral and political choice we face. This is not a moral but a political issue. It amounts to a political choice, around which a construct of morality is being put together. Others are diverting the argument to economic consequences and other questions, but the real issue centres on the question of whether the threat posed by the Iraqi regime is of such a scale that it justifies the harm that will be done to innocent people. At present the answer is a definite &ldquo;No&rdquo;. We must have certainty about the existence and scale of a threat before acting against it.</P>
    <P>The postponement of military action because of the approaching summer in the Middle East is a minor inconvenience by contrast with the scale of the harm that could be inflicted. To therefore impose artificial time limits, such as a week, makes a nonsense of any argument based on morality. There can be no moral justification for the scale of human suffering that could be inflicted on Iraq simply because it would be inconvenient to postpone military action until the weather changes after the summer. As long as our moral code is so corrupted and undermined that we leave that out of the equation, we are in severe danger of compromising what this country used to stand for in international affairs.</P>

      <P>The question of war is not clear cut because there are so many variables. It is not only a matter of a good or bad guy &ndash; there is much more to it. I would consider myself to be pro-American but I am not anti-Arab or anti-Iraq. Perhaps I am a little older than some other Members, but I am reminded of the Second World War. I have said many times in the House that when the chips are down we always call on Uncle Sam. We can never repay all those young Americans who lost their lives in the last world war so that Europe would be free from the scourge of national socialism. While we can say what we like about the Americans, if things go wrong we must always turn to the United States. So far, we have never been let down.</P>
      <P>Many Senators referred to the morality of military action and I agree with many of the views expressed. I also agree with Senator Ryan's view that the current threat posed by the Iraqi regime does not justify war. The Minister of State has indicated that the Government does not wish to see war and at every forum available it has spoken and used its influence to urge the parties to find a peaceful solution. That is what we would all like.</P>
      <P>However, this debate is concerned with wider issues, especially in view of the events of 11 September. Can we truly expect the Americans to do nothing while another couple of airplanes destroy skyscrapers and kill more thousands of people? Not only are they right to act, but they have a duty to do so.</P>
      <P>The Americans have acted. To the best of my understanding they destroyed most of the al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the figures indicate that 3,000 innocent people lost their lives in that conflict. It is a very sad consequence of war. It is difficult to balance these things, right or wrong.</P>
      <P>Our main concern is whether we want the United States to be the world's policeman. Our views appear not to matter much because the Americans will act in this way regardless. The United States is the most powerful country the world has ever seen. The only frightening aspect is that power in such a huge country seems to be concentrated in the hands of a very few, who can use it for good or ill.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris outlined the faults of the United States and its various excursions. I do not approve of its involvement in the overthrow of the Allende regime in Chile, its incursions into Nicaragua or its use of agent orange in the Vietnam war, etc. However, ultimately, we must sometimes come down on one side or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A headline to a recent article in<i> The Irish Times</i> declared that if the main produce of Iraq was bananas war would not be on the agenda. I believe that to be the case. I am convinced the issue is concerned with oil. However, while America will always look after its own interests, including its business interests, it will fight against regimes like Saddam Hussein's. Whatever may be said about the United States, people like me can <Col N="370" />visit the country and criticise the President. In this country I can criticise the Taoiseach and the President. While I may be politically assassinated, I will not be assassinated in the way I would be in Baghdad.</P>
    <P>Saddam Hussein is intrinsically evil. The things he has done to the Kurds, his own people and his own family beggar belief. Nevertheless, he has done and will continue to do them unless he is stopped.</P>
    <P>We are in a delicate and tricky position. If we could be assured that no innocent Iraqi would suffer, I am convinced the whole world would say, &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo;. However, we cannot be sure of this and if there is a war, we can only hope the Americans will minimise the number of deaths of innocent people. We face a horrific prospect. Years ago Winston Churchill said jaw jaw was better than war war and that is still true. There may still be a way out but unfortunately Saddam Hussein does not seem to be ready to capitulate.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford made an important point. If we are faced with the choice of a world run by Saddam Hussein or George Bush, we should plump for a world run by George Bush. That is my position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Lydon for affording me the opportunity to make a brief intervention. I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for the work he is doing on this and many other issues in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>I expect the Minister of State will convey to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, my appreciation of his clear analysis of the present situation as demonstrated yesterday in a radio interview with Marian Finucane. The Minister set out clearly the historical development of Irish neutrality and the work Ireland has done in the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations. Through the Minister of State, I express our appreciation of the officials of his Department and our personnel at the United Nations for the outstanding work they have done, especially during our time on the Security Council, in endeavouring to find a way in which conflict can be avoided.</P>
      <P>Although there has been some misrepresentation, I am sure everyone is against war and every one of us would endeavour to find a way to avoid it. It looks as though war is now inevitable but perhaps there is still time to find a solution to the problem. The people who can most easily resolve it are the leadership in Iraq. The message has gone loud and clear from the United Nations to it that the main responsibility for bringing an end to the present dilemma rests with the Iraqi authorities. That message will be repeated by the weapons inspectors when they conclude their business. If the leaders of Iraq avail of the opportunity offered to them, there is still time to avoid a war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past year and even before then a campaign has been orchestrated and well organised by people who remain in the background. Protest <Col N="371" />marches and demonstrations have taken place at Shannon Airport which have led on a couple of occasions to the damaging of State property, the breaking down of perimeter fences and attempts by people to get onto the runways causing anxiety to those awaiting flights or meeting relatives arriving at the airport. Demonstrators behaved in ways which led to chaos at the airport and created a real risk of loss of life. What is happening is unimaginable.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the young demonstrators who are worried about war in this tense situation. I blame those who orchestrated and organised the campaign but who remain in the background. Last summer I saw bills posted in Dublin advertising protests at Shannon Airport and offering free transport to those who were willing to go and agitate there. The Green Party and the Labour Party are now running scared. We have heard little from local Labour Party Deputies on the matter. Deputy O'Sullivan, in particular, who is very vocal on other issues has been very quiet on this one while her party colleague, Deputy Higgins, makes impassioned speeches on the tarmac. However, he then denies all responsibility for those who do criminal damage to aircraft and wind up in prison. I have not seen the Green Party or the Labour Party rushing to sign bail bonds for demonstrators when they find themselves in prison, as some are at present.</P>
    <P>People have a legitimate right to protest, to complain and march on Shannon Airport which they have been doing for many years. In my 30 years as a public representative I have seen many protests and demonstrations on this issue at the airport. Proinsias De Rossa chaired a meeting in Dublin to organise a protest there but I did not see him when Aeroflot was transferring technicians on their way to work on the nuclear missile programme in Cuba. He certainly did not come to the airport at the time to protest about Aeroflot refuelling. He was in Moscow seeking money for his Democrat Left organisation.   </P>
    <P>In some respect I do not blame those who did wanton damage at Shannon Airport because their actions were orchestrated and organised by agitors ambivalent about how we deal with terrorism. The Green Party and the Labour Party are ambivalent about international terrorism but disclaim responsibility for the damage done at Shannon Airport saying they cannot be held responsible for a small minority who break away and do criminal damage to the airport. I hold the Green Party and the Labour Party responsible and believe they have questions to answer on the matter. I would like to hear their answers and hear them soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to speak on this matter and welcome the Minister of State. I was initially reluctant to speak because I feel I do not have the necesssary quailfication to do so. On reflection, however, I decided to avail of the opportunity presented to <Col N="372" />me. I agree with many of the previous speakers regarding the key issue. The two key words in this debate are idealism and realism. While none of us wants war, we must be realistic.</P>
      <P>Iraq is ruled by a tyrant who, according to a 1999 UN report, had biological weapons which could cause mass destruction. At that time the United Nations found that Saddam Hussein had 25,000 litres of anthrax. As we saw the devastation of the anthrax attack in New York in recent years, we can only begin to imagine the devastation that would result if such a level was used in an attack. The United Nations also discovered that Iraq had 38,000 litres of botilium toxin, of which there is now no trace. We must ask where has it gone. In 1999 the United Nations also found that Saddam Hussein had mobile biological laboratories and that he had used poisonous gases on whole villages, especially Kurdish villages. If a man is prepared to poison his own people, what would he do to people outside his own country?</P>
      <P>Senator Lydon referred to Saddam Hussein's relationship with his own family. His son-in-law left the country following a dispute with him. He was asked to come back and told that all was forgiven but when he returned to Iraq he was shot on the aeroplane when it landed at the airport. This is the sort of man we are talking about. He cannot even spell the word forgiveness, much less practise it.</P>
      <P>The people are concerned about our neutrality. We are not a neutral country and never have been. It is time we had a proper debate on the issue. We cannot sit on both sides of the fence. If a person stands in the middle of the road, he will be knocked down by both sets of traffic. We must examine the issue of neutrality and decide what role Ireland should play.</P>
      <P>While it is great to see us playing an active part in the United Nations, it is time we realised that, as a country, we are almost 80 years old and maturing. We should have a belief in ourselves to play an active part in world affairs and not shirk our responsibilities at every opportunity. If the country was truly neutral, we would be spending billions of euro each year on our Defence Forces. We should look again at the whole issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the ministerial permission given for the landing of aircraft and personnel. Will he clarify which Minister gives that permission? Is it the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Foreign Affairs as there appears to be some confusion about the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Daly's comments about the so-called peaceful protest at Shannon Airport. The irresponsible attitude of the Green Party on the issue left much to be desired and when things went wrong, it was quickly on the scene. The Leader of the Green Party had to engage in an embarrassing climbdown during the week on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. We should not encourage violence or vandalism of any form. Any attacks or pressure put on the Garda cannot <Col N="373" />be tolerated by any so-called peaceful protesters who have other ways of voicing their concern.</P>
    <P>There is a vacuum because of ambiguity towards our neutrality which is allowing some to exploit it. If we deal with the issue, that will not happen again. I would even be so bold as to suggest that we send a delegation from the Seanad to Iraq. On the Fine Gael benches, 13 of the 15 Senators are new. There are many new Senators on the Fianna Fáil side also. I suggest there would be no harm in having a briefing on the issue first hand down the line as it would lead to a more informed debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the welcome to the Minister of State and thank him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for their work on this delicate and sensitive issue. I was honoured to have been selected with Deputy Michael Higgins to visit Iraq from 22-28 January. I thank the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which was unanimous in proposing that we visit the country. Our first objective was to assess the Iraqi response to the United Nations resolutions and press for full compliance with them. There were other issues at which we wanted to look, in particular, the ongoing humanitarian impact of the economic sanctions on the civilian population, the operation of the United Nations Oil for Food Programme and the preparedness of the international aid agencies in relation to the delivery of humanitarian relief.</P>
      <P>I came away from Iraq very concerned about the position on sanctions, the effect of which we witnessed in the Saddam General Hospital in Baghdad. Half the population of Iraq is under 15 years of age. Obviously, children have borne the brunt of the sanctions for 12 years with many suffering from leukaemia, cancer and black fever. The doctors who spoke to us trained in London and the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin and said if they had the 20 day treatment for black fever recommended, they would be able to deal successfully with that contagious disease. They found that the cocktail of drugs needed for treatment was never fully available to them. Similarly, parts of ventilators and incubators were missing when they looked for this important equipment.</P>
      <P>The international community must take more interest in the question of sanctions against Iraq. The sanctions have been described by Professor Joy Gordon as weapons of mass destruction. The 661 committee has withheld some of the treatments. It is known as the dual use list. Products such as chlorine, which is badly needed for water treatment, cannot be allowed into the country as a result. Lead, which is used in pencils and a basic item for education, is not allowed in also. We have to make a strong case on the question of sanctions and I hope the Government will take up the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Members, I am concerned about a strike against Iraq as innocent people will be killed. The delegation saw the bombed shelter at Al-Amiriyah where 408 people were killed. It was <Col N="374" />one of 34 in Baghdad, each capable of taking 1,500 people. When the first shelter was bombed in 1991, people returned to their homes and said they would take their chances.</P>
    <P>On the question of compliance with UN resolutions, we made a strong case for an Iraqi response. We pointed out that we were standing by Resolution 1441 as we saw it as an alternative to war and an opportunity for Iraq to fully co-operate with the United Nations' weapons inspectors. One outcome of a war would be the disastrous effect on the Oil for Food Programme. Some 18 million people in Iraq, out of a population of 26 million, depend on the programme which is dependent on food rations. One of the NGOs we met, namely, CARE, stated the scheme was most efficient. We were shown the actual amounts of food each person, young and old, would receive. The Iraqi Foreign Minister, Dr. Sabri, told us there was about a three month food supply remaining in the event of a war in Iraq.</P>
    <P>It is important to focus on resolution 1441. Deputy Michael Higgins has spoken about its interpretation and said some eminent people would get together quickly to discuss the issue, as well as the role of Iraq's neighbours in the region and the Arab league, the question of ending sanctions and the fact that Iraq would do everything to facilitate the weapons inspectors. Names mentioned by him include Nelson Mandela; former US President, Jimmy Carter; Archbishop Tutu; former President and UN High Commissioner, Mary Robinson. The Ministers we met in Jordan, after leaving Iraq, were very interested in this proposal. They referred to the fact that there had been assistance for Ireland when the Northern Ireland peace agreement was being negotiated and that people such as George Mitchell and our colleagues from Canada and Scandinavia were and are still involved in the decommissioning process.</P>
    <P>I raised at every opportunity the importance of Iraq admitting UN human rights rapporteurs because of the obligations they have to meet under international human rights law. While we hope to reach a solution in a short period, it will have to be done in stages. The human rights issue is huge. Iraq is a one party state. That bonus payments are paid to party members is an example of dictatorship and abuse. There should be representation for the Kurdish population and a minority group such as the Marsh Arabs who were dealt with in a cruel manner by Saddam. As other speakers said, he must be removed. It is a question of how this should be done.</P>
    <P>Life for the Iraqi people is very difficult as there is a high dependence on food rationing. Professional people and the middle classes are devastated by the actions of Saddam Hussein. I met a retired university professor who was earning $4 dollars per month. His wife who also works at the university and is not in good health earns $25 per month. Five years ago 250 dinar was worth $10 dollars, they are now worth 12 cents. <Col N="375" />The value of the currency has fallen dramatically with consequent effects on the economy.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that many delegations have visited Baghdad and agree with what Senator Browne had to say. There were also politicians from Canada who sought to intervene. Also present were Mr. Denis Halliday and Hans Von Sponeck who resigned from the United Nations over the question of sanctions. I was pleased that members of the European Parliament had visited the area but was taken aback when Pat Cox questioned the reason MEPs such as Patricia McKenna and Prionsias De Rossa should go there. I welcome the fact that people go there &ndash; everyone should do so &ndash; to seek compliance with the United Nations resolutions and to try their best to avert war. The latter is something we are all trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>I would be very concerned about a strike against Iraq and would like to see everything being done in the context of the United Nations. The United States and Great Britain have no right to launch such an attack unilaterally. In the spirit of the United Nations, we should adhere to the resolutions passed. I welcome this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State who has far wider experience than some Members of the House. Although listening to Senators Michael Kitt, Norris, Mooney and Browne, I am impressed by the number of people who have visited Iraq and know far more about it.</P>
      <P>I am convinced of Hussein's record of evil in the past, but I am unconvinced by his current protestations of innocence. As long as he continues in power, the world will be a risky and a dangerous place in which to live. I am, in general, very pro-American. I am conscious of the commercial, historical and family ties which link Ireland with the US and of the benefits we have enjoyed as a result of our strong relationship with that country. The ties between America and Ireland should ensure that we listen with a great deal of sympathy to the calls the Americans are making, even if we do not go as far as giving them the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment now on to the war which is beginning to look more inevitable with each day that passes. The issue is not about stopping Hussein, but about how he will be stopped. There are ways of stopping him which represent too high a price to pay. I have recently returned from America, where I spent the first couple of weeks of the new year. When I talked to people there &ndash; I do not believe they were all Republicans but perhaps they were &ndash; I was struck by how many people said things like, &ldquo;We have the power to wipe out <Col N="376" />Hussein and, therefore, we should use it.&rdquo; I have not heard those sort of words in recent times. In the simplest words, what they were saying was, &ldquo;Might is right&rdquo; and &ldquo;We can do it, therefore, we have to&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is this naked assertion of America and of American interests which I find so disturbing. We cannot run the world that way. Even in an era in which there is, effectively, only one superpower, we cannot have a situation in which that power is free to impose its views and to do whatever it wishes. This is what I call an imperial scenario. However benign such a project might be when it starts, it soon degenerates into what I call unbridled aggression and, effectively, abuse of power, with the consequent destruction of the values we, in free countries, including the United States, hold dear. Our protection against that is the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Imperfect though the United Nations may be &ndash; and we have heard some criticisms to that effect &ndash; it is based on the very opposite of the might is right principle. Instead of ceding absolute power to one country, the United Nations encourages us to cling to the principles of collective power and collective action in the pursuit of world peace. That is so important that I am inclined to say we should rule out any solution to the Iraqi problem which is not organised through the United Nations. The United Nations is not an option in this crisis; it is an essential part of how we must work through it. If we get rid of Saddam Hussein through bypassing the United Nations, we will have dealt an enormous blow to the cause of freedom throughout the world. It might take us centuries to recover from such a blow because it is impossible to predict what might happen.</P>
    <P>Saddam Hussein must go and that is the bottom line. However, we must work harder to convince and persuade the Americans in regard to how this should happen. That is even more important than the simple fact that it must happen. They might not want to hear that message, but that does not reduce our obligation in that regard. If it puts strains on the relationship and friendship which binds America to Ireland, then so be it. It is essential that we act through the United Nations. We must convince the Americans that this is the only way to proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I share many of the views Senator Quinn expressed. This is not so much about Iraq but about America. Everybody in this House and virtually in the world believes the same thing about Iraq, that is, that it has an evil regime. How that regime is toppled is obviously a matter of fierce debate. To Members of this House, it is a matter of our relationship with America. In the battle between Boston and Berlin, I would be unapologetically on the side of Boston. We should be grateful to the United States, on which we are economically dependent. More than any other country, the United States is responsible for the economic boom here. That is a seriously difficult position from which to start if one wants to <Col N="377" />take a neutral position in what is probably about to become a war.</P>
      <P>As a nation, Ireland is, therefore, handicapped. As a demonstration of that, I would like to point out something about our attitude to Iraq. I remember that I and many others in this House pointed out what was happening to the Kurds in Iraq on many occasions. To be honest, and this applies to all parties, nobody was terribly interested at the time when these people were being slaughtered. Nobody was particularly interested in sanctions against Iraq at that stage, but we were perfectly happy, as part of our foreign policy, to impose sanctions against South Africa. We were utterly inconsistent in that regard. I find some of the sanctimonious comments being made now somewhat difficult to take.</P>
      <P>The main problem with this war is that innocent Iraqi people will be killed. These people have no political voice and they have no part in and do not support this war. I will not come down on one side or the other, but we must ask whether it is worthwhile toppling an evil regime the resultant cost is measured in the deaths of Iraqi women, children and babies. That is a terrible choice to make. What is America doing in pursuing this war? Is it concerned with its political or economic interests or is it really the moral policeman of the world?</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to Shannon Airport. The Government must take an agonising decision in that regard. People from all parties feel the same about humanitarian reasons for not supporting the Americans in any way. They do not want to be part of a war of any sort because of the consequences. However, imagine the consequences for Ireland &ndash; I would go further than Senator Quinn in this regard &ndash; if we were to tell the Americans they were unwelcome at Shannon. Why have we not done that? We would like to be able to tell them to fly to Frankfurt everyday and to forget about Shannon for the moment. The Americans are making a political point by landing there because they do not have to do so. They could land in London, Frankfurt or in other places. They are making the point that Ireland is not totally neutral in this war, and we are certainly not neutral in economic terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would be the consequences if we said to the Americans that we did not want them at Shannon? I do not know, nor does anybody else, but because of our economic dependence on the US &ndash; this is practical, it is not noble &ndash; we might have economic difficulties. That is the reality. The reason the Government is not telling America to buzz off is because of the possible economic consequences. What sort of a message would it send out to Intel, Hewlett Packard, Microsoft and others if we said that American soldiers were not welcome here, even to refuel, when America has done us so much good? I feel for the Government in this situation. Nobody has a monopoly of humanitarian feelings on this issue, because we all feel the same, but it would be difficult to take <Col N="378" />the high moral ground and make a decision which might have disastrous economic consequences for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think the Americans are going to war for the wrong reasons. They are doing so for economic reasons and it is not worth the candle. It is an unjust war but we should be mindful of the fact that it means a possible return to pre-Celtic tiger days with Americans taking a different economic attitude to Ireland. There is an awful balance here and it is a very difficult decision for any Government to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I sense a palpable, controlled emotion in this debate and I sense the very same emotion among the general public whenever this issue is discussed. It seems as if we are torn between common humanity and what might be perceived as economic and political expediency. It has been said here many times that being anti-war does not mean being anti-American. Those who equate both things are doing a terrible disservice to what is a very serious debate. In fact, they could be doing a terrible disservice to the general good in the long run.</P>
      <P>I am anti-war but pro-America, as many others would be. I have a greater spiritual affinity with America than I would have with many parts of Europe, which is understandable given the fact that there are 40 million people of Irish extraction in America. When we talk about America we are talking about the Irish community there also.</P>
      <P>We should be able to debate this issue not in a deliberately confused way but on a humanitarian and moral basis. One of the most striking images I saw during the debate on Iraq was the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, when he was in another part of the world, far removed from Iraq. He spoke then about the imminent danger of hundreds of thousands of people dying while other countries prepared for war. This is a vital message which should form part of the debate. Those hundreds of thousands are entitled to human rights in the same way as America would suggest that their invasion of Iraq is about human rights. The difference is that we could do something about the human rights of those Africans with the money we could save by avoiding a hostile situation such as the one that is now developing. We are talking about the expenditure of billions of dollars. If we want to talk about reality, the human rights issue must be put into context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the terrible atrocity of 11 September 2001, I can understand fully why, first of all, it would be necessary for America to retaliate and, second, to ensure that what happened should never recur. Part of the confusion in this debate, however, is that people are still not quite clear about the connection between Iraq and what happened on 11 September 2001, other than that Iraq may have the potential to inflict an atrocity of that kind and, also, that the country has an exceptionally brutal leadership that might undertake <Col N="379" />such an action. I have not seen the direct connection between the two, however.</P>
    <P>I still cannot see how the end will be justified by the means. If what we have been told by military experts and other analysts is correct, then there is no doubt that there will be huge civilian losses. We could be talking about tens of thousands of casualties, if not more, and the smart bombs will not differentiate between men, women and children. While the atrocity in America almost 18 months ago accounted for approximately 3,000 deaths &ndash; many of whom were Irish &ndash; the death toll in Iraq could be multiples of that number. In debating this issue we must look at that aspect and ask whether it will be justified. Are we sure that Saddam Hussein will be the victim at the end of the conflict? Are we even sure that it will be possible for America to put a regime in place that will have the loyalty of all the Iraqi people, if they have suffered as a direct result of aggression? </P>
    <P>Another concern of mine is the terrible damage that has been done to the United Nations. I think America was wrong in being so assertive towards the United Nations. They were entitled, by all means, to make their demands as any another UN member would be, but I have a sense of fragmentation which cannot be good for world order or future peaceful co-existence, and that is only the start of it. If America decides to take unilateral action it will not just be a matter of destabilising that particular region, it will also destabilise the allies. It is quite clear that is happening, even in the language that is being used, but at least we have stepped back from the brink of four weeks ago when the language employed was close to being hostile. That is not good for the United Nations because ultimately that organisation is the only guarantor of world order.</P>
    <P>I understand the emotion in America but we should also consider the results of recent opinion polls there. One poll showed that over 70% of Americans were opposed to war. I have visited America many times, including during the Libyan bombardment when I could find hardly anybody who disagreed with it. It is normal for the American people to consolidate at a time like this, but why is it different now? Why are the American people doubting that this is the right course of action? One reason is the markers which America itself has put down, including the undiplomatic language about the smoking gun. They have admitted there is no smoking gun, although that does not mean that there are not weapons of mass destruction but we have UN inspectors to check that. Even in the preliminary reports we received from those inspectors it is quite clear that they are not over-oriented towards the regime in Iraq but they are trying to do their job in a responsible, accountable and transparent manner. It is wrong to be aggressive towards those people who seem to me to be trying to do what is right for everybody in this case. It is clear, <Col N="380" />however, that there is no smoking gun. As of now none has been found.</P>
    <P>Having listened carefully to the speech made by the Minister of State today and to the speech made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to the General Assembly of the United Nations last September, I think Ireland is accepting its responsibilities and is doing all it should. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, said on radio recently that while he did not wish to overestimate our importance in the international forum, he knew we had played a major role in bringing about the current resolution. Nobody can point the finger at the Irish Government in this regard. One should read closely and listen to the two speeches to which I referred.</P>
    <P>If we continue along the same lines, America, which I regard as a sister nation, will not be able to say we did anything other than what was right. I would go one step further and say that in a few months' time, with hindsight, people will ask, &ldquo;Why did we not provide that moral element to help America decide the right course of action?&rdquo; In acquiescence the wrong message may be given to America. By taking a stand and making a contribution in the context of our understanding of neutrality, of being friends with America and in no way condoning Saddam Hussein and of helping those countries oppressed by dictators, we will be regarded as having been more helpful than some of those much more belligerent and at times much less logical.</P>
    <P>Today's debate was filled with palpable, controlled emotion. We had to get behind the rhetoric. That is why the debate was so important. We had to talk about humanitarian issues, sovereignty, the rights of people and the bigger, global issue of human rights where resources can be diverted to assist those who cannot help themselves. By so doing, we will ensure we do not spawn a further terrorist group in those countries, arising from unrest and dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the stance taken by the Government. Two speeches, one made today by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to this House and the other made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to the General Assembly in September should be published because the media are missing out on them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I was very interested to hear the report of Senator Michael Kitt. It is useful for Members of the Oireachtas to undertake responsible fact-finding missions and report back to us. That applies, equally, to Senator Mary White's visit to Colombia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point disguising the great unease in this country about the situation in Iraq. People are concerned about war. War is always a terrible thing for humanitarian reasons. We strongly believe that war should be the last possible resort. We are concerned, as are many others, about the <Col N="381" />possible long-term consequences of conflict that no one can foresee.</P>
    <P>Our position on any matter like this is clearly stated in the Article 29.2 of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the Pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.</P>
    <P>In that context, I warmly welcome the tone of the Minister of State's statement:</P>
    <P>The Government does not wish to see war take place. In every forum available to us we have spoken out and used our influence to urge the parties to finding a peaceful solution. We will continue to pursue this approach.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to misrepresent or caricature President Bush or Condoleeza Rice &ndash; both of whom I have heard speak at first hand &ndash; but there is widespread concern that there is too much belief by our friends in the United States in the efficacy of force and not necessarily always as a last resort. The template for me on all such matters are the principles laid down by Eamon de Valera, a very thoughtful international statesman. I would like to quote from a speech made by him in 1955. He made the point that a small country, in an alliance or not, would not be consulted about when a war commenced. That is true.</P>
    <P>In the interval, we joined the EU. I was a little amused by an article in the Irish news earlier this week trying to figure out whether, in the terms of Donald Rumsfeld, Ireland was part of the old Europe or the new Europe. As we had not co-signed the letter signed by seven or eight other countries nor had we been part of the Franco-German statement, they were not quite sure. In some ways, I am quite happy with that.</P>
    <P>Equally, Eamon de Valera was clear on the question of enforcement. He said &ndash; I have quoted this to the House previously &ndash; on 25 July 1946:</P>
    <P>Under the UN Charter, if there is ever to be a rule of law, nations must make up their minds that they will take part in such enforcement.</P>
    <P>Otherwise one cannot have a rule of international law. Disarmament has been demanded from Iraq for ten years. It has been given a much greater urgency by the events of 11 September 2001. Sanctions have negative effects. The Minister makes it clear that that is not entirely due to the crudeness of the sanctions themselves. The way in which the Iraqi regime administers that is also the case. We need to address the causes of sanctions. A particular situation could be created by the bringing to an end of sanctions and that would be better.</P>
    <P>Dictatorships are a cause of war. The famous philosopher, Immanuel Kant, in an essay which I recommend everybody should read because some of the European ideal is based on it, said militarily unaccountable governments go to war; they <Col N="382" />do not have to account to their people and there is no means of changing government. That is the cause of much of the misery in many countries.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to believe Iraq does not have nuclear weapons. The UN inspector responsible seems definite there is none. Few of us would be assured there are no chemical or biological weapons being moved around. Iraq must adopt a new attitude if war is to be avoided. Friends of Iraq are urging it to do so. There is a fear that some kind of oriental Götterdämmerung might be fixed which would leave a long-term myth in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point that the West has much about which to reproach itself. That is true of Ireland also. We, too, thought we could do profitable business in beef and health care with a brutal authoritarian regime. We had a joint commission with Iraq. The invasion of Kuwait changed our attitude. One can argue, as Senator Ryan did, about the threat but the UN has already decided that question. Weapons of mass destruction do represent a threat and we have to take it from there.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly address the situation at Shannon. We know from history that we gave discreet assistance to Britain and America during the Second World War. In this context, we are providing facilities for a build-up in the Gulf but for the purpose of securing compliance. I suppose we are much closer to the US than to Iraq, just as we were much closer to Britain and America during the Second World War than we were to Nazi Germany.</P>
    <P>If there is a second clear resolution, I do not think we will have a huge problem, even though I share Senator Ó Murchú's concerns about undue pressure being put on the United Nations. It more or less implies that the United Nations must do the business or it is irrelevant. The United Nations must make its own decisions and this could be a difficult decision to make. As the Taoiseach observed, we could have a difficult judgment to make. If war was to break out without a second resolution, we would have to judge the situation perhaps with our EU partners but without the benefit of the UN.</P>
    <P>I have respect for peaceful protest. I would have been a strong sympathiser with CND, the anti-apartheid movement and their perfectly honourable methods of civil disobedience such as sitting down on roads, etc. It is extraordinary, however, that the person who inflicted much costly damage was invited to be feted by a small number of American warmongers, in other words, those who want the war in Ireland to continue, despite the Good Friday Agreement. I am not surprised that the peace camp has broken up because I think that action made the position untenable. Perhaps the organisations which applaud that activity might think about reimbursing the Government and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks made by Senator Michael Kitt. I hope if there is, tragically, to be a war, weapons such as depleted uranium, which <Col N="383" />has caused many problems in a lot of places, will not be used.</P>
    <P>I agree with the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, that if only people put a fraction of the resources into solving some of the real economic, social and environmental problems of the world that they invest in developing and purchasing military hardware, perhaps we would not have quite so many problems to solve.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the festering sore of the Middle East must be addressed. Realistically, if war is to be avoided, a much more forward and positive attitude is needed from the Iraqi regime. We must do everything in our power to get people to hold off and see whether a peaceful resolution is still possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who has done tremendous work abroad and whose statements are welcome. I wish him continued success in his ministry. I would also like to put on record my appreciation to Senator Michael Kitt and Deputy Michael D. Higgins for going to Iraq, which was a very important mission. The report by Senator Michael Kitt is very worthwhile.</P>
      <P>On 6 November last, I called for a debate on the crisis developing in Iraq. There is enormous interest in the Seanad in discussing these issues and I compliment the Minister of State on his excellent contribution to the debate.</P>
      <P>We have a few choices to make. Saddam Hussein can prevent war by stepping down and being given asylum in another country, which would be given UN support in providing him with accommodation. This would remove the current threat from the United States of America, Great Britain and other countries who will be engaged in the war. If there was agreement to the continued presence of the UN inspectors and a peace force to be stationed in Iraq, with the agreement of the Administration there, it would certainly allay fears that the regime was building up a stockpile of weapons or producing nuclear weapons, as is being alleged. The Secretary of State, Colin Powell's, statement to the United Nations yesterday outlined the cover-ups that are taking place. The inspectors are now on the ground and will be examining the evidence provided yesterday by the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last resort and unacceptable solution is war. The Irish people are neutral and they wish to remain that way and see a peaceful solution emerge. Those people who marched last Saturday are sincere in their beliefs and want to prevent war. However, in some cases the peace movement at Shannon has been hijacked by others, including party political organisations, who wish to further advance their own agendas and not further the cause of peace. The Government has provided facilities at Shannon Airport which are in keeping with international agreements. As an independent State, Ireland is entitled to provide <Col N="384" />these facilities to assist in implementing UN Resolution 1441.</P>
    <P>Most Irish people have close connections with the United States of America. My nephew is currently in the American army and, if required, may be called up to fight in Iraq. Some 40 million Irish-Americans have an influence in this regard because the war will take place in their name. I would say to the United States that this war may be more difficult than anticipated.</P>
    <P>When all is said and done, this conflict is about oil. Yesterday, the Shell International Petroleum Company reported record profits. The French and Germans currently have reservations about the war. The Russians have obtained concessions from the Iraqi Administration in regard to oil fields and exploration. The French are deeply involved in Iraq and companies that have links to Ireland and are quoted on the British Stock Exchange have been given concessions. Post-Saddam Hussein, no one is sure what will happen about the current agreements. This is part of the difficulty involved in removing his regime.</P>
    <P>An interesting scenario is that the British have been given a concession to move in to the most profitable oil fields in Iraq. They will secure these on the first drive into Iraq if the war proceeds. Therefore, oil is the fundamental reason for the current moves on Saddam Hussein and Iraq. We must bear in mind that President Saddam Hussein was an ally of the United States of America during the war with Iran. In fact, he initiated the war against Iran and had to finally come to an agreement. The Islamic Republic of Iran, which is now coming on side with the international community, did not support that war. We provided beef to the Iranian and Iraqi armies during that period. The biggest mistake Saddam Hussein made was to move into Kuwait. If he had not done so, he would still be respected in a business sense and business would still be conducted.</P>
    <P>Some 47% of the people of Iraq are under 16 years of age. It is unseemly to go to war with a country with such a low age profile, as young people will suffer most. When I worked as an election supervisor in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1998 with the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, I experienced at first hand the ravages of war. That country will not be fully reconstructed for many generations. If Baghdad and other cities are bombed from 30,000 feet, urban infrastructure will be annihilated and there will be massive loss of life. That such an outcome must be avoided is the bottom line &ndash; it is why we are here. This House and the Government should appeal to all sides to pull back from the brink and to give space to the weapons inspectors to do their tasks and meet their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Iraq is an easy target because no other country has received such a level of surveillance from above, as was evident from Colin Powell's presentation yesterday, and on the ground. Iraq is not in a position to provide great resistance to the 140,000 troops who will be mobilised there. Although other pillars of evil such as North <Col N="385" />Korea are engaging in war-mongering, they will not be attacked as they do not have oil. Other undemocratic regimes will not be challenged in the same way as Iraq.</P>
    <P>This is a serious situation and I hope war is not inevitable. I was impressed by the Government's statement that it does not wish to see war take place. This country has used its influence in every available forum to urge all involved to find a peaceful solution to these problems. The Government will continue to pursue this highly commendable approach, which is based on UN Resolution 1441. This House should unanimously appeal to all sides in the conflict to attempt, through the United Nations, to reach a solution that will prevent war in Iraq.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House. War is the breakdown of reason and war is hell. I support UN Resolution 1441 and I share Deputy Leyden's wish that the House should unanimously request a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</P>
      <P>I hope, even at this late stage, that Saddam Hussein will comply with the United Nations, but it does not appear that he intends to do so. He is drinking at the last chance saloon. Non-compliance with the UN resolution will inevitably lead to war and, unfortunately, the people of Iraq will suffer. There is no limit to the suffering that Saddam Hussein has inflicted and will inflict on the people of his country. During the debate on this issue, some people seem to have forgotten his history of non-compliance with UN directives, human torture, invasion of neighbouring countries, use of chemical weapons to kill Iraqi people and the fact that he is an absolute tyrant.</P>
      <P>I was intrigued by Hussein's claim that Iraq does not possess weapons of mass destruction. General Colin Powell yesterday played audio tapes of intercepted conversations between Iraqi officials, in which they spoke of concealing evidence from inspectors and of coaching scientists on how to answer questions. General Powell presented satellite photographs of material being moved from sites in Iraq just before visits from UN inspectors and he related intelligence detailing Iraqi imports of banned weapons materials. In addition, he detailed travels in and out of Iraq by al-Qaeda operatives and other contact between that network and Iraq. The highly technical and elaborate presentation included about 30 slides, several intercepted audio tapes and satellite photographs. The bulk of the presentation focused on weapons of mass destruction, a large part was devoted to links with terrorism and a smaller portion was concerned with Iraq's human rights record. General Powell has been involved in reviewing US intelligence on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction programme and its links to terrorist groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that one man can bring a proud nation down, but that is what Saddam Hussein has done with his catalogue of abuse since he took up the reins of power in 1979. Within days, he had <Col N="386" />executed 20 potential rivals who were members of the Ba'ath Party and the military. In 1986, the UN Secretary General reported that Iraq had used mustard gas and nerve agents against Iranian soldiers, with significant usage in 1981 and 1984.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Iraqi military operation Anfal resulted in between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths in northern Iraq. Iraq used chemical weapons, mass executions and forced relocation to terrorise the area. In March of that year, Iraq attacked the Kurdish town of Halabjah with mix of poison gas and nerve agents, killing 5,000 residents. In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and was condemned by the United Nations. Iraq was defeated by the allied forces the following year during Operation Desert Storm.</P>
    <P>Later in 1991, however, Iraq suppressed rebellions in the south and north of the country, creating a humanitarian disaster on the borders with Turkey and Iran. A UN Special Commission was established, in co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, to ensure that Iraq was free of weapons of mass destruction and to establish a long-term monitoring programme to see that it remained free of prohibited weapons. In 1994, Saddam Hussein amalgamated the positions of Prime Minister and President. In 1998, Iraq ended all forms of co-operation with the UN Special Commission. Iraq asked the UN to replace its United States and United Kingdom staff there in 1999 and it rejected new proposals in relation to weapons inspections in 2000.</P>
    <P>This litany of abuse has caused great suffering for the people of Iraq, who have been used as a human shield by Saddam Hussein. It is planned to remove him from office to prevent further suffering, but how can this be done without a war that would itself create suffering? I ask this House to support any further UN resolutions. It looks as if we are inexorably moving towards war with Saddam Hussein and Iraq.</P>

      <P>Many wise things have been said during this debate and it is difficult to avoid repeating the comments of other Senators. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, for his speech and I congratulate him, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and our permanent representatives in the United Nations for the work they have done in developing the resolutions and maintaining lines of communication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators have shown emotion and concern when speaking about certain aspects of the rhetoric associated with US foreign policy. Particular concern has been shown in relation to the direction in which such policy seems to be in danger of going. Such comments are made, as Senator Ó Murchú has said, because we are profoundly pro-American and not because we are anti-American. This country has deep bonds of respect for the values of American democracy. As Europeans, we are grateful for the way in which the United <Col N="387" />States rescued European democracy twice in the last century.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are concerned are trying to help the US through this period, which is extremely difficult for it. As Senator Ó Murchú pointed out, we are reflecting a profound unease in American public opinion. Many good and thoughtful people in the USA are equally concerned. It is important that the United Nations is supported and that when it passes a resolution, it is enforced. I am very glad to have Senator Mansergh's assurance that Éamon de Valera enunciated that need in 1955.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day this could lead to war. The important point, on which we are all agreed, is that war should be the last resort, not the first. I, too, saw the telecasts of Secretary of State Colin Powell's address to the United Nations. It was quite powerful in many ways. Like some, I thought that there was some doubt about Iraq's nuclear potential but there is little doubt about its potential for biological warfare. It is known to have been there and if it has been destroyed, somebody should be able to show that it has or otherwise account for it. I was rather less convinced that taking on Iraq militarily at the moment would do much for international terrorism, which is of great concern to us all. The opposite might well be true: I fear that an attack on Iraq at this stage would not only do untold damage to civilian populations but also have enormous repercussions in the Arab world, which extends from Indonesia to Casablanca. As an action against terrorism, we may end up sowing dragons' teeth by the bushel. The effect would be to make every American a target.</P>
    <P>As Senator Quinn said, America is in a difficult position as it adjusts to being the sole superpower. We do not want to go back to the balance of terror that maintained peace of a sort during the Cold War, or Lord Castlereagh's balance of power within Europe, which was a recipe for later struggles. America will have to learn to live with being a superpower, part of which is ensuring support for international organisations. We must cling to the hope this can be settled by means other than war. That does not mean giving Saddam Hussein, who is quite clearly in breach of the resolution, unending rope but it does mean making every effort in the days and weeks available to ensure a peaceful resolution is achieved through the United Nations. There is a challenge for America here, too &ndash; sending troops and putting them in position to show that it really means business &ndash; calling Saddam's bluff &ndash; must be balanced with the difficulty, as the Duke of York found, of marching them down the hill again. That is something we will all want to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>There is a further step that must be considered, although we might not like it or want it. We are all fairly satisfied that if action is mandated under the United Nations and taken under its banner, no large section of public opinion here or in <Col N="388" />Europe will have difficulty in accepting it. What if the United Kingdom and the USA decide to go ahead without it? We are then presented with problems, not least the ones outlined by Senator Ross, to whom we should listen carefully on the matter. If there is a choice between the version of democracy exemplified by Saddam Hussein and that exemplified by America, very few of us would have any difficulty in making up our minds, whatever criticism we might have of the details. We must also consider the very deep and persistent connection, economically and emotionally, between this country and the USA.</P>
    <P>In the light of these considerations, it is a matter of biting the bullet, much as we might deplore it. The Government and others should be thinking about what will happen in that case and considering the best form of damage limitation. At best, we can assist in humanitarian actions and help to put the pieces together but in the meantime all anybody can do is hope and pray. I commend the Government and the Minister for the thoughtful and constructive nature of today's speech and encourage them to keep up the good work.</P>

      <P>I will be brief as we have gone over our time. I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State to address this issue, which is clearly of great international concern. The events that occur over the next few weeks and months are likely to set the international political and economic agenda not only for the rest of the year but also for many years to come. I compliment the Minister of State, his Department, including the officials who are here today, and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, for the careful work they have been doing in relation to this developing crisis. Ireland has managed quite well to balance on the fine line between endeavouring to ensure continued international peace and striving to see Iraq rid itself of all weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about what kind of weapons there are. I join Senator Maurice Hayes in my doubts about Iraq's nuclear capabilities &ndash; some of the documents we have seen in recent times cast a shadow of doubt over what is there. Mr. Powell certainly seems to be concentrating on biological and chemical weapons. I do not mean to undermine their capabilities as weapons of mass destruction. Certain Members and elements of society seem not to remember the hazardous effects of chemical weapons as we have become hung up on the nuclear threat. People have used the fact that no smoking gun was found leading to nuclear weapons as a reason not to pursue Saddam Hussein. We know that chemical and biological weapons can be just as destructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and our officials in the United Nations on the careful work we have been doing there, both on the Security Council and in the General Assembly. Throughout the European Union, we have made a telling contri<Col N="389" />bution to preserving peace. Much of this debate has concentrated on the international dimension but I want to discuss the developments in the Middle East in relation to this country, particularly with regard to Shannon Airport. As I come from County Clare, I am well aware of the fact that military aircraft of various nations have been landing at the airport for some 40 years now. They have done so during peacetime and in advance of any build-up to conflict in any part of the world. The airport deals with the fuelling requirements of military aircraft transporting military personnel to many bases throughout the Middle East. An economy has built up around this: many of the hotels in the area succeed, even in the off-season, in maintaining peak employment in the region as a result of this extra business.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport has been used for a number of reasons. Geographically, it is positioned exceptionally well: it is about halfway between the United States and many of its bases. For those of us who live in the region, one unfortunate aspect of the airport is that it does not have the same number of flights as Dublin and Cork. The uncluttered environment, however, makes it suitable for these aircraft. There has been a significant benefit to the local economy in terms of the jobs and income it has generated. I spoke to people who work in the duty free shop who, under normal circumstances, see significant sales to US soldiers returning home, although they have not seen many return flights at this stage.</P>
    <P>I condemn the actions of a small minority who fail to recognise the importance of what a peaceful protest means. The peaceful protests of genuine people, whose view differs from the Government's, have been usurped by those whose views on the war are quite different. That is to be deplored. I condemn the fact that a member of the Garda has ended up in hospital. It is regrettable that a member of the civil force was attacked while doing his duty, protecting military aircraft. Damage to the aeroplane has already cost the State a great deal of money and is something we need to examine closely.</P>
    <P>It is not just the &euro;500,000 worth of damage to the aeroplane that is regrettable but the damage to the image of the region and the country as a whole. People who are not interested in peaceful protest have succeeded in putting us in the headlines in the United States &ndash; a market that has been significant for us in terms of business and tourism. The protest has involved people from outside the State who have decided to congregate in our country and create problems for the Government &ndash; which is not directly involved &ndash; rather than in the so-called war-mongering nations of the United States or the United Kingdom. The knock-on effect is the unwanted damage to our international reputation. We have successfully generated an image of being at the forefront of the development of peace, particularly in Northern Ireland, but this image is being lost during this period of worldwide unease.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" />Much of the debate has referred to the rights and wrongs of war. Listening to some of the debate one would be forgiven for being confused at times that Saddam Hussein was a fantastic person who had great care and regard for his people. However, we know that is not the case, as some speakers have already alluded to. The argument that the United States armed Saddam Hussein over a number of years and was an ally at one stage seems to go unchallenged. It is a great strength of any democratic society to recognise that it may have been wrong in the past and that mistakes may have been made. When the United States was allied with Iraq during its war with Iran, matters were different at which stage I have no doubt that Saddam did not indicate his ultimate intentions. It is unfair to criticise the Americans for being part of a bloc of nations that succeeded in putting him where he is today. We must get over this and recognise that foreign policy and directions of countries change, that mistakes have been made and seek to redress them and ensure they do not happen again.</P>

      <P>I express my appreciation to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Tom Kitt, for attending. He has been here since before 11 a.m. This morning we came to an agreement with the Whips to leave the time fluid between 1.30 p.m. and 2 p.m. I, therefore, expect the few minutes overtime will not be taken into account.</P>
      <P>We appreciate that the Minister of State came here so readily and without any undue pressure. He has been in the House regularly. I listened to all of the debate in my office and was struck by the sincerity of the contributions and the firmly held views of many of those who spoke. I also reflected on what a good debating chamber the Seanad is. Yesterday's debate on the Science Foundation of Ireland was extraordinary in its depth and how well understood the issues were.</P>
      <P>The debate on Iraq has been extensive and featured many contributions. The holding of complex debates on important issues from time to time is the rightful role of the Seanad. I pay tribute to all those who spoke from all sides of the House. The debate has been sought for some time and I have no doubt we will hear more on the issue as it unfolds. I will continue to contribute to this matter as I have done in student debates. It is not a black and white issue &ndash; one cannot say Saddam is bad and Bush is good. That is a trite reflection of the complexity of the debate. There are many viewpoints with interleaving thoughts. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and giving of his time so readily. He has an extraordinary depth of vision on this issue and has chosen to share it with us.</P>
      <P>I must attend a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Therefore, I must leave the House but thank the Minister of State and his officials for attending today.</P>

      <P>I am privileged to have been involved in this debate and I am happy to have been present throughout because it has been profound and balanced. There was a diversity of views and opinions, which I expected, but the one over-riding message was that we should do everything possible to avoid war. For that reason, it is important the House debated the issue. It was timely, too, because additional information was available today that the Lower House did not have when it debated the issue</P>
      <P>I am heartened and believe this debate will reinforce me, the Government, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and others closely involved with the issue. This helps us in our efforts at UN level to contribute to resolving the crisis. I have always believed our interest in this area is based on our proud tradition of support for peaceful resolutions of conflicts throughout the world. Ireland has a genuine attachment to foreign policy issues, whether on foreign conflict resolution, human rights or the role of international law. Even as a small nation, we have always been anxious to play our part on the international stage, especially at the United Nations. We can and have been playing our part. I thank those who underlined this point. We are dealing with a serious situation. That has also been acknowledged.</P>
      <P>I thank those who referred to comments I made in Ethiopia. They were genuinely felt, having been there for a week with my officials talking to people where others were suffering greatly. Members may have heard me say the lives of about 11 million people are seriously at risk through no fault of their own. The country is suffering from a horrible drought which, combined with poverty, has lead to the situation where there are huge and immediate needs.</P>
      <P>I made a contrast between the resources urgently needed in Ethiopia for food aid and the resources that can mobilised in a speedy way in the Gulf. I was contrasting the cost of a war and the use of weapons &ndash; at my estimation, about $100 billion &ndash; with the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia. I have no doubt that if any Senators had been there, many of whom have been on various missions to the developing world, they would have felt the same way. Since my return there have been some humanitarian developments. There have been more offers of food aid, including a substantial one from USAID. I have written formally to all my EU colleagues to outline the seriousness of the matter and will keep Senators informed in that regard.</P>
      <P>We are determined to do everything possible to avoid war. The House will be aware of the consequences of conflict, which I have already outlined. The Government will continue to do all in its power to ensure we do not see such consequences become real. We know that Resolution 1441 was designed to achieve the disarmament of Iraq and thus bring about a peaceful solution to the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" />The inspectors are in place and continuing their work. The information shared by the United States yesterday will be given to them. They should be given the time they need to do their work. All UN members with the capacity to assist them should do so as fully as possible. They will make a further report to the Security Council on 14 February. Dr. Blix has set out very clearly the questions Iraq must answer. We are all very clear, because of the many debates we have had, that the Iraqi Government must respond in a straightforward way without any further evasion or playing for time.</P>
    <P>Senator Michael Kitt raised the issue of the dual use list and sanctions. I welcome the fact that both he and Deputy Michael Higgins were able to visit Iraq and share their experiences with us. That is healthy.</P>
    <P>During its time on the Security Council, Ireland worked hard to bring about a radical reform of the economic sanctions system to expedite the flow of supplies and do everything possible to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population. Circumstances have improved greatly, as has been made clear here today, but not enough has been done to satisfy us. A Fine Gael Senator mentioned Shannon Airport and asked whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Transport should be responsible where the law is concerned. To clarify that matter, the Minister for Foreign Affairs grants permission under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, for civilian overflights and landings. Civilian flights are subject to the usual civilian civil aviation regulations. If, however, there is a request to carry munitions or weapons, the Minister for Transport can exempt an aircraft from the prohibition against carrying weapons and munitions, as provided for under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973.</P>
    <P>With regard to the build-up, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have spoken about the need for a credible threat. Senator Maurice Hayes touched on this also. As I said, we are determined to do everything possible to avoid war and have outlined the requirements with which Saddam Hussein must comply. The build-up of army personnel is part of the credible threat. We hope it will suffice and that, combined with the role of the inspectors and the new information they have received, it will lead to an acceptable and peaceful outcome.</P>

      <P>I wish to discuss the provision of a primary health care centre in Mulhuddart and thank the Minister of State for attending to address the matter. We have spoken about providing such a centre for some time and people living in the area are extremely concerned at the delay in delivering it. It is a priority for the Blanchardstown RAPID team, which is supposed to deliver facilities for the area, and a faciltiy for which the Northern Area Health Board has developed plans.</P>
      <P>Mulhuddart has been badly neglected for many years. As the Minister of State knows, it has three times the national average number of lone parents. It also has a large number of young people leaving school at an early age, 50 times the national average. The area has no general practitioner, pharmacy or dental service. It was built in the 1970s and still lacks these essential services in 2003. Therefore, there is a huge need for a primary health care centre.</P>
      <P>It is time we recognised the lack of facilities and delivered for the people. The area has a population of approximately 2,500 which will rise to about 10,000 given the current and proposed developments to come on stream. I look forward to the response of the Minister of State which I hope will be positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I am happy to have the opportunity to respond.</P>
      <P>I am aware that primary care is the first port of call for the majority of those who use health services. It is right to acknowledge the key role a health centre has in delivering a wide range of community health and personal social services. It is important that such facilities are customer-friendly in terms of being modern, well equipped and accessible.</P>
      <P>My Department is committed to the development of primary care services. Since the primary care strategy, Primary Care &ndash; A New Direction, was launched the Department has been involved in putting in place a number of essential building blocks to support the process of implementation. A small primary care task force has been established, drawn from the Department and the health boards. In line with the role set out for this group in the strategy, it has responsibility for driving the implementation of the changes and developments set out in the model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force has engaged with and will continue to work with a range of interests concerning how the strategy will be implemented. It has met the health boards and, in several cases, representatives of key service providers at regional level. In order to begin the process of implementation <Col N="394" />of the new primary care model, the task force prioritised the selection of locations for a number of initial primary care implementation projects. In October 2002 approval was given to the first ten such projects which will build on the services and resources already in place in the ten locations involved to develop, over the coming months, a primary care team in line with the inter-disciplinary model described in the strategy.</P>
    <P>The provision of primary health care centres, including the prioritisation of the development of such centres, to meet the needs of local communities is a matter for the relevant health board or the ERHA in line with funding available under the national development plan. In the case of the Mulhuddart area, responsibility rests with the ERHA. In the light of what the Senator said, I support the desire for appropriate infrastructural developments in an area. It is necessary to work hand in hand with the local authority, health service providers and other statutory operators to ensure the appropriate supports are in place.</P>
    <P>The ERHA acknowledges the need for a major primary health care centre to serve the growing populations of Ladyswell, Mulhuddart and Corduff. It advises me that Fingal County Council has provided a two bedroom house that will be used as a GP surgery while there is a small health centre in Corduff. In the Mulhuddart area the Northern Area Health Board rents three houses from Fingal County Council, one of which is in Dromheath and used to provide child health services, drugs services and counselling services. The others are located in Wellview and used as a family resource centre. All other primary health and personal social services provision is dealt with through Roselawn Health Centre, Lower Roselawn Road. Mulhuddart has been highlighted in the national spatial strategy as a key development area. It has also been included in the RAPID programme.</P>
    <P>The local authority has indicated that the development of a new health centre is a regional priority in the context of currently inadequate local infrastructure and major population growth in the Mulhuddart area. Unfortunately, given other commitments within the community health service infrastructure, the ERHA is unable to proceed with the development at this stage. All capital development by health boards, including the ERHA, is funded through the national development plan. Since the commencement of the plan there has been significant investment throughout the health service, including the community health sector. The Department of Health and Children is reviewing from a national perspective the NDP for each health board, including the ERHA, in the light of the outturn position for 2002. This process encompasses provision for existing capital contractual commitments and, where possible, the planning or construction of new projects nationally in 2003 or beyond. It is in this context that capital developments for the <Col N="395" />ERHA are being considered. My Department fully appreciates the importance of progressing such developments and will continue to work closely with the authority in relation to prioritising its overall capital needs in line with the funding resources available under the NDP.</P>

      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister of State's response. This area has been neglected for years and is being put off again. What is the point of inclusion in the RAPID programme when it has delivered nothing to the area? This is not good news for the people of Mulhuddart. I am annoyed by the response, though obviously it is not the fault of the Minister of State whom I ask to push the delivery of the centre for Mulhuddart. It is needed as soon as possible given that it is already years behind schedule. As the matter is urgent, I ask the Minister of State to make it a priority.</P>

It is important not to blame my Department for the lack of an appropriate facility to meet demands which are the result of planning by public representatives at local authority level in Fingal County Council, some of whom, I am sure, were members of the Senator's party. They failed to ensure there would be appropriate infrastructure available to meet the needs of the prospective population of the housing developments they were planning. In that context, I am sure the Senator is as satisfied as I am that the national spatial strategy has been put in place, among other provisions. These will ensure what we have witnessed in the past will not recur in future growth and development of densely populated areas. While we recognise that there is a lack of appropriate structures, the Senator can rest assured&mdash;</P>

It will also investigate the planting of explosive devices across the Border in Northern Ireland, the planting of an explosive substance on the MMDS mast at Ardara and a host of other serious allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the tribunal and wish it well in its deliberations. As the person <Col N="396" />who first and persistently raised activities in County Donegal and asserted that the only way to establish the truth was through a tribunal of inquiry, I am passionate in my desire to see it fulfil its brief. However, it will not be able to do so unless the persons central to its deliberations are properly represented legally throughout its proceedings.</P>
    <P>Much credit for getting us to this juncture must go to the McBrearty legal team which clinically and thoroughly exposed the manner in which the State had scandalously vilified and attempted to convict a completely innocent family. It had destroyed family members' reputations and good standing in the community and left their business in tatters. For the best part of five years the McBrearty legal team had fought its clients' case, challenged their arrests and, eventually, vindicated their innocence. As the State wrecked the McBrearty business, the legal team representing the family has not received a single penny in payment of the substantial costs incurred. The McBrearty family is central to a huge segment of the tribunal's proceedings, the reason they must be legally and properly represented.</P>
    <P>Lawyers, like other professionals, must put food on the table. One cannot expect them daily to commit unpaid to a tribunal which might continue for years. There are clear precedents for some form of interim payment, as happened in the case of the Stardust tribunal in 1981 and the Lindsay tribunal. The Stardust happened to be in the constituency of the then Taoiseach. If such a payment is not made in this case, the McBrearty family will not be at the tribunal rendering it largely meaningless and a waste of taxpayer's money.</P>
    <P>On 18 December last Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty International, wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicating that Amnesty International would send Professor Stephanie Farrier as an observer to the tribunal. It expressed major reservations at the manner in which the issue of legal representation was being dealt with. It also expressed a long held view of mine that the terms of reference of the tribunal should include examination of the respective roles of the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Garda Commissioner, Attorney General, Director of Public Prosecutions and Donegal State Solicitor. The failure to include the performances of those in senior executive positions while this sordid saga was unfolding in the terms of reference of the tribunal is incomprehensible. If people have nothing to hide, why should they not have their respective performances examined by the tribunal?</P>
    <P>The intervention of Amnesty International is highly significant and very embarrassing. The fact that a respected international human rights organisation has deemed it necessary to make its strongly held views forcefully known to the Government must encourage it to respond posi<Col N="397" />tively with regard to the two areas which are of grave concern. I urge the Minister to bring an amendment before the Oireachtas to expand the tribunal's terms of reference as recommended by Amnesty International and put in place a scheme of interim payments to provide the McBrearty family with proper legal representation permitting it to appear before Mr. Justice Morris.</P>

      <P>I have been asked by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to apologise to Senator Higgins for his inability to address this matter directly in the House and to reply to the Senator on his behalf. A letter dated 18 December 2002 was sent to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by Amnesty International, the subject of which was the Morris tribunal and to which a detailed reply issued recently. It would not be appropriate, however, to discuss the details of the correspondence in the House at this time.</P>
      <P>The Minister has asked me to address the specific issues the Senator raised regarding the terms of reference of the tribunal and legal representation for the McBrearty family. The McBrearty family have initiated a number of civil actions in the High Court for damages arising from events in County Donegal and, to the best of my knowledge, have full and adequate legal representation for those proceedings. As regard the Morris tribunal of inquiry, the onus to establish the facts and inquire into the matters in question falls on the tribunal. Nevertheless, tribunals of inquiry have the right to authorise legal representation for any person appearing. This is done, in particular, where a person's good name may be called into question. The Morris tribunal has, on application to it, granted representation for 67 persons or bodies, including the McBrearty family.</P>
      <P>The question of costs is determined by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002 which allow a tribunal which is of the opinion that, having regard to findings in all other relevant matters, there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to do so to order the whole or part of the costs of representation of a person appearing before it to be paid. A tribunal, when determining whether costs should be paid, may take into account failure to co-operate or provide assistance for or knowingly giving false or misleading information to the tribunal. In effect, therefore, the reasonable legal costs of participants are effectively guaranteed in advance provided the persons concerned co-operate with the tribunal, although actual payments are not made in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand we cannot show favouritism to any particular individuals, nor can we prejudge the case of individuals. Equity requires that all parties to the tribunal be treated equally. To cover in advance the reasonable legal costs of all parties would be to pre-empt the power of the tribunal not to award costs to those who do not <Col N="398" />co-operate and undermine its greatest power in its search for the truth. The truth, after all, is what the tribunal is about. Counsel for the tribunal has already made it clear that establishing the truth in the Donegal affair will be of particular difficulty and I will not support any proposal that may hinder the tribunal in carrying out the tasks assigned to it by both Houses of the Oireachtas</P>
    <P>Both Houses of the Oireachtas passed a resolution on 28 March 2002 providing for the establishment of a tribunal under the Tribunal of Inquiry Act to inquire urgently into certain defined matters of urgent public importance relating to complaints regarding some gardaí of the Donegal division. These defined matters constitute the terms of reference of the tribunal and are based on the recommendations of a senior counsel who was nominated by the Bar Council and examined all the relevant papers held by the Garda Síochána, the Department and the Garda Complaints Board.</P>
    <P>There are two methods of amending the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal which are set out in the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1998. One provides for the tribunal to request such an amendment. If this happens, the Minister must amend the instrument establishing the tribunal provided an appropriate resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. In effect, if the tribunal takes the initiative and is supported by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister has a passive role and must amend the instrument accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides for a second method which may be initiated by the Minister. He may ask the Attorney General to consult the tribunal and if it consents, he may amend the relevant instrument, provided an appropriate resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Either the tribunal or the Minister may initiate the process but in both cases it is clear that the tribunal, in effect, has the final say.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the terms of reference was raised by certain parties with the tribunal which stated it could not possibly adjudicate on an application to extend the terms of reference unless material had been advanced as to the reason an extension should be sought. It indicated it would be willing to consider, in particular, arguments or submissions grounded on evidence but that a mere assertion or request for an extension of the terms of reference was not sufficient. At this stage the Minister is not aware of any grounds for amending the terms of reference. If the tribunal encounters any difficulties or new issues come to light, the matter can be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The existing terms of reference are not restrictive. It is a matter for the tribunal to determine how it carries out its tasks but it is open to it to examine the role of any and all State agencies in the matter specified in the terms of reference. In this regard, counsel for the tribunal is already in <Col N="399" />the process of interviewing all persons who held the office of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform during the periods in question and that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been asked, and is providing, state<Col N="400" />ments for the tribunal on all the issues coming within the terms of reference as well as discovering all relevant documentation.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 2.45 p.m. until 2.30&nbsp;p.m. on Tuesday, 11 February 2003.</P>
