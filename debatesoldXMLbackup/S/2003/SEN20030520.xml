      <P>I have received notice from Senator Mansergh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to further improve facilities for older and disabled people at State airports.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 2, Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 4.30 p.m., and No. 3, Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 2, or at 4.30 p.m., if the debate has not concluded earlier, and conclude not later than 6&nbsp;p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Leader to reconsider the Order of Business in view of the infor<Col N="2" />mation to hand concerning the schools building programme. It would be worthwhile for the House to debate the issue and hear statements from Senators and the Minister for Education and Science. One of the reasons the Freedom of Information Bill was debated so vigorously by both sides of the House was that it gave us an opportunity to see the reasons behind the decisions made by the Government. It has now come to light that the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, was complicit in a range of activities which, in effect, put children's education at risk.</P>
      <P>The decisions taken by the Government before the last general election were scandalous. We now know that in January 2002 the primary school building unit of the Department of Education and Science highlighted to the then Minister the misleading slant on the information purporting to come from the unit, the authority of which was totally undermined. In February 2002 the then Minister was warned about the information he was sending to Fianna Fáil backbenchers. The building unit asked him to ensure the language was changed to avoid negative wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a full debate on this issue. If public policy is being determined purely on the basis of politics, as happened at the last general election, <Col N="3" />it is scandalous. I ask for a debate to take place today with statements on the subject. The Leader of the House is a former member of that Cabinet and the distinguished representative of the Government in this House. Will she stand over the actions of her colleague, Deputy Woods? Does she defend them? Untold hardship has been caused to communities which want the schools building programme advanced. They should not have to be satisfied with the whims of the Fianna Fáil Party as it prepares for an election. An urgent debate is required. The truth has been exposed: the people were conned at the last general election.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, did the Senator say he was asking the Leader to agree to the change? Is it the case that he is not proposing anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing anything. This side of the House will oppose the Order of Business unless the Leader changes it to meet our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could be of some help in that regard. As I said last week, we now have a Minister or former Minister being hung out to dry every week and nobody knows what going on. I do not know what is going on in the area of education. I have restrained myself from discussing it for the last year but my sabbatical is finished.</P>
      <P>What is happening in the area of third level education? We might get a view on the matter tomorrow night when we see the Government amendment to the motion on Private Members' Business. We will also see the position of the Progressive Democrats on the matter. I intend to approach party members to see whether they will support the motion and the debate should be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to be helpful, I draw the attention of the Cathaoirleach to the Order Paper. At a time when there has never been such chaos in education, notice should be taken of the second statutory paper laid before the House today. It is a fine, colourful piece of documentation &ndash; Department of Education and Science &ndash; Statement of Strategy, 2003-2005. Nothing would be more appropriate for us to discuss &ndash; as the Cathaoirleach knows, it is quite in order to discuss papers laid before the House on the Order of Business. I ask that this fine document which deals with how we should create policy and provides for detailed planning for meeting accommodation needs at first and second level, be discussed today. In order to accommodate Senators' requests on this matter, I ask that an amendment be made to the Order of Business to this effect. We could arrange for the discussion to take place at 6 p.m. to give Members a chance to read through the document and give the Minister or somebody from the Department a chance to deal <Col N="4" />with it, although, as we have found out, it is not necessary to have the Minister for Education and Science here to discuss education strategy or policy. We might well do better with other Ministers or former Ministers.</P>
    <P>I remind Senators that some months ago there was a huge response on the other side of the House to a very casual remark made by Senator Ulick Burke to the effect that the misinformation around the time of the general election, including in the Leader's constituency, led to Members losing their seats, including the Leader. This issue has been clearly put on the agenda but I do not know the truth of it.</P>
    <P>I am not as sure as Senator Brian Hayes about whether the former Minister was misleading us. Perhaps he did secure the money and, if so, what happened in the meantime. A good question is what happened before and after that when communities were given commitments which have not been met. This issue involves more than pure politics. We are all hit by it; we are all accused of telling lies to the electorate. I would like to know what is going on. This is a good example in that context. I formally make the proposal that we take this item at 6 p.m.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes's proposal to change the Order of Business. We urgently need to debate this issue. Irrespective of the motives of the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, we need to find out what lay behind his announcement in relation to funding prior to the general election and his statement yesterday to the effect that he did not know what had happened to the funding since. As Senator O'Toole said, there is a problem regarding accountability for funding for schools' programmes. The way the issue has been handled by the Government is a disgrace. There is also the question of schools which have not been included in the latest list and have not been included in lists of schools' building works this year. Where do they stand and what is being done to address their needs for temporary accommodation, school refurbishment or permanent school buildings? I support Senator Brian Hayes's proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise a matter that is entirely non-contentious and have an interest to declare &ndash;  I am a member of the committee of patrons of the Special Olympics. I hope this issue can be dealt with in an entirely non-political way. Those involved in organising the Special Olympics would not like it any other way. Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Health and Children to make available the advice he received which led to the decision on some of the athletes who were asked not to travel? I have enormous sympathy for the Minister in the matter. When a Minister refers a matter to a committee of experts, there is little he or she can do without creating another row but take the advice offered. There are strong precedents in ordinary life of persons seeking a second medical opinion and <Col N="5" />many a life, including political ones, has been saved by doing so. It would be helpful if we knew that this matter was being kept under review and that there was the continuing possibility of a review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second Senator O'Toole's proposed amendment to the Order of Business in regard to the schools building programme. I do not know who has been misleading who. I am not making allegations against anybody but there has been a frightful level of misinformation and the matter needs to be cleared up urgently.</P>
      <P>On a separate matter, will the Leader outline to the House, in so far as she may be aware of it, as I am sure she is, the Government's current thinking on the groceries order? Last week the Tánaiste seemed to indicate that she might be in favour of its repeal, in spite of the fact that on 24 October 2000, following extensive consultations, she had upheld the order. In a press release at the time she stated she was doing so in the interests of consumers. We are aware that the Consumers Association of Ireland, farming bodies, ISME, the social partners and many others have all spoken in favour of its retention. I am not aware of any clamour for its repeal. I do not believe it would do any good, rather it could do a good deal of damage. I look forward to hearing what the Leader has to say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I had intended to second the proposal by my colleague, Senator O'Toole, but was gazumped by the representative from County Kerry. He is, however, most welcome. This shows what broad appeal the matter has.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to find out something for me on a matter of some importance. There was a debate in the United Nations human rights area on the subject of extending protections on the basis of sexual orientation. However, the Irish delegation unexpectedly abstained. It was confronted by a coalition involving Muslim countries and the Vatican. Newspaper reports suggest there was lobbying by the Vatican to get Ireland to abstain. That would be regrettable. Will the Leader inquire from the Minister for Foreign Affairs if this is the case? I will also try to find this out under the Freedom of Information Act. As a member of various human rights groups, I am aware that in South America and many other countries people are routinely imprisoned, tortured and murdered on accusations about their sexual orientation. If freedom of sexual orientation is not a civil or human right, I simply do not know what constitutes such a right. I would like some explanation with regard to why Ireland changed its support for this type of human right at the meeting to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A motion has been tabled on the subject of Iraq. The situation in that country becomes a matter of increasing concern each day. There have been reports today that Iraqi nuclear facilities are not being protected and that local vil<Col N="6" />lagers are breaking in, looting them and removing radioactive material which is leading to pollution. There are already reports of radiation sickness developing. Who knows where some of this material might go? It could certainly end up in the wrong hands. In view of the Americans' alleged interest in weapons of mass destruction, it seems astonishing that they should so casually permit this dangerous material to be dispersed throughout Iraq.</P>
    <P>There were newspaper reports at the weekend that St. Mary's Church, which is just off O'Connell Street and which is being converted into a super-pub &ndash; a licence for which was obtained under the law, which means one cannot challenge it although one might want to challenge the law &ndash; also received a heritage grant for this conversion. That is astonishing. A similar situation obtained in respect of St. George's Church. This type of behaviour is extraordinarily insensitive and strange. I worked in the area of conservation and heritage for many years and I know that it is damned difficult to obtain a grant of any kind. When a church &ndash; which had the Grinling Gibbons carvings stripped out of it when it was not properly attended to &ndash; is given a heritage grant to allow it to be converted into a pub, I begin to wonder about people's values.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available in the coming weeks to allow the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, update the House on how the working groups are coming to a final decision during the lead-in to the presentation of the Convention on the Future of Europe's final report in June? That is an important issue and it is not receiving sufficient publicity.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly sought statements on planning legislation and how it relates to regulations and by-laws. There is considerable confusion in this area and it would be no harm to arrange a debate to allow us to revisit that legislation because I am not sure whether parts of it are working very well. Such a debate could incorporate a consideration of the activities of An Bord Pleanála and An Taisce. It could also look at how they operate in tune with the legislation and how best we can work, in a complementary manner, for the good of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues regarding the need for clarity and information to be given to the House in respect of schools building projects. This matter affects the lives of many children as well as teachers and boards of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader consider the possibility of inviting the Minister for Transport to return to the House to discuss the penalty points system and insurance? The insurance companies are seeking to gain access to information regarding those who have amassed penalty points and are considering rewarding only those with zero penalty points. This is grossly unfair. People should be allowed a period of grace or should be allowed <Col N="7" />to accumulate two or possibly four points before they are penalised on their insurance. Given that Hibernian made &euro;30 million in profits last year, one can understand why the insurance companies want access to this information. It is important to debate the possibility of putting in place a threshold before which penalty points cannot be used against people who are already crippled by excessive insurance premiums.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ormonde in her request for the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to come before the House to hear statements or, possibly, a debate on the future of Europe. This is a most important period, given that the Convention on the Future of Europe is moving forward. Reports at the weekend about what was said by the chairman of the convention, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, are, to say the least, a matter of concern. As the convention concludes its work and the Intergovernmental Conference takes over, it would be useful if Members had an opportunity to address the relevant issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a very good debate in the House recently about road safety. At the time it seemed that the introduction of penalty points was working. Last weekend has proved how dangerous the roads are and how our safety on the roads is held by a very delicate thread. I believe the Minister's heart is in the right place and I would like him to be invited to the House. Senator Browne has proposed a debate on penalty points particularly in regard to insurance. We must do all we can to reduce the horrific incidence of carnage on the roads. The Minister is capable of doing something and we should encourage him to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with the point made by Senator Norris about appropriate uses of churches. In Aberdeen there are ex-churches, now night-clubs, which offer for sale cocktails called the Seven Deadly Sins. It is an invitation to mock religion. There should be some limits on what former churches are used for.</P>
      <P>I would welcome an informed debate on primary school buildings. As a candidate in the last general election my impression was that it was one of the biggest issues in the election. People were coming from every quarter looking for commitments.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to this House to debate the report of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. The report highlights a huge problem in Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in regard to facilities for premature babies. It is important not to allow a similar situation to happen in the Midland Health Board region as happened in Monaghan. It is important for the Minister to come to this House to ensure the proper facilities for premature babies are put in place in the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital in Mullingar. This issue must be addressed immediately.</P>

Over the past number of weeks there have been conflicting reports from Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil Ministers regarding their attitude to the possible reintroduction of third level fees. Given that students are just two weeks away from the leaving certificate examination, it is important to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Leader of the House. Hers was not the only constituency where promises were made in relation to primary schools which were not delivered on. In my county, Kilkenny, the two Fianna Fáil Deputies who were returned made commitments about schools in Cuffesgrange and the Rower, projects which were to be completed this year and have not been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), lines 14 to 15, to delete &ldquo;that established the team&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to make the section clearer. We put it to the Minister of State that the qualifier &ldquo;that established the team&rdquo; provided for in paragraph (<i>a</i>) is inappropriate. For example, if the State and another state establish a team and a third state joins the team, the members of the third state would not be seconded members under the Minister's definition because that state would not have established the team. That is the reasoning behind the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Article 11 of the framework decision, a joint team can be set up by mutual agreement of the competent authorities of two or more member states setting up the team. The team will be set up in one or more of the member states in which the investigations are expected to be carried out. Members of the joint investigation team for member states other than the member state in which the team operates are referred to as being seconded to the team in accordance with Article 14 of the framework decision. In other words, seconded members are the foreign members of a team appointed by member states involved in establishing the team, but these members are operating outside their state of appointment.</P>
      <P>The definition, as drafted, makes it clear that seconded members are those members who are appointed by the member states involved in the team but not the state in which the team is operating. This clarity comes from the qualifying term &ldquo;that established the team&rdquo;. The effect of this amendment might lead to confusion. Removal of the qualifying term &ldquo;that established the team&rdquo; would give the impression that seconded members could be from member states other than those involved in the establishment of the team. That is not the case.</P>
      <P>When a joint investigation team is operating in the State, the seconded members of the team will be those team members from the other member states or states involved in establishing the team. Members of the team from states other than those involved in the establishment of a team are provided for in section 6(2)(<i>c</i>). This provision allows the Minister to appoint persons who, in his or her opinion, have experience or expertise relevant to the investigations concerned.</P>
      <P>The Bill distinguishes between different types of team member. On the one hand, there are the main players, the team members appointed by the member states involved in establishing a team, called seconded members where they operate outside their state of appointment. On the other hand, there are those team members appointed from wherever to provide additional experience and expertise not readily available to the existing team. To accept the amendment would only serve to blur that distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should reconsider this aspect. If a member state not involved in establishing a team joined one, its members would be outside the definition. As worded, the subsection clearly envisages that a team may comprise members from other member states. If that was not meant, why would a member of a team be seconded in the first instance? As worded, the provision could exclude those not involved in the establishing of a team but may join at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 40, to delete &ldquo;Subject to <i>subsection (2),</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2(1) provides that the Garda Commissioner will be the competent authority of the Sate for the purposes of the Council framework decision. However, section 2(2) qualifies this by providing that where &ldquo;the competent authority of another Member State requires a request to it under <i>section 3(1)</i> to be made, or a request from it under <i>section 4(1)</i> to be received, by a judicial authority, the Minister shall be the Competent Authority in relation to the request&rdquo;. Amendment No. 2 seeks the deletion of the words &ldquo;Subject to <i>subsection (2)</i>&rdquo; in page 4, line 40, while amendment No. 3 seeks the deletion of section 2(2). This would ensure the Garda Commissioner was the competent authority in both cases. If he is the competent authority in one case, why should he not be the competent authority in all cases? The amendments seek to provide for this.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for tabling these amendments. The difficulty is that some states will accept communications and requests from the Garda Commissioner while others will not. Section 2 provides that the Commissioner will be the competent authority in Ireland for the purposes of the Bill but that where the competent authority of another member state requires that requests in relation to the establishment of a joint investigation team should be made or received through a judicial authority, the Minister, not the Garda Commissioner, will be the competent authority in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If accepted, the amendments would result in the Garda Commissioner being the sole authority for the purposes of the Bill. While that would be a neater way to proceed, if it was possible, other states, in accordance with either their legislative or constitutional arrangements, require and have named judicial authorities rather than chiefs of police as their national competent authorities for the purposes of the legislation giving effect to the framework decision. For example, Austria has named the Federal Minister for the Interior as <Col N="18" />the competent authority while Italy has named the Minister for Justice and Portugal, the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>A member state which has nominated a judicial authority as its competent authority will refuse to send requests to, or accept requests from, the Garda Commissioner. It is for this reason that the Minister must be designated as a competent authority for the purposes of the Bill. In practice, this does not mean that the Minister will be involved in the setting up and operation of joint teams, which would be the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. Providing for the Minister as a competent authority merely facilities the transmission and receipt of requests to and from those member states which do not have provision in domestic legislation to permit direct transmission of requests within judicial authorities and the police forces of a foreign state.</P>
    <P>While I understand the concerns that motivate these amendments, the effect of accepting them would be to prevent Ireland from establishing joint investigation teams with certain member states. The Minister has been nominated as a competent authority to enable us do business with those member states which would not recognise the Garda Commissioner as a competent authority in implementing their legislation to give effect to the framework decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">

      <P>I understand the problems that arise from the failure by some member states to accept the Garda Commissioner as the competent authority when requesting information. While there is little that can be done about this, the matter should be raised at European level to see if it could be overcome. In the meantime we must accept the current position and I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 5 to 7, to delete &ldquo;if the circumstances so require, for such period or periods as may be agreed by the Competent Authority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for such periods not exceeding its duration since establishment, or if the circumstances so require, for such periods as may be agreed by the Competent Authority in consultation with the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to attempt to provide for a more definite structure in terms of the period during which investigations take place. If they are allowed to proceed without greater <Col N="19" />clarity in terms of duration, they could become open ended. The Garda Síochána is under serious pressure to fulfil its responsibilities in this and other countries and many of us have called for greater resources to be allocated to it. If these investigations are ongoing for too long a period, they will impose a great strain on resources and involve a huge cost to the State. In view of this, the amendment seeks to provide that investigations should not exceed the duration provided for at their establishment but that where required, the duration may be extended if it is agreed by the competent authority in consultation with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As drafted, section 5 provides that a joint investigation team shall be established for a specific purpose and a limited period. Where necessary, that period may be extended for an additional period or periods as agreed by the competent authorities concerned. All countries involved in a joint investigation will have to agree to the extension.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed seeks to allow the period of time for which a joint investigation team operates to be extended while limiting it to &ldquo;such periods not exceeding its duration since establishment&rdquo;. In other words, a joint investigation team which had been established for four months could only be extended for an additional four month period unless other periods were agreed. This would not make sense. It is not possible at the beginning of a criminal investigation to know exactly how long it will take. The duration of an investigation depends on many factors which are completely outside the control of the persons involved and change as the investigation progresses. As an investigation progresses, the length of time involved may become clearer. Where it becomes evident that more time is needed and it is estimated that, for example, the complexity of the investigation requires an additional period of one year, the written agreement drawn up among the member states involved in establishing the team will have to be amended. It would not make sense to have to amend an agreement three times over the course of the subsequent year when it would have been quite clear at the outset that an additional period of year was required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator's proposal gives the impression that the Garda Commissioner will allow joint investigations to run endlessly. Where no further benefit is likely to accrue from the continued operation of a joint investigation team, the Commissioner will terminate it in accordance with section 5(7)(<i>b</i>). Where the purpose for which the team was established is achieved in advance of the elapse of the time allocated, the Commissioner will also terminate the team in accordance with section 5(7)(<i>a</i>). If an investigation has not been completed, the time period for which it is to continue will have to be extended. To do this in the limited manner proposed by the Senator <Col N="20" />would weaken the section. I am sure that other member states involved in the establishment of teams would agree with this conclusion.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to note that on 8 May last the Council of the European Union adopted a Council recommendation on a model agreement for setting up a joint investigation team. The model is intended to permit flexibility and be adapted according to particular circumstances. The agreement does not limit the period of extension in this way either but provides that, &ldquo;The expiry date stated in this agreement may be extended by mutual consent of the parties&rdquo;. In such a case, the agreement shall be updated.</P>
    <P>The amendment also provides that the Minister should be consulted in any agreement to extend the period of time for which a joint investigation team operates. This appears to contradict the Senator's previous amendment to section 2 which sought to remove the provision to allow the Minister's involvement in joint investigation teams. During the debate on Second Stage, the Senator asked:</P>
    <P>If the Commissioner is capable of being the competent authority, why is he not allowed to be the competent authority for all aspects of the legislation? Does this reflect a rift between the Minister and the Commissioner or mistrust of the Commissioner?</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 appears to seek to provide for shared responsibility between the Garda Commissioner and the Minister. As I have explained, the Minister is a competent authority for the purposes of the Bill and can facilitate the transmission and receipt of requests to and from those member states which do not have provision in domestic legislation to permit direct transmission of requests between judicial authorities and the police forces of a foreign state. The Commissioner has responsibility for the establishment, operation and running of joint investigation teams. I emphasise that the Minister has no role to play in the operational aspect of a team's work. For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>My question as to whether the Minister had full trust in the Garda Commissioner was dealt with on section 2. The provisions in section 5 make possible lengthy investigations, many of which may be carried out at the same time. I have no doubt that this will give rise to serious costs. To prevent this happening, I tabled this amendment which seeks to provide that investigations may be extended for one term or further after consultation with the competent authority, in this case the Minister. If we proceed in the way the Minister of State has outlined, we will be in danger of initiating lengthy and costly investigations which might continue indefinitely. We should not leave ourselves open to this in the light of the potential cost to the State.</P>

      <P>The deployment of gardaí and the assigning of tasks to them are matters for the Garda Commissioner. As the Senator rightly points out, while we are in about third place in Europe in the ratio of gardaí to the population, there is a perception that there is a scarcity of officers. The Government believes we can use more gardaí. I take the Senator's point in that regard. Gardaí constitute a scarce resource which the Commissioner must deploy to maximum effect. I am certain that any reasonable and responsible Commissioner would not allow joint investigations to drag on for longer than was necessary. As with certain local investigations, it becomes evident if a joint investigation is failing despite the expenditure of time, effort and resources. In the circumstances, I am sure the Commissioner will terminate an investigation having decided that he has better uses for the persons involved.</P>
      <P>Provision is made in the legislation which allows the Garda Commissioner to terminate an investigation if it finishes before the period for which it is agreed elapses. The Senator will be aware that we are creating a statutory framework for an arrangement which is in place informally. Joint investigations, as the Senator pointed out on Second Stage, are already a reality. Some of the most successful efforts have lasted for up to two years. When people sit down to draw up the agreement for a joint investigation, they will not provide for a two year duration but as evidence is uncovered, there must be an element of flexibility. The Commissioner will be advised by his staff and act responsibly in that regard.</P>
      <P>I point to the model joint investigation team agreement adopted by the European Council which does not mention limiting the duration of an investigation. If one looks through the agreement from start to finish, one will discover that flexibility is its hallmark. It is important not to write in restrictions. We can rely on the Commissioner to act responsibly as the competent authority who will superintend the joint investigations which take place. He will not waste scarce resources.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 8 and 9 to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Each joint investigation team to be established under this Act shall be costed by the Competent Authority prior to establishment.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask that any investigation initiated under the Bill be costed by the competent authority. I have serious concerns about the cost of investigations, some of which, as the Minister of State pointed out, may continue for two years. There is no provision in the Bill to award costs to the Garda for the work which will be carried out, or for the allocation of additional resources of any type. We <Col N="22" />should cost joint investigation teams prior to establishment. Garda drug operations are fully costed prior to their commencement. I ask that these investigation teams be costed in the same way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigating and detecting crime costs money. In this situation, the competent authority, namely the Garda Commissioner, provides the initiative to set up the joint investigation team. We cannot introduce something into domestic law which compels competent authorities in other countries to calculate costs in advance. The Garda Commissioner will calculate costs and ensure taxpayers' money is not spent foolishly in setting up joint investigations and allowing them to continue indefinitely. We are talking about serious crime. Joint investigations will not be a daily feature of policing. Rather, they will be set up to deal specifically with serious problems which have a trans-national element. The crime will of necessity be serious if the Garda get involved and invite foreign police forces to help them.</P>
      <P>These cases will involve crimes such as drug trafficking or the trafficking of human beings, which have a serious impact on quality of life. These types of situations are unusual but are, nonetheless, a feature of the modern criminal scene. It would not be possible successfully to investigate such crimes unless police forces from outside were involved. Therefore, the costs will be well worthwhile and some of those costs will be borne by the other states. That is the mechanism we are seeking to establish here.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment in the name of Senator Terry provides that the establishment of each joint investigation team should be costed prior to establishment. One of the guiding principles for the Garda Síochána, as indicated in the Garda corporate strategy 2000-2004, is to ensure that the Garda carries out its functions in a way which obtains the best value from Garda activities. The Garda policing plan for 2003 lists 12 strategic goals, one of which is managing finance to achieve best value for money. The performance indicators in the plan for this strategic goal include compliance with budget allocation and costing of major functional policing areas, including drugs, traffic and crime enforcement.</P>
      <P>This goal is intended to ensure that resources are properly managed and effectively used. With regard to certain drugs operations, which can often involve the deployment of personnel and resources from different Garda divisions, as a matter of good management practice it is not unusual, as the Senator indicated on Second Stage, that they be costed in advance to determine where costs fall and to ensure that such resources are being used effectively. I am informed by the Garda authorities that sanctioning operations which could involve major seizure or arrest are not subject or dependent on such costing. However, it is considered to be good management practice for the reasons illustrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="23" />If the Senator is suggesting that a provision be made for the establishment of teams to be subject to costing, it is difficult to see how this would work in practice if the implication is that joint teams would not be set up if costs were over a certain limit. Investigations would be set up to deal with serious crime. While good management practice would require effective use of resources and planning for same, it would not make sense to compromise the safety of citizens, perhaps even in life threatening situations, by having a mandatory requirement to go ahead or not on the basis of cost.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of a joint investigation, I do not believe it would be possible at the outset to give anything other than an estimate cost of the establishment or operation of the team. The costs will vary depending on issues such as the nature of the investigation, the type of offences to be investigated, the size of the team and the length of the investigation.</P>
    <P>As the Senator will be aware, precise costing exercises take time and protracted discussion on the subject between competent authorities would only serve to delay the establishment of a joint investigation team. The primary benefit of a joint investigation team is speed and efficiency. Why introduce provisions which allow team members to bypass existing mutual assistance procedures if we are going to delay the establishment of the team while engaged in discussions on arithmetic with the other competent authorities involved?</P>
    <P>As currently drafted, the issue of pay and remuneration for team members is dealt with in section 6 of the Bill, while section 8, which provides for the written agreement drawn up between member states establishing the team, makes specific provision for &ldquo;the financial arrangements for the team, including arrangements for the payment to its members of remuneration and allowances for expenses, if any, incurred by them, the payment of other expenses that may be incurred by it in the performance of its functions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With a view to facilitating the establishment of joint investigation teams and to allow, where possible, consistency between member states with drawing up agreements for the establishment of teams, a Council recommendation for a standard model agreement was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 8 May. The model is intended to allow for flexibility and to be adapted according to particular circumstances, i.e. not all of the provisions would necessarily be used in every case. The Council recommendation is an unbinding measure &ndash; it is being recommended. I agree that it is appropriate that the agreement to establish a team, rather than legislation itself, address the issue of costs. The Senator might wish to note that the model agreement, in dealing with organisational arrangements, allows for the setting out of costs, which will be subject to the exclusive competence of one or other of the parties to the agreement and to costs which will be <Col N="24" />shared by the competent authorities establishing the team. It is important to remember that the cost is a shared one between the member states involved. We will never bear the burden of the cost alone.</P>
    <P>The provisions for costs in the Bill are sufficient in the circumstances and the Senator must agree that the benefit to be gained from the establishment of these teams in the fight against serious crime, particularly terrorism, will largely outweigh any cost involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, I support the Bill. The amendments I have tabled are an attempt to improve it. I fully respect the benefits of having these joint investigation teams and, as the Minister of State said, the cost is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>However, I make these points at a time when our Garda force is under serious pressure and we have not provided for the additional resources that are needed to carry out these sometimes lengthy investigations. I am trying to ensure that the Garda Síochána is resourced so it can continue with the work it is required to do. While I am asking for the teams to be costed and for resources, my request is in order that the Garda force should not be depleted. We have requested additional gardaí, yet these extra members have not been forthcoming. If we do not cost these teams, we are doing ourselves and the public no favours by not ensuring that we have the resourced Garda force we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with some of the Senator's sentiments. The question of increasing the number of gardaí is a separate one. I agree that we would benefit from having more gardaí. The Government has certain commitments in that regard, which have been the subject of recent controversy. The commitment in the election manifesto and the programme for Government, as I recall it, was to provide 2,000 extra gardaí over the lifetime of the Government. Just 20% of the Government's lifetime has elapsed. Therefore, we still have four years to go. The commitment was subject to resource constraints and let us hope the resources can be made available to increase the number of gardaí.</P>
      <P>However, we cannot use the fact that we need more gardaí as an excuse or reason for undermining the operation of joint investigation teams. These will be a rarity and will be set up only in the most extreme circumstances to deal with particularly serious forms of crime which are seriously affecting the State and its people. The Government is accountable to the public and must deal with what it promised in this regard in the programme for Government and its manifestos. We will have to answer to the people in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of joint investigation teams is a good initiative. It is happening already but we are now putting in place a formal structure. In the operations that have taken place up to now there was <Col N="25" />flexibility &ndash; competent authorities were not forced to cost them in advance. It would not be desirable to do this now. In many cases it would be a wasted exercise and could delay the setting up of a joint investigation team, which could have horrendous consequences.</P>
    <P>While I do see the Senator's point, I do not propose to accept the amendment. We must take into consideration the model agreement drawn up by those who are expert in this area and which does not make any provision for this but allows the competent authority setting up the investigation team in each case to deal with the issue of costs. Costs will vary from one investigation to another &ndash; in some cases it will be appropriate to deal with costs in advance and come up with a figure, while in others it may not, depending on the complexity and scope of the investigation. While I understand the thrust of the Senator's argument, I am not prepared to put anything in the legislation which might in any way hinder the efficacy of joint investigation teams, whose purpose is to combat serious crime with a transnational flavour.</P>

      <P>Section 5(4), as worded, provides that the State can join an existing joint investigation team without any conditions and, in particular, without any of the conditions that would have to be considered if the State was involved in establishing the team. Section 4(3) sets out the criteria which must be fulfilled before the competent authority can set up a team, yet section 5(4) allows the State to join a team without having to satisfy such criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a tricky area. Section 5(4) allows the State to join a joint investigation team which has already been established on such terms and conditions as the Irish competent authority may agree with the competent authorities of the member states involved in the original establishment of the team. In other words, under this section the team has already been set up. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to provide a cross-reference to section 4(3) which deals with the criteria to be taken into consideration by the State when deciding whether to establish a joint investigation team with another member state in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I looked at this proposal initially, I <Col N="26" />though it sounded reasonable but having consulted both the office of the chief parliamentary counsel I find it is not possible to accept the amendment. The sections in question deal with two aspects of joint investigation teams: establishing a team and joining a team. Section 4 deals with the future establishment of a team by the State upon request from another state and lists the criteria that must be taken into consideration in this instance. Section 5(4), however, makes provision for joining a team which has already been established by other member states. In section 4 the Irish competent authority can agree to the establishment of a team where the investigation is to be conducted in the State. In section 5, however, the team has already been established by other member states and public interest considerations, although they may account for the State wishing to join a team, cannot be said to have been the reason for establishing the team.</P>
    <P>Similarly, while the fact that part or all of an investigation will be conducted in the State can be taken into account when deciding whether to agree to the establishment of a joint investigation team, this consideration does not count where the State joins a team which has already been set up by other member states and which is evidently operating in another member state. The sections are at odds with each other. They relate to quite different sets of circumstances and I am advised that it would technically not be possible to link them in this way.</P>

      <P>Under section 5, if the State joins a joint investigation team, the team will not have been set up with its agreement. The Minister of State mentioned a cross-reference but there is no cross-reference that I can see between the two sections. Even though under each section the State's involvement in the team is under different circumstances, surely there should be similar criteria for joining a team as there would be for setting it up in the first place.</P>

      <Col N="27" />The purpose of this amendment is to insert a new subsection which would allow for a member of the Criminal Assets Bureau who was not a member of the Garda Síochána to be appointed to a joint investigation team. The reason is obvious: it is quite clear that members of the CAB who are members of the Garda could be included under section 6(1).

      <P>This amendment would provide for an additional category of person to be appointed as a member of a joint investigation team, namely, a non-Garda CAB officer. However, having examined the amendment, I am a little lost about the purpose behind it. Section 6(2), as drafted, allows the Minister to appoint to a joint investigation team officers of customs and excise, the Revenue Commissioners, any other Government Minister and persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have experience or expertise relevant to the investigation. I have examined section 8 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 and found that the only non-Garda members appointed as bureau officers are officers of the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Social Welfare. Both categories have already been covered by section 6(2)(<i>b</i>) of the Bill. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is specifically named and the reference to &ldquo;any other Minister of the Government&rdquo; covers officers of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</P>
      <P>An officer of the Revenue Commissioners or the Minister for Social and Family Affairs who is also a bureau officer is permitted to join a joint investigation team under the existing provision. I, therefore, cannot see any reason for accepting the amendment. I see the point the Senator is making but it is already catered for.</P>

Section 6 deals with membership of a joint team and provides that members of the Garda Síochána, officers of the Customs and Excise, officers of the Revenue Commissioners and officers of any other Minister may be assigned or appointed to a joint team. In addition, section 6(2)(<i>c</i>) allows the Minister to appoint any other person who, in his or her opinion, has experience or expertise relevant to the investigation. The provision is broad and has been widely drafted in order to ensure that whatever additional expertise or advice is needed by a team is available. The Minister has the power to look beyond the gardaí and the Civil Service in order to provide this experience or advice.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment seeks to qualify this provision by referring instead to one or more persons being officers of the Minister or of another Minister. This, in effect, merely repeats the provision in section 6(2)(<i>b</i>), which already provides for the appointment of any officer of the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister or any other Minister. It narrows the scope of the provision in that it restricts the pool of expertise to officers of Government Departments or, as Senator Tuffy said, a person in a public position.</P>
      <P>This approach is not in keeping with the spirit of the framework decision, which makes specific provision for the inclusion of additional expertise from appropriate persons &ndash; be it fingerprint experts, systems analysts, computer programmers, accountants, researchers or statisticians &ndash; who are not representative of their competent authorities, to take part in the activities of the team. I refer, in other words, to persons who are not State officials. While I am aware that in the majority of cases the necessary expertise will be found among members of the Garda Síochána and officers of Government Ministers, I must consider the fact that a joint investigation team may be established, which, in certain circumstances, will require something extra. It is that for which I am providing.</P>

      <P>I still have concerns about who might be appointed under this provision. Freelance operators could be appointed. The scope of the provision is broad. How would a person appointed, who is not a public official, be accountable? What kind of person is it envisaged will be appointed? If a psychologist was to be appointed &ndash; bearing in mind that there are psychologists employed as public officials &ndash; why would there be a need to appoint a person who is not a public official?</P>

      <P>The public service, excellent though it may be, is not the sole repository of wisdom, experience and expertise. In complex fraud investigations, we may need to bring in representatives of some of the top accountancy firms. In cases of trafficking of children for sexual or other reasons, we may have to bring in representatives of the authorities in other countries, such <Col N="29" />as Albania, where such an offence is a phenomenon.</P>
      <P>In signing up to the framework decision, member states undertook to put into law not only the letter but the spirit of the agreement. A cursory glance at it would quickly demonstrate that we should not limit ourselves. It is envisaged that members of the Garda Síochána and the customs authorities &ndash; persons who are State officials &ndash; and officers of various Government Departments will be sufficient in the vast majority of cases. Occasionally, however, in order to make the difference between success and failure, we may need to appoint a person who is not in the public sector. It will not be a question of appointing party political supporters.</P>
      <P>Under new legislation, the Garda Commissioner will be the accounting officer for the gardaí and he will have to account for expenditure under the Garda budget. I am sure that if the Commissioner appointed a person who was not useful to such an investigation or a person who was a friend or whatever, he would have serious questions to answer before the Committee of Public Accounts. While I understand the Senator's concern, I consider the section is safe in this regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The disciplinary regulations for the time being in force applying to members of the Garda Síochána shall apply to service abroad by a member under section 3 of the Garda Síochána Act 1989 as amended by <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Having dealt with the Minister of State on the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill &ndash; which provides for co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland and which has a similar provision &ndash; my party considers that a similar provision would be appropriate in this legislation. I raised this matter on Second Stage. There are references to criminal liability, civil liability and the status of the member of the Garda Síochána concerned in section 10. If, however, a member of the Garda Síochána was involved in some activity that required disciplinary measures, what would happen in such a situation should be explicitly outlined in the Bill. I would interested to hear the Minister of State's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 amends the Garda Síochána Act 1989 by adding joint investigation <Col N="30" />teams to the list of overseas organisations or units with which a member of the Garda Síochána may serve. The proposed amendment seeks to further amend that Act by providing that it should explicitly state that the Garda disciplinary regulations apply to gardaí referred to in section 3 of the Garda Síochána Act 1989, that is, gardaí serving overseas on United Nations missions, as liaison officers with Europol or as members of a joint investigation team.</P>
      <P>Existing Garda disciplinary procedures already apply to Garda members outside this jurisdiction. Disciplinary powers vested in the Garda authorities are not bound by geographical limits. An explicit statement in the legislation to the effect that disciplinary regulations apply in these instances could give rise to the suggestion that they might not apply in other instances. Such an implication is undesirable. Gardaí travel abroad and are stationed abroad from time to time for purposes other than those enumerated in section 3 of the 1989 Act and they are all subject disciplinary regulations at all times. This amendment is unnecessary in that it seeks to make provision for something that already exists.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Where an act is alleged against a seconded member operating in the State which would, if committed by a member, constitute a breach of discipline, the act shall be investigated by the Commissioner who shall report thereon to the competent authority concerned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We tabled this amendment because we consider there to be a lack of a particular provision in the legislation. Such a provision is included in the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill. A provision on the disciplinary measures which may be taken against a seconded member operating in the State should be included. At the very least, a provision on the investigation of such an offence should be included. The latter could then be forwarded to the member state in the same way that a similar provision would apply in such circumstances to a member of Police Service of Northern Ireland seconded here. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point of the analogy the Senator seeks to make between the Bill and the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill. However, the fundamental difference between the two is that under the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill, members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland seconded here will, to all intents and purposes, become members of the Garda Síochána. They will be transferred here for a number of years, up to a maximum of three, and they will become members of the Garda <Col N="31" />Síochána and be subject to the same disciplinary provisions as members of the Garda Síochána operating here.</P>
      <P>It is very different in the case of a joint investigation team. These people come to the country temporarily to assist in an investigation that mainly takes place here. I understand that, under the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill, for example, if a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland is seconded to the Garda Síochána and is a member of that force, he or she can conduct an investigation in his or her own right. That will not be the case with this legislation. Local gardaí will remain in charge. Seconded members will not be allowed, under the provisions of this legislation, to conduct an investigation. They will merely be present in a support or advisory capacity.</P>
      <P>The amendment deals with breaches of discipline concerning seconded members operating in the State, that is, team members from one or other of the member states involved in establishing the team operating in the State. It provides that, where such a breach of discipline takes place, the matter will be investigated by the Garda Commissioner. The amendment is similar to section 6 of the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill, which provides for procedures to deal with breaches of discipline by a member of the PSNI who is seconded to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a significant difference between members of the PSNI seconded to the Garda Síochána and members from other EU states seconded to joint teams operating in the State. A member of the PSNI assigned to the Garda Síochána becomes a member of the force and is treated as such in all respects, whereas a member of a foreign police force seconded to a joint team operating in the State remains in the employment of the foreign state which appointed him or her.</P>
      <P>It was never envisaged that seconded members, whether police or customs officers, would operate under the direction and control of the Garda Commissioner in the same sense as members of the Garda Síochána. While they will be under the control and general superintendence of the Commissioner for the duration of the joint investigation, they will continue to be subject to their home authorities' disciplinary rules. If an alternative to this was to be contemplated, the agreement of all EU member states to a protocol on discipline would have to be secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of breach of discipline was considered in the context of the drafting of the Bill. It was decided that, if seconded members can come from the 14 &ndash; soon to be 24 &ndash; member states and be subject to 14 &ndash; again, soon to be 24 &ndash; different sets of national legislation, it would be unwise, if not impossible, to include in primary legislation a provision that would attempt to address this matter in all circumstances. While in some instances it may be appropriate for the Commissioner to report on the <Col N="32" />behaviour of a non-national who is not in his permanent employment, in other situations it would not be the correct way to proceed. We must always bear in mind that the ultimate sanction &ndash; dismissal &ndash; is not in the power of the Commissioner where members of a foreign police force are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that we decided that this matter should be dealt with as and when required. To that end, section 8, which provides for the written agreement to establish a joint investigation team, includes a catch-all provision which allows the competent authorities involved in drawing up the agreement to include &ldquo;such other terms and conditions&rdquo; as are agreed by the competent authorities concerned. This means, in effect, that, where it is considered necessary, a tailor-made provision specific to the investigation and the member states involved can be agreed. The issue of breach of discipline will be dealt with on a case by case or investigation by investigation basis. This is the most satisfactory way to approach the matter for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister of State said, there is a gap in the legislation. He pointed out the differences between this legislation and the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill. In respect of criminal liability, however, section 12 of the Bill before us states that &ldquo;seconded members of the team shall . in the case of such seconded members who are members of a police force of another Member State, be regarded as members of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo; That would conflict with what the Minister of State said.</P>
      <P>The important point is that no grievance procedure is in place for a person who is affected by or has a complaint in respect of a foreign police force member seconded to this State. That person cannot have his or her complaint investigated. That is a gap in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a grievance because seconded members will be subject to disciplinary procedures. In the debate on the previous amendment it was seen that geography is no limitation to the Commissioner's authority where discipline of members of the Garda Síochána is concerned. The same applies to other police forces, especially the other 24 with which we will be co-operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criminal liability is different. We have been advised that a separate protocol would be needed to which all member states would have to sign up if we were to introduce what Senator Tuffy &ndash; logical and correct as it may be &ndash; is seeking to introduce. In respect of criminal liability, the reason behind section 12(<i>a</i>), which states that &ldquo;in the case of such seconded members who are members of a police force of another Member State, [they may] be regarded as members of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;, is that sometimes there is a different category of punishment for offences committed against a member of the Garda Síochána as opposed to a member of the public. I do <Col N="33" />not know if that is logical, but it is part of criminal law. It was regarded as fair, right, just and consistent to provide similar sanctions for offences committed against members of a joint investigation team who happen to come from another country.</P>
    <P>Our advice is that we would need a separate protocol to which all member states would have to sign up. I am far from certain that we would obtain agreement on such a protocol because some member states are extremely sensitive about who has disciplinary control over their officers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. Under section 2, food premises, food stalls or food vehicles within the meaning of the food hygiene regulations are included. How will this Bill be applied to takeaway outlets? How is the manager of such an outlet to cope with disorderly behaviour by people who have perhaps come from the local pub and congregate outside the takeaway? Should food premises be covered by this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a policy decision that food outlets be covered by the Bill because in the past they have been an area where disorder has taken place. In this case there will be a warning and they will be given an opportunity to get their act together in terms of avoiding such disturbances in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>These outlets do not sell drink so they are not responsible for the individual becoming intoxicated. Why should the owner of a takeaway, for instance, be held responsible for the misbehaviour of somebody who is under the influence of alcohol as a result of taking drink in a licensed premises? It will be extremely difficult to oblige the owners of food premises to be responsible for the misbehaviour of people outside their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a public order Bill and is not entirely to do with drink-related offences, although clearly that is identified as the root cause of the problems. If people leave a pub in an intoxicated state and cause an affray outside a chip shop, a dance hall or wherever &ndash; it can be any sort of a congregating area &ndash; that has to be taken on board if there is disorder. Clearly it will impose extra responsibilities on the owner but it has to be included if we want to deal seriously with public order offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that anybody who commits a crime anywhere, be it outside a chip shop, a dance hall or a club, must be held responsible under the law for their actions. The difference is that we are placing an onus on the owners of food premises to ensure that this type of behaviour does not occur outside their premises. I agree that a person who commits a crime outside a premises must be held accountable but holding the owner of the premises accountable will be extremely difficult to implement. We are not giving the management of these premises the guidelines under which they must operate. We are not telling them what they must do but rather saying that they are <Col N="35" />responsible for the behaviour of people outside their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that common sense will have to prevail. If we are interested in the maintenance of public order and if, for instance, a facility is selling chips to people who are in an intoxicated state and thereby causing noise, disruption or violence, then the State must take action. If the owner is not in a position to exercise control over his customers at that hour of the night, he should close to avoid such a situation. The Bill includes the power to close the premises and this will put an onus on an owner to avoid situations where disorder would arise on his premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will enhance the reputation of the food premises. I live in Dundrum and there is a takeway shop across the road from a public house. This Bill will clean up the whole street. Owners should feel responsible for their premises.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Terry's view is a little extreme. This Bill will help clean up society and make the streets safe. People should take responsibility for their own premises and that is the end of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not really satisfied with the answers given by the Minister of State. Of course I agree with Senator White that we want our streets safe but this Bill does nothing to make them safe. It is putting the onus on the management of food premises to ensure that there is no disorderly behaviour outside the premises. It is not clear how they are supposed to achieve that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>

      <P>There is no question that the premises we are referring to are and can be the focus of serious disorder. We either decide to do something about it or not. The reason the owners of certain premises are in business is certainly not just to give a service to revellers after hours but to make a profit. If by virtue of his profit-making <Col N="36" />enterprise, his premises is giving rise to disorder, then there is an onus on an owner. This Bill will impose a penalty on the owner if he does not carry on his business properly and it extends to the vicinity of his premises.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to introduce a general duty in respect of licensees to ensure they take such action as is necessary to prevent disorder. There are very strong measures in the Bill relating to this type of duty. The penalties imply such a duty of care. My Labour Party colleagues and I believe it would be a good opportunity to spell out in legislation this duty. It would remind licensees that they need to exercise care to ensure public disorder or noise does not ensue and that they act responsibly in running their businesses.</P>

It is not the practice to insert provisions of this nature in a criminal justice Bill. They are more suited to <Col N="37" />a civil law measure where the intention would be to create a tort or breach of statutory duty.</P>
      <P>It is not the Government's intention to introduce qualifying provisions such as &ldquo;reasonably serious&rdquo; into the Bill. They would simply be regarded as let out clauses and excuses which would lead to legal arguments as to what was meant by them. The Minister is not amenable to making changes of this nature to the Bill as they are not appropriate.

      <P>This is a similar amendment. The Bill allows a judge to make an order in relation to CCTV. It would, therefore, be useful to have a general duty in relation to premises over a certain size. A similar proposal was made in the Dáil by my colleague, Deputy Costello. I accept the Minister of State's point that this would not be usual in criminal legislation. Very often provisions are included in legislation which are also included in other legislation. This has been the case in regard to work permit legislation where we referred back to immigration legislation, which is regarded as criminal legislation. I understand the work permits legislation is regarded as civil legislation. The Government has done this in the past.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to make the legislation more effective by proposing a general duty for licensees. Everyone recognises that security cameras and other measures are useful deterrents to public disorder offences.</P>

It could be considered in the context of the more general liquor licensing reforms being studied by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was raised in the other House in the context of an earlier version of the Bill, specifically in relation to section 5, paragraph (<i>c</i>). The Minister's amendments to the Bill in this <Col N="38" />area were accepted and the Bill now provides that the installation of CCTV cameras is a possibility a court may consider at the same time as it is making a closure order in the case of a different type of premises covered in the Bill, including food premises. In the earlier version this option would only have been available in the case of premises with drink licences.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>)(ii), line 31 after &ldquo;caused by&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the playing of music by&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Noise emanating from premises is referred to in section 4(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii). A number of people have complained to me about the noise resulting from the playing of music in public houses. This is a great source of nuisance to families, in particular. The Bill is the appropriate legislation to deal with the issue. My amendment should be included because it would cater for the playing of music. If it is not included, children will be kept awake at night, a nuisance for families who live adjacent to pubs. I hope the Minister of State will accept my amendment which would be of great benefit to many.</P>

      <P>There may be a slight misunderstanding here. It appears that the effect of the amendment would be to restrict the noise criterion to the playing of music by persons on the premises. Some musicians would not appreciate their music being classified as noise.</P>

      <P>Why is that the case? The existing paragraph is deliberately designed to cover all types of noise, not just that involving loud music. It also includes music. We are talking about very loud discussions, argument or drunken behaviour and so on. The section includes music and all other types of noise while the Senator's amendment refers to the playing of music only. Accordingly, the Minister sees no reason to amend the section which is drafted to include music, whether loud or otherwise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>)(ii), line 34, after &ldquo;for&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes that the subsection should refer to &ldquo;serious annoyance&rdquo; as opposed to just &ldquo;annoyance&rdquo;. There should be serious annoyance before a closure order is made. The term &ldquo;annoyance&rdquo; is quite bland and what is an annoyance to one person will not be to another. It would be more appropriate to insert this adjective to ensure that it is not just any type of annoyance which might cause the closure of a pub or premises. It must be on serious grounds.</P>

      <P>The Senator said that one person's annoyance would not be another's. However, one person's serious annoyance could be interpreted differently as well. The Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment. The District Court will operate on the basis of common sense. If something is trivial, the court would not make an order. If something is serious, the question would be what was meant by the term &ldquo;serious&rdquo; and there would be lawyers' arguments in court as to its meaning. It is preferable to leave it to the common sense of the District Court on the basis that it would not make orders for trifling reasons and that gardaí would not apply for such orders. Accordingly, it can be safely assumed that, relying on the common sense of the Garda Síochána and the courts, the term &ldquo;serious&rdquo; is already implicit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the closure of fast food and other food premises. I was involved in the fast food business for a number of years and I am familiar with most aspects of it. The Minister mentioned the level of noise, but who will be responsible for defining this? On one hand, some people will report matters out of vindictiveness or spite while, on the other, there will be genuine cases of disruption and public disorder.</P>
      <P>It amazes me, with regard to fast food premises, how the food can have such an effect on people that they cause public disorder. Nobody ever mentions that drink is the cause; it seems to be the food. Nothing is being put into the food to excite people to the extent that gross public disorder is caused at fast food premises. In fact, the opposite is the case. Food calms people down.</P>
      <P>The Government is taking a strong line on the closure of premises for providing food late at night or in the early hours of the morning. We had this debate previously in respect of litter outside fast food premises. The main problem in terms of litter is the number of plastic bags scattered throughout the countryside. I have yet to go to a fast food outlet where one will be given a plastic bag. No plastic bags are given out by these outlets. However, nobody would dare to suggest that supermarkets be closed down because of litter. One will see people eating outside fast food premises in the evening and late at night. I have seen students, young people and even old people sitting outside them on refuse bins and throwing their rubbish on the ground. That cannot be attributed to the person who owns the premises. He is she is not at fault.</P>
      <P>The Bill uses the sledgehammer approach to closing down the food premises. In the majority of cities throughout the world, one can get food at any hour of the morning. In New York, one can get a hamburger at any hour of the day or night and nobody is talking about closing these outlets down. The people of New York are not much different from the people of Ireland. Why is there no legislation there to close food premises because of public disorder? One will see bouncers on the doors of such premises, but they are there to keep out people who might cause disorder inside the premises. There are not concerned about what happens on the streets; that is a matter for the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a fast food outlet has people on the door and there is public disorder on the street, the latter cannot be attributed to the person who is running the business. The person is legitimately running their business. They have bouncers on the door and trained staff, to whom they pay big <Col N="41" />wages, and they are under enormous pressure to keep their businesses going. The Minister and the Garda Síochána, however, will come along and close down the premises. It is extremely heavy handed to put such a provision in a Bill, especially when drink and not food is the cause of the problem.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that people will congregate in places. One need only visit a town where a provincial final is taking place. There will be huge crowds. Some of the people might not have been in a fast food premises in the town, but they might cause problems outside such a premises. The Bill applies to people who have been on the premises. How is one to say whether a person was on the premises? He may well have got a burger from somebody else who was in the premises and not been in there himself.</P>
    <P>This section is inoperable. I do not know how the Garda Síochána will implement it. However, it will be possible to go to court and close somebody's business down in a big legal case that will cost the owners a great deal of money and cause great personal trauma. They are already under enormous pressure to employ people at unsociable hours and they face huge insurance costs. I feel for these people. They are providing a service in many cases. Do we want a situation to arise where it impossible to get anything to eat in our towns? That is what is happening in my own town where it is difficult to get something to eat after 8 p.m. other than in a fast food outlet. We invite tourists to the country but at the same time we are closing everywhere down.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister comes back on Report Stage he should re-examine this. I understand that a stance must be taken but this will mean that these premises will have no choice but to close, despite the fact that people are running them to the best of their ability. There are those who have been barred from such places who will get up to mischief and be vindictive, causing problems for those running the food outlets and this will not be taken into account in court.</P>
    <P>The law is an ass in many cases and there will be grave injustices done as a result of this. It is a heavy-handed way to sort out this problem. This Bill will close many of these places down and that is not the answer. I hope the Minister will look at this again before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>On Sunday evening I had the pleasure of attending Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú's oration in Crossbarry commemorating the ambush at Kilmichael on 21 March 1921 and it was an inspiration to listen to him. There was, however, a pub 100 yards from the site of the oration and it was pumping out loud rap music.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not rebel music, it was rap music and it was blaring out of the windows, causing noise pollution in the whole area. I went into <Col N="42" />the pub and was met by a phalanx of drunks who were totally stocious at 6 p.m. a mere 100 yards from where Senator Ó Murchú was giving his inspirational speech.</P>
      <P>Directly across the road from the pub there is a beautiful Centra store. It closed at 6 p.m. and the staff took in the litter bins from outside the store because they wanted to maintain the standard of their shop-front and avoid the dumping of ugly glasses and bottles by people leaving the pub. The shop-front was immaculately kept. People must take responsibility for their premises and we must become more continental in our actions. There was a complete contradiction in this situation, with raucous music 100 yards from this inspirational speech about our history.</P>
      <P>I deal with many multiple retail outlets and it is rare that one sees litter around their shops because they are conscious of their public image and want to keep the shop-front clean. On the Sunday morning after a rugby match, however, the litter bins on streets of this town are overflowing and Baggot Street is covered in litter. Private enterprise means that the retail outlet will keep its property clean.</P>
      <P>I agree that these are the only places where food is available at night and we should do everything to help late night take-away outlets, but they will be further enhanced if they take responsibility and do not allow rowdy people to gather around them. There will be better customers coming at night if they are not afraid. In Dundrum there is a fabulous Macari's chip shop. If I thought the street was tidy and safe at night I would go down if I was hungry, but I know that there will be hell for leather down there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem with food outlets because we are dealing with people who have come from licensed premises to buy chips. It will be extremely difficult for the owner of the chip shop to be responsible for the behaviour of those outside. If he sees an incident occurring, what can he do? He can ring the Garda and report the public disorder, but that is all. If there is public disorder, however, outside the licensed premises caused by those who have been served too much drink, I fully agree that the licensed premises manager should be held responsible. How can the manager or owner of the chip shop be held responsible for the misbehaviour of the drunk who came from the pub? The Minister should revisit the provisions for food premises before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Burke and Terry have a valid point. The situation is different for food premises in that they do not need a licence to do what they do because they are not serving alcohol, the main cause of public disorder of this type. I am worried, therefore, about the impact this legislation will have on these premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" />They should not, however, be totally excluded from the legislation because there are many incidents of people being attacked and even killed outside food premises and that must be taken into account. There are food premises that do not operate as they should, which do not keep a good house, and that must be recognised in the legislation. That is why the Labour Party would ensure closure orders are made in reasonable circumstances and requirements would be put in place for these outlets.</P>
    <P>I can understand the fears expressed by the Senators but I cannot see how they would address this because it is not a good idea to exclude food premises from the legislation. Maybe there are other things the Minister can do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy for the Senators' point of view but my experience of chip shops is that the rows seldom start outside; they generally start inside and spill out on to the footpath. It is clear cut &ndash; if the Garda is called to an incident that has spilt out of a premises, the chip shop owner should have some responsibility. If a row is started by people walking past and the Garda is called, common sense will prevail. Chip shops and fast food outlets cannot be exonerated because many of them are close to licensed premises. The drunk coming out of a pub will run to the chip shop for food first. They are positioned in these areas because the closer to the pub they are, the better business is. I have some sympathy for them but they cannot be completely exonerated. The Minister has struck a fair balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no argument that drink is the problem, not salt or vinegar. We all know, however, that next to night clubs and bars with late licences there are fast food outlets where people accumulate and that serious public order offences have occurred in them. Several years ago, in my own county, a fracas developed outside a chip shop and a person assaulted by a local bully ran to his car, took out his rifle and unfortunately shot the bully dead. In fast food outlets, all that is needed to give rise to trouble, if people are drunk, is for someone to jump the queue or insult somebody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The order applies of course to licensed premises as well. To stop short of including food outlets would mean a major deficiency in the Bill. Before an application for closure can be made, disorder must have taken place on the premises or in its vicinity, there must be excessive noise emanating from the premises or its vicinity, and such disorder or noise must be likely to recur. There is a provision where, if there is a difficulty or disorder and the Garda is notified, it will give a warning. It is only when there is a recurrence of that particular disorder that the issue of closure would arise. The matter then has to go before the <Col N="44" />court, which will adjudicate. We must assume a fair degree of common sense in our courts and among our gardaí.</P>
    <P>It would leave a major deficiency if the Bill were to exclude food outlets, because there has been widespread experience of disorder at such outlets. The reason these outlets are there is to make money, and if they exist simply to provide sustenance for drunken revellers after the pubs close, one must ask if such business is appropriate, if it is giving rise to disorder and to assaults. These food outlets must be covered in the legislation, which will place major responsibilities on their owners or operators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) that a licensee has failed to take action requested of him or her under section 4(2)(<i>b</i>),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to include the provision that, before a court can make a closure order, the licensee must have failed to take action requested of him or her under section 4(2)(<i>b</i>). This amendment is appropriate because, under the section as currently worded, a closure order could be made by the court without any default by the licensee. The licensee merely has to be the subject of the accusation of disorder or noise in the premises or in the vicinity, but there is no requirement to show that the person has actually failed to deal with or address the problem.</P>
      <P>If a person's livelihood can be taken away, the person should be at fault in some way. As the section is currently worded, it would seem that the licensee, or the owner or occupier, could be completely blameless. The section could also be unconstitutional. For that reason, and the other reasons outlined, I am putting forward this saving clause.</P>
      <P>Similar points were made by Senators Burke and Terry regarding the unfairness of the provisions whereby a food premises operator, for example, might simply be the victim, so to speak, of disorderly behaviour. That person should at the very least be notified of being at fault, and should have an opportunity to rectify the fault.</P>

Under subsection (4) it is provided that a person who does not comply with a closure order is guilty of an offence, and can be subject to a penalty of not more than &euro;50 or a prison sentence not exceeding three months. If we are serious about dealing with public order offences, we must have a pretty strong Bill, and any weakening of the enforcement of the Bill would certainly render it useless.

      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), line 30, after &ldquo;period&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;not exceeding 30 days&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose this amendment because, in relation to the closure order, or a subsequent closure order, there is currently provision in section 5(2)(<i>b</i>)(i) and (ii) that such an order cannot exceed seven days in the case of the first order, or, in the case of a second or subsequent order, must be not less than seven and not exceeding 30 days, yet section 7(2) seems to allow for an indefinite extension of the closure order. There is nothing there to indicate how many days the closure should be, or what length of time it should or should not exceed. That is why this amendment is tabled, in order that the length of time should not exceed 30 days, which seems reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for this amendment. The point it refers to was raised on Committee Stage in the Dáil and was withdrawn by Deputy Costello on the basis that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would examine the position to ensure that any extension of a closure order, which is provided for under section 6 of the Bill, in circumstances where the Garda is satisfied there is a risk that the disturbance or noise will recur, cannot be beyond an upper period of 30 days. The Minister would have confirmed this position on Report Stage but the <Col N="46" />debate on the Bill was concluded before the point was reached.</P>
      <P>I am happy to confirm that as defined in the Bill, a closure order means an order made under section 5 for the closure of a catering premises, that such term includes such an order as affirmed, varied or extended under the provisions of section 6. Section 5(2) then goes on to provide that a closure order shall order the closure of a catering premises for a period not less than seven and not exceeding 30 days. Section 5, read in conjunction with the definition, adequately covers the situation. The Minister is satisfied that there is no need to amend the provision in the manner suggested. I respectfully suggest that Senator Tuffy might withdraw her amendment in the light of the clarification I have provided.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9.</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 30, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11. Any member of the Garda Síochána whether in uniform or not may enter without a warrant any place in respect of which the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 apply, any premises licensed under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 1883-2000, the Registration of Clubs Acts 1908-2000, the Public Dance Halls Act 1935 and the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-1986 for the purpose of enforcement of the Intoxicating Liquor Code or the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment provides for uniformed or ununiformed gardaí being given the right to enter a premises without a warrant. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said in this House recently that under the intoxicating liquor Bill he will be including this provision, but it is appropriate that the amendment be included in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill 2002. It would allow greater powers for the Garda to arrest people behaving in a disorderly fashion or having consumed too much alcohol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appropriate to include this amendment in the Bill, as it would give greater powers to the Garda to carry out the work necessary to tackle the type of public order offences which occur. It would tackle it at source by dealing with the individual who is consuming too much drink, acting in a way that is unacceptable or seeing whether the owner of the premises is providing drink to <Col N="47" />somebody who has already taken excessive amounts of alcohol. I recommend that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>It is intention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to strengthen the powers of the Garda Síochána in this area, but the relevant provision will be contained in a separate intoxicating liquor Bill. This follows from a recommendation in the Intoxicating Liquor Commission's recent report. The Minister indicated on Second Stage of this Bill in the House on May 15 that he is preparing the intoxicating liquor Bill as a matter of priority. In the light of this development, I ask Senator Terry to withdraw the amendment.</P>

We will have to go through all Stages of the intoxicating liquor Bill, so we are talking about another 12 months or so. On the basis of the time it took to get this Bill through the Dáil, can we expect the same timeframe with the intoxicating liquor Bill?

      <P>Older people and those with some disability like to be as mobile as possible for as long as possible. If one boards a bus in the middle of the day it is full of older people. Older people make great use of trains as well. They would make more use of aeroplanes too, particularly to visit friends and family, if airports were not as intimidating as they are. I express an interest here as I refer in part to experiences I have seen with my mother-in-law who lives in the west of Scotland and who is in her early eighties.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta provides wheelchairs to take people from check-in to departure. In the early morning there is an awful lot of queuing involved, particularly as it puts together different regional destinations. In Britain it is all the one queue. It is very intimidating for an older person to the extent that people ask if they will go through with it again. Often there is nowhere to sit down. When people get in the wheelchair they might like to stop at the duty free but there is no opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>The case I am making is not just a social and humanitarian one, it is also a commercial one. There is a big untapped market for older people if conditions were right at big airports. Obviously there is no problem at small airports such as Farranfore which is easy to get around. Air operators are missing a big opportunity. People want to travel but, clearly, air travel in the larger airport is for the able-bodied. It is not for those who, with the best will in the world, are not able to travel long distances or to wait on their feet for long periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" />In the context of talking about new terminals at, say, Dublin Airport, whether under Aer Rianta or private management, I urge the Minister &ndash; I thank him for coming in to take this matter &ndash; to look at the design of the airport from the point of view of this untapped market. For example, why not have a special seating area, a type of waiting room with special check-in desks where people could be called one by one, for those who have impaired mobility or who are not able to stand for long periods? The airports could be made much more humane.</P>
    <P>I am a greater admirer of Ryanair. However, I went to the desk for a timetable and I was informed it does not issue timetables anymore, they are all on the Internet. I accept Ryanair is not in the Minister's jurisdiction in any shape or from. For an older person over the age of 60, who may not have a younger person living with them who could do the booking on the Internet, this is not friendly. We have got to stop making life more difficult for older people. They have rights and want to enjoy life. They want to have normal social contact.</P>
    <P>I accept that the possibility for adaptation is limited within an existing Bill, but I urge the Minister in the context of planning for the future to see if we could not be a pioneer country in providing and specifically catering for the needs of the older person and the person who is partially disabled. This would improve not only their quality of life, but increase throughput through airports and increase the number of persons who are able to travel. There is both self-interest and idealism involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mansergh for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I listened carefully to what he said and I have no difficulty in agreeing 100% with his sentiments. How it deals with issues such as this is a measure of any civilised society. Certainly our society should be mature enough to deal in a sensitive and sensible way with these issues.</P>
      <P>I have taken careful note of what the Senator said and I will examine the issue as a matter of urgency. Overall responsibility for general Government policy on the rights of people with disabilities is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta has statutory responsibility for the management, operation and development of the State airports, including the provision of facilities and services for aircraft and passengers as it considers necessary. The company has informed me it is company policy to ensure that the design and provision of facilities at the State airports are user friendly and accessible to all, including the elderly and persons with disabilities. The company has a pro-active policy on disability and has put in place <Col N="50" />a range of facilities and initiatives over the years which are designed to meet the needs of people with disabilities in their journey through the State airports.</P>
    <P>The building standards used by Aer Rianta for design purposes are the building regulations 2000 and in particular Part M of those regulations which concentrates on access for people with disabilities. In this regard also the company uses the current guidance document, Buildings for Everyone, published by the National Disability Authority. Aer Rianta also refers to various other relevant publications, some dedicated to airports and others more generic in nature but focused on mobility, access to buildings and the surrounding landscape. From time to time Aer Rianta consults with various agencies with specialist knowledge about specific areas of concern.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has always recognised the importance of delivering a high quality of service to all customers and the enhancement of the quality of the travel experience for all users, including the elderly and people with disabilities. The company informs me that this is achieved in partnership with the various other service providers at the airports.</P>
    <P>The three Aer Rianta airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork were among the first signatories to the airport voluntary commitment on air passenger service which was officially launched in February 2002. Aer Rianta's involvement in this voluntary commitment further demonstrates the company's commitment to customer service at the airports.</P>
    <P>One of the terms of the voluntary code commits Aer Rianta to a special protocol on meeting the needs of people with reduced mobility to ensure that infrastructure and facilities meet the needs of people with disabilities and that their safety and dignity are respected. The code also requires that the European Commission's Charter on Air Passenger Rights is prominently displayed at key strategic locations throughout the airports.</P>
    <P>The airport voluntary commitment on air passenger service is also highlighted and explained on the Aer Rianta corporate website. Airlines and ground handling operators at the airports are aware of Aer Rianta's commitment to operate the voluntary code through discussions held at the airline operators committee and other such forums.</P>
    <P>In 1999, Aer Rianta introduced a by-law which requires service providers at the State airports to make available such facilities as are necessary for passengers with disabilities in order that they may avail of all airport services. This by-law, together with the more recent special protocol to which I referred earlier, has assisted in making people in general and, in particular, people with disabilities, more aware of their rights and has heightened <Col N="51" />awareness of the issue of facilitating people with disabilities at the airports.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta informs me that it continually updates its facilities with a view to improving access and services to passengers and visitors with disabilities. At Dublin Airport, for example, an audit of all sanitary facilities for such persons was completed recently and a schedule of work is in progress on recommended modifications.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta and the airlines working at Dublin Airport have agreed to implement new measurable customer service standards at the airport to enhance the experience of those travelling through it. These service standards apply to a number of key processes at the airport, including passenger check-in, security screening and baggage collection.</P>
    <P>Further improvements are also planned for Shannon Airport, including additional public seating for passengers and upgrading and refurbishment of facilities for disabled people in the older arrivals building. With the airport designated as an arrival point for Special Olympics participants, work has already commenced on the <Col N="52" />upgrade of disabled toilet facilities adjacent to the delegation welcome centre.</P>
    <P>A new terminal and associated facilities are planned for Cork Airport. I understand from Aer Rianta that tenders for the construction of the new terminal and supporting infrastructure are in the final stages of evaluation and that work on this programme will get under way in the coming weeks. The project will include a new terminal building, a multi-storey car park with a covered walkway connection to the terminal and airbridge facilities to protect passengers getting from the terminal to their aircraft. All aspects of this major investment programme at the airport will take full account of the needs of the elderly and disabled. In this regard Aer Rianta consulted with the representatives of disabled groups to ensure the design is appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>I take on board the points raised by Senator Mansergh, including his comments on Ryanair. I will see how I can advance the cause of ensuring that elderly and disabled people have the full facilities to which they are entitled at the three State and all other airports.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.45 p.m. until 10.30&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, 21 May 2003.</P>
