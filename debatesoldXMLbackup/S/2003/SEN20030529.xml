      <P>I have received notice from Senator Morrissey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the delay in relocating Unit 9 of James Connolly Memorial Hospital to the new purpose-built hospital.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an up to date position regarding the urgent need of Griffeen Valley Educate Together to lease the site reserved for the school to enable the school to have temporary accommodation on the site by next September.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed five minutes, and on which Members may share time, the Minister to be called on to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage at approximately 12.45 p.m.; and No. 2, Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken not earlier than 1 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with the Order of Business as proposed by the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Leader will agree that the OECD is a very reputable international agency and when it reports its findings and makes conclusions about any member country there is a responsi<Col N="486" />bility on that country to respond to those conclusions. I ask the Leader to organise at the earliest possible juncture a debate with the Minister for Finance on the conclusions reached in yesterday's report. This presents a wake up call for this country, given the massive splurge in public expenditure in the past five years, the lack of value for money seen in many public projects and the fact, for instance, that the national development plan is more than 60% over budget and most of its priorities cannot be met.</P>
    <P>There are very serious conclusions and recommendations in the report, which we should closely study with the Minister for Finance to see whether the situation can be rescued. It is unfair to suggest that consumers should pay for the Government's recklessness through higher prices. I ask the Leader to allow time for this matter to be fully debated in the House.</P>
    <P>As the Leader is aware, on a number of occasions in recent months, Senators on all sides have asked for an open ended debate on neutrality, in which they can give their views openly. Later this morning, my party will publish a detailed policy position on neutrality, which takes a distinctive view of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>People have a right to be heard on this issue, in which there is public interest given the events of recent months and a debate would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unhappy with the Order of Business, in particular the taking Report and Final Stages of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill. We had a very long debate on that Bill yesterday and last night at about 9.30, we learnt that the Report Stage would be taken today. I urge the Minister to reconsider that. I do so now with much more strength, taking into account what Senator Brian Hayes has just said about the OECD report. This is not the first wake up call. That organisation gave us a wake up call two years ago when it said that all legislation passing through these Houses should undergo a regulatory assessment so that we could assess its impact on our economy. The Government <Col N="487" />approved of that and last year, following a White Paper, both the Tánaiste and Taoiseach announced that all legislation in future would have a regulatory assessment.</P>
      <P>Yesterday we had the Committee Stage of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill on which there has been no regulatory assessment. The Minister accepted no amendments other than Government amendments and by his tone and body language, if not by his words, gave the impression that any amendments he would accept would be taken in the Dáil. That is not the respect and esteem in which we should hold ourselves and we should not take Report Stage today. We should give the Minister of State time to have that regulatory assessment carried out. Even if it is not a full regulatory impact assessment, it would be easy for civil servants to tick off boxes and indicate that the legislation will affect certain areas.</P>
      <P>The Bill leads the way in setting up standards in Ireland that are higher than anywhere else in the world. It is a form of legislation that no one else is introducing, yet we hope to attract business and entrepreneurs into Ireland to create jobs and wealth. This legislation is not being given the proper attention, however, although the Minister of State is clearly saying that he will devote time to considering it before it is introduced in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I urge the Leader not to take Report Stage of the Bill today, but to defer it to a later date when the Minister of State will have had time to consider the amendments tabled yesterday by Members on this side of the House. We had a healthy debate on Committee Stage, but the Minister of State made sounds &ndash; I accept that he may not have used the actual words &ndash; which indicated that it was not his intention to accept any amendments today. I urge the Leader to reconsider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the findings of the OECD report, which, from accounts in the media, seems to be extremely important. It is not the first wake-up call, but it is further evidence that the Government has squandered the boom. Severe problems will arise as a result and the country faces major challenges in managing the economy. It is important to have an early and detailed debate on the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned by the comments of Senator Quinn on the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill, particularly regarding the Minister of State's intention to take amendments in the Dáil rather than here. All Senators will agree that we are doing an excellent job with legislation; we are anxious that it should be introduced here first in order that we can debate it in detail. I hope that Ministers take on board our dedication to the cause of legislation in that regard and that they will not treat us in a slightly cavalier manner. It is not fair of the Minister of State to table amendments in the Dáil without tabling them here, as then we do not have an <Col N="488" />opportunity to subject them to the detailed questioning needed. I ask the Leader to take Senator Quinn's views on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view that it would be useful and appropriate to debate the OECD report, but the Government is not in need of a wake-up call. If anything, it is the Opposition which needs the wake-up call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Good man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be noted that the report is complimentary of the way in which the economy has been managed and, in particular, it acknowledges the success of low taxation rates. There are many positives in the report. Nobody on the Government side is complacent about the need to manage the economy well in the future, to keep inflation under control, to encourage competitiveness and to attract inward investment. I am confident that this will be done properly under the aegis of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been many calls over the years for a debate on planning and all Members would agree with the call from the President of the IAVI to remove the blanket ban on one-off housing. Local authorities are very inconsistent. Some insist on planning applicants being employed in the area, while others put in conditions for five, seven or ten years and include sell-off clauses, which are unconstitutional but which have not been challenged. There is a need for a much more uniform national policy and I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>We could have wider use of biocycles for waste disposal and so on. This would help halt rural decline, as farmers are being savaged in terms of what is happening on their farms. It is wrong that people from rural areas may have sites available to them from their families but can still be prevented from building. They are getting the run-around by planning authorities and the present policy is denying many people affordable housing&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As ever, I appreciate the Chair's advice. I am sure the Leader would like to facilitate such a debate and the Chair will agree it would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Widespread anxiety has been created in Ennis and County Clare, in general, by extracts from a report, on the future reorganisation of hospitals, which have been leaked to the media. Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Health and Children when these reports will be published? Can we have a debate on those reports to establish the facts? Will the Minister allay the fears of people in Ennis and County <Col N="489" />Clare &ndash; though I am sure there are other areas affected &ndash; regarding the imminent closure of Ennis Hospital? This has caused widespread anxiety in the area and the Minister should allay fears by stating that there are no proposals of that nature in the report. It is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good that it seems as if teams from all countries will be able to attend the Special Olympics. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to inform the House how he proposes to organise medical coverage of the games in view of the fact that public health doctors are still on strike and the dispute seems nowhere near being settled? It is very serious to think holding a major event of this nature without proper facilities for epidemiological work being available, if needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Senator Henry's point, it is a pity that we could not have arrived at this stage a couple of weeks ago without creating tremendous fear and hoo-ha. Since the Special Olympics are organised on an all-island basis, what consultation has taken place with public health authorities in the North? </P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill and I was one of the extremely select band who remained until 9.30 p.m. last night, when Committee Stage concluded. I took a slightly different view of the Minister of State's body language. He was very receptive and patient and my impression was that he took on board much of what was said and that he would bear those comments in mind when seeking formulations that would meet the concerns expressed by Senator Quinn and me. The difficulty is that one could not really expect him to do that overnight. The Minister of State may have been putting this on hold by saying that he would not be able to consider the various amendments by today but that, before the Bill is introduced in the Dáil, he and his officials will have done so.</P>
      <P>That introduces the question of the standing of the House, which in many ways is the more important matter of concern to us. The Minister of State did not seem to be in an appalling hurry to get the Bill through. Will the Leader consider whether it is necessary to complete Report Stage today? We could do it in two stages, which would give the Minister of State time &ndash; which he may want and which he would use productively &ndash; to reflect the concerns of the House. That would meet the requirements of those who contributed and it would also be more conducive to the dignity of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In both Houses over the years, Members have been continually reminded that Ministers have little influence in the work of various agencies, such as the NRA, and that they are not responsible to the Oireachtas for the workings of those agencies. A quick glance at the NRA's recent report and the allocation of fund<Col N="490" />ing to local authorities clearly indicates political input and influence. It is no coincidence that some of the largest allocations have been made to counties Kildare, Clare and Donegal, to mention but a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>County Galway received one of the lowest allocations despite being the second largest county in Ireland. This is a disgrace and the matter must be taken up with the NRA. I took up the matter of the inaccuracies in the allocations for 2003, as shown in the appendix of the report, with the NRA yesterday but did not get much of a report on the reasons for them. The fact that a major national agency with a considerable spend produced an annual report with such glaring inaccuracies must be taken up. Somebody must take responsibility and the authority must be brought to book. It is a disgrace. If there was political influence in the determination of final allocations, it is an even greater disgrace. I hope the Leader will take up the matter as a matter of urgency with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coghlan's comments on planning. We debated rural development recently. I support what was said then and this morning by Senator Coghlan. When large estates are built in urban areas and local primary and secondary schools are unable to cope with the population increase, it is poor planning. In rural areas, schools, post offices and Garda stations are closing due to the decline in population and the attitude of planners.</P>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Daly's remarks on comments made not only about Ennis Hospital but also about other hospitals. It appears local media in all constituencies are fond of publishing adverse comments made, whether in national reports or by local politicians. Such reports are undermining the confidence of the local population in the services the hospitals provide. It is always a case of the bad story travelling far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on the OECD report. However, I sometimes think we endow reports from abroad with far more importance than we should. The OECD is a group of fine economists but it never errs from right wing conservative orthodoxy and gives little thought to the social requirements of citizens. That remains the case whether reports have the <i>imprimatur</i> of the OECD or emanate from Paris. We should keep this in mind&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to raise another issue which has been brought up before. I attended the rugby match in Lansdowne Road last Saturday, as I know others did. I say this to bring some balance to comments I made about rugby in this House a couple of months ago which attracted some attention. To be fair to the IRFU and management at Lansdowne Road, the catering fare provided was somewhat better than the tepid hot dogs and overpriced minerals which will available to Dublin supporters next Sunday at Croke Park.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <P>In relation to the many calls from both sides for a debate on planning, I spoke to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government yesterday and relayed the views expressed in the House on many occasions on one-off housing, recycling, staffing and appeals to An Bord Pleanála and the length of time they take. The Minister is aware of these views and said he would like to come to the House but wanted time to examine all of these areas which he believes are very complex. He will take time to do so but will come to the House when that examination has been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The most contentious issue facing local authorities is incineration. Plans for incinerators in Duleek and Ringaskiddy were turned down. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Health and Children should look more closely at the issue of incineration. Members may be aware of a study done in Cumbria over 37 years of residents living near incinerators and crematoria. It has come up with definitive medical evidence that babies have a 17% greater risk of being born with spina bifida and that mothers have a 12% greater risk of contracting various heart conditions. In many cases, many of those protesting against incinerators cite medical issues. We now have direct evidence that there are difficulties and should take stock of the situation. Perhaps we need to reconsider our attitude to incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support calls for a debate on health and the comments on the reports leaked to the media. The Government provided &euro;11 million to purchase Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe from the Franciscan Sisters. It also provided funds to buy a site in Tuam for a hospital. It is, however, regrettable that there is so much bad <Col N="492" />publicity about these projects which should be supported. The Government has shown the way by providing the money. I call on the Leader to arrange a debate on health funding, particularly in regard to hospitals because there is much concern about the Hanly report which only looked at two areas of the country, yet every hospital about which one talks seems to have been downgraded or is about to close.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur, to a certain extent, with Senator Glynn's comments on the importance of planning in large urban areas. One example is Lucan which, according to the Central Statistics Office, is the fastest growing area in the country. Senator Glynn is right in that the fault lies with planning but not necessarily planning by local authorities. In regard to the shortage of school places in the area in which I live, the Department of Education and Science should be taking the initiative because it is ultimately responsible for providing school places and is accountable. We need to discuss that matter as well as joined up government. All local authorities can do is rezone land and set aside sites; it cannot provide school places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs came to the House to discuss rural development. It was clear from the debate that the planning code adversely affected development in rural Ireland. I am co-founder of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association and over the last two years it has come to my notice that there is much outside influence in planning. For instance, no allowance is made for a dispersed village, a cluster village or any of the traditional concepts in that they are all based on the English concept. I bring to the notice of the House that in recent days we discovered that there was a body in Britain monitoring and, by extension, influencing planning in this country. When it was asked if it had such a monitoring body for any other country, it stated, &ldquo;No&rdquo;. It stated it had one for Ireland because of historic ties. It went on to state it did not regard Ireland as a foreign country, which is particularly worrying. If this is correct, it proves what we have believed in the last couple of years, that is, that there is an influence endeavouring to impose on us concepts of planning not traditional to Ireland. I would welcome a debate on the matter in the immediate future.</P>

Senator Moylan made the correct decision last night by indicating that the Remaining Stages of the Bill should be taken today. That has allowed the matter to be discussed on the Order of Business. However, the dignity of this House is at stake and I believe we should hold back in respect of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of the Opposition, sought a debate on the recently announced OECD report. This would be very useful. I reject his contention that the OECD damned us all. Initial reports in the papers suggest, as Senator Dardis highlighted, that, in many respects, it approves of the way we do our commercial business and run the country. I acknowledge Senator McDowell's point that we are all accepting the OECD report as if it was written on tablets of stone and that the orthodox view it represents does not take heed of real people with real needs living in real communities. That is true, but the OECD can only write its report on the basis of facts and figures.</P>
      <P>Senators Brian Hayes and O'Meara called for a debate on neutrality. This would be extremely useful and both sides of the House would be keen to have it. I will certainly request it and I await the publication of the relevant document today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003, which is on today's Order Paper. He said this legislation is too extreme and made the important point, with which we all agree, that the Seanad amendments should be given greater weight or considered further. I understand that the Minister of State, <Col N="494" />Deputy Michael Ahern, was extremely receptive and helpful in respect of proposals put to him last night. He is very interested in progressing the Bill and has paid great attention to it. I do not agree with reading into his body language because I believe that it can mean whatever one wants it to mean. We will be taking Report Stage of the Bill today and I am quite sure that he will listen carefully to what the Senators have to say. We all agree that the Seanad amendments should be accorded full weight, listened to and, if possible, acted upon. Our function is to make such amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the call to remove the blanket ban on one-off housing and the need to examine this issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly mentioned the widespread anxiety that has been created by extracts from a report on the future reorganisation of hospitals that have been made available to the media. As soon as the report is available, we will discuss it.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked that the Minister for Health and Children be invited to come before the House to tell us how he intends to address the health needs of the athletes participating in the Special Olympics in light of the strike of the public health doctors. I have invited him to do so and to refer to the matter of the participating countries, which seems to have been resolved.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes expressed a view on the body language of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, last night. The Senator asked that the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 be delayed so that further studies and reviews could be carried out. I believe that the Members of Houses of the Oireachtas are keen to see this Bill passed in the Seanad today, however long it takes, so that it can be considered in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the issue of the NRA, which I have found to be extremely punctilious and proper in its duties. It carries out the tasks given to it by the Government of the day. The Senator mentioned the funding allocated to County Kildare but my colleague, Senator Dardis, quite rightly stated that the work on the Monasterevin bypass accounts for much of what seems to be the considerable expenditure in that county. All who travel in that region will be aware of that. I do not have to stand up for the NRA &ndash; it is an independent statutory body &ndash; but I have found it to be very professional and careful in what it does.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn supported Senator Coghlan on the planning issue and supported Senator Daly's remarks on local hospitals and urban planning. He said the local media seem to publish adverse comments and not the good stories. Sadly, this is the way things happen. If the more positive news is released it will be good for local communities.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde called for a debate on planning. I am delighted that the Minister said he would be keen to come before the House to discuss this but, before he can do so, reviews still have to be conducted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" />Senator Finucane called for a debate on incineration. We all listened with dread to what we heard this morning, but waste will overwhelm us if we do not reach some conclusion regarding how it can be disposed of properly. People have legitimate fears about this difficult issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt called for a debate on health and the comments on the report which were leaked to the media. I hope the report is published, after which we can certainly debate it.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy agreed with Senator Glynn on urban planning, but stated that the Department of Education and Science is ultimately responsible for deciding on the location and size of schools and the provision of school places. That is true.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú's remarks were extremely important, particularly in respect of the influence of the monitoring unit from the UK that is considering our planning system and our traditional concepts of extended villages and groups of houses. The unit aims to impose on us a model of planning based on the English country village, which does not reflect the way we have lived.</P>

      <P>The Senator's remarks were very disturbing. I suggest that he convey them to the Minister for Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, because we are not aping the English shires and we never did so. Why should we follow their planning guidelines?</P>
      <P>Senator White praised last night's healthy debate on the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003. I am glad to hear it was healthy. We hope to conclude the Bill today.</P>
      <P>Senator Dooley called for a debate on the hospital in Ennis and spoke about the way in which the NRA carries out its duties. His experience of the NRA echoes my own. It works to a framework laid down by the Government of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to commence the debate on this important Bill in this House. It is widely acknowledged that social partnership involving employers, employees and Government has been the driving force of change in the workplace over recent years. This social partnership process has been backed up by a well-balanced range of employment rights/labour legislation which, together with measures designed to stimulate employment, provides an appropriate framework for the purpose of achieving an efficient and competitive business environment. Employment rights legislation covering a range of areas such as conditions of employment has an important role to play in promoting labour market stability and minimizing conflict. In keeping with Ireland's voluntarist tradition, collective agreements are, generally, the primary method of determining conditions of employment. The role of statute law has generally been limited to that of setting minimum levels of protection or entitlement.</P>
      <P>Ireland has over the past 20 to 30 years been to the forefront in ensuring that reasonable conditions of employment exist which set out clearly for both employers and employees their respective entitlements. Successive Governments have enacted legislation in the area of employment rights reflecting changes in society and the workplace at both national and international levels through, for example, the transposition of EU directives and reflecting in Irish domestic law the standard setting activities of the International Labour Organisation, ILO, and the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>Such legislation has covered a wide range of areas, including minimum notice and terms of employment; protection against unfair dismissal; payment of wages; organisation of working time; safeguarding of employees rights on the transfer of undertakings; protection of young persons at work; safety, health and welfare; redundancy and insolvency entitlements; minimum wage entitlements; and protection of part-time workers</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area where employment rights legislation has dramatically affected people's work and lifestyles is that of the organisation of working time. This area covers issues such as holiday entitlements, rest periods, maximum working time and night work. Changing social needs and technological advances have influenced the way we work and the length of time in terms of days and hours per week we spend in the workplace. For example, the maximum number of hours people work per week has fallen over the years from 60 hours to 48 hours. The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which implemented an EU directive on working time, set the maximum number <Col N="496" /><Col N="497" />of hours that may be worked in a week at 48 hours.</P>
    <P>The needs of workers and employers have also changed over the years. Nowadays, employers want a well-educated and flexible workforce that allows their companies to be competitive in what are becoming increasingly globalised markets. Employees also want the flexibility that enables them to balance work and family life and allows them to be able to move within and across employments, thereby enhancing their work skills and educational needs through lifelong learning programmes. Many employees do this by means of temporary employment, either through the auspices of employment agencies or through fixed-term contract work.</P>
    <P>Fixed-term contract work provides these employees with both opportunities and challenges. Many of their contracts are fixed-purpose based or time-based to coincide with the completion of a specific task or an event. This often involves meeting deadlines by the employee on the one hand, while giving employers increased productivity through clearly identifiable targets or outputs on the other. The combination of job satisfaction for fixed-term employees and increased productivity for employers has, in many ways, changed the environment in the labour market in recent years.</P>
    <P>All these changes in employment rights legislation have also influenced employment trends and the numbers in employment. According to Central Statistics Office figures for the last quarter of 2002, the number of persons in employment has risen from 1.22 million in 1994 to 1.77 million in 2002, an increase of 45%. This number includes 294,000 part-time workers. This number represents 17% of the workforce with the majority of these being women. In addition to atypical workers such as part-time workers, there is also the category of fixed-term contract workers. While the CSO does not at present have figures for these workers, it is estimated that there are some 70,000 fixed-term contract workers, or just 4% of the workforce. The CSO has been requested as part of its review of the quarterly national household survey for 2003-2006 to include in its questionnaires a series of questions to ascertain the numbers and trends in relation to fixed-term workers.</P>
    <P>Despite these increasing and welcome figures, we have in Ireland over the past few years been experiencing severe skills shortages in our economy. This is also happening right across Europe. To address this major problem, the European Commission and the European Council have each year since 1998, under the Luxembourg Process, requested member states to prepare an employment action plan setting out their respective Government's proposals on how to improve the overall economic environment in terms of people at work. As part of this process member states' respective annual employment action plans are required to set out policies which<i>, inter alia,</i> facilitate opportunities for women who have <Col N="498" />raised their families and are keen to come back into the workplace and formulate family-friendly policies which facilitates, in particular, greater female participation in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The European Commission guidelines for 2002, the fifth year of this process, set out a number of horizontal objectives aimed at building conditions for full employment in a knowledge-based society. These detailed guidelines require member states to formulate policies involving a more employment friendly approach through a review, where necessary, of benefits, taxes and training systems; positive measures to maintain the skills and working capacity of older workers in particular, through sufficient access to education and training; and flexible working conditions such as part-time work and contract work.</P>
    <P>In relation to the taxation system, the Government has over successive budgets substantially reduced the burden of PAYE, thereby making the option of working more attractive all round.</P>
    <P>The scenario that I have just painted sets us all both a challenge and an opportunity. In this context, the timing of our discussions on this Bill before the House, namely the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Bill 2003 is therefore opportune.</P>
    <P>The proposed Bill seeks to implement the provisions of EU Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 concerning the Framework Agreement on Fixed-Term Work concluded by the general cross-industry organisations at European level: UNICE, the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe; CEEP, the European Centre of Enterprises with Public Participation; and ETUC, the European Trade Union Confederation.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the directive are to improve the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring the application of the principle of non-discrimination, that is, fixed-term workers must be treated not less favourably than comparable permanent workers, to remove discrimination against fixed-term workers where such exists and to establish a framework to prevent abuse arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts. The target date for implementation of this directive was 10 July 2001.</P>
    <P>A tripartite working group, including representatives from the social partners, IBEC and ICTU, who broadly support the intent of the directive, and from relevant Government Departments and State agencies was set up to discuss the measures necessary for the implementation of the directive in this country. The deliberations of this group have contributed to and influenced the composition of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the directive allows for its implementation in an individual member state by means of a collective agreement between the social partners. Both IBEC and ICTU, however, declined this option as regards the implementation of the directive in Ireland, hence this Bill. I thank both ICTU and IBEC for their work at both European and national levels in framing the <Col N="499" />Bill, which I believe will have a major social impact in Ireland over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The scope of the directive is expressed as applying to fixed-term workers who have an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by the law, collective agreement or practice in force in each member state. In this context, Irish labour law covers persons employed under contracts of service.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which is influenced by the terms of the directive, provides for measures guaranteeing that fixed-term workers may not be treated less favourably than full-time workers. It also requires the removal of discrimination against fixed-term workers where such exists, and contains measures aimed at improving the quality of fixed-term work.</P>
    <P>The fixed-term work directive, on which the Bill is based, provides that the quality of work be improved by the application of the principle of non-discrimination, which means that people on fixed-term contracts are not treated in a less favourable manner than comparable permanent workers.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill that I wish specifically to mention is the inclusion of pay and pension entitlements of fixed-term workers. This entitlement is covered under the definition of remuneration set out in the interpretation section of the Bill, section 2. The Government has decided to include pay and pensions in the Bill as a deliberate policy initiative, without prejudice to continuing to maintain the validity of the legal advice received to the effect that, because of the wording of Article 137.6 of the treaty, such inclusion cannot be regarded as obligatory under directive 99/70.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision on pay and pensions means that fixed-term workers should be treated in a similar manner to comparable permanent workers with immediate effect in so far as pay and pension entitlements are concerned. This is entirely consistent as the Government has already granted similar pay and pension entitlements to part-time workers under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.</P>
    <P>In addition, the granting of such entitlements to fixed-term workers will have the effect of increasing overall pension coverage levels. As the House is no doubt aware, all parties to the Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement share the objective that the level of coverage of occupational pensions schemes should be increased and are committed to co-operating to promote improvements in the coverage of schemes towards the national pensions policy initiative target of 70% of the workforce over 30 years. In that context, employers who exclude employees from their pension scheme, or who limit eligibility for a scheme, must, from 15 September 2003, provide access to at least one standard personal retirement savings account &ndash; PRSA.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the inclusion of <Col N="500" />pay and pension entitlements in the Bill in relation to the wider public service is estimated at &euro;50 million annually. However, the economic and social benefits that will accrue, particularly in relation to workplace relationships and the promotion and encouragement of the process of change in work relationships, which will benefit employers and employees alike, will be considerable.</P>
    <P>For example, fixed-term work can help people achieve a work-life/family-friendly balance and fit in caring responsibilities. For example, term-time-only contracts can benefit parents. It is important that those with caring responsibilities are able to make provision for retirement. In addition, women are significantly more likely than men to be in fixed-term employment between the ages of 25 and 44, a period which often includes their most important years for accruing pension benefit.</P>
    <P>Section 9 indicates that fixed-term workers must be advised by their employer in writing of the objective grounds justifying the renewal of the contract of employment on a fixed-term contract basis.</P>
    <P>Section 10 specifically addresses the use of successive fixed-term contracts by employers. The effect of this section is to provide that in future, following a period of continuous service of at least three years by a fixed-term employee, an employer may, in effect, renew a fixed-term contract once only. Thereafter, any further renewal of the fixed-term contract concerned shall be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration. The thinking behind this is that a period of three years service, followed by one renewal, which can be of any duration, provides a linkage to permanency in an employment for fixed-term workers.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that those who have accumulated three years service at a minimum with an employer will only have to complete one further contract before being deemed to be in a contract of indefinite duration. Employers are, of course, free to give such workers permanent employment through open-ended contracts of indefinite duration, based on the performance of that fixed-term worker, before the three-year period required expires.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 17 of the Bill provide that where fixed-term contract workers are concerned about their treatment by employers, they will have recourse to redress procedures, to the Rights Commissioner service of the Labour Relations Commissioner service in the first instance and then, on appeal, to the Labour Court, with a further appeal on a point of law to the High Court. These redress procedures are a standard provision in employment rights legislation.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions in Part 2 of the Bill mirror the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001, which arose from a similar framework agreement agreed at European social partner level in relation to that category of atypical workers. Other provisions in the Bill in relation to complaints to rights com<Col N="501" />missioners and enforcement procedures reflect what might be described as standard provisions in other employment rights legislation generally.</P>
    <P>I hope that against this background we should be able to progress this Bill through the House expeditiously. I invite Senators to provide constructive criticism of the proposals in the Bill as appropriate but I also urge a positive and proactive approach so that we can secure enactment of this important Bill by the summer recess.</P>
    <P>I have highlighted the key areas of the Bill and will now outline in detail the main provisions of the Bill. In Part 1, section 1 is a standard provision dealing with the Short Title of the Bill. Section 2 sets down the main definitions associated with the Bill. Section 3 empowers the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make regulations and orders prescribing any matter or thing which is referred to in the Bill as prescribed or to be prescribed or for the purpose of enabling any provision of the Bill to have full effect.</P>
    <P>Section 4 raises the fines of £5O and £10 provided for in section 10(1) of the Employment Agency Act 1971 to &euro;2,000 and &euro;1,000 respectively. It also amends section 28(8) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and section 17(8) of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 by removing the time limit of six weeks. which applies at present to referrals of rights commissioners' decisions to the Labour Court. It further provides for a technical amendment of section 39(2) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 relating to the powers of a rights commissioner, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or the Labour Court to amend decisions in certain cases.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a standard provision stating that the expenses incurred by the Minister in connection with the administration of the Bill shall be paid out of funds provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Part 2 deals with fixed-term work and the rights of fixed-term employees. Section 6 provides that an employee is a comparable permanent employee in relation to a fixed-term employee if (a) the permanent employee and the fixed-term employee are employed by the same or associated employer and one of the conditions referred to in (i),(ii) or (iii) is met; (b) where (a) does not apply (including a case where the fixed-term employee is the sole employee of the employer), then the permanent employee is specified in a collective agreement, being an agreement that for the time being has effect in relation to the relevant fixed-term employee, to be a comparable employee in relation to the fixed-term employee, or (c) where neither (a) nor (b) applies, the employee is employed in the same industry or sector of employment as the fixed-term employee and one of the conditions referred to in (i), (ii) or (iii) is met.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" />The following are the conditions (i), (ii) and (iii) referred to above: (i) both employees perform the same work under the same or similar conditions or each is interchangeable with the other in relation to the work; (ii) the work performed by one of the employees concerned is of the same or a similar nature to that performed by the other and any differences between the work performed or the conditions under which it is performed by each, either are of small importance in the context of the work as a whole or occur with such irregularity as not to be significant; and (iii) the work performed by the relevant fixed-term employee is equal or greater in value to the work performed by the other employee concerned, having regard to such matters as skill, physical or mental requirements, responsibility and working conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that, generally, a fixed-term employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of his or her conditions of employment. Section 7(2) provides that a fixed-term employee may, in respect of a particular condition of employment, be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee if that treatment is based on objective grounds. Section 7(3) provides that, except where a different length of service qualification is justified on objective grounds, such a qualification in relation to a particular condition of employment shall be the same for a fixed-term employee as for a comparable permanent employee.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that a ground for treating an employee less favourably shall not be regarded as an objective ground for that purpose unless it is based on considerations other than the fixed-term status of the employee. The less favourable treatment involved for the employee must be for the purpose of achieving a legitimate objective of the employer and such treatment must be appropriate and necessary for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 9(1) provides that a fixed-term employee shall be informed in writing by his or her employer as soon as practicable of the objective condition determining the contract, namely, (<i>a</i>) arriving at a specific date, (<i>b</i>) completing a specific task or (<i>c</i>) the occurrence of a specific event. Section 9(2) provides that where an employer proposes to renew a fixed-term contract, the employee shall be informed in writing, not later than the date of renewal, of the objective grounds justifying the renewal of the fixed-term contract and the failure to offer a contract of indefinite duration. Section 9(3) provides that the written statements referred to in section 9(1) and section 9(2) are admissible as evidence in any proceedings under the Bill. Section 9(4) provides that a rights commissioner may draw any inference he or she considers just and equitable if it appears to him or her that (<i>a</i>) an employer omitted to provide a written statement or (<i>b</i>) a written statement is evasive or equivocal.</P>
    <P>Section 10(1) provides that the contract of a fixed-term employee may be renewed on only <Col N="503" />one further occasion, without restriction as to duration, after the fixed-term employee has completed at least three years of continuous employment. Section 10(2) provides that where any term of a fixed-term contract purports to contravene subsection 10(1), that term shall have no effect and the contract concerned shall be deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration. Section 10(3) provides that, for the purposes of section 10(1), the service of an employee shall be deemed to be continuous unless the service is terminated by (<i>a</i>) the dismissal of him or her by the employer or (<i>b</i>) the employee voluntarily leaving his or her employment.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that in order for a fixed-term employee to have the same opportunity as other employees to secure a permanent position, an employer shall inform him or her in relation to relevant vacancies which occur. This information may be provided by means of a general announcement at a suitable place in the employee's place of employment. This section also provides that, as far as practicable, access by a fixed-term employee to appropriate training opportunities shall be facilitated by the employer.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that when calculating the threshold above which employees' representative bodies may be constituted in an undertaking in line with section 4 of the Transnational Information and Consultation Of Employees Act 1996, fixed-term employees shall be taken into account. Employers shall, as far as practicable, consider informing employees' representatives about fixed-term work in the undertaking.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that a provision in any employment agreement shall be void in so far as it is inconsistent with any provision of this Bill. Section 14 provides that an employer shall not penalise an employee for invoking his or her right to be treated in regard to his or her employment in the manner provided for in this Part of the Bill. Penalisation of an employee is also forbidden for having lawfully opposed an act which is unlawful under the Bill or giving evidence in any proceedings under the Bill. Penalisation for this purpose includes dismissal, unfavourable change in conditions of employment or any unfair treatment, including selection for redundancy.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill relates to enforcement. Section 15 provides that a complaint by an employee, or by a trade union of which the employee is a member, that the employer has contravened any provision of the Bill in relation to that employee, may be presented to a rights commissioner who shall issue a written decision in the matter and communicate that decision to the parties. The decision of the rights commissioner may require the employer to pay compensation, subject to a limit of two years of the employee's remuneration. A complaint to a rights commissioner must be made within six months of the date of contravention of the Bill or the date of termination of the contract of employment concerned, whichever is the earlier. This period <Col N="504" />may be extended by a further 12 months if the commissioner is satisfied that failure to refer the case within six months was due to reasonable cause. The hearing before the rights commissioner shall be conducted in private.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that a decision of a rights commissioner may be appealed to the Labour Court within six weeks of the date of the decision. The Labour Court shall issue a determination in writing affirming, varying or setting aside the decision of the rights commissioner. It may request the Minister to refer a question of law arising in proceedings before it under this section to the High Court for final and conclusive determination. Where a decision of the rights commissioner has not been carried out by the employer, and an appeal against the decision has not been brought within the time allowed for doing so, the employee may refer the complaint to the Labour Court which may, without hearing any evidence, make a determination to the like effect of the decision of the rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides that where an employer fails to implement a determination of the Labour Court within six weeks from the date it is communicated to the parties and the determination has not been appealed within the appropriate time limit, the Circuit Court shall, on application to it by the employee concerned, a trade union of which the employee is a member or the Minister, and without hearing any evidence, make an order directing the employer to implement the determination.</P>
    <P>Part 4 of the Bill relates to exclusions and other provisions. Section 18 provides that the Bill shall not apply to a member of the Defence Forces, a trainee garda or a trainee nurse.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that relief may not be granted to an employee, in respect of a penalisation in contravention of section 14(1) of the Bill which constitutes a dismissal of an employee within the meaning of the unfair dismissals legislation, both under Part 3 of this Bill and those Acts. It also provides that a person who is a fixed-term employee under the Bill and a part-time employee under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 may not obtain relief in respect of the same circumstances under both the Bill and the 2001 Act.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the right to reasonable conditions of employment should continue to be enshrined in employment rights legislation. It is our duty, as elected and accountable legislators, to play a proactive approach in ensuring any such future legislation reflects the needs and expectations of both employees and employers, is framed in such a way as to respond to the needs of society as a whole, and reflects the ongoing changes taking place at an enormous pace in the labour market. The Bill is, without doubt, a welcome addition to our employment rights legislation and will have a major impact on our employment landscape in the years ahead. Accordingly, I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to implement the provisions of the EU directive concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by the European social partners. It should be noted that the European Commission claimed that Ireland had failed to properly implement this directive which should have been implemented in 1999. I understand there is a legal case pending against the State. I am not definite about it, but when the Minister of State responds he may update us, in so far as he can, and as long as it is not <i>sub judice</i>.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Hogan, raised this matter in the Dáil last April and to date I do not know if there has been a proper explanation with regard to the delay. The response to a parliamentary question on the matter states &ndash; I am sure the Minister of State has covered it in his speech &ndash; that one of the main provisions of the proposed Bill is to provide that abuse arising from the use of excessive fixed-term employment contracts will be outlawed; and whereby the contracts of fixed-term employees will become permanent after a certain amount of time or after a certain number of contract renewals. The exact position is not evident to me from the response, as the question is not properly answered. Perhaps the Minister of State will allude to this in his reply to the House.</P>
      <P>While certain aspects of this Bill are welcome, we would like full and complete details from the Minister of State as to the financial implications of what is proposed. It is noted that the application of this Bill is estimated to cost the Exchequer some &euro;50 million <i>per annum</i>. The Minister stated that the benefits would be considerable. Can we have more details on this claim? Could the Minister of State also give us a detailed breakdown on the costing of this legislation? What does it provide for small and medium-sized enterprises in respect of its implementation?</P>
      <P>While this Bill provides some benefits to employees working on fixed-term contracts, it seems to impose a heavy burden of paperwork on employers. It is reasonable to insist on a written contract or statement from employers at the commencement of employment, but the additional provisions of section 9(2) seem unduly harsh, particularly the provision that an employer who does not give written reasons for the renewal of a fixed-term contract can be penalised by a rights commissioner. It could be envisaged that employers would have to employ lawyers to clear all this new documentation. This is a further cost to employers and one a small business can ill afford. We have had many references recently to all aspects of competitiveness. This is exercising other minds outside the Houses, as it is undoubtedly important for the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" />Equally I am concerned about section 10 which suggests that if an employee enters into the third year of employment on fixed-term contracts, he or she may have only one further renewal. While the intentions may be good, this may result in many employees losing their jobs in year four of their employment. This is not what the European social partners envisaged in the directive when they were drafting the anti-abuse provisions. I request the Minister of State to reconsider this section in light of the provisions of the directive and to ensure there is real employment protection.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive overview of the Bill, subject to the queries I have raised. We all accept that social partnership, involving everybody as it does, has been a driving force for change. This process will be backed up by the well-balanced range of employment rights and labour legislation which we hope will continue to work in an efficient and competitive business environment. There are question marks because of the downturn and how we handle all aspects of competitiveness. It is important that reasonable conditions of employment should exist and the respective entitlements of employers and employees are set out clearly. I welcome this aspect of the Bill. We all accept that the needs of workers and employers have changed over the years. We have a well educated workforce that allows people to be competitive. It is important with the global economic conditions of today that the State continues to be competitive or we will all go down the Swanee.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the combination of job satisfaction for fixed-term employees and increased productivity for employers. The labour market has changed considerably. I did not know until he mentioned it today that we have 294,000 part-time workers in the economy, representing 17% of the workforce. That is a large percentage which has important implications.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the use of successive fixed-term contracts by employers. I find it worrying that an employer may renew a fixed-term contract only once after three years. That could be for an indefinite duration. It strikes me as not being equitable. I know the market has changed, but most good employers should be able to decide after a probationary period of one year if an employee deserves a contract. We would want such a process to be fair and balanced all around.</P>
    <P>We are all good Europeans and these proposals have arisen from discussion at European level. It has been accepted in Ireland by the social partners. It has been delayed &ndash; whether unduly or not, I will not pass judgment. I know there is a case outstanding. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response on that and to the queries raised.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that when excellent legislation comes before the House, it is not given the recognition it deserves. Tonight, one will find little on RTE or TV3 news or radio about the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, in bringing this legislation to the Seanad. It is time RTE dedicated a ten minute slot after the &ldquo;9 o'clock News&rdquo; to highlight the legislation going through the Houses to ensure greater public knowledge. Then the people affected by legislation will realise it is being enacted, allowing them an input through their public representatives during the passage of a Bill. It is about time we had a dedicated Oireachtas broadcasting channel. I compliment the existing &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; for its fair and balanced assessment of both the Dáil and the Seanad proceedings.

      <P>The point I am making is that this is such progressive legislation it should be given the maximum publicity but, unfortunately, the media are more concerned about issues not relevant to the Bill. That is the way they work. BBC2 has a dedicated channel which broadcasts the proceedings of the House of Lords and the House of Commons almost on a permanent basis and it is interesting to see the working of the legislation. I make that point because the work the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, the Tánaiste and their senior civil servants, whom I welcome to the House, have put into the Bill should be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the progressive legislation that comes before the House is influenced by and is as a result of European Union directives. This Bill arises from the implementation of the provisions <Col N="508" />of Directive 1999/70/EC of the Council of Europe concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by the general cross-industry organisations at European level. This country has reaped the benefits of such progressive legislation since we joined the European Union. Ireland would not be as forward-looking or progressive if we had not joined the European Union. We are a great advertisement to the applicant countries which will join in May next year.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister of State's statement that against this background we should be able to progress the Bill through the House expeditiously. He also invited Senators to provide constructive criticism of the proposals in the Bill but urged a positive and proactive approach in order that we can secure enactment of this important legislation by the summer recess. That statement is welcome because, from my personal experience of bringing the Companies Bill through this House as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, I listened attentively to the excellent contributions of Senators who had a broad vision of the working of legislation. The Official Report will show that I accepted many progressive amendments from Members of this House. I recall Senators making excellent contributions to debates on legislation, which indicates the strength of this House and the need for its continuation.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that social partnership involving employers, employees and Government has been the driving force of change in the workplace in recent years. It is appropriate that I pay tribute to the president of the ICTU, Senator Joe O'Toole, who has played such an important role in national agreements. He is very progressive, as has the ICTU. The social partnership process has been backed up by a well balanced range of employment rights and labour legislation which, together, are designed to stimulate employment and provide an appropriate framework for the purpose of achieving an efficient and competitive business environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined the progressive legislation coming from the European Union which covers such a wide area, including minimum notice and terms of employment, protection against unfair dismissals, payment of wages, organisation of working time, safeguarding employees' rights on the transfer of undertakings, protection of young persons at work, safety, health and welfare, redundancy and insolvency entitlements, minimum wage entitlements and the protection of part-time workers. The Tánaiste and the Minister of State should be commended on the enactment of the Redundancy Payments Bill last Sunday, 25 May, the fastest enactment of any Bill. It is very progressive legislation, yet I do not recall much coverage of the Bill appropriate to the work involved.</P>
    <P>Changes in employment rights legislation have also influenced employment trends and the numbers in employment. According to the Central Statistics Office figures for the last quarter of <Col N="509" />2002, the number of persons in employment rose from 1.22 million in 1994 to 1.77 million in 2002 &ndash; an increase of 45%. Is there any better endorsement of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government? It is the most impressive performance of any Government in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>&mdash;is that one votes with the party on the day. That is the key point but in the meantime one can certainly have one's own views and try to influence Government decisions.</P>
      <P>I want to make a number of points to the Minister of State concerning changes to the Bill which he may take into account. I am pleased that the evidence before the rights commissioner will be heard in private. The Minister of State should review the Unfair Dismissals Acts which allow for public hearings about private matters concerning employer-employee relationships. It is not in the interests of the public to know the relationship between an employee and an employer. The Unfair Dismissals Acts should be reviewed in this regard because under this Bill, the hearing before the rights commissioner shall be conducted in private, rightly so because it is a private matter between the employee and the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why are members of the Defence Forces, trainee gardaí and trainee nurses excluded from the provisions of the Bill? I want that section removed because the people concerned are entitled to their rights under the Bill. Young Defence Forces members only get a 12 year contract and many will be let go in the next few years if they do not progress to corporal status, which is very difficult. They have a poor guarantee of employment in the Defence Forces, a matter I will bring to the attention of the Minister for Defence. I would like the Minister of State to <Col N="510" />explain the reason these trainees are being excluded from the provisions of the Bill to which they are entitled. He has invited us to make constructive points on the legislation. I ask Members on all sides of the House to support my call to him to remove section 18. Nobody should be excluded from the provisions of the Bill. We are all entitled to the protection of the law, regardless of whether we are a trainee nurse, garda or member of the Defence Forces. I want that section removed from the Bill, which is my main criticism of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Tá fáilte romhat.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it goes. All of the speakers so far have looked to locate the Bill in the context of overall social legislation, particularly in the European context. It is right that we should do so because this is one part of what is now a fairly substantial corpus of labour law, much of which has been influenced by European directives and agreed at Brussels level before being transformed into domestic law. It underpins what is, in effect, the European social model as it works in Ireland. It is our view, which we should express loudly and clearly, that while we look to encourage enterprise and relatively flexible labour markets, the rights of employees should be guaranteed by law as well as respected by way of collective agreements between the social partners.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State pointed out, the nature of employment has changed over the years and we now have a much greater number of part-time employees than in the past. In that context, he referred to a figure of 294,000. It is correct that we should extend rights under labour legislation to part-time employees, which we have done in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of fixed-term employees is more difficult and must be handled with care. I am glad that we have at least made some progress in this regard. The bottom line is simple, namely, that no one has difficulty with the use of fixed-term <Col N="511" />contracts of three or six months for a particular purpose, provided there are genuine reasons for employing the person in question for the specified period and purpose. However, we must get to grips with the practice of employers retaining staff on a casual or temporary basis, specifically to avoid affording them the rights to which they are entitled under law. I understand this forms part of the underlying purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of this practice, not all of which occur in the private sector. In the public sector, for example, there are a significant number of cases of staff being employed for a year or slightly less, for no reason other than the employer's desire to avoid giving them benefits &ndash; whether the right to participate in a pension scheme, rights under unfair dismissals legislation or a range of other rights, including the right to take holidays &ndash; they would have to give to full-time employees. Our job is to ensure that legal mechanisms of evasion are not used and workers are not deprived of their rights buy virtue of the repeated roll-over of fixed-term contracts, which is currently happening in large measure.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the figure of 70,000, even if it is an estimate, for fixed-term contract workers of 70,000 to which the Minister of State referred. I thought it was higher and my colleagues in the trade union movement also regard it as too low. I suspect that the use of fixed-term contracts is much more widespread. I am aware, for example, that some local authorities employ staff on a roll-over basis to avoid their legal duties. Sometimes this is not entirely by choice and can be attributed indirectly to the method by which budgets are allocated to local authorities, which means they do not know from one year to the next whether they will be in a position to retain certain workers or groups of workers. They choose, therefore, to employ staff for six-month or one-year periods and renew their contracts as required.</P>
    <P>The effect of this policy, whether deliberate, which it is in many cases, is to remove many of the rights to which workers are entitled. This is unacceptable. It would be useful if the Minister of State clearly signalled, as he failed to do in his carefully worded contribution, that this type of practice, particularly in the State sector over which we have direct control, is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Coghlan, I understand the purpose of section 10 which provides that an employer may renew a fixed-term only once after three years of continuous service. As he correctly pointed out, however, this provision carries an inherent danger. The implication for a person who has had, for example, three successive contracts of one year's duration is that he or she may only get one further contract of probably one year's duration, but possibly longer. Obviously, the intention of the Bill is that such persons should be made permanent, given an explicit contract to that effect and accorded the rights of a full-time employee. However, there is a danger, which is not beyond the bounds of imagination, <Col N="512" />that some employers will exploit and abuse the status of such people by terminating their employment prematurely.</P>
    <P>This means that those working on a fixed-term contract, following three years of renewal, face a hazard similar to that which arises under landlord and tenant law. I refer here to the common practice by which tenants are offered contracts of four years and nine months rather than receiving leases of five years, after which tenants become eligible for permanent lease. There is a danger that a similar practice will become commonplace in the context of part-time employment unless specific measures are taken. I ask the Minister of State to clarify if the Bill contains such measures, as I have not seen them.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan also raised the costs of the provisions to industry and employers. There will be a cost, which is the reason regulations such as these are applied on a European-wide basis. They ensure that one country cannot obtain a competitive advantage over another by virtue of imposing what is undoubtedly an additional labour cost. Many of the applicant countries of eastern Europe have much more flexible &ndash; so-called &ndash; labour markets than Ireland and do not guarantee the rights of workers to the same extent as current EU member states. Eventually, however, they will have to accept the <i>acquis</i> and conform to EU legislation as required.</P>
    <P>It is important that we point this out because we are often asked what benefits membership of the European Union brings ordinary workers? The principal benefit is that they are afforded rights that Ireland would not otherwise be able to afford. If Ireland was seeking to act on its own, we would not be able to impose unilateral additional costs on employers because it would involve a significant competitive disadvantage on their part. We are only able to establish such rights on a European-wide basis. It is important that we inform ordinary workers that benefits to individual employees are the flipside of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to objective reasons that an employee should be offered a fixed-term, as opposed to a full-time, contract. What are objective criteria? As matters stand, the drafting of this provision is not a bad effort. However, the exact meaning of the term &ldquo;objective criteria&rdquo; needs to be expanded further. One man's objective criterion is not necessarily another's in terms of justification for a short-term contract. For example, it is clear that the use of a fixed-term contract in the case of a person specifically employed in the information technology sector several years ago, for the purpose of sorting out problems anticipated in the context of the changeover to the new millennium, could be objectively justified. However, there are many examples of cases in which this is not clear. I question whether the &ldquo;objective criteria&rdquo; requirement and imposition of an obligation to provide a written explanation where persons are not given full-time contracts <Col N="513" />offers a sufficiently strong guarantee to ensure that there will not be significant abuse.</P>
    <P>I wish to address briefly the issue of employment agencies. Many of the people employed on fixed-term contracts are non-nationals who are employed here on work visas for short or fixed periods. These people are employed either through the intervention of or directly through employment agencies. As far as I can gather, employment agencies are excluded from the remit of the Bill. I am not sure whether it is the intention of the Minister of State to introduce specific legislation to deal with employment agencies and non-nationals who work to them. It is clear, however, that there is a need to ensure that the rights we accord to Irish citizens are not only accorded to non-nationals working here, but also enforced. There are far too many examples of people from outside the European Union being routinely exploited by employers and employment agencies operating here. The scope of the legislation should be extended to include this group if possible.</P>
    <P>While I broadly welcome the Bill, it should incorporate a number of other elements. Some aspects of it also require further clarification.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern. He is having a busy time in the House. It is always a great pleasure to have him here and I look forward to his responses to the contributions of Senators at the conclusion of the debate.</P>
      <P>I admit that I was somewhat reluctant to get involved in this debate because I first need to declare an interest. As many Senators will be aware, I wear another hat as a broadcaster and have spent most of my career with RTE, the State broadcasting body. It is the nature of the type of work in which I and many colleagues who work on air engage that we are not employed as permanent members of staff but on fixed-term contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is employed on a variable contract in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very variable. It might do no harm for me to nail a myth. Despite the high profile of presenters one hears on air during the day and the sums of money, real or imagined, they are alleged to receive, I assure the House that I and the vast majority of people who work on air in RTE are paid basic union rates which, as professional fees, are taxable. Whenever I say this within these precincts I get a wry look from my colleagues who point to some of the more illustrious and celebrated on air personalities, as if to say they do not believe me. I assure them it is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this legislation, I was employed by RTE in the mid to late 1970s and continued operating on a fixed-term contract on what is known as a rolling term of employment. <Col N="514" />My contract never exceeded six months over a period of years but was generally of the order of one to three months. At the end of its term the contract was rolled over and I continued to broadcast. However, in the context of the motives behind this legislation there is a cohort of workers in the country for whom this type of employment or this nature of work is not a guarantee. It is at best adventurous and at worst high risk.</P>
    <P>Until the early 1990s the only opportunity I had to pursue my broadcasting career was through the national broadcaster, as deregulation had not taken place. Subsequent to deregulation of radio many other broadcasting opportunities have arisen, but at a much lower rate of pay. Deregulation has created new job opportunities but it has also increased the number of workers employed under the concept of fixed-term contracts in the media.</P>
    <P>By the late 1990s, due to regime and management changes in the station, I and a number of others found ourselves no longer operating with a guaranteed fixed contract. In other words the roll-over nature of the contract was all but terminated. Since then I have been employed on a short-term basis presenting and researching a number of programmes in the music field. I also operate on a freelance basis with the sports department, which is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>Why I am going into such detail is because of the different categories that exist. Throughout my time with RTE there was no legislation to assist people whose contract might be terminated, irrespective of the number of years they might have worked. I would have been 15 to 16 years on fixed-term rolling contracts. However, people were literally told &ldquo;Thanks very much, your contract is ended. You have no pension, social welfare rights or holidays.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This legislation, therefore, is extremely welcome. I applaud the Government for introducing it. It addresses a major gap in our labour laws as reflected by the concerns of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country. It comes at a time when increasingly employers do not employ people on a full-time permanent basis. As a result of costs people are employed on a contract or fixed-term contract basis.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the initiatives from Europe regarding the provision of equal opportunities for women in the workforce. For those women in the home who wish to balance family life with a working career, this legislation offers encouragement. Many of them who for economic necessity had to take the risk of accepting contract employment will now be protected.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Government's initiative, we are now in the mainstream of European social thinking in regard to labour laws and legislation to protect workers. It has been a long haul. Those people who criticise Europe and who are against the concept of the European Union should remember that most of our social legislation has come via European Union initiatives. This legislation is a further example. It proves that the <Col N="515" />Government is prepared to look at directives of this nature and to incorporate them into Irish law. All our administrations, since we joined the Union, have been prepared to do this. The Government knows the legislation will not only protect the workers to whom it refers but will also increase and improve competitiveness. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I serve the economy and was part of the culture of the 1950s as a teenager, but I differ fundamentally from Senator McDowell regarding the concept of a permanent pensionable job. A permanent pensionable job rather than a fixed-term job could be a sentence that limits a person's ability to explore his or her potential.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives status to non-pensionable employment and allows for cultural change. In the 1950s the big thing was to obtain a permanent and pensionable job. The law of supply and demand and economic trends have brought change. I believe that a permanent pensionable job can prevent a person from delivering his or her potential.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows what I mean. Some people are getting on well in their permanent and pensionable jobs, but many are not. Fixed-term contracts could be better in many ways for a company and the country. There is nothing wrong with them. A company is only in business as long as it has sales. We cannot look at it as exploitation of workers. There is little of that. Companies do not succeed unless the workers are working with them. Where management and workers work together the company succeeds. Those in management are also workers. All of them want to keep their jobs but fixed-term contracts might be better for the health of the company and the country.</P>
      <P>I was shocked when I learned that over the last five years 50,000 people were added to the public sector pay bill. Is the Minister of State aware of that? I find it extraordinary that so many were employed by the public sector over that time. These are people who are permanent and pensionable for the rest of their lives when they might be better off with the opportunities offered by a contract.</P>
      <P>It is good that Europe is forcing us into situations where we have to make change. I am an impatient person and would much prefer if we could drive these changes. Where would we be if we did not have all this legislation from Europe? I find it frustrating that social change takes place so slowly in comparison with change in business or technology. Technology is changing daily at a fast rate and to be competitive, efficient and encourage growth a business must change and keep pace with it.</P>

This sort of change is not being driven here culturally. That we have so few women in our Parliament is an unnatural undemocratic situation. I am sure the men agree with me on this. Why do we not change it ourselves? We should tell the Government we need a percentage of women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Coghlan, McDowell, Leyden, Mooney and White for their contributions and for their general welcome for this important legislation which deals with those in fixed-term employment contracts. Some questions were raised by the Senators and I will attempt to cover most of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coghlan mentioned the delay in the publication of the Bill and the European Commission. As regards the delay, the date of transposition of the directive was set at 10 July 2001. The European Commission referred Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failure to implement the directive in time. In that context, we have sent to the court a copy of the Bill as published as an indication of the Government's intention to fully implement the directive. The main reason for the delay was the preoccupation of the relevant section in the Department with <Col N="517" />the carer's leave and part-time work Bills which had been given priority. However, when these measures were enacted towards the end of 2001, priority was then given to the implementation of the fixed-term work directive.</P>
    <P>A number of meetings were held of the tripartite group which was set up to consider the best means of transposing the directive in Irish circumstances. The work of that group is reflected in the Bill before us. The provisions of the Bill will come into effect immediately upon its enactment. It is not the intention that this legislation will have retrospective effect. The cost of &euro;50 million is considerable and is mainly in the public sector. The cost in the education field will be approximately &euro;42 million and it will be &euro;8 million in the health sector, which will cover the teaching and nursing professions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coghlan also raised a question about the SMEs and their effect on&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator must wait for four years. He is a little early yet. As regards the SMEs, the Bill provides greater clarity for companies which may want to recruit workers for a certain period on a fixed-term basis to see if they are satisfactory from the point of view of making the worker permanent. The employer knows the framework within which he or she must work to make that person permanent. As I said in my speech, there is nothing to stop the employer from making that person permanent before the three years come to an end. I encourage both employers and employees to work within the framework set out in the Bill which attempts to give flexibility to employers and security to employees.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden was critical of the exclusion of trainee gardaí and nurses from the Bill. This was done in pursuance of Article 2(2) of the framework agreement which permits the non-application of its provisions to initial vocational training relationships and apprenticeship schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be treated as apprentices for their initial contract. The amount of excess paperwork for employers under section 9(2) was also mentioned. The provision of this written statement helps both employees and employers in terms of the certainty of the employment relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the issue of the third year renewal. Senator Coghlan correctly pointed out that a good employer would know a good employee in practice and that he or she would <Col N="518" />appoint that person on a permanent basis. The directive gave member states a number of options. We took the three year route with one further renewal to give flexibility to both sides. I hope employers will take a fair and pragmatic approach and do the decent thing by employees and not exploit them.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell mentioned contracts. Contracts are generally of 12 months' duration. After that, employers must give a contract of indefinite period. The Senator also said that such practice is not acceptable in State companies. We acknowledge that. The State has had to review its procedures in this regard. It is estimated that it will cost approximately &euro;50 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell also mentioned employment agencies. They are not excluded from the Bill. Fines will be increased to act as a deterrent in terms of the obligations under the Employment Agency Act 1971. If there are any cases of non-national workers being abused by agencies, we would be grateful if they were brought to the attention of the labour inspectorate where they can be investigated. These workers have the same rights as Irish workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the definition in the Bill which defines a contract of employment and excludes contracts of employment agencies and of people who work for employment agencies or who are employed by such agencies for someone else.

      <P>I thank Senators Coghlan, McDowell, Leyden, Mooney and White for their contributions on this important Bill which will benefit the pay and other conditions of employment of 70,000 workers who are currently employed on fixed-term work contracts. I hope the Bill will go a long way towards realising the main aims of the directive, namely, to improve the quality of fixed-term work, to do away with the discriminatory treatment of workers on fixed-term contracts and to improve and to limit the use by employers of successive fixed-term contracts. The proposals in the Bill were given a good examination by those Senators who spoke. I look forward to Committee Stage in a few weeks' time.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) The Institute of Directors;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what was said yesterday. The supervisory authority is heavily weighted in favour of the public service and lightly weighted in favour of the creators of wealth. The Government has shown a desire to listen to consumers in the past. Therefore, the omission of companies which use auditors and executive directors highlights a gap in Government policy. The Government considers consumers in other areas but in this sphere it does not recognise consumers or users.</P>
      <P>The review group comprised 18 members, including two Civil Service trade union representations, six public servants, three academics and four representatives of auditors. There was only one representative of business, the creator of enterprise. The recommendations made by the group reflected that imbalance. There is a lack of understanding among governments in general about the needs of business. IBEC provided the only business representative on the interim board of the supervisory authority. My amendments are intended to achieve a better balance on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the acceptance of the Government's amendment on Committee Stage, nine bodies have been designated for the purposes of section 6(2). Each of the designated bodies, while being a member of the supervising authority, is entitled to nominate one person to be a director of the authority. The present composition reflects recommendation 9.5 of the review group on auditing. The Minister is entitled to prescribe, by <Col N="520" />regulation, additional designated bodies. He or she is also entitled, by regulation, to remove a designated body. There is flexibility, therefore, to take account of interests which, in the light of experience, should be represented on the authority.</P>
      <P>The aspect of the authority's role that is most relevant to the bodies mentioned is the review of compliance of accounts under the Companies Acts. As a result of the amendments made to section 27 on Committee Stage, the authority will be able to invoke the expertise of bodies such as the Institute of Directors or ISME to assist with this task. I will take note of the Senator's views but I am not willing to accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for noting the points I made. There is recognition of the ability and right to co-opt an individual to the board or to dismiss him or her. The reason I tabled these amendments is that I am concerned about the Government's attitude to business, particularly in regard to a regulatory impact assessment, which is lacking in this legislation. <i>The Irish Times</i> carries a headline today regarding the OECD's comments about Ireland. It is only two years since the OECD spoke strongly about Ireland and recommended that a regulatory impact assessment should be conducted. The Government stated it should be carried out and published a White Paper, which provided that all legislation likely to have an impact on competitiveness and making Ireland attractive to business should contain such an assessment. However, it has not been provided for in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole explained on Committee Stage that enough opportunities were provided for people to have an input but conducting a regulatory impact assessment is easy. A civil servant can be asked to ascertain the impact of regulations on various aspects of business. I do not know the reason it has taken a year to act on the White Paper. Other countries lost competitiveness because business was over-regulated and their economies went out of control, which resulted in the IMF or other institutions intervening to tell them how to run them. A number of years ago the European Union told us how we should behave ourselves. I am seeking to achieve a balance on the authority and will not press the amendments. While I appreciate that the Minister of State has noted my comments, I urge him and the Government to include users in future, which in this case include non-executive directors as well as auditors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has referred to regulatory impact analysis on a number of occasions. A number of initiatives have been taken as a result of the OECD report on regulation. These involved, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a high level group to co-ordinate the implementation of the regulatory reform agenda. The group will develop regulatory impact analysis guidelines. This work has not been completed <Col N="521" />and will require Government approval. The recommendations of the review group on auditing and the heads of the Bill were checked by the Department against a Cabinet handbook and quality regulation checklists and found to be compliant.</P>
      <P>In addition the IASA Bill is implementing the recommendation of the review group. This group was broadly based and its report was published in 2000. Interested parties were free to comment on its recommendations. Heads of the Bill were published in 2002. It is interesting to note that representations were received from the Law Society this morning &ndash; it took some time to get its views. Together with the excellent comments and views expressed here yesterday and again today it will give much food for thought in considering the provisions currently in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to section 23 of the Bill dealing with intervention in the disciplinary process of prescribed accountancy bodies. I tabled this amendment to ensure due process. The supervisory authority is in a sense all-powerful. It can intervene in the disciplinary procedures of any of the accountancy bodies and can even annul them. It is a <i>major domo</i> with all these powers. It would therefore have the ability to ignore due process, which could be in contravention of the rights of an individual member. Rather than having the power to annul, it should be allowed to investigate and if it concludes that a body's procedures are incorrect or have not been entirely followed, its decision should be open to appeal to the High Court. I am sure the Minister is aware that this is in line with the recommendation of the review group chaired by our colleague, Senator O'Toole.</P>

If convinced of them, I will table an appropriate amendment to address the issue in the Dáil.

      <P>As I spoke about this yesterday, I need not repeat myself. It basically says that the supervisory authority may give notice to the directors where &ldquo;it appears to the Supervisory Authority that there is, or may be, a question whether the annual accounts comply with the Companies Acts.&rdquo; Yesterday I used the term &ldquo;belt and braces&rdquo; which is what it seems to be. While I have not seen this before, I would have thought it should have said: &ldquo;if it appears to the Supervisory Authority that there is a question&rdquo;, which gives considerable freedom. It seems to be over the top to say &ldquo;it appears to the Supervisory Authority that there is, or may be&rdquo;. Why not insert &ldquo;or perhaps&rdquo; on top of that along with other words that would be open to the accusation of tautology? It is extreme and almost suggests wanting to make sure it will be able to do anything it wants to do. Although it is unlikely to happen, if a vindictive individual were to delay something just to embarrass somebody, this gives the freedom to do so. I urge the Minister to reconsider.</P>

    <P>(<i>b</i>) state in their report under section 158 of the Principal Act that they have failed to do so and explain the reasons for the failure.</P>
    <P>These words are very moderate and there is no problem there and no question of failure. However section 40(11) states:</P>
    <P>Where a company or a relevant undertaking that is required under this section to establish an audit committee &ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) fails to do so,</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;fails&rdquo; suddenly turns up again.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister of State has taken a step I do not understand, but does this apply to a private company? On two occasions yesterday, the Minister of State said it was an option for a private company not to do so. My concern on the last occasion on which we saw the Bill was that a later section referred to a failure to do so and another section referred to an offence. It was stated that failure would represent an offence. Yesterday, however, the Minister of State twice said that a private company had the option not to do so and that the word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; has been removed. The word &ldquo;fail&rdquo; is still present and I am concerned about that.</P>
    <P>I seek reassurance that taking that option is not an offence. I am not sure that this is clear or that the provision is watertight in terms of the eventuality of a statutory body wishing to take steps in this area at some point. The Minister of State has changed things since Second Stage to attempt to relieve my concerns. However, his efforts will not have been sufficient unless I can get this provision questioned. I am seeking clarification in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 makes the same point. I want the Minister of State to put my mind at rest because my main concern on Second Stage was that as far as I could see, a private company had to appoint an audit committee. There was an out in so far as the Bill stated it did not have to do so. It was not mandatory as long as the company explained why it did not do so. However, the Bill later referred to failure to do so and, further on, stated that failure to do so would be an offence. I recognise that steps taken by the Minister of State since then have removed those links, so I do not see them in the same way. However, I seek his reassurance that my rereading of the position is correct. In addition, since I have a difficulty with this provision, some future statutory authority or court might also have a difficulty with it. I, therefore, suggest that clarity be provided.</P>

      <P>My understanding of subsection (11) is that &ldquo;failure to do so&rdquo; refers to someone who has been excused under the terms of the earlier provision. As Senator Quinn points out, one could take the interpretation he has given. I know that is not intended and reassurance should be given immediately. A phrase such as &ldquo;a company or relevant undertaking described under this section, unless excused under the other subsection&rdquo; or words to that effect should be included. The word &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is required and Senator Quinn would accept that. Failure, in this context, is where a company is required to do something under a particular section and does not do so. My understanding is that this was intended to apply to those companies that had not sought the opt-out under the earlier Companies Act, which is referred to in previous sections. Reassurances should be given and if it is likely to cause confusion, then some change of words should be in order.</P>

If I was in the Minister of State's position, I would consider those points and adjust the Bill accordingly. The Senator is being very reasonable in pointing out that failure to act under this section may lead to someone being taken to court and found guilty of an offence. That is very extreme and is detrimental to the quality of the Bill.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated yesterday, recommendation 13.1 of the review group on auditing suggests that boards of directors of public limited companies, financial institutions and public interest companies should be required by legislation to establish audit committees, the membership of which should be made up of non-executive directors. The Bill imposes a mandatory obligation on public limited companies to establish audit committees. The requirement only applies to private companies above a balance sheet threshold of &euro;25 million and a turnover exceeding &euro;50 million and it is not mandatory. The board of such a company <Col N="526" />can decide not to establish an audit committee and only needs to explain why it has so decided.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 would remove the sanction on public limited companies which fail to establish an audit committee in compliance with the provisions of the section. I am not prepared to remove this requirement, but we will clarify section 40(11) to make clear that it only applies to companies which come under the mandatory regime.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator White.</P>
      <P>There is a difference involved here and the first situation deals with five years rather than one. There are very valuable people who may have served a company and who may have left and become non-executive directors. They may be exactly the kind of person one wants on an audit committee because they are no longer working for the company and are outside it. Five years is a long period and I am not locked into having one year rather than five. If an executive in the company is on the board and then leaves, ceasing to be an executive, but he or she then becomes a non-executive director, he or she would be so closely aligned to the company it would be difficult to regard them as unbiased or not linked to it. That was why I felt five years was too long and suggested one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a different case to make in the other instance. It is now regarded as common practice &ndash; and admirable &ndash; to have a non-executive chairman. He or she acts on behalf of the shareholders and keeps an eye on the executives, particularly the chief executive, of the company. These people are being increasingly brought in to chair companies &ndash; particularly larger concerns &ndash; and it is they who should be appointed to audit <Col N="527" />committees. If such a chairperson is an executive, he or she should not be on the audit committee because he or she is part of the circle. However, a non-executive chairman who is brought in purposely to act as a balance against conflicting interests and provide an outside view is precisely the kind of person who should be on the audit committee. They do not have to be on the audit committee &ndash; the board may well decide not to have them on it &ndash; but that is the kind of person one wants. My amendment suggests that an executive chairman should not be on the audit committee but a non-executive chairman should be permitted to be on it and is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>I can see from where Senator Quinn is coming. The audit committee must have credibility and it must be independent. If these lines were deleted, one could, technically, invite a retired employee of a company to sit on such a committee. I do not think it would be an independent group. The audit committee needs to be totally independent of the organisation because that is the only way it will work. I do not agree with the amendment and I ask the Minister of State to oppose it. This is an excellent provision and one which will, as far as possible, not be abused. In addition, five years is a short period within which an individual could join such a committee after leaving employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been my view that it does not need to be five years. If somebody moves directly from being a senior executive to being a board member, one could not describe him or her as independent. That probably happens quite regularly. A person might move from being a senior executive or perhaps retire from the executive function and become an non-executive director. I accept that such a person could not be seen as independent one year later. Perhaps a reduction of the five year timeframe could be considered so that there could be a type of limbo period. This could be considered because I do not think it would significantly change anything and five years is a long time. I am not being ageist, but if somebody retired from an executive function at 60 years of age and if we were to add five years on to that, he or she would be beginning to call time on things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the five year period, there seems to have been some confusion among those who drew up the legislation. Perhaps they were thinking of semi-State bodies. If someone was employed by a semi-State body and they became a director, they could have information which could give them power. In a private company, it could be imperative that an ex-employee become a director as soon as possible if the occasion arose. The five year requirement is extreme. There is no reason that a director should not also be chairperson of the audit committee. As stated this morning, companies in the private sector only survive as long as they have sales and can sustain jobs for management and staff. Everything should be done to enable companies to have those with the best expertise as directors. There is confusion in regard to the companies from which people come.</P>

      <P>The independence of the audit committee is the fundamental principle we are trying to achieve through this provision. However, I have asked my officials to reconsider the exclusion term of five years. Perhaps it is a bit excessive.</P>
      <P>The new section 205B, inserted into the 1990 Act by section 40 of the Bill, states that:</P>
      <P>The requirement that all members of the audit committee qualify under subsection (6) does not apply if all of the following conditions are met:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the number of qualified directors on the board of directors of the company or relevant undertaking concerned is otherwise insufficient to enable that company or undertaking to fulfil its duty to establish an audit committee;</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) any conditions prescribed under <i>section 46(1)(m)</i> of the <i>Act of 2003</i>;</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) the directors of the company or undertaking concerned state in their report under section 158 of the Principal Act the reasons for not complying with the requirement.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) Irish Companies Acts, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) Irish tax law;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with section 43 and the infamous compliance statement, which is really paving new ground. Without repeating all the arguments made yesterday, this amendment aims to simplify the obligations being laid down. Compliance statements should be confined to large companies and corporations. We have no business imposing this measure on small, family-owned businesses. I will not be laborious because, given that we discussed them at great length yesterday, the Minister of State is as aware of the arguments as are Members. He will address this matter either today or in the Lower House, but the limit should be set at a much higher level than the audit exemption threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I have a real difficulty with the compliance statement for a number of reasons. I would like to give the Minister of State what I regard as practical advice. If we want to make it more possible for people to stay within the law, I would like to find a way to overcome this issue. Yesterday, Senator O'Toole spoke about the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, in the United States and about the controls it had put in place. As far as I can determine, these were financial controls which did not pertain to matters such as employment, health, the environment and safety. My difficulty is that we are breaking new ground without having considered the matter fully. I know of no other country doing something similar. Senator O'Toole may be able to confirm this.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that non-executive directors should sign a statement of compliance, which sounded very reasonable when Senator O'Toole spoke about it yesterday. He spoke about the new section 205E(2), which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to subsection (6), the directors of a company shall, as soon as possible after the commencement of this section, prepare or <Col N="530" />cause to be prepared a directors' compliance statement containing the following information concerning the company:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) its policies respecting compliance with its relevant obligations;</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) its internal financial and other procedures for securing compliance with the relevant obligations;</P>
    <P>(c) its arrangements for implementing and reviewing the effectiveness of the policies and procedures referred to in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</P>
    <P>Nobody could object to paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), which are very reasonable, and everybody should accept that the policies referred to should exist but the sting in the tail comes in subsection (4)(<i>a</i>) which states that the directors shall include in the report a statement acknowledging that they &ldquo;are responsible for securing the company's compliance with its relevant obligations&rdquo;. I am concerned about this. It will scare any non-executive director who has been invited to join a company. The small print suggests that he or she has to make sure that the company's policies respect compliance, that internal financial and other procedures for securing compliance with its relevant obligations exist with the arrangements for implementing such policies. This is acceptable and what everybody would say he or she should do but the acknowledgement that he or she is individually responsible puts him or her under an obligation that he or she would find very difficult to accept. The high cost of putting his or her mind at rest must be considered. How would a non-executive director in this position handle the matter? He or she would state that the legislation refers to many areas and that it involves an unrealistic new workload and extra responsibilities for a company's directors.</P>
    <P>Traditionally and in law, directors are responsible for the accuracy of financial accounts and company tax provisions. The Bill proposes to enlarge this statutory responsibility to every form of law affecting a company materially in respect of its financial statements. In Ireland, this includes laws in respect of employment, health and safety, environment, competition, pensions, consumer protection, insurance and intellectual property. Nobody could say he or she would take the chief executive's word that his or her company was complying with these regulations. I would not do so if I was a non-executive director. Before signing off, I would request help from somebody who knows something about employment law. As Senators know, much expertise is required in these areas. I would also wish experts on health and safety, the environment, competition and pensions to issue the company with a clean bill of health. This is my problem with the issue of compliance.</P>
    <P>One will not get good directors if this legislation is passed. Some will opt for positions because of the prestige but these are not the sort <Col N="531" />of board members one desires. One desires a board member whose heart is in the right place, who is responsible and willing to say he or she will look after the interests of the company and make it a success and who will ensure there are internal controls in place to ensure the company will not overstep the mark and do something wrong. When a director reads the small print, he or she will see that he or she is responsible for securing the company's compliance.</P>
    <P>I know different terms are used in later sections of the Bill. The new section 205E(5)(<i>a</i>)(i) states the directors shall specify if they are of the opinion, based on the procedures referred to under subsection (4) of the same section, that they used all reasonable endeavours to secure the company's compliance with its relevant obligations in the financial year to which the annual report or notes relate. This sounds reasonable and nobody could object to it but the sting in the tail comes in the new section 205E(5)(<i>a</i>)(ii) which states the directors shall specify if they are of the opinion that &ldquo;the company has complied with its relevant obligations in that financial year&rdquo;. How could anybody sign this? If a non-executive director, not working in a particular company, asked the chief executive for a guarantee before signing a statement of compliance, and the chief executive said he or she could offer such a guarantee, the non-executive director would say that this was not good enough. This is because the chief executive is not an expert in the areas of health, the environment, competition or pensions. The non-executive director would not be willing to take the chief executive's word unless consultants and experts had been employed to give the company a clean bill of health in all the relevant areas.</P>
    <P>I run a company and know the number of things that can go wrong. I am an executive and know that it would be a case of non-compliance if somebody in one of my supermarkets put the wrong kind of plastic bag into a recycling container. Yesterday Senator O'Toole referred to the failure to install a fire door. That is a case of non-compliance in the field of safety. I could list examples pertaining to all the relevant areas of law. There are very strict laws regarding people under 18 years working more than a certain number of hours each day. I would love to be able to say this never happens but the most one can do as an executive is put controls in place to prevent it. It is unreasonable to ask a non-executive director who joins a company in order to advise, steer and ensure it complies with the law to prepare a statement such as that proposed in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have significant difficulties with the two aforementioned proposals which contradict each other. I would like the Minister of State to put my mind at rest. Directors are put under an obligation such that non-executive directors would insist on protecting themselves by hiring an expert consultant in each of the relevant areas of law. Non-executive directors would say they could not accept the chief executive's word. They <Col N="532" />would ask their wives to excuse them because they had signed, on the basis of the chief executive's word, a statement that could lead to their being jailed or having to lose their houses. Before losing their houses, their wives would suggest they hire experts on each of the areas of law.</P>
    <P>I do not know how we will solve this problem. We have gone over the top and established a standard which, to the best of my knowledge, nobody has attempted to establish anywhere else. Auditors and non-executive directors usually take responsibility in financial areas but it is unreasonable to place such an onus on directors, not just in terms of their having policies but also in terms of their having to comply with them.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the reason the non-executive directors of the AIB &ndash; Lochlann Quinn and others &ndash; did not resign when they lost $670 million. How many schools could we build and how many hospitals could we fund adequately if we had that sum of money? Unashamedly, they did not resign or comply with the regulations.

      <P>I might compile a list of directors who appear on the boards of all the big companies. I may even ask the public to send me names. Directors flew to New York for meetings of the governors of the Bank of Ireland and went to locations such as Monaco for celebrations. However, they did not take their responsibilities seriously and this Bill will make sure they do so. Let them be well aware of that.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes is a most distinguished non-executive member of the board of Independent News and Media. I would exclude a man of his calibre from my list. I do not say all directors are not compliant. There are some wonderful, qualified, unselfish non-executive directors of companies who take their jobs very seriously indeed. I apologise to Senator Maurice Hayes, the man who brought the Sam Maguire Cup back to County Down and who knew my relative, Mr. Alf Murray, a former president of the GAA, if he took any offence at what I said yesterday about non-executive directors. People of the calibre of Senator Hayes, who is doing an excellent job, are excluded from what I was speaking about yesterday.</P>
      <P>I am a customer of AIB and I was nominated to the Seanad by the Irish Bankers' Federation. Employees of that bank have been laid off. Customers and staff of the bank are paying for the inactivity of the non-executive directors of AIB. If some of them have to go to jail for not complying with the law, so be it. As far as I can see, it is all gain and no pain for non-executive directors. Companies go into liquidation and employees lose their jobs because of the ineffectiveness of their boards of directors, yet they never apologise. I have never heard a non-executive director apologise for his or her inactivity which allowed a company to go to the wall.</P>
      <P>I am glad this measure is included in the Bill. Non-executive directors seem to be queuing up for appointments. Some of them are on ten boards, they go from boardroom to boardroom, sign in, get their expenses and are not really worried whether or not a company is complying with rules or regulations. One hears at the tribunal hearings of directors who had little concern about the activities of their companies. The measure may be strong and may put a serious onus on non-executive directors. However, I believe it will cause them to think twice before becoming non-executive directors and they will take their jobs very seriously indeed. I want to see this section left in the Bill.</P>

      <P>While I hold no brief for the directors of the AIB, I wish to distance myself from the comments made by Senator Leyden about them. The case of the AIB is an interesting example. Senator Leyden is incorrect in saying the directors of AIB would go to jail or would be held criminally responsible if the same thing were to happen under this legislation. When the board <Col N="534" />of directors became aware of what had happened in the bank they immediately made a public statement and took responsibility. Mr. Michael Buckley tendered his resignation to the board and it was refused. As far as I know, Mr. Lochlann Quinn did so also. The directors handled the matter in the way responsible directors should and in the way we are trying to ensure such matters will be handled under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>They ignored the auditor's warning. Senator O'Toole's memory is selective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They took responsibility, as a matter of principle, but their board decided that it was incorrect to hold them responsible because they had done as much as they were required to do and that there had been a systems breakdown.</P>
      <P>One cannot hold directors responsible for the nefarious activities of someone in a backroom somewhere. If that were the case I would support Senator Quinn. If we ever reach a situation where right thinking honest people are punished for decisions which are undermined by people who have criminal minds we will be doing an absolute disservice. That would be unfair and wrong and there would be no support for it. That is not what is intended here.</P>
      <P>Companies are required to be compliant with regard to Irish Companies Acts, Irish tax law, the Competition Act and with regard to environmental and other issues. We could have written one line in the Bill requiring directors to certify that their company is compliant with every law. That was the demand of many groups, including environmentalists. However, it was felt that that would have been an unfair way of doing things and that we should specify the areas in which the company should be compliant. I could give a million examples of non-compliance. A person running a transport company might use unmarked diesel or a person running a liquor company might use liquor on which excise duty had not been paid. Senator Quinn referred to the misuse of plastic bags or an error in inequality legislation. Such situations are covered by the insertion of the words, &ldquo;may materially affect&rdquo;. If the action did not materially affect the financial statement it would not be a concern under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We work on the basis of a chain of command. Senator Quinn cited the example of a director who does not trust the chief executive. If there is not trust and confidence between senior management of a company and its board of directors the company is in serious trouble. We cannot arrange legislation to cope with that sort of situation. If I were a director and did not trust my chief executive I would do as Senator Quinn suggests and get an expert in. I would have the expert check everything the chief executive is doing. If I did not trust him to look after one aspect of his responsibilities I would not trust him to look after the others and I certainly would not have him in charge of the running of the company. I accept that Senator Quinn merely used this example as <Col N="535" />an illustration but it is one that does not give a fair reflection of the issue we are discussing. If we do not have trust and confidence in the people we are dealing with then we have a problem.</P>
    <P>A board of directors must have trust and confidence in the people running the company on their behalf to do so in compliance with the law. The board of directors may be wrong and the person running the company may be a confidence man, like John Rusnak, who is cheating the company. In such a situation one cannot hold the directors responsible.</P>
    <P>We are saying in this legislation that the directors must put the structures in place. Senator Quinn pointed out the way in which that would be done by ensuring the processes were in place, that the arrangements for implementing them were effective, and so on. The example given during Second Stage was precisely that &ndash; that the board would get a report on a quarterly basis, for example, as part of a regular agenda, as to how compliance was dealt with.</P>
    <P>The only issue is the fear about this, which I understand. People could suddenly find themselves snowed under by all sorts of extraneous legislation which would not normally be germane to the work of the company. If it is not normally germane or central to the work of the company, it should not materially affect the balance sheet. On the other hand, if someone is running an operation which remains profitable because it is, for example, dumping illegal waste, or operating in any criminal way, then these issues become hugely important.</P>
    <P>Many groups made very strong representations on this issue. They wanted it to be absolutely clear that the law of the land is determined on these issues. It has been said for example that the question of competition law is not understood by many directors, that they do not realise it is a criminal offence in many cases to break those laws. If a board of directors is given a report each month to the effect that four filling station owners are meeting monthly to decide on the price of a litre of fuel, to make sure each is charging the same price for it, then that is conspiracy. It is a breach of the competition law and a criminal offence. It would be utterly wrong to pass legislation that would allow people to sign up to compliance while ignoring such a situation. The point is to link all these aspects in order to create fair competition rather than to put undue pressure on people trying to work and create wealth in a very competitive environment. That is the objective, and it is well met.</P>
    <P>Last night I raised an issue touched on by Senator Quinn today. It relates to section 43(5)(<i>a</i>)(ii), which says that the directors shall specify that they are of the opinion that &ldquo;the company has complied with its relevant obligations in the financial year&rdquo;. That is the issue that bothered Senator Quinn, the question of there being something absolutist in the statement. What he <Col N="536" />said was fair, in the context of what I have just argued, that in asking directors to give their opinion, they cannot be absolutely certain that someone in the company is not being non-compliant. It might be helpful to insert words such as &ldquo;as far as they can reasonably attest&rdquo;. That may not be the precise form of words needed. We should be simply asking for people's best judgment on the basis of the information that has come to them in the course of their work. We should not ask them to employ consultants, for example, to reassure them.</P>

      <P>The problem with this section is that there is a myriad of different-sized companies. They might have revenues of &euro;3 million, &euro;4 million, &euro;50 million or &euro;100 million.

Is that point clear? The section is a monster for small and medium-sized companies and for those with revenues under a certain figure.</P>
      <P>The philosophy behind it is correct in that directors must know that everything is in order. Senator Leyden is correct.

      <P>There is a problem with the same law applying to companies of different sizes. It would be very difficult for a company like mine, employing perhaps 50 people, or a high-risk new technology company, to attract directors. We do not have the staff to deal with all these regulations. To deal with paperwork and regulations is a nightmare. When my business was initially established, and FÁS wanted my staff to go on courses to learn all the different management functions, we did not have the time.</P>
      <P>A company will not survive or be a good company if it does not comply with all the regulations. I am not excusing companies which do not comply, but it is wrong to put in place excessive regulations regarding directors, who are desperately needed. My company has a new director, a young man aged about 40. We are privileged to have him. To sustain and to grow a company, one needs experienced people, who come at a high price.</P>

      <P>The type of remarks to which I refer can be potentially dangerous for a company, but I accept that this was not the intention from the other side of the House. These types of remarks could be misreported in a financial commentary and could cause problems for the companies involved.

      <P>Amendment No. 11 would effectively remove paragraph (<i>c</i>) of the definition &ldquo;relevant obligations&rdquo; in the new section 205E(1), which is being inserted into the principal Act by section 43 of the Bill. We had a long debate on the merits of this proposal on Committee Stage. I explained that this decision implements the recommendation 14.1 of the report of the review group on auditing and it reflects what directors of companies are obliged to do when preparing accounts. I remind the House that the provision only refers to matters that are material or which may materially affect a company's financial statements.</P>
      <P>I will ask my officials to examine the wording in the new subsection 5(2), particularly in respect of directors giving their opinion, using their reasonable judgment, etc. This matter will be reviewed before the Bill is presented to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Due to the way that the exemption from the requirement to prepare a director's compliance statement is worded, as being available to a private company that is eligible for exemption from the requirement to have its accounts audited, a particular focus has been brought to bear on the thresholds applicable to such companies. In particular, the turnover threshold of &euro;317,000 has been focused on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of amendment No. 13 would be to change the basis of the exemption to the thresholds that apply in the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 for companies to be treated as small companies for the purposes of filing obligations with the Companies Registration Office. In essence, a private limited company with a turn<Col N="541" />over not exceeding &euro;3.8 million would be exempt from the compliance statement.</P>
    <P>As previously explained, amendment No. 14 appears to be designed to change the balance sheet total for eligibility for audit exemption. However, that is already the current threshold in section (32)(3)(<i>a</i>)(iii) of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999, so this would not result in any change.</P>
    <P>The implications of amendment No. 15 would be to raise the turnover threshold for the audit exemption from its present level of &euro;317,000 to &euro;3.8 million. It would have the knock-on effect that, if the new 205E(6)(<i>a</i>) had remained in the Bill, as initiated, exemption from the compliance statement would be available to all companies that met this higher threshold. In other words, the effect of amendment No. 13 would be the same as that of amendment No. 15 as regards the compliance statement. However, it would also have substantially increased the turnover threshold for eligibility for audit exemption. This would represent a quantum leap and it could have the effect of taking more than 80% of private companies out of the obligation to have their accounts audited. A change of that magnitude would be need to be carefully considered. I intend to do that before the Bill is presented to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Senators will understand that, in the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendments proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for his remarks, particularly regarding the need for compliance statements. When he and his officials have had an opportunity to consider the matter further, I look forward to his informing us that the level of the threshold for the compliance statement will be increased and that all small and medium-sized businesses will be removed from its scope.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister of State's reply in respect of amendments Nos. 14 and 15. However, my sole concern is that we would not put ourselves at any competitive disadvantage. I wanted what will be available here to be in line with that which is available in other EU member states. During the debate, great emphasis was placed on the position in Northern Ireland and Britain, which are our nearest neighbours. We are aware that the authorities in these jurisdictions are considering raising the threshold to £4.8 million. Apart from costs considerations, my sole concern is that, because competitiveness is so important, we would not put ourselves offside in terms of trade by increasing costs, losing jobs, etc., and thereby damaging the economy.</P>

      <P>In page 54, line 25 after &ldquo;year&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or if not such cases of non compliance have been reported to the relevant statutory authority&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" />This amendment also relates to compliance statements. In regard to executive and non-executive directors about whom we have been speaking, non-executive directors do not run a company. They ensure management runs it correctly and if they cannot trust the chief executive, they bring in someone else to do the job. I do not want to repeat all the points made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to this amendment, which I second. This is probably my last opportunity to speak on it because I realise now that my name is not down as a proposer. I have a real concern that there is an anti-business attitude to legislation brought before the House and that this is another example. I voiced this concern when I talked about the fact that the regulatory impact assessment did not come through and when I referred to the setting up of a review group and then an interim board on which business people were not adequately represented. That is the case, not just in this Bill but in other legislation also. The amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;or if not such cases of non compliance have been reported to the relevant statutory authority&rdquo; in the Bill. It is a good example of the proposals brought forward by Senator Coghlan.</P>
      <P>The legal environment here is becoming more and more hostile to business as is evidenced by a number of Bills enacted in recent years. The Competition Act 1996 gives the State police powers to carry out &ldquo;dawn raids on directors' homes and offices on suspicion.&rdquo;. The Company Law Enforcement Act 2001 obliges auditors to report to the Director of Corporate Enforcement if he or she thinks there may have been an offence committed. The Criminal Justice Act 2001 obliges auditors to report to the Garda that an employee &ldquo;may have committed an offence&rdquo;. The Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill is just another example. I am concerned about all this legislation because it appears there is a lack of understanding of those who set up businesses, provide jobs and create the wealth of this nation.</P>
      <P>I found the language used today from the other side of the House to be intemperate, inaccurate and unacceptable, and the Acting Chairman was right to criticise anyone who named a person. Fraud will happen and has happened but to assume that with all the processes put in being place it will never occur is wrong. It does. If one has put in place all the steps necessary to prevent it and somebody else has managed to establish fraud, one has done one's best.</P>
      <P>I understand in the case of the AIB that both people mentioned offered their resignation and were turned down. We should be very careful in this House. If the biggest company in Ireland is criticised in the manner and tone in which it was criticised here today, that is unacceptable. I agree with the Acting Chairman that we must protect those not here to defend themselves from comments such as were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" />This legislation is flawed. We have moved in the wrong direction in regard to some aspects of it, particularly with regard to compliance, and should not pass it today without making that protest. We listened to the Minister of State who has taken a number of points into account but in terms of compliance, we are moving in the wrong direction and sending out an anti-business and, therefore, anti-Irish economy message. We should rethink this measure which I am disappointed we are passing through the House with such alacrity.</P>

I would not wish to offend the Senator in any sense because we go back a long way to the time when I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing. His company has been exemplary in what it has done for Irish industry and producers. His was the first company to introduce the concept of traceability. I did not use the name in any way to insult the Senator; it was not intentional. In fact, I did not even make the connection until now. I want to make that clear.</P>

There should have been a public inquiry into the activities of the AIB which, incidentally, was rescued by this House at the time it amalgamated with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. It was saved from annihilation, not for the first time. As far as I remember, it was a Fine Gael Government led by Garret FitzGerald which recalled the Dáil to enact the necessary legislation. Are we forgetting that the board of directors of this great company did not resign then? They bought the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a white elephant&mdash;</P>

This provision would send out a positive message. The only reasons we are here are the provisions of the Constitution and the vote of the people. It is our constitutional duty to protect their interests. It would send out a positive signal if the Government was to legislate to ensure directors of large companies stand over a statement to the effect that everything in their companies was being done above board.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his success in passing the legislation through the House and thank his officials for their work on this difficult and intricate Bill. I am impressed that the amended Bill was brought before the House this morning as this required considerable hard work. Senator Henry received a telephone call at 11 p.m. last night asking if she would second my amendments &ndash; I could not be contacted &ndash; and was happy to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, too, wish to thank the parliamentary reporters. I received a telephone call from Indonesia recently from a person who had read on the Internet a contribution I had made in the House the previous night. I was astonished that this information was already on the website. We <Col N="547" />do not often have an opportunity to comment on this matter.</P>
    <P>As Senator Leyden stated, the Leader has brought a considerable number of Bills before the House and we have had many good debates, including this one. The Minister of State has responded to our contributions, although not necessarily to the extent we would have liked in some cases. Perhaps he went too far in others. Some of the amendments the Government tabled arose from Second Stage debates and conversations with Senators in which they had voiced their concerns. This offers us a reminder that while the amendments may not have been tabled by Members of the House, the House can play an effective role.</P>
    <P>My criticism is that much more should have been done here instead of leaving it to the Lower House to correct matters. Nevertheless, the legislation will return to the Seanad if amendments are made in the Dáil. I am disappointed that two aspects of the Bill, the provisions on compliance and non-executive directors, which are not specifically auditing issues, were included. It would be preferable if they were addressed in other legislation. Let us ensure the Bill works well. I congratulate all those involved with it.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on all Stages. The debates on 16 April, yesterday and today have been useful. I was struck by the number of Senators who had contributed and the quality of the interventions and views as well as their grasp of this technical and complicated legislation. I appreciate the input Senators have made thus far. I have listened attentively to their contributions and the Government tabled several amendments in response to suggestions made in the House on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I noted their contributions on Committee Stage and Report Stage and the Government hopes to table amendments in the other House for consideration, after which I will return to this House to give Senators an opportunity to express their views. Their contributions have already helped shape and improve the legislation, which, when enacted, will bear the imprint of the wisdom and insight of the House. I thank my officials for the work they have done to date and the officials of the House for preparing everything for this debate at such short notice, having concluded Committee Stage at 9.30 p.m. last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the episode of fraud at the bank referred to earlier. This intricate case, carried out in the United States, bears out the importance of the role of directors. I share Senator O'Toole's view that directors are not responsible for such intricate frauds, provided all reasonable endeavours to secure the company's compliance are made and the relevant obligations, structures and controls are in place. If such reasonable endeavours have been made, <Col N="548" />it would be wrong for us to send out the message that directors must fall on their swords in the event that a fraud is expertly carried out. The AIB is following other financial institutions which have been connected with the individual concerned. I hope it will succeed in getting some of the money back.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, for coming to the House today to give a report on unit 9 of James Connolly Memorial Hospital which is due to be relocated to a new purpose built hospital. I also raised this matter in February at which time I was informed by the Minister that a snag list was being compiled and due to be discussed the following week. This would have been around 11 February. Since then I have had a meeting with senior management of the Northern Area Health Board and attended a meeting where I expected to meet the assistant chief executive but there were no less than four other managers present to discuss the subject with me. I was quite surprised by this because I had been led to believe there were no problems. At the meeting I was promised I would be given a copy of the snag list. While I was not supplied with the list by the Northern Area Health Board, I did receive it from another source.</P>
      <P>The report I have been given states:</P>
      <P>It is a story of incompetence and neglect that will cost the Tax-payer hundreds of thousands of Euro, if not millions . The Design Team did not include Psychiatric Nurses and indeed excluded the Director of Nursing who has now been given responsibility for its operation . it is no exaggeration to describe this Unit as a disaster, to say it is the worst ever provided to the Psychiatric Services, to declare that it is unsafe for Staff, compromises Patient care and raises the distinct possibility that Patients will refuse to go there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report lists some of the issues of concern. It states the facilities in the new unit are cramped with the television room, recreation area and smoking room inadequate for 22 patients. One patient with three visitors will fill the new visiting room. The dining room can accommodate about six patients. Apparently, the design team did not <Col N="549" />realise that mentally ill patients were rarely confined to bed except in the very early stages of treatment, if at all. Somebody on the team had concluded that patients would eat their meals from bed tables when in reality the majority use the dining room.</P>
    <P>Regarding the high observation area the report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>There is no way that any Nurse with common sense, any regard for his/her continued practice or with even a semblance of patient welfare would place a client in any one of the five side rooms where the biggest expanse of space is glass. Or where there are open electric sockets, light fittings, which are accessible, doors, which are unsuitable. These Rooms can never be used to accommodate acutely disturbed Patients, even for &ldquo;time out&rdquo; in their current state.</P>
    <P>As for the proposed &ldquo;Green Room&rdquo;, this Room is so palpably unsuitable, so obviously dangerous as to be useless other than as a Store Room. It is certainly unimaginable that a practising Nurse would even consider the placement of a disturbed Patient therein.</P>
    <P>The idea that a disturbed Patient would be able to access the electric wiring is incredible; the absence of en suite facilities appalling.</P>
    <P>This and the previous Government have poured millions into the health service. The number of staff has been increased by over 30,000 since 1997. It is appalling that at such a time we would have management in a health board area which could be accused of such neglect. If benchmarking, which the Government brought into being, is to mean anything other than divvying up pay increases and adding to our public sector pay bill, it must include accountability. There is no accountability in this situation. I met five managers but our meeting was a whitewash. They told me they were responsible for the management of the hospital while the unions were responsible for staff in the hospital. I asked who was responsible for patient care.</P>
    <P>I visited unit 9 last week. One would see better in a Romanian orphanage. The unit would be condemned if it was part of a television series we were watching from Romania. It is hard to believe we can see this in Ireland given the millions spent on the health service. It is appalling to think we have a new hospital built, yet this is happening here in Dublin. It is time for decisions to be made. I want to see patients being removed from what the inspector of mental hospitals considers are not proper facilities in unit 9 and relocated as soon as possible in the new hospital. If it costs hundreds of thousands or &euro;1 million to make this move, it should be made public and those responsible brought to book. It is high time that patient care was placed at the top of the agenda. If we are told what has happened is true, there has been gross neglect.</P>

      <P>The acute psychiatric in-patient services for area 6 of the Eastern Regional Health Authority are currently being delivered from unit 9 at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, which has 22 beds. In his report for the year ended 31 December 2001 the inspector of mental hospitals noted that the unit was unsuited for its purpose and that its shortcomings had resulted in unsatisfactory conditions for service users and considerable difficulties for staff. The inspector also noted that the unit was structurally and decoratively poor with a temporary add-on structure providing bathroom facilities for female patients. The unit will be replaced by a new psychiatric unit in the new development currently nearing completion. Patients will be relocated to the new unit which will provide improved patient facilities and services. The new unit will be a 56 bed unit comprising 44 acute psychiatric beds, six high observation beds and six psychiatry of old age beds. Patients from a 22 bed unit at St. Brendan's Hospital will also be moving to the new unit.</P>
      <P>Discussions are ongoing with unions representing psychiatric nurses moving to the new psychiatric unit at James Connolly Memorial Hospital. The discussions are currently concentrating on a number of issues of concern in relation to the physical layout of the new acute psychiatric unit. Proposals aimed at addressing these concerns were presented to staff unions at a recent meeting with the Northern Area Health Board. Draft operational procedures and protocols were also presented, including admission, discharge and security policies. The unions requested some time to consider the proposals and advised that they would report back by 4 June 2003.</P>
      <P>The new acute psychiatric unit will provide bright and spacious accommodation for patients as part of the integrated services available at James Connolly Memorial Hospital. In the interests of patient care, I hope all interested parties will co-operate to progress its opening.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, for coming to the Seanad to take my matter on the Adjournment. This issue relates to Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school and I hope the response will be positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a greater issue than the one I am raising today and it was mentioned by Senator Glynn and me on the Order of Business this morning, namely, the apparent shortage of primary school places in developing areas. I am sure the Minister of State knows that Lucan is the fastest growing area in the country, according to Central Statistics Office figures. There is a crisis in terms of the lack of school places for children, particularly at primary school level, which may affect the num<Col N="551" />ber of secondary school places in the future, if it has not already done so.</P>
    <P>I have met parents who have had to bring their children to primary schools outside Lucan because they could not get school places in the area. I have also heard of many other such cases from friends and relatives of those affected. Many parents have contacted me because they are concerned that when they apply for school places for their children next year or in subsequent years, they will not get a place in Lucan. Many of the children involved are due to start school next year. I have heard stories about parents who fear they will have to keep their children at home until they are five or six years of age.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries about this matter with the majority of schools in Lucan because I wanted to know the extent of the problem. I found that large numbers of children from Lucan were being turned away from local schools which are trying their best but they are struggling in terms of the provision of school places. Many school principals are distressed because they must turn children away. The schools confirmed to me that they were turning away children in their catchment areas. They are asking children to defer their education until they are older or look elsewhere. Children have not had any success to date in finding a school place in Lucan.</P>
    <P>Bad planning is a major cause of this problem. However, it is not the fault only of the local authorities which must provide land for housing. They should do what they have done in Adamstown where housing is developed in conjunction with the provision of permanent school buildings. It should be mandatory to provide proper school accommodation. The Department of Education and Science is ultimately responsible. Children have a right to education which is enshrined in the Constitution. Every child should have a school place, preferably in the area in which he or she lives given the transport problems, particularly in the Dublin area. Planning is an issue because the Department and the local authorities did not anticipate the number of families with children of school going age who would move to new private estates and council housing in Lucan. Part of the problem is the length of time it takes to buy a house. The situation is particularly bad for the large number of non-nationals living in Lucan.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and the Department to respond to the crisis I have identified. Lucan should be treated as an emergency area. Emergency prefabricated accommodation should be provided for new and established schools which have requested it. I know many schools have requested additional accommodation, including Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school. The Department should acquire the reserved sites for schools as soon as possible and <Col N="552" />start building permanent school buildings. A lot can be done now. Emergency prefabricated buildings must be provided. If they are provided this September on the reserved site for Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school, it will be able to take in two new junior infant classes. If it does not happen, the people concerned may not have anywhere else to go. This issue requires an emergency response.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter since it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position on Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school. The school opened in September 2002 with provisional recognition from the Department of Education and Science. It is currently housed in rented accommodation in the scout den in Lucan village.</P>
      <P>During the period of provisional recognition it is the responsibility of the school patron to provide interim accommodation which must be capable of meeting the needs of the developing school until permanent recognition has been secured and the Department is in a position to acquire a site and provide a permanent school building. Interim accommodation must comply at all times with planning, fire, health and safety and building regulations.</P>
      <P>In view of the restricted capacity of the scout den, which has a maximum capacity of 30, the promoters were advised to develop and implement an enrolment policy in line with the capacity of the available accommodation. This approach was essential to ensure there was no overcrowding that might create a health and safety problem for pupils and school staff. In response to its impending accommodation difficulties, the board of management of the school made a proposal to the Department to lease the site which has been reserved in the Griffeen Valley area for primary education purposes from the owners and house the school in temporary accommodation on the site.</P>
      <P>The Department is acutely aware of the need for additional primary provision in the general Lucan area and exploring various options to ensure there will be adequate places available in September. In addition, it has instructed the Office of Public Works to commence negotiations on the acquisition of a site to facilitate the construction of a new school in Lucan. The Senator will appreciate that in view of the commercial sensitivity of the site acquisition process, the Department is not in a position to comment further on the matter at this time. I thank her for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position to the House.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.10 p.m. until 2.30&nbsp;p.m. on Tuesday, 10 June 2003.</P>
