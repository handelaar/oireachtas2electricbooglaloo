      <P>I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the Government's plans regarding the report of the Commission on Science, Technology and Innovation and, in particular, the strategy to be adopted regarding spending on research and development arising from the report.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Scanlon of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to clarify the position on lands designated special areas of conservation which are not registered as such by the Land Registry, are then purchased and reclaimed and Dúchas is now insisting be returned to their original state.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to replace staff at Nenagh Law Centre in order to alleviate the long waiting list there and meet the promises made by his predecessor to maintain at least three solicitors at the centre.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the reasons for the recent introduction of a charge for coarse fishing, in the form of fishing permits, in selected areas on the River Suck.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the level of <Col N="834" />suicide in Ireland; and if an investigation has been carried out into the number of suicide victims who may have been prescribed Cipramil by their general practitioners and were on this medication when they committed suicide.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Tuffy, Scanlon and O'Meara and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Leyden and Morrissey may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a proposal to appoint a select committee to be joined with a select committee of the Dáil to consider The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Bill 2002, to be taken without debate, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders relative to private business; No. 2, referral motion to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business; No. 3, referral motion to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food; No. 4, motion re Fourth Protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam which has been considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights; No. 5, motion re State Examinations Commission (Establishment) Order 2003 which has been considered by the Joint Committee on Education and Science; No. 6, motion re Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam which has been considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights; No. 7, motion re Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam which has been considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights; No. 8, motion re Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam which has been considered by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights; No. 9, Opticians (Amendment) Bill 2002 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and, it is hoped, to conclude by 4 p.m.; and No. 10, Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 9 or at 4 p.m. if the debate on No. 9 has not concluded and to conclude not later than 8 p.m. Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, will be taken without debate. There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="835" />Law Reform to come to the House once again to make a statement on his proposals regarding the rising number of crimes associated with alcohol consumption? At the weekend he suggested that two matters might be examined. One is the introduction of a national ID card throughout the country, which I would welcome. The second is the rather crazy suggestion that pubs be allowed to stay open later into the night. Perhaps he would make a statement to the House at some stage next week to outline the proposals he will put to the Government.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available in the next week or so for a debate on pensions policy? Last year the Minister for Social and Family Affairs introduced PRSAs, a portable and flexible pension arrangement for workers. However, the scheme seems to have fallen flat. The level of coverage available to workers is abysmally low and is far below the EU average. We need to debate this issue soon, so I ask the Leader to make time available to do so.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader find out from the National Library what is its policy with regard to purchasing artefacts and important historical documents? Last week, in an auction room in Dublin, an important historical document from the late General Michael Collins was lost to public perusal as a result of its being purchased by a citizen. While everybody holds the view that citizens should be sufficiently civic-minded to hand over such artefacts and documents to ensure that everybody in the State has an opportunity to see them in the National Library or the National Museum, what is the policy of the National Library on bidding in such auctions? I understand it made a bid of approximately &euro;21,000, but that the document was sold for &euro;26,000. I would be grateful if the Leader would clarify this matter with the National Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a technical matter. When the Leader was outlining the Order of Business she said Nos. 1 to 4 would be taken without discussion and distinctly did not say Nos. 5 to 8 would be taken without discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader corrected herself later. I do not accept that arrangement. I have no desire to speak on any of the issues, but we previously made it clear that, for the sake of efficiency, items being sent to committees should not be the subject of debate. That is how the House has operated but that was always on the basis that when a matter came back from a committee, Members who might believe it had not been adequately discussed by the committee should be entitled to raise it in the House. That is provided for in the legislation. I am not seeking a discussion on any of the matters but if a Member of the House, perhaps a member of a commit<Col N="836" />tee that dealt with Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8, believes that they require further discussion, he or she is entitled to seek it. That should be made clear. I have no indication that any Member wishes to speak on these issues. However, I cannot agree that Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8 be taken without discussion as a formality.</P>
      <P>A large number of statutory instruments are referred to in Nos. 1 to 8. I do not know if I am the only Member who regularly seeks statutory instruments, ministerial orders, papers laid before the Houses, etc., but it causes great difficulty and puts huge pressure on the over-pressed, under-resourced and understaffed Oireachtas Library. All such papers should be put on the Oireachtas website for easy accessibility. Will the Leader raise this issue? The Oireachtas website is probably the best parliamentary website in Europe. It is extraordinarily well presented and up to date. It is a prize-winning website and it would be a useful way of making these documents available.</P>
      <P>Of the papers laid before the House, No. 5 is an Oireachtas order concerning allowances to Members. The question was raised by a number of people in the Lower House recently as to whether it was appropriate for us to accept the properly arbitrated and decided upon pay increase for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>To which item is the Senator referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The fifth of the papers laid before the Seanad, which are listed on page 164 of the Order Paper. The Government kindly incorporated, with the support of all sides in the Dáil, a provision into the Finance Bills of 2001 and 2002 which allows Members of the House who, for principled reasons, could not accept a pay increase to waive it. I ask the Leader to obtain details from the Minister for Finance of the number of Members from each House who waived their pay increases. Will she also inquire whether the Minister would be prepared to share the money returned to him among those of us who were unprincipled enough to take the pay increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a peeping Tom. I do not care what Members do with their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious issue. I do not want people taking cheap shots in public at those of us who accept the money. Over the weekend, the Laffoy commission started running advertisements encouraging people to send in details of their happy stories and good experiences of institutions. This situation has gone completely off kilter and this latest campaign designed to accumulate happy recollections is a misuse of Government money. It is an utter waste of taxpayers' money to advertise for people to write and tell us they had a good time in whatever institution they were in. That is nonsensical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" />Will the Leader indicate whether both Government parties will have a free vote tomorrow on the Local Government Bill 2003?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good try by Senator O'Toole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of principle for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the free vote tomorrow. I do not recall the House agreeing to all Stages of the Opticians (Amendment) Bill 2002 being taken today. Now&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are seven amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the grounds of good humour and goodwill, my party will not object strongly. However, this should not be taken as a precedent. Report Stage should be taken separately because it would not be the first occasion on which an omission arose and was only spotted later.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader first to find out what is happening and, second, organise a debate in the House regarding the extraordinary decision by the European Commission to capitulate to the United States and supply as much personal data in advance about everybody travelling to the US as the authorities there request. There are two issues at stake here, both of which deserve to be discussed in detail. The first is the demand of the United States that we break our data protection legislation and that data which should have nothing to do the airlines will now be sought by them from passengers. That an airline would record data and then supply it to a third party is a fundamental breach of data protection legislation.</P>
      <P>The second issue, which is almost more important, is that of jurisdiction. This was not agreed by the governments of Europe, but by the Commission. Many of us spent 12 to 18 months between the two Nice referenda telling the people that the idea of an all-powerful Brussels was an exaggeration. Suddenly, however, we have been presented with something as fundamental as this agreement, which, to my knowledge, was apparently negotiated without input from any government. The people of Europe are being informed that if they wish to travel to the United States, they must let the authorities there know everything they wish to know about them, including their dietary preferences, which, in my opinion, is close to religious typecasting in advance. This is a serious matter. A Minister should explain to the House the Government's position on it and indicate whether it believes its stance is consistent with the philosophy and thrust of our data protection legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House could usefully discuss the community part of the new national agreement, in respect of which there are obviously major divisions between voluntary organisations. If there is <Col N="838" />one voluntary organisation to which I would listen first about the state of the country, it would be the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. The fact that it is so unhappy ought to alert the only segment of society not involved in the agreement, namely, the elected Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on this issue? Senator O'Toole has told us often enough about the other provisions. We hear at least once a week about his great achievements. I would like to hear about the parts the Society of St. Vincent de Paul does not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator O'Toole puts them forward as his great achievements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes about the need for a discussion on pensions. The country was fed a view on private pensions, based on an ever-growing stock market, during the past ten years. On the last occasion the stock market fell as precipitously as it has during the past three years, it took the Dow Jones 30 years to recover. This means anyone over 35 faces the prospect of a much more poorly funded private pension. This is a serious issue which also confronts the State because of its pension provision requirements. The optimism that the stock market will all bounce back in a few years is not grounded in historical experience and, consequently, there is a major need for a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Christina Noble will today receive an award from Queen Elizabeth for her great work in Vietnam. It is unfortunate that we do not have an honours system in this country. I raised this matter in the Lower House on a previous occasion&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the then Taoiseach was receptive. Deputy Quinn blew me out of the water on the matter saying that we were aping an English system. There are many examples of honours systems within Europe. For example, the Legion of Honour in France dates back to the time of Napoleon. It is time we had an honours system in this country. I saw it referred to recently when Richard Harris died. People said it was unfortunate he could not be recognised in his country. Will the Leader bring the matter to the attention of the Taoiseach? We should move in a positive direction and recognise the era in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same issue, Tom Hyland, who would be known to many Members, was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Limerick yesterday. That was highly appropriate. Awarding honorary degrees is a type of honours system and it is the way in which we recognise the significant achievements of people such as Tom Hyland. He has done the country such an honour that it would be an imaginative act on the part of the Taoiseach, after the next general election or if a vacancy were to arise in the House, to nominate a person such as Tom Hyland to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan raised the issue of American airlines being given advance warning of our dietary requirements. I do this as a matter of form because I like to give them the opportunity to prepare the food I like in advance and have no difficulty with it.</P>
      <P>I have a serious matter to raise. I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the appropriate Ministers the apparent existence of a crack cocaine source in Parnell Street which was exposed in the newspapers at the weekend. This is an extremely worrying development. Crack cocaine is a highly addictive and dangerous substance which leads to all kinds of ancillary crimes. I have warned about the worsening state of Parnell Street for several years. We have the extraordinary irony that there is a halfway house for female drug addicts in the old bakery in Parnell Street, apparently almost next door to a major source of crack cocaine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator looking for a debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would be very happy to have one. However, the Leader should draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that a task force for the area is needed as the problems are very complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a related matter, we have previously debated the extraordinary dependence of young people on alcohol and the ensuing violence. There was a radio programme yesterday in which a very distinguished police officer spoke about the prevalence of knives and suggested the Oireachtas had a duty to amend the Offensive <Col N="840" />Weapons and Firearms Act in order to curtail the carrying of knives, some of which are quite horrendous. He described how a match was put in a Stanley knife with two blades in order that when a person was assaulted and cut, an entire strip of flesh, which is very difficult to sew, was removed. There have been so many deaths through the use of knives that he said he was much more terrified of a knife than of a gun. We have been warned. We need to look at this and produce a legislative amendment to cover the subject. Such knives should be outlawed and their possession should be made a criminal offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of occasions in this House I have raised the issue of Cork School of Music. Given that the preferred bidder was selected as long ago as January 2001 and we are still no nearer a final decision despite assurances in this House, I ask the Leader at this late stage to appeal to the Taoiseach to move the matter forward and free the logjam in the Department of Finance with regard to the project.</P>
      <P>The Leader should express to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the gratitude of all Members of this House, including the Opposition. We had a very successful debate on the issue of under age drinking. It is reassuring to everyone that the Minister has acted on some of the proposals made in the debate.</P>

      <P>As Senator Norris said, Dr. Tom Hyland was recognised for his work on education in East Timor yesterday by being awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Limerick. He is continuing his work. I note that the Senator is helping his fundraising efforts by holding one of his one man Joycean shows. The Leader should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House in order that we can discuss how we can assist East Timor. Last week Dr. Hyland suggested to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs that it should be chosen as the first Asian country for the Ireland Aid programme. We should discuss how we can continue our positive relationship and show solidarity with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Leader aware that RTE, the State broadcaster, caused serious distress recently when it wrote to thousands of pensioners asking them to pay the &euro;150 television licence fee? This was a mistake, for which it should apologise. More shockingly, by axing the licence concessions of which many people have availed, the State broadcaster will penalise the elderly, who spend most of their twilight years enjoying <Col N="841" />television, and future pensioners. The House should categorically condemn RTE for this disgraceful decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan stated that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul was concerned about the recent national agreement. The society has also expressed deep concern about disadvantage in education. I ask the Leader to find out from the Minister which body is responsible for school attendance. When the House passed a Bill addressing the issue of truancy just over a year ago, Members assumed that by removing the responsibility for ensuring students attend school from the Garda, this duty would be transferred to another agency. I understand this has not happened. As a nation, we are not fulfilling our duty to ensure that the failure of children to attend school is investigated and that the necessary action is taken. Will the Leader take urgent steps to ensure this matter is addressed, which, I gather, is not the case more than a year after the relevant legislation was passed. It is in our hands to ensure action is taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a serious issue concerning providers of services to people with disabilities. CoAction is one such provider in west Cork. It is run voluntarily and provides essential services to people with intellectual difficulties and children with special needs. In 1997, the then Department of Health promised the organisation funding through the health boards. I understand some of the large organisations providing these services received funding. Unfortunately, many of the smaller organisations did not. In turn, this has led to a decision by CoAction to close one of its outlets and make some of its staff redundant. Ultimately, the people who will suffer are children with special needs and their parents.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children what happened to the money promised in 1997? Will she request that a sum of &euro;1.5 million be provided to address the core funding deficit of the organisation in question? Will she arrange for the Minister to come before the House to answer questions on this issue or at least to explain where the promised money is and whether he will make it available? If it is not available, does this mean that the national health strategy is dead in the water?</P>

      <P>I support the call made by Senators Brian Hayes and Ryan for a debate on what is a rapidly approaching crisis in the pensions industry. A pensions Bill was debated and amended by the previous Seanad. It has now been overtaken by events and we are heading for circumstances in which people's expectations will simply not be met. It should be pointed out that the industry is not run for the benefit of pensioners, who are the last who benefit from it, but for those who are parasites. They have their hands in the pie&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and have been absolute disasters in running pensions. As Senator Ryan rightly said, they invested in the worst possible performing asset for the past 16 years in which equities have been out-performed by bonds and the experts in the industry have taken the wrong course. The result is that those expecting pensions will not get what they expected. That is a serious situation which is getting worse.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes asked if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would come to the House to discuss drink related crimes and, in particular, announcements made over the weekend. I note that the item on under age drinking is still on the Order Paper, No. 19. We will endeavour to have a follow-up debate, which will be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of pensions and requested that the Minister for Finance come to the House to discuss them. As the issue is increasingly absorbing more time in the media, <Col N="843" />etc., it would be useful if we were to get the exact position.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked if the National Library had a policy on bidding for items of great national interest. He is correct that the bid on the Michael Collins letter went up to &euro;21,000 and &euro;25,000 or &euro;26,000&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like any bidder at an auction, the National Library would not have a set bidding price. It would probably decide to go so far and no further. Mr. Peter Barry was extremely generous in giving back the Michael Collins items he had purchased and I hope the citizen in question might do the same. On whether the National Library, or any national institution, has a set policy on bidding for a painting, letter, book or whatever, I can get the information for the Senator but imagine its policy is flexible in terms of the market for such an item, which I agree was a very important one.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to items on the Order Paper which were to be taken without debate. He does not have a difficulty with the four items to be referred to a joint committee but does have a difficulty with those which have been returned. I have been considering this matter because I am aware the Senator has raised it on several occasions. I am not being facetious when I say any Member of the Dáil or Seanad can attend a committee meeting at which such an item is being discussed. In future, if an item appears on the Order Paper which a particular Senator would wish to have discussed, I will arrange for such a discussion if he or she notifies me. That might be the best way to proceed because it can appear a little arbitrary for me to read out 12 items on which there will be no discussion.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also asked me to find out who was not taking money under the allowance scheme. He can get that information himself. I do not see myself asking everyone if he or she took the money they were granted.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan raised a concern about Report Stage of the Opticians (Amendment) Bill. There are seven amendments, two of which are textual. I would not normally do things this way and there should be a gap between Committee and Report Stages but the amendments did not appear to need a lot of reflection. That is the reason we have ordered matters this way.</P>
      <P>I also heard the piece on radio regarding the European Commission giving one's dietary needs and other personal data to the United States. While I presume the information is wanted to combat terrorism, I wondered about this also. A representative of the Commission discussed the matter, which does not seem to arise from any legislation or directive and about which I will make inquiries.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also agreed with Senator Brian Hayes about pensions. Regarding the committee tier of the national agreement, by their very nature they represent a broad sweep of individuals with various concerns. That is the reason they have divergent views.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane asked about an honours system in Ireland. Various ways of honouring people such as honorary doctorates from universities have been mentioned.

      <P>I am advised that the reference to bankruptcy is to those in a condition of undischarged bankruptcy. As the Bill is written, however, it appears that if a person becomes bankrupt once, he or she can never be an optometrist again. Section 5 states that a person must be of &ldquo;good character and repute and has not been declared bankrupt&rdquo;. This amendment would change that to &ldquo;an undischarged bankrupt&rdquo;, thus clarifying the matter. That is the usual position. The disqualification from becoming the director of a company is rarely for life. In an enterprise culture, we should not impose lifetime bans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, as drafted, amends sections 24, 25, 33 and 34 of the Principal Act to bring their provisions clearly into line with the European Union directives on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications. These directives were transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 1 of 1991 and Statutory Instrument No. 135 of 1996. Sections 6 and 9 of the Bill provide for the registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians who have trained in other member states of the European Union and who are authorised, by virtue of the relevant EU directive, to take up and pursue those professions. Sections 5 and 8 provide for the registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians who have trained in this State and sections 7 and 10 provide for the registration of those who have trained outside the European Union.</P>
      <P>The statutory instruments transposing the EU directives concerned use the terminology &ldquo;has not been declared bankrupt&rdquo;. Accordingly, it has been used in the Bill, as drafted. Having taken the advice of the office of the parliamentary counsel in the matter, I am not in a position to accept the Senator's proposed amendments to sections 5, 7, 8 and 10 which, if accepted, would have the effect of creating a different regime for, on the one hand, optometrists and dispensing opticians whose qualifications have been obtained in this State and outside the European Union and, on the other, those qualified in other member states. My understanding is that the phrase used in the Bill is the one normally used. What the Senator is suggesting might be more appropriate for debate on another occasion in the context of a system wide change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House unnecessarily on this. What advice has the Minister received on the matter? My understanding, on the basis of explanations I have received, is that once a person is declared bankrupt, he or she can never again practice as an optometrist. Is it the Minister's understanding that the prohibition applies only while a person is in the state of bankruptcy? Does it result in a lifetime ban if one is declared bankrupt? That appears to be an easy question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The same provision applies to Members of the Oireachtas. It appears to be an age-old provision. We are amending the Act to keep in line with EU Council directives on mutual recognition of professions across member states. My understanding of the term &ldquo;has not been declared bankrupt&rdquo; is that the person concerned is not bankrupt. I will revert to the Senator with further advice on the matter after I have obtained further clarification from the parliamentary counsel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the complications involved in that the issue does not relate solely to <Col N="850" />this Bill. However, before it is enacted into law, we should clarify precisely what the phrase means. While I know that any Senator who might be declared bankrupt would immediately cease to be a Member of the Oireachtas, I am not sure that one would be prohibited from running again if the provision was invoked. I have never had to deal with the issue, although a person known to some of us came close to it on one occasion. There is a separate issue involved in this regard. Perhaps it is public policy that a person who is declared bankrupt once is to be permanently excluded thereafter from the relevant entitlements. However, I do not claim to be very knowledgeable about bankruptcy but perhaps the Minister does.</P>

      <P>Historically, the phrase has been used in the context of criminal bankruptcy. However, we added Deputies and Senators to the list, in terms of eligibility for membership of outside bodies. In that regard, many Acts contain a standard provision referring to criminal bankruptcy and membership of the Oireachtas almost in the same sentence. The Senator may have a point in the generality of the issue. It is a legitimate question as to whether, if a person has a difficulty at a certain period of his or her life, this should result in being permanently debarred. I will seek legal clarification on the phraseology used in advance of the matter being debated in the other House. The difficulty is that the terminology is used in the EU directive which we are transposing into Irish law. The Senator has, however, raised an interesting point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 9, paragraph (<i>a</i>), line 12, after &ldquo;action&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including the prescription or administration of any drug for the purpose of paralysing the accommodation of the eye,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When we were discussing whether or not we should take all Stages of the Bill today, the Leader stated that she did not think any of the amendments were serious or ponderous. In my opinion, however, the amendment in my name is extremely serious because it relates to one of the most important parts of the Bill. While I warmly welcome the rest of the Bill, I am anxious about this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My anxiety was somewhat increased by the Minister's reply on Second Stage. With regard to what I said on the subject of allowing optometrists to use drugs, I do not believe he fully understood my concerns. I do not believe that the <Col N="852" />only people who should be allowed use drugs are members of the medical profession. I have spoken in this House, as the Cathaoirleach may remember, about the need to extend the use of drugs to paramedics in a pre-hospital emergency situation. I got quite a favourable response from the Minister about this and I hope that changes in this area will be forthcoming in the near future. I am not taking a trade union approach to this issue, about which I am quite concerned.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister stated that &ldquo;This Bill does not extend the use of drugs and it does not change the parent legislation.&rdquo; That is not really true. It is removing the section which states that an optician, as so described within the existing Act, cannot prescribe or administer drugs. The Minister then stated that &ldquo;Amendments to the Medicinal Regulations 1996 will facilitate the utilisation of the three drugs.&rdquo; However, there is nothing within the Bill which describes these three drugs. They are not there. As far as I can see, a future Minister could extend the number of drugs which it is possible to administer.</P>
    <P>I know there was considerable pressure on the Department to allow the use of atropine, but this was not allowed. We are not specifying in the legislation the drugs which may be used and I pointed out on Second Stage that I was one of those who had prescribed Chloramphenicol eye ointment, which subsequently was proved to cause agranular cytosis. It was decades before we understood that the local application of a powerful antibiotic such as that to which I refer &ndash; which was so useful in the treatment of eye infections &ndash; could actually cause depression of the bone marrow and the development of agranular cytosis. Even if this Minister does not, some other Minister in the future could extend the use of the drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his reply on Second Stage that three drugs were suggested. He started the paragraph following the one I have just quoted by saying drugs are used in diagnosis. That is quite true, but section 12(<i>a</i>) of this Bill states that &ldquo;a registered optician who is not a registered medical practitioner shall not suggest by any written or oral statement or by any action that the registered optician has made or is capable of making a medical diagnosis of a disease of the eye .&rdquo;. If this is the case, why, according to the Minister's own words, are we introducing drugs used to facilitate a diagnosis of eye disease?</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about systemic disease because although optometrists should be able to give a full ophthalmological examination of the eye, they cannot be expected to deduce the presence of systemic disease from symptoms within the eye. This is very important because systemic disease is frequently picked up because of some peripheral manifestation. Diabetes, the most common cause of blindness in people of working age, is the most important example of this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" />The Minister when replying said, &ldquo;Drugs are used in diagnosis to ensure that the best possible examination can be carried out to gain information that might not otherwise be readily obtained.&rdquo; As I said earlier, people will think they have had a full medical examination of the fundus of the eye. If the optometrist dilates the pupil the patient will think that ocular disease has been ruled out because the only reason the pupil is dilated is to do a fundal examination. Optometrists have been managing for years to give extraordinarily good advice regarding spectacles without the use of this drug. The drug to be used in this case is the one I am least concerned about, namely tropicamide. This is used to facilitate examination of the fundus of the eye by paralysing the sphincter and dilator muscles of the iris. It does have a slight effect on the ciliary muscle, but it does not last for long. It is the one I have the least trouble with, but there are side-effects, systemic as well as local, which are listed in <i>Duane's Ophthalmology</i>. They are not common, but they exist.</P>
    <P>Another drug about which I am concerned is oxybuprocaine hydrochloride. I am referring to the Minister's Second Stage speech so I assume these are the three drugs he intends to be used. This is a topical anaesthetic that produces a surface anaesthesia lasting 20 to 30 minutes. That is fine, but at present I believe some opticians are using this drug to anaesthetise people's eyes while they test them for contact lenses. I was tested for contact lenses, and failed, but I do not think a local anaesthetic was used. One can only presume that the reason there is enthusiasm for allowing a local anaesthetic is that the opticians would like to be able to use an applanation tonometer to measure pressure within the eye rather than the puff tonometer used at the moment. The difference between the two is that the former touches the surface of the eye &ndash; the cornea &ndash; and the latter does not. The former is more accurate, but the other is also quite accurate. Opticians have been measuring tension within the eye for many years. Perhaps some glaucomas have been missed &ndash; I do not know &ndash; and this is why they want the applanation tonometer, but it is a big change.</P>
    <P>Touching the cornea of the eye is important. The Minister said at the beginning of the Second Stage debate that, at present, opticians are not really allowed even to take a speck of dust out of the eye. Any medical practitioner is also extraordinarily sensitive about going near the eye because one can get into dire trouble so rapidly. I can only believe that this is the reason for the request to have this drug encompassed within the new regulations. Suppose there is a corneal tear, which can happen when a tonometer is being used. What is the legal liability of the optician, the to-be optometrist? After obtaining a copy of the Minister's regulations &ndash; a master stroke, as they were produced last Friday and I was obliged to explain them at a meeting of the IHCA on <Col N="854" />Sunday &ndash; I looked through the National Treasury Management Agency (Delegation of Functions) Order 2003, which is about extending enterprise liability to the National Treasury Agency. In it, the definition of &ldquo;clinical claim&rdquo; is given as &ldquo;a claim connected with the provision of, or failure to provide, a professional medical service&rdquo;. It goes on to describe &ldquo;professional medical services&rdquo; as:</P>
    <P>(a) services provided by registered medical practitioners or registered dentists of a diagnostic or palliative nature, or consisting of the provision of treatment in respect of any illness, disease, injury or other medical condition,</P>
    <P>(b) services provided by other health professionals in the performance of their duties, including pharmacists, nurses, midwives, paramedics, ambulance personnel, laboratory technicians .</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that opticians or optometrists are not mentioned there. The definition continues as:</P>
    <P>(c) services connected with the provision of health or medical care provided by persons acting under the direction of a person to whom paragraph (a) or (b) applies.</P>
    <P>I had presumed that opticians and optometrists would be allowed to use these drugs in their own private facilities and that they were not under the direction of anyone, although a general practitioner or schools officer may have referred the patient. Will the GP or schools officer then be liable? Is this to be put into the regulations? It is not mentioned here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the worry. Will the person who refers a person to a private contractor be liable? The legal liability cover of these people, as the Minister knows, is not very high. They are to take on a whole new area in which there could be a clinical claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see that. Before Report Stage, would it be possible to find out the provisions of legal coverage? I have failed to find this out. This is important because we are now allowing for drugs where, for example, there may be a corneal tear. It is very easy to tear the cornea using a tonometer. It is always a problem and is one of the things that the defence unions will admit they come across from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" />The next drug is cyclopentolate hydrochloride, which is a cycloplegic that acts on the muscle of the eye &ndash; importantly, the ciliary muscle. I have diagrams of cross-sections of the eye, for anyone who might like a copy, taken from Dr. Patrick Trevor-Roper's lecture notes on ophthalmology. It can be seen that the ciliary muscle is in the ciliary body and suspends the lens within the vitreous humour. This drug is totally different from tropicamide, which acts on the sphincter and dilator muscles of the iris, although they look similar. It is an important drug which is close in action and chemical composition to atropine and has similar side-effects. One of the problems is that these side-effects are frequently systemic.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Duane's Ophthalmology</i> describes the side-effects of cyclopentolate as &ldquo;Systemic toxicity induced by the ocular administration of cyclopentolate hydrochloride is similar to that produced by atropine, except that visual and tactile hallucinations are a more constant and striking feature of cyclopentolate toxicity.&rdquo; It is odd to propose to omit atropine from the provisions of the Bill, but to include another drug which causes side-effects of visual and tactile hallucinations. <i>Duane's</i> description also states:</P>
    <P>This is not surprising since cyclopentolate is structurally similar to atropine but contains a dimethylated side group also found in some tranquillisers and hallucinogenic drugs. CNS toxicity induced by cyclopentolate is especially prominent in children and the elderly. This seems to indicate that CNS immaturity or ageing is necessary for its potent psychotomimetic action to become manifest. As with atropine, there is increased incidence of systemic toxic reactions in children with brain damage. The peripheral signs and symptoms of cylopentolate toxicity are variable and frequently absent. Gastrointestinal toxicity consisting of ileus or gastroenteritis which has been observed with cyclopentolate concentrations of 0.5% or greater in pre-term infants due reduced gastric acid secretion and volume.</P>
    <P>The levels quoted are quite low. The description further states that:</P>
    <P>The onset of cyclopentolate toxicity occurs within 20 to 30 minutes of drug instillation and, although usually transient, the symptoms may last 12 to 24 hours. The treatment of systemic cyclopentolate poisoning is the same as for atropine poisoning.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why the Minister has decided not to allow the use of atropine and allow the use of this drug, even though a reputable medical text book says it has an even greater chance of causing serious systemic side-effects which are most likely to occur in children. It is not possible to refract a child's eye without the use of either atropine or cyclopentolate because <Col N="856" />one must relax the ciliary muscle to allow for the refraction.</P>
    <P>Children from well-baby clinics and school examination clinics are currently referred to a community ophthalmic practitioner. These are physicians trained in ophthalmology who, although not in a position to perform surgical treatment, can carry out a total medical examination of the eye, identify systemic disease and are experienced in how to deal with any side-effects that result from the administration of drugs. This is far more than simply an eye examination and the prescription of spectacles which, in any event, may not be the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of community ophthalmic practitioners and perhaps we should employ more. I am anxious that shortcuts may be taken and that children will be referred to optometrists. Optometrists are splendid in their own way, but children will not have as good an eye examination as they would if they had been referred to a community ophthalmic practitioner. It could easily happen that children will be referred to optometrists.</P>
    <P>I have grave concerns about the fact that these three potent drugs, particularly cyclopentolate &ndash; which appears to have more sustained side-effects than atropine &ndash; are being used. I did not mention the local side-effects of these drugs, one of which is acute glaucoma from raised intra-ocular pressure. It is not as though the people carrying out these examinations are badly trained;, it is that they are not trained in these specific areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that use of these drugs is allowed in England. There is a completely different system in that country for training optometrists, who have an extra intern year in hospital after training and a considerable amount of their training takes place in hospital. That does not happen here, although I am sure they are doing their job well. However, we are taking a dangerous shortcut in permitting the use of cyclopentolate because the only reason for it to be used is for the refraction of children's eyes in order that they can be prescribed glasses, which is not the case at present. I find it odd that the use of a drug which has more serious side-effects than atropine &ndash; as this reputable text book from which I quoted states &ndash; will be allowed, while the use of atropine will not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect there is no one in the House, including the Minister, who can argue with Senator Henry on the technicalities of this matter. The experience in dealing with any substance which is potentially harmful or toxic is that the people who are least well trained are those who are the most casual. It is a well-documented fact that there are fewer explosions during the off-loading of crude oil at a refinery because the staff there are far better trained and have a greater respect for it. The disaster at Bantry was unsurprising because of the lack of skill available <Col N="857" />there. All my professional training suggests that the people to whom one must give the most training in terms of being careful with potentially hazardous substances are those who are least qualified and most likely to take shortcuts, whereas the best trained will meticulously observe the letter of good practice because they know better. It is interesting to watch the reactions of people to an exposure to H2S. People who are professionally qualified are wary because they know how toxic it is, while those who are not will regard it as funny because it smells of rotten eggs.</P>
      <P>The point Senator Henry made &ndash; she was not scaremongering &ndash; is that the administration of a potentially toxic drug needs to be under the control of people who have the training and skill to treat the substance with the appropriate degree of respect and care. I am always concerned where people are using one, two or three substances because familiarity with their use can have the opposite effect to that intended. They will tend to take them for granted because they are so familiar with them. One needs the extra training because there are few materials which are not potentially hazardous. The first rule I teach my students is that, if something is neither air nor water, they should neither breathe nor touch it. The first principle is to avoid exposure to any substance. The only good practice is to treat everything as if it is potentially hazardous.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry made a convincing case that at least one of the three substances to which the Bill refers is harmful and we need to be careful with it. This issue deserves a lot more thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was here last, I made the point that the Bill was not the legislative mechanism through which the three named drugs would be allowed; they would be allowed through amendments to medicinal regulations. The Bill removes the absolute prohibition on the utilisation of some drugs by optometrists included in the parent Act.</P>
      <P>From the outset we recognised that unanimity on the issue of the use of drugs by optometrists would be difficult to achieve. There has been much consultation and discussion on the issue, both with the Opticians Board and the College of Ophthalmologists. While considerable ground was given during the consultations, this has not been acknowledged &ndash; even by the groups involved. There are those who believe we should have a restrictive approach and those who want to see an even more liberal approach. While we have attempted to achieve a balance, it has not been easy given the strong positions taken by both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Senators welcomed the amendments to section 48 of the principal Act during Second Stage. This section concerns the provision of treatment and the prescribing and administration of drugs. The Bill achieves a satisfactory balance in this area in allowing optometrists carry out their professional function while stopping short of <Col N="858" />facilitating medical treatment by them of an injury or disease of the eye. The Senator made the point that the impression may be given but the Act is very specific in forbidding and prohibiting optometrists from attempting to make a medical diagnosis. It places an obligation on them to refer any problems to an ophthalmologist for the disease to be treated. This will be enforced by Government amendment No. 6 arising from the consultations in which I engaged before Second Stage with the college to make sure, ar eagla na heagla, there would not be any doubt about the matter. There cannot be any suggestion that the Bill facilitates the treatment of medical conditions pertaining to the eye by optometrists.</P>
    <P>The Senator quoted section 12, which is quite specific:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) A registered optician who is not a registered medical practitioner shall not suggest by any written or oral statement or by any action that the registered optician has made or is capable of making a medical diagnosis of a disease of the eye or that, in relation to the treatment of the eyes, the registered optician has done or is capable of doing anything other than&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) in the case of a registered optometrist, the prescribing or provision of spectacles, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) in the case of a registered dispensing optician, the provision of spectacles.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) inserting the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Where in the course of an eye examination or treatment of the eye, a registered optician referred to in subsection (1) suspects the presence of a disease or condition of the eye, the registered optician shall inform the patient of this and recommend that the patient consult with a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The lines of demarcation legally drawn are clear. They outline what an optometrist is legally obliged to do in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>This legislation is 30 years in the making and this dispute over the utilisation of drugs or whether spectacles are required has been ongoing for some time between both professional groups. The journal of the British College of Optometrists states:</P>
    <P>Cyclopentolate is the cycloplegic most frequently used in optometric practice and, in all but those situations where complete cycloplegia is required, it is probably the nearest approach to the ideal . Cyclopentolate does not have the toxic potential of atropine, particularly as it is not normally used at home. There have, however, been reports of CNS disturbances . following the instillation of cyclopentolate drops. This temporary disturbance, which recovers in a few hours with no apparent lasting effects, has usually been associated with <Col N="859" />the use of higher concentrations (2%) than normally employed.</P>
    <P>Allergic responses to cyclopentolate are even less common than to atropine and cyclopentolate may be used in patients who are allergic to atropine . The risk of a rise in intraocular pressure following the use of cyclopentolate is lower than with atropine because of the less drastic effects and the shorter duration of action. It is also easier to reverse the effects of cyclopentolate if this is thought to be desirable.</P>
    <P>Cyclopentolate is used in older children (over 6 years) at 1% and in young adults (over 15-16 years) and older patients in whom a cycloplegic is felt desirable at 0.5% (or 1% if the irides are very dark).</P>
    <P>The drugs in question are widely used in Britain where the authorities are going further than we are and recommending the use of drugs for therapeutic purposes. The Irish College of Ophthalmologists takes a different view to the British College of Ophthalmologists. If Senators excuse the pun, they do not see eye to eye on the utilisation of these drugs. While I accept Senator Henry's concerns, we have reached a reasonable balance in trying to bring the legislation in tune with current optometry norms.</P>
    <P>I have been told anecdotally that drops are used and people ask me what the fuss is about. We are bringing the legislation up to date. There is no provision being made for optometrists to engage in medical diagnosis. After the Bill is passed, there may be a case for the Opticians Board to present to the public what is and is not allowed in order that there are no illusions or no false impressions are given. People may think they are getting a full medical examination from an optician but the Bill does not go anywhere near suggesting this. It is erroneous to suggest that it does. Its presentation subsequent to its enactment regarding what optometrists are entitled to do should be done clearly and publicly. The Department may take a role in this.</P>

Surely some of its provisions could be brought into force within a guaranteed timeframe of anywhere from three months to a year. I do not hold with the practice of not laying down time limits for fear something might happen. The Houses of the Oireachtas will have debated the legislation at length. In that context, surely the sections dealing with reading glasses could be subject to a more rigid timescale. This open-ended provision is bad practice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 34, after &ldquo;2000&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided that an environmental impact statement for the purposes of this Act shall be carried out by a person who does not benefit financially from the approval of the project to which it relates&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many Members have read environmental impact statements. I have read too many and have become increasingly sceptical because I have never read one that found that a project would harm the environment. I am a little sceptical about the fact that every project turns out to be of minimum impact, because human activity has an impact on the environment.</P>
      <P>In my unfortunate absence from the House from 1992 to 1997, I did a great deal of work with the clean technology centre in Cork Institute of Technology. During that time I spoke to people from overseas, many of whom suggested that an EIS should be carried out by someone who does not stand to benefit financially from a positive outcome to the project. Most of the environmental impact statements I have read have been written by the consulting engineers for the project. I do not suggest for one second that people are being bought off. It is never as simple as that, but their perceptions and judgments, the weight they give to various factors and the way they present matters are invariably affected by their view of the project.</P>
      <P>The profession of which I am a member is full of people of integrity who would not take on projects if they believed they were not ethically acceptable. I am sure there are exceptions, as there are in all professions. That said, if there is a requirement for an environmental impact statement, the sensible approach is to require it to be done by an individual or body who, as our amendment suggests, does not stand to benefit financially from the approval of the project to which it relates. I am happy to leave the detail of how this should be worded to Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have deliberately tabled the amendment to invite the Minister to reflect on this issue. One of the problems in terms of environmental protec<Col N="865" />tion is a huge belief on the part of the people that they are being codded. This is commonplace in communities because of the rapid increase in public access to scientific and technological information. Every argument on one side of a debate on, for example, incineration will be responded to promptly by others with information hot off the presses, and to the best of my knowledge, some of the information on both sides is distorted.</P>
    <P>It is often interesting to go back to the original source of much that is quoted. Regardless of the side of the argument quoted, the actual scientific paper is generally more nuanced. The universal statement at the end of all research papers is that more research is needed. Researchers stay in business by always recommending more research. It would be useful to encourage independence in the preparation of environmental impact statements. I take the opportunity presented by this Bill and its strange collection of unrelated items &ndash; although that is a separate issue &ndash; to suggest this to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of background, I have carefully studied all the amendments carefully, some of which will help to improve the Bill. The environmental impact statement is, first, a statement. The assessment is by the authorities and the public which I know can be very subjective. I agree with the Senator in many respects. If there are ten lawyers in a room, they will give ten opinions different from the one the client wants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to have some basis for operation, good organisations to deal with it and very good transparency. Other EU member states have the same issues in addressing this. The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 set out the detailed provisions in relation to environmental impact statements and are based on the requirements in EU Directive 85/337/EEC, as amended, which provides that a developer should supply the relevant information to the consent authority which carries out the assessment, as does the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning authority, either the local authority or An Bord Pleanála, in the case of an appeal, is required to consider the adequacy of an EIS. Where it decides that an EIS is inadequate, it must ensure it is supplemented by further information. We are all aware of cases where this has happened. In addition, under Article 14.2(<i>a</i>) of the 1994 EPA licensing regulations, the EPA is required to consider the adequacy of an EIS in so <Col N="866" />far as environmental aspects of the activity are concerned. Where the agency considers an EIS to be inadequate, it can, like the planning authority and An Bord Pleanála, require further information. The adequacy of an EIS in relation to an IPPC licensable activity is, therefore, open to scrutiny by the local authority, An Bord Pleanála and the EPA as well as by the public as part of the decision making process. On that basis, I do not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give an example of what developers can do. The issue of noise arose on a project around Cork Harbour. A background test and an assessment of the increased level of night-time noise were carried out. The noise level was said to increase from 14 to 15 decibels, which sounded like a minuscule amount. However, the scale is log long which means 15 decibels is ten times higher than 14. Neither was that critical and it has not caused a huge problem but they omitted to refer in the EIS to the fact that the scale was log long and that one increment actually represented a tenfold increase in the same way that the Richter scale for earthquakes is log long. Therefore, a Richter scale measurement of 8 is ten times larger than a Richter scale measurement of 7. That sort of judgment will be nuanced when the person giving it is in the employ of the developer. When I spotted this in the particular case, I noted that they were telling the truth but that it was nuanced.</P>
      <P>The problem arises where a local authority is the planning authority and in favour of a particular development, to which there are local objections. Can I mention Carrickmines Castle without causing enormous repercussions? I do not want to talk about the particular case which is before the courts. However, in such a project how can people be happy that there is an element of independence in the evaluation of the impact on the environment if, for instance, the local authority is in favour of what is happening? </P>
      <P>While he Minister will not accept my amendment, he has responded reasonably to it. I will find other fora in which to pursue it.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 13, after &ldquo;2000&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided that an activity which is an established activity pursuant to this definition shall cease to be an established activity on the fifth anniversary of the enactment of the <i>Protection of the Environment Act 2003</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be argued that established activities would have a competitive advantage if they were allowed to operate to lower standards indefinitely. The details of this amendment do not matter. I will not say traditional industries get away with murder. However, there is a town with a meat factory through which I drive when coming <Col N="867" />to Dublin from Cork. On certain days of the week one would know it had a meat factory but nobody objects because it has been there for years. I am a chemical engineer and know that if a pharmaceutical plant was opened there which emitted a whiff of a smell on one day, the whole place would be up in arms. There are traditional and untraditional smells.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows better than I that an enormous amount of the damage to our water is caused by urbanisation, agriculture or some of the more traditional industries. Waste from a milk plant can do enormous damage to our rivers but most think a milk plant could not do much harm. Many believe the computer industry is clean but Silicon Valley is probably the most polluted ground in the United States from post-production waste. I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts about how established industries can be chivvied up to meet the same standards over a period of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between the Senator's view and mine on this issue. His amendment would come into effect five years from now in 2008. In the Bill I propose a much shorter timeframe up to 2007. The IPPC directive provides that established activities must be IPPC licensed by October 2007. The Bill provides for this deadline to be met in two ways. Established activities are newly licensable by virtue of the directive. The power given to the Minister in section 82(4) of the Bill to make orders to bring established activities into the licensing net will be used to achieve a target date of October 2007. This will be done in an orderly, phased manner, as was done in the 1990s when IPC licensing was successfully introduced.</P>
      <P>Subsections (10) and (11) of section 82 require that as regards established activities in respect of which licences are already enforced under the 1992 Act, those licences will be examined by the EPA for compliance with the directive and the agency will take appropriate action to ensure full compliance in that regard by October 2007. This action can include carrying out a review of the licence, which the EPA is mandated to do, amending its conditions or declaring in writing that no further action is required. There will be differences among the licences, probably on account of some of the more traditional activities in which some companies may have been engaged.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as drafted, would ensure that the benefits which accrue from being an established activity in terms of the phasing in of licensing will end earlier than is proposed in the amendment. The proposed amendment is not necessary. Perhaps the Senator wanted to tease out the issue.</P>

      <Col N="868" />Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not one of the sections on which there is considerable argument. It states: &ldquo;&lsquo;emission limit value' means the mass, expressed in terms of a specific parameter, concentration or level of an emission, or both a specific concentration and level of an emission, which may not be exceeded during one or more periods of time:&rdquo;. I cannot follow this definition. A mass expressed as a concentration is incorrect technically. Generally, one expresses a mass as a level, not a concentration.</P>
      <P>I do not want to play &ldquo;I know more than you&rdquo; games as I probably do not. However, unless the definition has been transposed from an EU directive, in which case we would be stuck with it, it should be examined by somebody with a reasonable degree of technical skill. While the phraseology appears to be poor, it is possible that it is long established. Even if that is the case, it deserves to be examined, given that a mass expressed in terms of a specific concentration is meaningless. Either one has a mass or a concentration. While a concentration can be used to determine a mass, a mass cannot be expressed in terms of a concentration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being facetious. I take the Senator's point on the Bill's definition of an emission limit value. The EPA will be required under the new Part IV to include emission limit values in IPPC licensing conditions. In practice, the EPA is generally doing this already. Obviously, therefore, it has a measuring system available to it. We could insert a more intelligible definition only to find ourselves out of step with the EU directive.</P>

    <P>In page 12, to delete all words from and <Col N="869" />including &ldquo;which&rdquo; in line 43, down to and including &ldquo;whole&rdquo; in line 49.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleagues that the Bill is extremely technical. Several of its provisions are sources of serious concern to both myself and my party. The Bill merits detailed discussion and should be considered by a technical committee before it proceeds.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes the deletion of part of the section because it contains a considerable amount of waffle. Reference was made to simple language earlier. Simpler language would make for better law. The lines in question are unnecessary as they are complicated and repetitive and I ask the Minister to consider their deletion.</P>

      <P>During Second Stage and in conversation with colleagues before coming to the House today, I pointed out that this is a very technical Bill. By its nature, some of its language is technical. In fairness to the officials who drafted the text, they endeavoured to make it as understandable as possible. Committee Stage provides us with an opportunity to tease out issues to help us understand the Bill.</P>
      <P>In tabling the amendment, I am sure the Senator was not aware of some of the consequences of his proposal. As proposed, the amendment is not appropriate as it would go far beyond the intention of the directive as it will be applied in the other EU member states. I repeat that the legislation needs to be consistent with the directive and the legislation introduced by other member states. In other words, we should act in a manner consistent with what is happening in all other member states and should not do anything which would make it more difficult to operate and meet the terms of the directive.</P>
      <P>The amendment would link BAT, the most up-to-date technology, irrespective of whether it was practical. It would not achieve a proper balance between environmental protection, which is my aim, and what is economically and technically feasible. We have got this balance wrong in the past. My officials and I have given much thought to ensuring that in striving to ensure we introduce the best available technologies, which is a major innovation in the Bill, we also take economic considerations into account. The definition of BAT for the purposes of integrated pollution prevention and control is set out in Article 2.11 of the directive and is reproduced in the Bill. We should follow this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A close reading of the amendment also makes it clear that, if accepted, it would undermine BAT for the purposes of the IPPC system. It would remove all references to the primary aim of applying BAT, that is, for the purpose of preventing, eliminating or reducing emissions and their impact on the environment as a whole. This is the core intention of the section, which strikes a reasonable balance. The legislation is completely consistent with the terms of the directive, which <Col N="870" />it transposes in a manner that makes our position consistent with those of other EU member states.</P>

      <P>I raised this issue on Second Stage. I cannot agree with Senator Bannon. We have to have regard to cost. The original BATNEEC referred to &ldquo;not excessive costs&rdquo;, which was used as an opt-out, certainly by local authorities at some points. I refer, for example, to the pollution of the River Liffey by sewage treatment plants. That reference was used as a type of refuge or an excuse for not doing something that should have been done.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke earlier about the type of technology used and I agree with him in that regard. This provision cannot be open-ended. We cannot say that there cannot be some regard for costs. Perhaps I am doing Senator Bannon a disservice, but nobody would say we should tell farmers that they must install a pollution control system which will be so expensive that it will put them out of business. It would be better not to have the activity rather than adopt that attitude.</P>
      <P>The proposed new section 5(2)(<i>b</i>), to be inserted in the 1992 Act, refers to &ldquo;taking into consideration the costs and advantages, whether or not the techniques are used or produced within the State&rdquo;. I am not sure about the distinction between where we are now and where we were with BATNEEC. We now have best available technology, but previously we had best available technology at not excessive cost. We still have regard to cost in the Bill and I am not clear on the distinction or how this is more or less restrictive than what existed previously. I would be grateful if the Minister would illuminate that area for me because I am somewhat confused about it.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis and Senator Bannon made good points, but we have gone quite far already in examining costs because the term <Col N="871" />&ldquo;under economically and technically viable conditions&rdquo; is used in the Bill. Do we need to insert another reference to costs? As is often the case, people constantly plead costs. The Bill refers to the techniques being reasonably accessible, but something that is enormously expensive could not be described in that manner. The Minister could consider telling people that if something is expensive, they do not have to get it. However, it could be desperately important that they do obtain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the thrust of Senator Bannon's amendment and I appreciate his intention with regard to the environment. Senator Dardis hit the nail on the head and almost answered the question he posed. I want to be absolutely consistent with the directive because I want to maintain the competitiveness of our economy against those of our European partners. We would all accept that European environmental standards are very high. That is something to which Ireland aspires and we will be supportive of that in our own role in developing these directives.</P>
      <P>Article 2.11 of the IPPC directive provides the definition of available techniques. The definition makes it clear that costs of techniques should be taken into account in the determination of BAT, and this is also repeated in annex 4 of the directive. I made the point that if we do not follow the directive we will force applicants and holders of IPPC and waste licences to apply best available technologies, irrespective of cost. That could not be allowed to happen because it would have significant effects on the ability of Irish industry to compete and would ultimately lead to job losses and to industries relocating out of Ireland to other European countries. We need a balanced approach to environmental protection. We must strive for high environmental standards and the Bill's provisions &ndash; some would say they go too far &ndash; make significant progress in this regard. We must also have regard for the economic reality in the marketplace, however, and the need for a level playing field across the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis is correct. We are moving from BATNEEC to BAT &ndash; best available techniques &ndash; but that will not result in a major change for Irish industry in terms of the way it operates currently. BAT demands a high general level of protection for the environment as a whole and there can be no question of sacrificing environmental quality, but regard must also be had of what is economically and technically feasible. It is a balance in the language which recognises that there are difficult issues to resolve between the environment and what is economically viable, but BAT states that one must start with the best available technologies in the area. That would be the criteria applied. However, as in the example given by the Senator, one could introduce a state-<Col N="872" />of-the-art environmental pollution system costing &euro;10 million although we could not expect every farmer to put it in place on their farms.</P>
    <P>We must take account of the environmental area in which the activity is taking place. Local environment conditions and geographical location must also be considered. Other areas are reasonably well defined and will ensure that what is required in terms of best available technology is feasible and will do the same environmental job. In another area, that particular system may not be good enough so there is a balance between the two.</P>

      <P>In page 15, paragraph (<i>a</i>), line 4, after section to insert &ldquo;3B or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The proposed new section 3B allows the Minister to amend the First Schedule to the Act in certain circumstances. The approval of the Oireachtas should be required where such a wide power is conferred, rather than, as proposed in the Bill, simply informing it of that conferral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this amendment it might be helpful for Senators if I outline the background to the proposed new section 3B. Section 7 of the 1992 Act enables the Minister to amend the First Schedule to the Act, which con<Col N="873" />tains details of the activities to be licensed and their thresholds. This can only be done, however, after positive resolution of both Houses. The new section 3B, therefore, is designed to bring a small and limited level of flexibility into the system. It empowers the Minister, in certain specified circumstances, to make regulations, should the need arise in future, to further amend the First Schedule to the Act of 1992 without a positive resolution of both Houses.</P>
      <P>It is important that I set out these limited circumstances for the Senators. They are: in paragraph (<i>a</i>), the adoption of an Act by the European Communities that would render the operation of the Schedule and section 82 non-compliant with that Act &ndash; an EU requirement, which must be complied with in this regard, would, in any event, have already been subjected to the new Oireachtas scrutiny arrangements; and, in paragraph (<i>b</i>), the making of an amendment which would not involve any deviation from the principles or policies of the Schedule and section 82. Here we are talking about technical adjustments and corrections which must be consistent with the decisions of the Oireachtas as set out in the Schedule to the Bill, which we will consider later.</P>
      <P>Section 3B gives the Minister a limited and reasonable power to amend the Schedule. All other cases of amendment would require a positive resolution of both Houses. I am advised by the Attorney General's office that the proposed section does not involve an unauthorised delegation of power to a Minister. It gives a reasonable level of flexibility and accordingly I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I propose to bring the date back to 2005 because there is plenty of time to deal with this. Line 6, page 16, refers to activities commencing on or after 30 October 1999, so we are halfway through and there are no benefits in extending the time to 2007.</P>

      <P>This amendment goes back to the first discussion on this issue I had with Senator Ryan, though Senator Bannon is coming at this in a different way. I cannot accept the amendment because Article 5.1 of the directive requires that all established activities operate in accordance with the directive not later than eight years after the directive comes into effect. This period expires on 30 October 2007 and the provisions of the Bill will ensure that that deadline is met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should remember that we in Ireland have <Col N="875" />had integrated pollution control licensing since 1994. We are ahead of most, if not all, EU member states in this area and we should remind ourselves of that. This subsection does not refer to the licensing of activities which are not already covered by the IPC regime but the date by which the existing integrated pollution control licences in Ireland are examined to ensure they are fully compliant with the IPPC directive. I do not doubt many of those will be found to be already fully compliant. We are well ahead of the game and it is neither necessary nor desirable to go further ahead at this stage. Shortening the period as proposed could potentially divert attention and resources from bringing activities into the licensing system which are not already licensed but which must be licensed under the directive. Those are the ones we need to get in place and that is likely to be the greater priority in the interests of environmental protection.</P>

      <P>I tabled this amendment because while I realise the definition of a waste management plan includes a hazardous waste management plan, it might be wiser to separate them in the context of the Bill. As far as I am aware, a hazardous waste management plan is monitored all over the Republic by the EPA, while waste management plans come under the county councils. This amendment seeks to put greater emphasis on the hazardous waste management plan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be at cross purposes. This amendment makes a point already covered by the Bill. The definition of a waste management plan is in section 5, page 10, line 18, and includes a hazardous waste management plan. Such a plan will be taken into account when licence applications are considered, along with waste quality, water quality and other waste management plans. The proposed amendment therefore provides no additional benefit to the Bill and the point made is already included in the Bill. I know it is complicated.</P>

      <P>It is not feasible for me to accept this amendment, although I appreciate the Senator's thinking. As the text stands, it is clear the EPA must be satisfied that emissions will not contravene standards for effluents or their treatment, which may be prescribed under section 26 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977.</P>
      <P>Adding the words proposed may appear to the casual reader to give added emphasis, which is what the Senator is clearly trying to do, to the nature of the effluents concerned. However, we must deal with legalities in drafting legislation and the amendment adds nothing in a legal sense to the current text. Regulations under the relevant section of the 1977 Act were made in 2001, covering 14 dangerous substances likely to be of significant risk to health or the environment. Those include pesticides, solvents and metals with toxic, persistent or biocumulative effects.</P>

That might be a <Col N="877" />desirable objective, in principle, but in practical terms it is a non-runner. The title of the IPPC directive mentions pollution prevention and control. There is, therefore, an implied recognition that there will be emissions and that we must control them. There is an implicit recognition that all processes produce emissions in one form or another.</P>
      <P>The objective of public policy, through the application of BAT and other measures in the Bill, is to prevent or eliminate emissions, where possible and, if that is not possible, to ensure they are effectively controlled to protect and enhance the environment.

This would be totally ineffective in the case of corporate bodies where persons other than the applicant companies, be they directors, the company secretary, managers or similar officers, effectively are in control of the operation. That is the point Senator Henry is making. The Waste Management Act 1996 has an identical provision on fit and proper persons and <Col N="878" />regulations under that Act ensure corporate bodies are adequately dealt with.

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 32, line 35, after &ldquo;area&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or neighbouring counties with jurisdiction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A person can be on the border of a county which the functional area should recognise. The Bill states &ldquo;a planning authority in whose functional area the activity is or will be&rdquo;. As a problem could arise in a neighbouring county, it is important that the affected local authority can act in such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this amendment we should be clear about the purpose of the relevant subsection. The requirement on the applicant to notify the planning authority in the functional area in which the development will be located is to ensure the authority is aware of all development proposals in its area and the possible implications for development control. This is consistent with section 91(6) of the Bill under which the authority must maintain a register on IPPC activities in its area.</P>
      <P>The notification is not for the purpose of advising about any possible emissions from the activity. This is because the planning authority is precluded under section 99F of the Bill from placing conditions relating to emissions in a planning permission for an IPPC licensable activity. IPPC licences deal with emissions from activities across whatever local authority areas might be affected and the EPA is the designated national authority to control and regulate such emissions. The point made by the Senator is dealt with by the EPA and does not take into account any particular local area but deals with it across the spectrum.</P>
      <P>The notice provisions contained in the subsection, which are supported by regulations which require site notices and publication of a notice in a newspaper circulating in the district in which the activity will be carried on, provide adequate notice of IPPC proposals to interested parties. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The intention is laudable. It would be desirable that other local authority areas would be cognisant of the potential for pollution that might impinge on them but there would be a huge knock-on effect if the amendment was accepted. It could logically be argued that if a person was applying for planning permission for a house bordering a neighbouring local authority area, there would be an obligation on him or her to apply for planning permission in two areas. The amendment could be extended to apply to other activities which would not make sense. The <Col N="879" />subsection only deals with the activity, not its effects. If the local authority in Kildare discharges sewage into the River Liffey and it eventually reaches Dublin, there is nothing to preclude action by Dublin or the EPA against Kildare to stop the activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point made by Senator Dardis. If an activity is confined to a particular local authority area, one should apply to that authority. In relation to waste management plans, regions have been established already. I live in the area subject to the Connacht waste management plan, to which the EPA has agreed. I accept that regional plans are a good idea but, in relation to activity, I understood that applications should be made to the relevant local authority or authorities, as the case may be. That is my understanding of the Minister's comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be argumentative and I understand precisely the point Senator Bannon has made. However, the IPPC licensing process has nothing to do with the application to the planning authority, which is a separate issue. The matter to which the Senator referred is dealt with by the EPA, which is not concerned with the planning boundaries but may look across the entire country if it wishes. The Senator's amendment is directed at the wrong target by referring to the planning authority, which does not deal with the issue. The EPA, which deals with that issue, does not have a jurisdiction in terms of a local planning authority area.</P>

      <P>I am against the concept of absolute discretion. I believe it creates bad law and results in absolutist decision-making. It is relevant to recall Lord Acton's letter to Bishop Creighton in which he said that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. I regard this as an important issue and I hope the Minister will take my amendment on board. I am not suggesting that every time an organisation refuses an oral hearing, it should be dragged through the courts. I sympathise with the EPA in this regard but I also feel it should act reasonably, as every other organisation is required to do. I hope the Minister will see the logic of this amendment and accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with this amendment in two ways. The Senator's proposed wording is not as clear as the text of the Bill, which is far more definitive. There is also a value in maintaining consistency between the IPPC and waste codes. The &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; in the Bill mirrors exactly the provision in section 42(11) of the Waste Management Act 1996 in relation to a decision on the holding of an oral hearing concerning a waste licence. I propose to maintain consistency rather than the approach suggested in the amendment. However, I am giving new powers in the Bill for people to request oral hearings and strengthening the entire oral hearing process.</P>
      <P>The Bill has to be seen in the round, in terms of maintaining consistency. The Senator's amendment seeks to change a permissive power for the EPA to hold an oral hearing, &ldquo;shall have an absolute discretion&rdquo;, to another permissive power, &ldquo;may have a discretion&rdquo;. I am maintaining consistency but, in another part of the Bill, I am bringing in new powers whereby people will have the right to request an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Senator's concern in that I am aware there has been much unnecessary frustration due to the fact that people cannot get an oral hearing. That can lead to a great deal of suspicion, uncertainty, misgivings, misunderstandings and loss of emotional energy when people do not understand the process and are not satisfied there is full transparency in the system. In the overall context of the Bill, I am in agreement with the Senator's position and additional powers are <Col N="881" />being introduced, but in this particular section I am maintaining consistency between the various legislative codes.</P>

      <P>In page 35, line 9, after &ldquo;decision&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and of the reasons for the decision&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When the EPA refuses to hold an oral hearing, it should give its reasons in the interest of proper administration, among other considerations. For example, if an applicant is refused planning permission for a dwelling, a fairly detailed letter of explanation is issued by the planning authority. People expect that level of transparency and accountability. My amendment is intended as an avenue of such transparency and accountability and I hope the Minister will accept it on that basis.</P>
      <P>In relation to the new section 87(10), the time for challenge runs from the date on which the decision is made to refuse a licence. While I did not put down a formal amendment in that regard, I suggest to the Minister that the period should run from the date on which the decision is notified. I hope he will consider that as well as my amendment with regard to giving clear and explicit reasons.</P>

      <P>The licence should be given within a period and that period should be stated after an oral hearing. This is a delaying tactic. It is important to specify a period when the licence will be given. I suggest that it be given within three months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are already various provisions, in both the 1992 Act and the 1994 licensing regulations made under that Act, which put time limits on various aspects of the licensing process. These include, under section 87(3) of the new Part IV, an eight-week time limit on the EPA to issue a proposed determination from the date of receipt of all relevant information. This is extendable only with the agreement of the applicant.</P>
      <P>Under the 1994 licensing regulations, there is a four-month time limit on the EPA to issue a final decision where objections are received, starting at the end of the period for objections. These can be extended in complex cases by the agency.</P>
      <P>Analysis of the agency's performance in 2001, the latest year for which full information is available, showed compliance with the statutory obligations in terms of processing applications. Delays in processing licences occur in the supply, by applicants, of all information necessary to assess their proposals fully.</P>
      <P>The agency receives licence applications which often involve considerable technical complexity, public interest and importance for the environment. These considerations must be balanced against the need for an efficient decision-making process. The current legislative framework provides this balance. Accordingly I do not propose to accept the amendment for the outlined reasons, which are more than fair and working well.</P>

For far too long we have seen delays in several areas of Government such as in that of grants, particularly in the agricultural area. For example, a charter of rights for farmers was introduced and that has been flouted on several <Col N="883" />occasions. When the Minister provides for a time limit people can get into that mindset.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated that consideration by a planning authority of an application is generally limited to eight weeks, etc., but there should be a defined time limit. Perhaps three months would be appropriate. It should be looked at within a particular period.</P>

All the latest available data indicate that where there are limits they are working well.</P>
      <P>We should also bear in mind that an applicant must co-operate in the process. Many of the delays are in the getting and the assembling of information, but by and large this is working. If I must come back at some stage in the future on the basis of its not working, I will do so. There are time limits under other Acts already in place and we should encourage people to continue in that process.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get everybody tied up in a bureaucracy where the date then suddenly becomes everything. That would lead to the High Court because somebody did not comply by the date, leading to another area of appeal.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill states that the agency may periodically <Col N="885" />review a licence, etc. I feel, in the interests of safety and of protecting the environment, that a licence should be reviewed at any time but my amendment shortens the period from three years to two years. That is reasonable. The Bill provides that it shall do so periodically. Perhaps the Minister should consider reducing the period to two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have moved to meet some of the Senator's concerns but I do not believe it would be right to bring the period of review of licences from a minimum of three years to one of every two years, even, for example, where there is no change in the level of emissions from the activity or where the available technology to deal with these emissions has not advanced.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (<i>a</i>) of section 90(1), which is the main provision we are discussing, is expressly subject to subsections (4) and (5). These subsections set out extensive mandatory and discretionary circumstances in which a licence may be reviewed earlier than the three year period.</P>
      <P>Licence review is an important and demanding process and should not be undertaken unless needed at the particular point in time. Otherwise resources will be diverted from priority tasks. The section already provides strong, and I might suggest robust, arrangements for review of licences as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if there is a major advance in technology, that would be one area. If something is wrong in terms of the operation of the licence and there is unsatisfactory application of the licence, that would be another reason. Some other possible reasons include changes in BAT which make it possible to reduce emissions further; questions of operational safety; a review is required due to any Act adopted by an institution of the European Community; and emissions from the activity are deemed to be of such significance that existing emission limit values, parameters or technical measures need to be reviewed. There is plenty of scope and it does happen. I do not want to reduce the time limit because that will clog up the system. A limited number of technical experts are available, so three years is fairer and more manageable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator and I are on the same wavelength in trying to make sure we do the best we can with the legislation. However, we also need to be practical. The application of BAT to control and limit emissions is itself a demanding standard, requiring a high general level of protection for the environment as a whole, and the effect of the proposed amendment would be to require reviews of licences whenever there is an updating of BAT, rather than when there is a substantial change in its requirements. This would be unreasonable and could impose an undue burden on industry. Moreover, the wording &ldquo;substantial changes&rdquo; in this section comes from Article 13 of the IPPC directive and will also apply in the other member states, so I am also maintaining consistency.</P>
      <P>It is preferable that those changes arising from updating of BAT which are not substantial in nature are made in the course of the scheduled reviews of licences already provided for in the proposed new section 90(1). For those reasons and for the sake of consistency among member states in the implementation of these important directives &ndash; this is important for Ireland in terms of competitiveness &ndash; I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>We should not depart from the terms of the IPPC directive. I am maintaining consistency in that area. The existing text of the Bill provides a balanced approach and if significant reductions in emissions can be achieved without imposing excessive costs, the EPA should be required to initiate the review and, on foot of that, make the appropriate changes in the licence. I do not agree, however, that it is reasonable to impose a requirement on industry which would give rise to costs disproportionate to the benefits likely to accrue. That would be the effect of the Senator's proposal. Moreover, the wording in this subsection comes from Article 13 of the directive and will also apply in other member states. It is important to maintain consistency. It is preferable, therefore, that the qualification be retained. <Col N="887" />If the costs are excessive they should not be incurred.</P>

      <P>This proposal would delete a provision that was included in section 91(1) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 at the outset. By deleting the words proposed by the Senator, we could be ensuring that a new licence is required every time there is a change of ownership even if there is no change in the operating circumstances of the activity. This seems to be unnecessarily bureaucratic and costly for all concerned, namely, the EPA, the industry and other interested parties. It is important, however, that there is control over to whom the licence is passed, hence the new section 94, which deals with the transfer of licences. The Senator's point may be more fully dealt with in that section. It would not be right, therefore, to accept the proposed amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed new section 95(1) states that &ldquo;A licence or a revised licence granted under this <Col N="888" />part may be surrendered by the licensee .&rdquo;. I propose to insert the words to which the amendment refers because a person could surrender his or her licence while going through the courts. This should not be allowed. Often a person will relinquish a licence if it means he or she can avoid appearing in the courts or can state in court that he or she does not have the licence, which results in the case's being thrown out. This is an important amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 94 is a new provision, which introduces new controls on the surrender of IPPC licences. The original 1992 Act had no such provision. It is important that there are such controls and that they are exercised before a licence is surrendered. While I appreciate the thinking behind the proposed amendment, it would be wrong to include a provision that would effectively compel someone who has already been in breach of his or her responsibilities to the environment to remain in control of the site in perpetuity. It would be far better to do as is done in the section, which is to give the agency the power to carry out the necessary inspection, obtain information and monitor before making a full assessment of the condition of the site. If at that stage the agency is satisfied with the condition of the site, it will accept the surrender. We are actually achieving what the Senator wants.</P>

      <P>I can think of one example of which I have experience. A succession of attempts was made by the EPA and the local authority to try to control a certain activity that was taking place &ndash; to the extent of going to the High Court &ndash; but the limitations of the legal system were evident in terms of the person's being able to continue the activity. If the Senator's proposed words were added it would preclude the agency from dealing with somebody such as that, which it should be able to do. If a person has a bad record, even if he or she has not been convicted of an offence, it should be open to the agency to adjudicate in a case such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dardis is correct. The Bill goes further when it comes to illegal activities. Previously, if illegal activity was occurring, one had to prove to the High Court that this activity was causing pollution. Under the Bill, it is automatically deemed that pollution is occurring by virtue the fact that illegal activity is taking place. This shortens the process, dealing, to some extent, with the points raised by Senator Dardis.</P>

The EPA can make an assessment to see what has happened on the site and make determinations before the licence is surrendered, whereas there is no such provision in the 1992 Act.

Perhaps I am not getting through, even though I have repeated myself on numerous occasions, and Senator Dardis may have put it in more succinct terms. The criminal law deals with all sorts of activities in legislation. If people commit illegal acts, the criminal law is there to deal with them. The Bill identifies a weakness in the 1992 Act, which did not deal with this issue. I am providing a specific condition with regard to the surrender of an IPPC licence and that is an important step forward in protecting what we are trying to do. From time to time people will attempt to break the law, in which case the law will pursue them with all its armoury.</P>

      <P>This section is a new provision which introduces new controls on the surrender of an IPPC licence. The 1992 Act contained no such provision. As it is important that there are such controls and that they are used, I have provided accordingly in the Bill. After the necessary inspection, monitoring and assessment, the EPA is called on in subsection (7) to decide whether the relevant installation is causing or is likely to cause environmental pollution or whether the site is in a satisfactory state. This standard is the one set out in Article 3 of the IPPC directive. It will apply in all other EU member states. There is a similar wording in the new section 83(5)(<i>a</i>)(x) provided for on page 21 of the Bill in relation to measures to be taken on permanent cessation of the activity.

      <P>Section 90 of the new Part 4 deals comprehensively with the mandatory circumstances, from Article 13 of the directive, in which a licence must be reviewed. These circumstances, in section 90(4)(<i>a</i>), are as follows: if emissions from the activity are deemed to be of such significance that existing emission limit values, parameters or technical measures need to be reviewed; if substantial changes in BAT make it possible to reduce emissions significantly without imposing excessive costs; if the operational safety of the activity requires techniques other than those currently in use; if a review is required due to any act adopted by an institution of the European Communities or an agreement entered into by the State or an enactment passed since the licence was granted or reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 90 also generally restates the discretionary power of the agency contained in the 1992 Act to review a licence where there is a proposal for a substantial change to the emissions; where the condition of the environment or environmental medium in the area of the activity has substantially changed; or where new evidence has come to light or a new standard is prescribed in relation to the emission or its effects on the environment. While the EPA may well, at times, carry out reviews on foot of the circumstances <Col N="894" />listed in section 99E(5), paragraph (<i>c</i>), at other times, it may not.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>c</i>) contains an indicative list of circumstances in which a review might be required, but it is not designed to be definitive. It would be unwise to go beyond the mandatory circumstances in section 90 in which the reviews must be carried out and which reflect the terms of Article 13 of the IPPC directive. It is essential that full authority in relation to IPPC licensing and reviews remain with the EPA. I think we would all subscribe to that. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 86(1)(<i>b</i>)(vii) is more likely to impact upon and interfere with necessary commercial operations on a site than on emissions or environmental parameters. This subparagraph is quite unnecessary given the provisions already contained in sections 86(1)(<i>b</i>)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v). Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.

      <P>Anything we can do to improve the environment, be it by systems, standards, technology or activity is obviously important, as I am sure the Senator would agree. I wanted to give certainty and maintain continuity between the 1992 Act and this Bill. Areas of activity that should be in place or that are in fact happening are being added to legislation to give them certainty, but the changes are very marginal. These activities are already taking place in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We obviously want better environmental management systems. I was in one location recently looking at new state-of-the-art environmental-management systems from the perspective of a public authority. It was a water system in which water was being pumped from different areas of the county and in which each bore hole could be monitored individually. These types of management systems and information controls were not available in the past. I am simply updating legislation to take account of such developments. These developments are taking place as a matter <Col N="896" />of course but were not taken account of in the 1992 Act.</P>

I have provided, for instance, that there would be more access for the public to an oral hearing on a particular activity. If people require more information, it should be provided in a transparent way. Aside from this, however, the answer to the Senator's question is no.

      <P>Reference is made in this section to &ldquo;the prevention of danger to health or damage to property&rdquo;. This should also include streets and pavements because people who damage them in the course of their work often leave them in such a state that local authorities must repair them. The onus should be placed on the people who damaged the streets or pavements in the first instance and provision for this should be included in the Bill. Will the Minister consider including such a provision?</P>
      <P>The amendment is probably worded in a general manner, but it is important because it is on streets and pavements that the most damage is caused, usually by JCB diggers, etc. Such damage often creates problems for local authorities and has resulted in their being taken to court by people who have tripped on damaged pavements and so on. The onus should be on the person who damaged the pavement to replace or repair it. This should be included in the Bill because it is a grey area.</P>

      <P>I did not table this amendment because I favour any disrespect for the licences people may hold, but because it is a serious issue for a company to be cited in the Environmental Protection Agency book as not having complied with its licence. Should we try to make more of an effort to distinguish between serious contraventions of a licence &ndash; such as emissions from a factory or unit &ndash; and those of a technical nature? Perhaps that is already the case and the EPA examines seriously the nature of a licence contravention. For example, if it was a requirement in a licence to take samples from a river on 14 days and they were only taken on 12, that would not be the same as causing a major fish kill. Are all offences treated equally or does the EPA make a distinction when writing its reports? It is damaging for companies to be mentioned as having been in breach of their licences. That is why I tabled the amendment.</P>

      <P>Two issues have arisen in the application of this section. Having discovered an unauthorised waste disposal activity, it is incumbent on a local authority to undertake potentially time consuming and expensive investigations to establish the occurrence or risk of environmental pollution before legal proceedings can be initiated. Where such investigations have been undertaken, the District Court has not necessarily accepted that environmental pollution has occurred. This is particularly the case where construction and demolition waste is concerned. This waste does not generally contain organic or hazardous materials and is often regarded as inert.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" />Accordingly, the purpose of section 21(<i>b</i>) is to amend section 32(6) of the 1996 Act so that the onus is placed on a person alleged to have held, transported, recovered or disposed of waste &ndash; without requisite authorisation or in contravention of such authorisation &ndash; to establish that the activity concerned was not likely to cause environmental damage. We are switching the onus. I take the Senator's point, but discretion would obviously be exercised by the EPA.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 62, to delete lines 29 to 33.</P>
      <P>This part of the Bill proposes to reverse the Supreme Court decision in a case taken by a high profile member of Cork City Council, the judgment on which ruled that the local authority, irrespective of payment, had to collect waste. The amendment is clear in the sense that we, on this side of the House, are opposed to this. If the Supreme Court had adjudicated differently, I do not think we would be dealing with a proposal in the Bill to accommodate it. This is overkill. In the event of non-payment of refuse collection charges, managers have recourse through the courts. I hope the Minister will look favourably on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator knows, my position on this is pretty well defined. I do not propose to accept the amendment which, in effect, would require a local authority to continue to collect household waste from a person even when he or she fails to pay a relevant waste charge. In other words, people would subsidise their neighbours. Councillors from all political parties wanted this corrected as a result of the Supreme Court case referred to by the Senator. As there must be equity between householders, this is the proper course of action. All of the Senator's colleagues who are members of local authorities would agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 33 of the 1996 Act, each local authority has a qualified obligation to collect or arrange for the collection of household waste within its functional area. This obligation does not apply where an adequate waste collection service is available, the estimated cost of collection would be unreasonably high or adequate waste disposal arrangements can reasonably be made <Col N="900" />by a householder. I will not go into the background of the Cork situation again, which we know. This is fair and the law has to apply equally to everybody.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say the vast majority pay their collection charges and are happy to do so. This is increasingly the case. People are pressing me for more segregated systems. Interestingly, the public has become attuned to the need for recycling, reuse and segregation and is encouraging local authorities to provide new segregated systems. We are now moving at a faster pace. The amendment would be very unfair to the vast majority who want these improvements and would see their neighbours simply do nothing and have their waste collected for free. That is not on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In a later section the Minister will hand powers to county managers to recover the costs of collection and the provision of services in local authority areas. Heretofore, local authority members, when striking their rates and making provisions for the cost of a bin or collection at estimates time, always included an amount for a waiver. What will be the effect on local authority waivers? The manager will have the power to set the fee for collection but who will decide the waiver? Heretofore, the members had a say but with the proposal to hand over all the power to the manager will he or she have the power to decide the waiver? This issue is crucial to Senator McCarthy's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In tabling this amendment I am sure Senator McCarthy was imbued with feelings for individuals. In equity it would be most unfair if I decide to pay my refuse collection charges and my neighbour decides he or she does not want to pay. Although it could come across as a measure whereby if I pay, I am going to make sure my neighbour also pays, this is not the case; it is about a sense of fairness.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the waiver system is in place for those who cannot afford to pay. From my knowledge, managers always had a huge input into deciding who should qualify for a waiver. Representations were made and points of view expressed but the managers decided. The waiver scheme is defined on the basis of the amount of income or social welfare received. Mostly managers are reasonable in their application of the waiver schemes if there is a genuine inability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see, however, the logic of the Senator's amendment in the sense of wanting fair play for everyone. It is manifestly unfair to let one person off if he or she can afford to pay and take the money from others who can also afford to pay. I imagine it would lead to much difficulty, particularly in an estate where the houses are close together and everybody knows each other and who is and is not paying. It would be mad for refuse collectors to remove the waste of one per<Col N="901" />son who was paying and do the same for someone who was not. As the Labour Party is well known for its sense of fairness, I appeal to Senator McCarthy to consider this side of the picture.</P>

      <P>In page 64, line 44, after &ldquo;before&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;after&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section is a very good one. I always like legislation that contains words like &ldquo;the second activity (irrespective of whether it would otherwise be so regarded) shall be regarded as an activity falling within section 39(1)&rdquo; and it can then become the first activity. It is very useful because people may have applied for a waste management licence instead of an IPPC licence. However, why does it have to be before and not after? It gives the EPA the power to change the licence from one area to another, which again is a very good idea. Having realised they made a mistake and applied for the wrong licence, applicants should be allowed to apply for the other licence rather than having to start <i>de novo</i>. I am sure the Minister has a great explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>The intention behind section 39A(7) is to allow a person who proposes to carry on two related activities, that is, an activity involving the recovery or disposal of waste and an activity to which the First Schedule of the 1992 Act applies, to request the Environmental Protection Agency to make a determination as to which licensing regime shall apply before, obviously, the prospective applicant goes to the trouble and expense of preparing the requisite licence application. This lets him or her know at the start of the process the licence for which he or she should apply. There seems to be little merit in an applicant requesting a declaration from the EPA after making an application for either a waste licence or an IPPC licence as the case may be. In that <Col N="902" />event either the licence application is made under the appropriate Act or it is not. It will be processed, if appropriate, and, if not, he or she will have to go back.

      <P>Operators will be obliged to notify the agency annually of the charges and cost of running a landfill for the previous 12 months. In the majority of cases, the local authority will operate the landfill. How will this be scrutinised? The Minister is transferring powers for waste management to county managers, who can provide whatever figures they like on the operation of a landfill. They can make the costs of using a landfill so unattractive that people will turn to incineration. Who will be accountable?</P>
      <P>I have major concerns about the proposals. A landfill operator could also be an incinerator operator. In such circumstances, he would have a vested interest in increasing landfill charges to a level which compels waste collection agencies to use incineration.</P>
      <P>Operators must account for the amount of waste arriving at a landfill on a weekly, monthly or annual basis. A charge, including a Government levy, must also be imposed. In many cases the county manager will increase the cost per tonne of using landfill. The proposals will give rise to considerable controversy. I am concerned that it could result in a significant amount of waste being diverted to incineration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand the point the Senator is trying to make, I do not accept it. The manager is in charge when the landfill is established, but the determination is made by the Environmental Protection Agency. I cannot fore<Col N="903" />see circumstances in which a local authority would forego potential income from its landfill by driving landfill charges to such levels that nobody would consider using it. Such an approach would make no sense. A balance will have to be struck between the use of the various facilities and this will be done through weighting.</P>
      <P>I welcome the huge strides now being made in waste management. Our approach to this issue is hierarchical. During discussions with local authorities in recent months, I have been encouraged by the fact that they intend to focus their waste plans for the coming year on prevention and recycling. These two areas will be the bedrock of the system. I will ensure that recycling becomes far more attractive than the other options. I have already established the construction and demolition waste council and I also established the electrical task force under the relevant directive to make sure electrical goods are not brought to landfill. The new waste packaging directives, which apply to business, entered into force on 1 March. We have not taken just one approach, a raft of approaches are being taken.</P>
      <P>It is time we, as politicians, acknowledged that the mood among the public and business is in favour of accepting responsibility for waste. Having distributed some &euro;15 million to local authorities through the environmental fund late last year, I will distribute a substantially higher amount later this year. In doing so, I will emphasise to local authorities that the public, particularly householders and private citizens, want sufficient recycling facilities to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>We need to strike a balance. We must have the facilities in place before we deal with some of the arguments. The Environmental Protection Agency will licence and monitor facilities to ensure matters are being handled correctly. We will not allow people to charge exorbitant prices for landfill use. Such an approach would not be acceptable.</P>

It is possible that running a landfill will become so expensive that Sligo County Council could easily be compelled to bring its waste to an incineration facility.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred several times to weighting the various waste options. How does he intend to apply these weightings to landfill, recycling and incineration, now that it too will become part of the waste management programme?</P>

      <P>Given that I have been accused of introducing incineration, I do not mind using the term. As politicians, we had better begin to <Col N="904" />understand about what we are talking when we refer to incineration. We are not talking about traditional incineration facilities associated in the public mind with mass burning. No such facilities will ever be built here. They would not be acceptable to the Government or to any political party. The facilities in question have taken a huge leap in terms of technology and treatment, even in the past three to five years. Having addressed the waste problem so late, we have enormous difficulties in our waste management systems, Nevertheless, we are probably lucky because the technology we will introduce will be so advanced as to allow us to have managed facilities with very marginal emissions.</P>
      <P>I refer the Senator to section 30(8), which states:</P>
      <P>The Agency shall not grant a licence or revised licence in respect of the disposal of waste at a facility referred to in subsection (1) unless it is satisfied that the proposed licensee or licensee will take or will continue to take steps to comply with this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This means a proper statement of costs must be produced and, as a result, the real costs will be transparent and open. The public will, therefore, be properly informed about the system. Obviously, once the various facilities are in operation, we will have to examine elements of their usage to ensure that the balance of use is fairly distributed across the various approaches.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the outdated systems in place perhaps 20 years ago. Recently, a large number of councillors from across the country were taken to Germany to view what is considered a state-of-the-art facility which uses the latest technologies. Those responsible for compiling waste management plans for a number of regions co-sponsored the visits. Is the Minister aware that, within three weeks of one such visit by a number of councillors from the midlands, the facility was closed down on health and safety grounds?</P>
      <P>I strongly oppose incineration. No one knows how long a facility must be operating before it is considered tried and tested. Despite evidence that incineration causes damage to health, the Government has done nothing to allay people's fears. If we were to hold a public meeting on incineration tomorrow morning, 500 to 600 people would attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the wrong information is being transmitted. Certainly, the closure of the facility in Germany does not allay public fears. Having been sold to councillors and the public as a state-of-the-art facility, a story appeared in the national and European press informing us that it had been closed down within weeks of a visit by councillors. This causes grave concern and anxiety among public representatives because they are the <Col N="905" />voice of the people, are accountable to them and must listen to them.</P>

      <P>The Senator is correct. I wish we could get more of that message across because what we want to do here in a management sense is light years from what has been the case heretofore. I was not talking about the facility but, thankfully, I have very good officials sitting behind me. The facility about which the Senator is talking was an experimental one which did not deal with incineration but with a new technology which did not work. The Senator forgot to mention that the same councillors visited many other facilities with which they were delighted because they worked extremely well. Let us not confuse the two issues. Thank God I have a few good officials who are ahead of the game.</P>

      <P>While we will not get into an argument about it, we have to be clear and fair.</P>
      <P>I attended a large public meeting recently when for the first time in my life I was on a platform with a young lady who was absolutely expert in this area. I had never met her before but she was brilliant. She had the simple gift of English, yet was highly technically qualified. She dealt with every issue and there was not a whimper at the end of the meeting. If I can get her to help us in the Department or anywhere else, I will because she was superb. She dealt with all of the sensitive issues from breast cancer right across the spectrum and demolished many of the traditional emotional arguments which are not relevant when we talk about the type of facilities Ireland proposes to put in place.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to all my colleagues in the European Union about this issue. The number of facilities in the European Union is approximately 360, many of which are starting to close down due to public demand because they are out of date. It should be borne in mind, however, that the incinerators which are closing down abroad are of the old style and that new ones are being built. The public is demanding that these facilities be state-of-the-art and there is no issue in putting them in place in housing estates. I do not propose to put them in place in housing estates here but there is a gap in the entire information flow if Europeans appear to be comfortable with such facilities, which is not the case here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say to politicians particularly that we must take on our responsibilities by informing ourselves and then leading the debate in a fair, proper and balanced way. We owe it to the people we represent not to engage in superficial argu<Col N="906" />ments but to deal with the substantive issues and try to understand what we are talking about.</P>

      <P>In County Mayo recently a waste collection operator who was segregating waste applied to extend and modernise his premises. Permission was granted by Mayo County Council but was subsequently refused by An Bord Pleanála on the grounds that the plant was four and a half miles from Castlebar. That is the ludicrous position in which this man found himself. The plant is located in a rural area only four and a half miles from the town. An Bord Pleanála refused planning permission, first, because it was not part of the Connacht waste management programme, yet the man concerned has been collecting waste for 20 years throughout the town and other towns also. In fact, he was collecting waste long before the local authority started doing so. The second reason for the refusal was that the plant was located in a rural rather than a built-up area. Obviously, An Bord Pleanála wants such facilities to be provided where waste is generated, namely, in towns, not rural areas.</P>
      <P>I remain concerned about the question of weightings. The man concerned provided a service which involved segregating waste and bringing part of it to the landfill site, yet An Bord Pleanála refused him permission to expand his premises. As a result, he is in a terrible state. The less waste that goes to landfill the more it will cost per tonne because it will be done on a tonnage basis. While there is no doubt that some managers will push up the price per tonne, I hope it will be weighted in terms of recycling rather than incineration, if possible. It would be ridiculous to have it weighted in a situation where waste could go to a recycling facility or for incineration. I accept the Minister spoke about the weightings but it should be spelled out in the Bill. Every Senator is well aware that the cost per tonne at landfill sites will increase dramatically, especially if there is a reduction in tonnage. If the weightings were in favour of waste going to recycling rather than incineration&mdash;</P>

      <P>On Senator Burke's point about local authorities and the provisions in the Bill which place restrictions on the issuing of licences, we had an interesting case recently at the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government whereby representatives of Wicklow County Council were brought in to explain its position on landfill sites in County Wicklow. It proved to be a particularly enlightening presentation, and that was only one local authority. There are mechanisms, therefore, for maintaining pressure on local authorities to fall within the existing guidelines. We have also had representatives of Superquinn before the committee to deal with the question of packaging. Representatives of Roadstone came before us to talk about its <Col N="907" />landfill sites. There are other mechanisms in place, including the joint committee.</P>

      <P>Senator Burke spoke very sensibly. The real problem is to try to get people involved in recycling. The Minster is right when he talks about the difference in incineration 20 years ago and today. People are always asking me to appeal on health grounds with a view to preventing incinerators being built but that is becoming impossible with modern incinerators. The real problem is that with incineration it is too easy for people to stop trying to minimise waste and start recycling. It is important that whatever rating we introduce will encourage the minimisation of waste for a start and then recycling because incineration is too easy.</P>
      <P>I will not be popular in the Dublin 4 area for saying this but incinerators will have to be built near where the problem is created because we cannot continue to cart waste all over the country. People will have to understand that if they produce huge amounts of waste, it will have to be disposed of near them because otherwise we will have enormous problems in moving it around the country, including traffic problems. The economy of scale involved in removing this waste is important also. The Minister is right about the incinerators being closed down in the European Union due to their inefficiency or the pollution they produce but in respect of the modern facilities being built, we cannot make a case on health grounds and say they are causing terrible trouble.</P>

      <P>The more modern landfill sites work very satisfactorily in most cases. I have inspected sites on the Continent and in America and their operators and the general public are more than satisfied with the measured recycling facilities built in, etc.</P>
      <P>Some local authorities received grants at harvest time for recycling facilities but it was done on a piecemeal basis. I do not understand the reason every local authority was not facilitated with grants for that purpose. In Longford this issue came up yesterday during a discussion on the Protection of the Environment Bill and there was major disappointment on all sides that we did not receive grant assistance. Longford is a small county with a very low rate base.</P>

      <P>When it was closed down we had no communication from the Department of the Environment and Local Government to explain the situation and public representatives felt let down. Many of the representatives returned home with the view that the facility was state-of-the-art and that we should have something similar in Ireland. However, their confidence in the system was undermined when the facility closed down. Nothing has yet been done by the Department &ndash; not even so much as a press release has been issued &ndash; to communicate information about the closure. However, if I attend a public meeting or visit a community development association and this issue arises, the incident to which I refer is mentioned. We can say that it was just a trial run, but why were public representatives brought to inspect a facility and told on the day they visited it that it was the modern way to dispose of waste? That issue must be addressed because councillors are totally frustrated by the way in which they were treated.</P>
      <P>What happened gives the impression that similar facilities around the world can close down and this impression means less emphasis is put on recycling. No effort will then be made to recycle because such facilities need to be fed with waste to become viable. That is a big concern for the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That underlines our general attitude to these matters.</P>
      <P>It was stated on Second Stage that there is no such thing as a dump any more &ndash; they are all superdumps. The superdump proposed for Kill would have been convenient for Dublin waste, as it would have come as far as Kildare but would have been outside Dublin. I had a memorable experience at a protest meeting against that dump when a person sitting beside me smoked <i>Disque Bleu</i> cigarettes all night. At about 10.30 p.m., I had to ask him to respect my environment yet he was one of the most active opponents of the superdump.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could summarise the general attitude of individuals to this as being that they want to produce as much waste as they can, that they want the local authority to remove it for nothing and that they do not want a dump or incinerator <Col N="909" />near where they live. That is a reasonable summary of most people's position, but it is totally untenable. As stated on Second Stage, landfill is much more environmentally damaging than disposing of waste by heat; provided the temperatures are high enough and the combustion is complete there are minimal risks. At the Sillot Hill landfill site in Kildare, gases got into underground strata and people had to be evacuated from their houses. That was within two miles of the Liffey, a source of drinking water for Dublin. Such crazy things cannot continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct: incineration is not the word, it must be waste-to-energy or waste-to-heat. At one stage there was a proposal, which received some support, to use the disused turf-burning power stations in the midlands for waste disposal. However, they could not be used because the temperatures that would be generated would not be high enough to get rid of the waste properly. The technology is now advancing fast enough to do this properly and public representatives have a responsibility to show some leadership and backbone at public meetings on what can be an emotional issue. Perhaps that is why some of us are in the Seanad rather than the Dáil, though I exempt the Minister from that criticism.</P>
    <P>We must face up to reality. We cannot continue to state that this cannot be done anywhere. If waste is generated, it must be disposed of and someone has to pay for it.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay proceedings, but I am pleased there is a good substantive discussion on this matter even if, as Senator Dardis said, one is not sure what section we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>I do not like doing this to Senator Bannon, but the Longford application was wholly inadequate and unacceptable in its quality, presentation, documentation and back-up material. I will go no further, as I have made my point, and I want Longford to be involved as much as any other area. However, we must ask why some local authorities are doing exceptionally well while others are not. It comes down to leadership on both sides at local level. Having said that, I want to encourage all local authorities. I will work with and fund their activities, but there has to be a good basis for that work.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Henry's point, we have a national waste prevention programme and a market development programme for recyclables. I am excited by the fact that so many sectors of Irish industry are now becoming involved and taking on responsibilities in this area. I am heartened by the public attitude to this because it is changing substantially. These plans worked in other countries and one is not taking from the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis and others mentioned thermal treatment. We are now into combined heat and power, waste-to-energy and other options that <Col N="910" />were not available five to seven years ago but which we can now introduce to Ireland. There is now a huge range of options.</P>
    <P>Ironically, yesterday I presented a green flag to approximately 400 students at a primary school in respect of an extraordinary achievement &ndash; driven by those students &ndash; regarding the packaging of lunches. The children would not allow their parents to put unnecessary packaging on the lunches. They said they wanted minimal, recyclable packaging. That involved the parents and then the teachers and the local community became involved. The students, who, as a matter of interest, come from all social backgrounds, drove this matter forward. Students from first class onward at the school were involved in the scheme, which had an enormous effect on the community. A new mindset was put in place and there was an acceptance of people's responsibility as individuals and of their having a role to play in society. That is where it starts and it is in this direction that we are going to drive our activities in respect of the recyclables.</P>
    <P>We have had a wide-ranging discussion which may not relate directly to the section with which we are dealing, but it has been a healthy debate. We do not live in a perfect world and we are damaging the environment by burning rubbish in back gardens and in farmyards. If I had all the thermal treatment plants or incinerators I wanted in place and working, their entire combined output would be less than 2% of the entire country's dioxin emissions, yet they would be party to a massive reduction in dioxin emissions from, among other sources, cigarette smoke. I am a smoker and I still wedded to Player's non-tipped cigarettes, even though others are trying to stop me.</P>

That is the reality with which we must deal. We are out there with our kids shovelling stuff on to bonfires. We go collecting with them and help to poison them. Those fires, with all the tyres burnt on them, will do more damage in years to come than anything else. I am trying to introduce the best technology to reduce and manage the problem in order that we may live in a society that protects both our health and the environment. Nothing in the world is risk free but we can act to reduce the risk substantially and maintain our environment.</P>

      <P>In page 73, line 14, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This stronger wording would give a stronger footing to the waiver system which is more important now than ever. People will find it difficult to pay service charges. In Cork they have gone up by 108% to &euro;390. The waste management strategies of some counties are light years behind and the appropriate centres for recycling are not in place to initiate the three Rs: reduction, recycling and reusing. It is vital that the waiver system is strong because managers will have differences of opinion. Only some will have recourse to the system because of the exorbitant increases in some county council areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not accept an amendment that would compel any local authority which made waste charges under the new section 75 of the 1996 Act also to provide a mandatory system of waivers in respect of all or part of such charges. It would be a departure from the <i>status quo</i> that would not be useful or necessary.</P>
      <P>Currently local authorities are not under an obligation to provide for waivers in respect of waste charges. The provisions of section 75(3) of the 1996 Act are identical to those of section 5 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983 under which waste charges are currently levied. Accordingly, local authorities will retain discretion in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is currently and will remain a matter for the manager of each local authority to determine if there should be a waiver of waste charges and the parameters of such a scheme. Many local authorities provide such waiver schemes and I am pleased that they do. I expect local authority managers, in exercising their proposed new powers, to continue to address new waivers for those <Col N="912" />on low incomes in a sensitive and sympathetic matter.</P>
    <P>I see no merit, however, in a mandatory requirement for waiver schemes. The letter of any such legal requirement could be complied with without providing any meaningful relief for waiver recipients. I could include such a provision in the Bill but meaningless waiver schemes could then be put in place that would not benefit anyone. Many local authorities operate the current scheme and the Bill re-emphasises its importance. It is unnecessary to go further. It would tilt the balance away from an effective scheme for many local areas. Provision for discretion allows personal circumstances to be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase of 108% in Cork. No one could have foreseen in the 1990s that charges would be so high today. I accept that charges were lower then because we had not got our act together in the waste management area. If the amendment is not accepted, there will be applications for waivers from those on low incomes who are not recipients of social welfare. Given the discretion of the manager and the further discretion granted in the Bill, he or she will be able to turn down a waiver application from someone in gainful employment on a low wage. The minute he or she enters employment details on a waiver application the application looks farcical because he or she may appear well enough off to pay the charge when that is not the case.</P>
      <P>The waiver system should be mandatory because only county managers exercise this power. I am dubious about increasing their power and about legislation in recent years that has eroded the power of elected representatives.</P>

We are responsible to citizens and understand the situation. We must face the electorate. Circumstances come to our attention, not the Government, where a waiver should be applied. I am all for those who can afford it paying but there should be provision for hardship cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Making the system mandatory would not improve it, it would simply mean a manager could introduce a system that observed the legal niceties of the Bill without any meaningful basis. The current system is working well across the State. If it is not broken, we should not try to fix it. I am loath to go any further and cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly, in the case of a person whose level of income is such that he or she cannot afford the particular charges, there will have to be a waiver scheme. Under the new system of taking cases against householders for non-payment of <Col N="913" />waste charges, any manager who had not first made an effort to look at the person's income situation would be laughed out of court and would discredit the entire system. It is quite clear from the manner in which I have dealt with this in the Bill that all of those factors have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>An important factor is that tax relief on charges is available to those who are working. On the other side of the equation, allowance must be made for those whom circumstances prevent from working and who are on social welfare incomes. That is provided through the waiver scheme which managers can implement. It is working well, I have re-emphasised it in the Bill and I do not consider that a mandatory provision would improve it in any way. It is a good scheme and we should have confidence in the people operating it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on a matter which has arisen in my area. I refer to the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to clarify the position on lands designated as special areas of conservation but not registered as such by the Land Registry.</P>
      <P>Following the purchase and reclamation of such lands, Dúchas is now insisting that they be returned to their original state. I believe there is a loophole in the law in this regard. The individual concerned bought the lands in good faith and proceeded to carry out certain works. He received a phone call from an official of Dúchas at a stage when half the work had been completed. I must say the official was very courteous in his approach. He requested a meeting with the land owner and an on-site visit took place.</P>
      <P>The official proceeded to read the regulations to the farmer, for whom that was a very frightening experience. Having bought the land in good faith, he was shocked to hear from the Dúchas official that he would have to return it to its original state, despite having spent some £15,000 on reclamation works. The legal loophole which gave rise to this situation should be closed off. If lands are designated as special areas of conservation or otherwise, that should be registered on the title deeds or, at least, some notice of that fact should be taken in Land Registry.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Scanlon for raising this issue. The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, which transposed the EU habitats directive into Irish law, is the statutory instrument under which special areas of conservation, SACs, are designated and afforded protection. These sites have legal protection from the date they are publicly notified for designation to landowners and other persons concerned. The sites which have been submitted to the European Commission as candidate SACs have not yet been adopted by the Commission and so cannot yet be legally registered as such.</P>
      <P>A key question in the particular case outlined by the Senator is the length of time the land had been owned by the individual concerned &ndash; whether he had owned it for quite some time or acquired it more recently and the state of progress in the designation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon" hpid="Mr. Scanlon Mr. Scanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>He had been in ownership of the lands for approximately two months at that stage. The person from whom he purchased it had been living in America and would have had no knowledge of the SAC designation process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard it as normal practice that the purchaser or his or her advisers would ascertain from the seller if there was a designation for conservation purposes on the land. The registration process can take quite a while to complete. Anybody purchasing land would be well advised to ascertain, through the auctioneer or solicitor handling the transaction, the position with regard to any SAC designation.</P>
      <P>When SAC designations become final, following adoption by the European Commission and the making of a formal order by the Minister, it will be possible to register land formally as being covered by an SAC designation under the Registration of Title Act 1964. Under Regulation 14 of the habitats regulations, a person is required to seek my Department's consent before carrying out operations or activities likely to alter, damage, destroy or interfere with the integrity of an SAC site. This consent is dispensed with for activities or developments which require a licence or consent from another Minister or statutory body, such as a local authority or An Bord Pleanála in the case of planning applications, or the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the case of decisions regarding the issue of foreshore licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where this obligation to obtain my Department's consent is contravened, the owner, occupier or user of the land may be required by my Department to restore the land to its pre-damaged state. Control over activities requiring consent of another authority is a matter for that authority. My Department has responsibilities to ensure that special areas of conservation are <Col N="915" />maintained in a favourable conservation status and to use the powers assigned to it appropriately to this end.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Senator could supply further details of the location of the site in question. It is possible that the difficulty arose at an in-between stage. However, if a person were buying land in a professional manner, it would be expected that the legal advisers or auctioneers would check out matters of this nature. Substantial efforts are made by my Department to inform people generally of special designations being made. The normal procedure includes notices in local newspapers, radio stations, Garda stations and local authority offices. A serious effort is made to communicate with the wider public when land is being designated. Nevertheless, people buying land should ensure that all aspects are fully checked and there is a certain responsibility on professional advisers in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of this case. Perhaps the Senator would feed us information on it. A requirement to restore a site to its pre-damaged stage could also apply as part of a court order. While it could happen, the Department, without knowing the particular case, is surprised that it would happen and that a farmer, having bought land, would not have known and have been made aware of the circumstances. If the Senator provides me with the information, the Department can get it checked out further.</P>

    <Title>Nenagh Law Centre Staffing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving permission to raise this important matter of the staffing levels at the legal aid centre in Nenagh and at the associated centres in Thurles and Clonmel. As the Minister of State may be aware, the administrative centre for the Legal Aid Board for Tipperary is in Nenagh, but there are outreach centres and there are also clinics and offices in Thurles and Clonmel.</P>
      <P>A very serious situation has arisen with the staffing levels for the legal aid service in the county and there are consequent implications for those on the waiting list. According to figures supplied by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the staffing levels in the legal aid centres in December, and into January, were three solicitors and 3.5 support staff, and the waiting time for an appointment was nine months. The Minister of State would have to agree that this is an unacceptably long waiting time, particularly when compared to that in other parts of the country where the waiting time is more normally three to four months. Tipperary is outstanding in that regard in having, even in December, one of the longest waiting times for an appointment with the free legal aid service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has deteriorated since January <Col N="916" />with the loss of one solicitor and, as a result, the loss of a member of support staff. As notified to me via one of my Dáil colleagues last week by way of a written parliamentary question, the current position is that there are two solicitors and two support staff in the legal aid office in Nenagh and the waiting time for an appointment has now gone from nine to 11 months. This is an unacceptable and intolerable position. It is certainly intolerable for the staff involved, who I would imagine &ndash; without having discussed it with them &ndash; are being put under extraordinary stress, and for the people on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>Only recently I received a woman into my clinic. I want to give this as an example &ndash; the Minister will be aware of the kind of case to which I refer. This situation could be replicated right across the country but I cite it as an example of the kind of difficulties faced when a person is relying on the legal aid service to sort out his or her affairs.</P>
    <P>This woman's marriage has unfortunately broken up, due to psychiatric illness in the family, leaving her responsible for the mortgage. Because of a legal situation arising from the fact that her name is on the title deeds of a house, for which she now cannot afford to pay, the local authority is essentially saying that she is not qualified to apply for housing. We are dealing with that at another level. In fact, what she needs is legal separation. She wants to get a legal separation but she cannot afford a solicitor because of her position.</P>
    <P>With two small children, this woman is unable to work. She herself is under severe stress and when I spoke to her last week she told me she had been waiting six months for an appointment with the Legal Aid Board. I advised her to go to another legal aid office because the waiting time in Limerick, for instance, is four months. I said to her that this was a really urgent matter and suggested that perhaps she needed to put herself on the waiting list for the Limerick service too.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of situation with which we are faced. The local authority is telling me that it is in an impossible position. If a person's name is on the title deeds of a house and the person has not negotiated or finalised a legal separation, the local authority is in a very difficult position in dealing with the person's application for housing.</P>
    <P>This woman is in very difficult circumstances. This is only one example of the kinds of problems people face. The Minister of State will be aware that at this stage family law cases have become the largest element of the work of the legal aid service.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to explain why staffing in the Tipperary office has been allowed to fall to two solicitors and two support staff. I hope a commitment will be forthcoming that this problem will be rectified as soon as possible. I want to know why this is happening. Is it because of a cut in funds to the Legal Aid Board? If so, could the <Col N="917" />Minister of State please explain why this is happening and the justification for it? If there is such a cut, who made this decision, why was it made and are the implications being fully examined? It would appear to me that cuts such as this are hitting the most vulnerable in the community, the very people who cannot afford to go privately to a solicitor, who are dependent on the free legal aid service and who, as a result, are often left waiting often in legal limbo.</P>
    <P>I should of course emphasise that the waiting time is for an appointment, not for a court hearing which, hopefully, is consequent on an appointment. Therefore it masks, in many ways, the full reality of this intolerable situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, who could not be here. He has also asked me to bring the points made by the Senator to his attention.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, the overriding principle underlying the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 and the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 is to provide legal aid and advice for persons of modest means. Section 5 of the Act provides that the function of the board is to provide, within the resources allocated to it and subject to other provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice in civil cases for persons who satisfy certain requirements set out in the Act and the regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>Under section 30 of the Act, responsibility for determining how legal services should be provided, including the location of law centres and the staffing required by these centres, is a matter for the board. The Senator will appreciate that the function of the board includes identifying both the level of demand for its services and the most suitable way in which to meet the demand for services.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that, to serve the people of Tipperary, the board operates a permanent law centre in Nenagh and two part-time law centres in Thurles and Clonmel. This arrangement offers a reasonable geographic spread for the convenience of applicants throughout the county. The board has informed the Minister that its approved staffing complement for Nenagh law centre is two solicitors and three support staff.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also been informed that at the end of January the number of persons on the waiting lists in Nenagh, Thurles and Clonmel was 45, 32 and 87, respectively. The waiting times, based on the person longest on the waiting list, at the three locations was ten months, 10.25 months and 11 months, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister understands that, some time ago, as part of its remit and in order to address a number of staffing issues such as maternity leave, sick leave, etc., the board made a temporary increase in the staffing complement at Nenagh law centre on a contract basis. This temporary increase was <Col N="918" />to cover the staffing situation as it existed at the time and, following the return of the permanent staff members, the position has reverted to normal levels on completion of the contract.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to inform the Senator that, in order to improve the waiting list situation at Nenagh law centre, the board has taken the step of providing support to the law centre from its head office and will continue to do so in the coming months. The board anticipates that this measure will lead to a reduction in the waiting list at the Nenagh law centre shortly. The board has also decided to review the arrangements for the provision of legal services in the part-time law centres in Clonmel and Thurles.</P>
    <P>In relation to applicants waiting for legal services, the Minister has asked me to point out to the House that the Legal Aid Board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded to certain categories of cases, for example domestic violence, child care, child abduction and cases in which there are time limits. I understand that in these cases the application is dealt with immediately and the person concerned is not placed on a waiting list. That would probably not extend to the case to which the Senator is referring, although I have found from personal experience that local authorities are usually fairly co-operative in holding positions.</P>

      <P>In so far as they can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that waiting ten or 11 months is ideal. A system is necessary to ensure that persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with a priority service. This is a most important initiative by the board and accounts for over 20% of all applications.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that a sum of &euro;17.075 million has been allocated to the Legal Aid Board this year. While this figure represents a slight decrease of 3% on the allocation last year, it still represents a significant increase in resources for the legal aid board in recent years, up from &euro;10.563 million in 1997 to &euro;17.075 million in 2003. This is an increase of almost 62% over the period in question and compares very favourably with a consumer price index increase of just over 24% during the same period. Sanction for the board to employ additional full-time solicitors was also received during this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board has informed the Minister that it continually keeps the arrangements for delivery of legal services under review to ensure that it provides services to the greatest number of persons possible and that this includes the law centres in Tipperary. The information I have is different from the Senator's. She said the current staffing was two solicitors plus two support staff, whereas I said it was two solicitors plus three support staff. There is a slight difference in the information, even allowing for the extra contract per<Col N="919" />son, presumably a solicitor, who was covering sick or maternity leave.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

      <P>I accept what the Senator is saying and I will pass it on to the Minister. There <Col N="920" />seems to be a problem in that the service in those offices is not what might be expected. I am not sure of the nature of the support to be given by the head office.</P>
