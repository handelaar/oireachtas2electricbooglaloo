      <P>I have received notice from Senator Browne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make a statement on the progress being made in the Carlow Regional Youth Service's central youth facility.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the reason Iarnród Éireann, despite many cash injections, has unsuitable and unsafe passenger trains on its mainline network, particularly on the Sligo and Westport lines.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being mischievous. Five years ago the Government, with support from other parties, supported the establishment of drugs task forces in Dublin, Cork and other urban areas. The then Minister of State, Chris Flood, was solely responsible for the issue of drugs during the lifetime of the previous Government. The current Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and colleagues from two other Departments are now responsible for the issue, which is not good enough. There is growing evidence of crack cocaine on the streets of Dublin and the supply of drugs in this city is as bad as ever. I have spoken to many voluntary drugs treatment organisations in the capital and have been informed that there have been significant cutbacks in the level of funding they can obtain from their task forces. Will the Leader permit a full debate on drugs policy in the next week or two? Such a debate could include the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is only right that we should review the progress &ndash; or lack of it &ndash; in recent years.</P>
      <P>Does the Government have any proposals to introduce a consolidated Bill in respect of the declarations Members of the Oireachtas make to the Public Offices Commission? If one is a member of a local authority and a Member of this House, one must make four returns &ndash; two to the local authority and two to the Public Offices Commission. This is ludicrous. There should be one return and one consolidated Bill should suffice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is quite right. We thought the Freedom of Information Act was overly progressive in its own way, but we will now be obliged to change it. It is always a good indication that there is no sign of an election when Fine Gael get both matters on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Today is the feast day of Our Lady of Lourdes and is known as a day for miracles. Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, announced he was finally going to move on the question of the Shannon river council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy the social partners are more prepared than Members of the House to listen to good advice on some of these issues.</P>
      <P>The new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, will be published today or tomorrow. It should be debated in the House while the different pillars are considering it. The House has discussed the issue of housing on many occasions and this is included in the agreement. The views of Members should be clearly articulated on these issues. I heard a clear lack of understanding on the issue of affordable housing being aired on television last night. This is just one of a wide variety of issues and outstanding matters that could be dealt with. I ask that this matter be discussed during Government time next week.</P>
      <P>People are continually asking why matters of this nature are not discussed in the House. The main reason for this is that people do not get involved at any stage. I have said before that committees of the Houses should receive reports on such negotiations. The Oireachtas should articulate a view before any decision is taken by the four pillars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue to which I have referred on previous occasions, namely, the role of An Taisce in regard to planning permissions. Cork County Council recently granted permission to the most senior civil servant in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Secretary General, to build a cottage on Sherkin Island overlooking the ocean and An Taisce has lodged an appeal in respect of this decision.</P>
      <P>The role played by An Taisce in relation to planning permission affects one-off rural housing developments, in particular, and also young people living in rural constituencies. I accept that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government came before the House recently, but he should be invited here again to discuss the role of An Taisce in relation to one-off housing developments in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minster for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to come before the House to outline his policy on the future of An Post, particularly the downgrading of local post offices to be operated on an agency basis and the proposed provision of letterboxes at the end of laneways &ndash; which would be detrimental to rural areas &ndash; and to allay fears that the five day delivery service will be reduced to a three day <Col N="404" />service. I will give an example of where this has occurred. The Cathaoirleach comes from a rural constituency and he will appreciate the impact of this development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The village of Four Roads in County Roscommon has lost its post office, which has been downgraded to be run on an agency basis. This is a major blow to a rural area that has been reclassified as a CLÁR area by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cúiv.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to again invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House to listen to a debate on the ongoing level of crime on our streets. I raise this issue today following an interview on the Marian Finucane show this morning, which some Members may have heard. If they did, I expect that &ndash; as in my case &ndash; it brought tears to their eyes to listen to that poor man speak about his son who was viciously attacked in Cork nearly 12 months ago and who is still alive but unable to function. This type of crime is happening far too often on our streets and the Garda Síochána does not have the necessary resources to tackle it. I ask the Leader to request the Minister to come before the House to engage in a debate on this matter because the concerns expressed about it appear to be falling on deaf ears. We want to impress upon him again the seriousness of this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the role of An Taisce. I would also like the House to debate the role of An Bord Pleanála and that of the NRA and the need to revisit the legislation on planning and development that was introduced in 2001. There are many areas in this regard that need to be clarified. People are questioning how the legislation is operating. Will the Leader ask the Minister to examine the legislation in the light of the problems that have arisen in the past two years and to clarify matters relating to it? It is time we revisited this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" />
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader give the House some reassurance that we will consider amending the equality legislation in light of the information that has emerged today about the exploitation of people, particularly from the Philippines? A woman was interviewed earlier and the position she outlined was appalling. It emerges that when the legislation went through the two Houses, we excluded from its provisions domestic service within a private residence. These people, often vulnerable women far away from home, have their visas entrusted to their employers so that they cannot really leave their employment. This woman was thrown out on the side of road, which was simply appalling. She was also swindled out of her bonus and so on. If we are a decent civilised country, we need to address this matter. This is something we did not envisage when the legislation went through the Houses and we should amend it. A slight amendment would remedy this situation.</P>
      <P>While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in the House, I would be happy to discuss crime levels with him. However, I can say exactly what is likely to emerge from the tragic case cited. The eight young men who attacked this youth were out of their skulls on drink and it was the result of a combination of certain drinks, such as Red Bull, Smirnoff Ice and others. We know this perfectly well because the analysis has already been done. I am not familiar with the case but I would take a bet with anyone that that would be what would emerge.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the ethics commission. It is complete and utter nonsense and a whitewash. It is cosmetic and means nothing. No one who swindles or takes bribes will state on a declaration of ethics that he or she received &euro;17,000 from a captain of industry. It is rubbish and wastes the time of decent people like us who must fill out these declarations in triplicate, register them and have them notarised, which costs about &euro;10 or &euro;15. When I applied to be reimbursed, the application was returned. If our time is to be wasted, we should at least be paid for it.</P>
      <P>I also welcome and join in calls for a debate on the role of An Taisce. This time, I hope we all tell the truth because it is much simpler, neater and cleaner. The truth is that, although An Taisce has not been great at manipulating its public image and has made several mistakes, in Leitrim, for example, where it was said it opposed the majority of planning permissions, there were 9,000 applications and the number of objections was in single figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I would like to put it on record. I wish to comment on something said by Senator McCarthy, with whom I normally agree. He complained that a senior civil servant in the Department of the Environment and Local Government had to undergo the same process as everyone else. Of course he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator McCarthy's call for a debate on planning, especially in the context of rural development. I would like the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to attend this debate.</P>
      <P>There is significant unrest throughout the country. For example, in Mayo two weeks ago, more than 300 people attended a meeting on this issue, while in Kerry several hundred attended a similar meeting. In many areas people are not allowed to build, even on their own farms. We have discussed rural areas being denuded, yet this is an occasion when people want to live in such areas and be part of them. I will not pillory An Taisce. It should be part of the debate as well.</P>
      <P>It is much better to hold the debate in the House than on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; or &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo;. We are supposed to be legislators and this House is where the debate should take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of concern about the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the fact that the clergy has stated its component of the overall cost. I am aware that the Leader was a member of the previous Cabinet which decided on this matter. While she would not reveal Cabinet secrets, was any projection made of the State's liability? It is estimated that between 20,000 and 30,000 people may avail of the redress board.</P>

      <P>The House should not allow this day to pass without recording its condemnation of the bomb planted in Enniskillen in the past 24 hours. I am sure this will find agreement on all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>I thought we had passed that stage. I live within half an hour of Enniskillen and have relatives in the county and the town, which I know well. As the Church of Ireland bishop said this morning, when we hear of Enniskillen and a bomb in one sentence, it cuts one to the quick. In this House we had the legacy of the 1988 bomb in the person of the distinguished, much remembered, lamented and loved former Senator Gordon Wilson. I hope this House and others that have the moral authority can send a powerful message to those who do not represent the overwhelming desire of the Irish people for peace on this island. I direct my comments to the Leader to allow her an opportunity to comment on this issue. I hope this House will record its condemnation of this event. In spite of the fact that we are in the middle of a peace process there are evil men still around, be it in the day or at night.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Terry in calling for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House. There is significant concern at the escalation of juvenile crime and the fact that young people, especially young men, are targeted for beatings. Last week a 72 year old widow in Sligo was jumped on by three young men on her way home from mass. She had nothing in her bag apart from a pension book, a set of rosary beads, &euro;5 in cash and the keys to her house. She is lying in a hospital in Sligo where she suffered a stroke. A garda in Sligo asked what people like me are doing about it. Such events no longer even make headlines in local newspapers. If we allow this to happen it is a sad day for Ireland. Other people have spoken about planning issues, but if the fabric of society is to be threatened&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Transport to come before the House to explain his policy of banning all trucks and HGVs from the city centre when the Dublin Port tunnel is opened? Is the Minister aware the country comprises more than just Dublin? What plan, if any, does he have for the remainder of the country which has to suffer the same difficulties with large vehicles travelling through towns?</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that nearly 500 accidental deaths were caused by lorries in the past five years. This problem, which affects the whole country, not just Dublin, is linked to another serious issue, namely, rail freight. Given that Iarnród Éireann has shown a lack of enthusiasm for rail freight, it is incumbent on the Government to take action in this area.</P>

Such a debate should concentrate on the inconsistencies between local authority planning officials, inspectors from An Bord Pleanála and the board itself. Planning decisions are turning the planning system into a lottery. Instead of playing six numbers, people are making six planning applications in the hope that one of them will be successful. We have been calling for a debate on planning since the Seanad was formed. We have now reached the stage where the issue must be debated. I urge the Leader to arrange this as soon as possible.</P>

    <P>Senator Hayes also asked if there were any plans to introduce a consolidation Act in respect of the forms Members must complete when declaring their interests. I had to fill out four forms because of my previous position but I take Senator O'Toole's point. When the Bill was going through the House everybody spoke in praise of ethics and we were all delighted to be part of the purer than pure group.

      <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of the need for an amendment to equality legislation because of a lacuna which has come to light in that people who go into domestic work are not covered by the legislation, which I believe was introduced by the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor. Time has moved on and there are different people in the country, so there is a need for this measure. The Senator asked why we should be bothered about ethics. Is there not a rascal among us? No? Then that is fair enough.</P>

      <Col N="413" />Senator Coghlan asked when the people of his area will be able to avail of the BreastCheck programme. That might be suitable for discussion on the Adjournment in order to get a more precise answer. Senator Coghlan also supported Senator Leyden on the post office issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Feeney described what happened in Sligo and sought a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the increase in crime. Senator Browne sought clarification from the Minister for Transport on the banning of certain large vehicles from Dublin and asked whether the same ban will apply in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan asked for a debate on planning; he has been seeking such a debate for some time. Senators McHugh and Bannon sought a debate on rural issues with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Senator Bannon also sought a debate on the National Roads Authority.</P>
    <P>I take issue with Senator Burke, who has been sniping at me. He keeps saying I am not answering him and that I am not getting the Ministers he wants. If he can find a day when I can get those Ministers I will get them.

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I find this section utterly confusing. Perhaps the problem is in relation to my command of the English language. I support the amendment, which makes perfect sense and I hope the Minister of State will accept it. Section 7 gives Science Foundation Ireland certain authority such as, for example, in paragraph (<i>f</i>), under which it will &ldquo;carry out such other functions that concern oriented basic research or strategic areas of scientific endeavour as may from time to time be assigned to it, with the consent of the Minister, by Forfás.&rdquo; I am assuming &ldquo;oriented&rdquo; means focused, directed or something similar. If, therefore, Forfás decides that an endeavour is oriented towards something called &ldquo;basic research&rdquo;, it will inform the Minister who will give then give the go-ahead. However, the section also refers to &ldquo;such other areas as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know how this is going to work. Who commences the process? Will the Minister prescribe a certain number of issues or areas that concern economic and social benefit or long-term industrial competitiveness? Who will then decide that the functions concern what is &ldquo;oriented basic research&rdquo; into those areas? What is the connection between &ldquo;the Minister and Forfás&rdquo;? Who will approach whom first and what is the final stage of consultation? Will the Minister talk to himself or herself? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording used in the section extremely confusing. I do not understand what it means or how it will work and I doubt if any fair-minded person can understand it. What does it mean? How will it come into operation? What is the process whereby it starts? Does it commence with somebody deciding what are the functions, then checking that it concerns &ldquo;oriented basic research into a strategic area&rdquo; and then having to ensure that the strategic area has been prescribed by the Minister? The wording is all over the place and <Col N="416" />does not make any sense. Surely it should be possible to simplify it. While it may be a good idea, I do not know what it means, how it will work or how to interpret it. I would appreciate some guidance on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator O'Toole, I am concerned about the phraseology in this area. I also presume that &ldquo;oriented&rdquo; means &ldquo;focused&rdquo;. I referred to the need to support basic research on Second Stage. I was anxious that we recognise the value of basic research because it appears that the foundation is very much geared, as in section 7 (1)(<i>a</i>), to looking at scientific endeavour which concerns the future development and competitiveness of industry and enterprise in this State. While I am glad that basic research is mentioned in this regard, I am grateful to Senator O'Toole for pointing out the difficulties we have with the word &ldquo;oriented&rdquo; preceding it. When one is performing basic research, it is frequently difficult to know on what it will be focused. The whole basis of such research is that it is something which can fan out in many directions. We need to consider this matter carefully. We need a clear explanation of what it means. This is one of the most important sections of the Bill and, if necessary, it perhaps can be changed before Report Stage.</P>

That is the reason for the insertion of the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; in my amendment. However, a technical amendment would be required so that, when aligned with my amendment, the text would read &ldquo;such other areas that concern economic and social benefit, long-term industrial competitiveness or environmentally sustainable development as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister.&rdquo; If that would be acceptable to the Senator, we could change the amendment to that wording.

      <P>With regard to a query by Senator O'Toole, there was a technology foresight exercise carried out which involved people from the universities, the institutes of technology and other areas. They looked at what they considered necessary to drive the development of science and technology ahead in this country and came up with the Science and Technology Institute and highlighted bio-technology and information and communications technology as the primary areas in which we should invest. It may be necessary in time to set up another technology foresight exercise in order to review what needs to be done in the future. It is in that regard that we have the third element in subsection (3), that is, &ldquo;such other areas that concern economic and social benefit, long-term industrial competi<Col N="417" />tiveness . as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister&rdquo;. Forfás is responsible for bringing forward different ideas to the Minister and, therefore, it is the overall umbrella agency in this area.</P>

      <P>I understand that. I am delighted the Minister of State accepted Senator McCarthy's amendment. It certainly adds significantly to the section. It is hugely important that competitiveness should go hand in hand with environmentally sustainable development.</P>
      <P>What I am really asking is a serious question in terms of how the foundation will work. The foundation will carry out functions which are assigned to it, with the consent of the Minister, by Forfás. I refer here to section 7(1)(<i>f</i>), which states it will carry out functions that may from time to time be assigned to it by Forfás. That is really what it says.</P>
      <P>What is the difference between &ldquo;oriented basic research&rdquo; and basic research? If they are going to be asked to do something, it has to have some relevance to their work or what they are doing. Forfás will not ask them to do something that has no relevance. Basic research into an area is precisely that and it is not directed beyond it. It is related to or it is dealing with an area of concern. It seems that the word &ldquo;oriented&rdquo; confuses the issue. I understand what the Minister of State said, namely, that Forfás will be responsible for informing the Minister.</P>
      <P>With respect, the Minister of State did not deal with the area under section 7(3)(<i>c</i>), which states &ldquo;as may be prescribed from time to time by the Minister.&rdquo; Will the Minister do this on a regular basis and will Forfás select from that what it considers to be important? Is that how it will work?</P>
      <P>My main question is about the word &ldquo;oriented&rdquo;, which seems to confuse matters. I will not push the matter to a vote, but I do not think it helps to include the word in the section.</P>

As Senator O'Toole said, he is not moving the amendment but there is an opportunity at this point &ndash; that is the idea behind Committee Stage &ndash; for the Minister of State and his officials to tidy up the section to make it clear what is the position.

      <P>I agree with what Senator McCarthy said and have committed to it. However, I have often been in a room full of people articulating that view yet, when they have the opportunity of nominating, they suddenly forget it. Even though I agree with Senator McCarthy, there is a difficulty in that one cannot say more than is in the Bill. If the only person considered suitable for a position is male does one instead choose a woman who is unsuitable? One must try to create role models.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" />I do not wish anyone to suggest I do not think any woman is qualified, which is not the case. The simple solution is if all nominees on the board can nominate two people, one can create role models and ensure there are no problems. However, we will find that many bodies can only nominate one person. I have argued on other legislation that, if nominating bodies could nominate two people, it could be a condition that one is male and one female. In this case, we can get close to what is suggested by Senator McCarthy. As long as bodies can only nominate one person, one is asking them to make a choice which may sometimes be unfair and inequitable. There is another side to this argument.</P>

      <P>I am dismayed that only four of the 21 members are women. I wonder what I have been doing for the last 30 years &ndash; obviously not half enough. Women have done a great deal of work in technology and science organisations and many students of scientific disciplines are women, including 60% of those in medicine and a high proportion in genetics. Role models are important so people can aspire to these positions. Science Foundation Ireland will be at the pinnacle of what one could hope to get into in terms of scientific research. Will the Minister of State tell the Minister, Deputy Harney, that we are dismayed by the composition of the board and that we hold out great hopes for the future? Senator O' Toole's idea about a body being able to nominate two people is an important one, but I do not know how it would sit with the Minister of State and the Minister.</P>

      <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State outline the rationale behind this thinking. Since becoming a Member of this House I have wondered why it has become fashionable to clobber politicians. In this instance, however, those being scapegoated are people who are already on the board and who may aspire to elected office. If these individuals are already on <Col N="423" />the board, I presume it is because they have the relevant expertise and why should they be disbarred from holding elected office on these grounds? The State is riddled with anomalies in this regard and I will come to deal with one or two of them in a moment.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the section is that the process will also work in reverse and that elected representatives will be prevented from taking a place on the board. Politicians are over-laden&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;with registers of interests and declarations. Given that we all comply with the law of the land in regard to registering or declaring interests, I do not see a problem. Members are aware of semi-State bodies, the boards of which include some excellent politicians. I know of one elected politician who represents Senator Leyden's party in my part of the country and who was an excellent appointment to the board of Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>There are directors of a company that is, to a large extent, owned by a semi-State body who are also trustees of that body's shareholding. If people hold shares in their own beneficial interests and are, in addition, trustees who represent all of us, they must surely have a conflict of interest. However, the situation to which I refer continues to obtain. That is the unacceptable side of the coin. I am just trying to find a happy medium and I do not see why politicians must be automatically disbarred from sitting on the board. I wish to hear the Minister of State address that point.</P>
      <P>Standards should obviously be the same across all State and semi-State companies and bodies, but that is clearly not the case. To borrow language that would be a lot more familiar to my colleague, Senator O'Toole, the entire issue is somewhat of a scata bullán. Do Members know what is a scata bullán?</P>

      <P>There is no even-handedness in the approach taken in this section. In the absence of such even-handedness across the State services, I strongly object to the section and look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister of State that a provision should have been included to allow members of local authorities to sit on the board. He may be pleased to note that members of prison visiting committees may also be members of Seanad Éireann, Dáil Éireann, the European Parliament or a local authority. To disbar people who may be eminent professors, scientists or researchers from being members of the board if they are elected to a local authority is grossly unfair. I accept that Members of these Houses or the European Parliament should be disbarred because they have a full-time commitment to their work and it is extremely difficult to find the time to be both a legislator and a research scientist. As soon as an individual becomes a member of a local authority, he or she will be disbarred even though he or she may be providing a tremendous service to the board in terms of research.</P>
      <P>As local authority members will possibly be excluded from membership of either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament, it is surely going too far to force people to decide between continuing as members of a research board or becoming members of a local authority. There is nothing inconsistent about being a member of this board while also serving on a local authority. This may not affect many individuals; it may not arise at all.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State, however, to discuss this with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to see if this provision can be removed. I am happy to concur with the exclusion from the board of Members of the Oireachtas, who have enough commitments already. It would also be inconsistent if Members of the Oireachtas had to resign from local authorities but would be eligible to participate on boards of this quality and size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much precedent for this. Some Bills have excluded members of local authorities from boards, while others have not. Most Bills have excluded Members of the Oireachtas from such boards, there is a clear precedent for that. If one looks at the legislation passed in these Houses over the years, one will find that different Departments have different requirements in this <Col N="425" />regard. Some Departments have not disbarred local authority members from being members of State or semi-State boards. Members of local authorities can become members of the boards of IDA Ireland, Bord Fáilte, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and other bodies, so why should they be excluded from this particular board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout the previous session, I opposed the inclusion of provisions of this nature in every Bill that came before the House. Such provisions are appalling. On the Order of Business, a Member referred to the pressure politicians are under to complete so many declarations of interests and so on. On each occasion a provision that oppresses, deprecates and diminishes politicians and makes them inferior to everybody else comes before the House, it is supported unanimously. If ever a group of individuals needed a union or shop steward to look after them, it is the Members of these Houses. I have never seen such a shower in my life. As soon as anybody kicks us in the teeth, we invite them to do it again.</P>
      <P>How dare anybody tell Members of this House that they may not sit on the board. A ridiculous argument has been put forward that Members are too busy. If the people who will eventually constitute the membership of this board were not already as busy as politicians, however, they should not even be considered for membership of the board. These will be people who have already proven themselves and demonstrated their commitment elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I agree with everything Senator Leyden said about local authority members, but exactly the same argument applies to Members of the Houses. I am sick and tired of this. I ask the Minister of State to reply to the following observation, although I know the answer he will give. I guarantee the House that this provision was not included in the draft Bill that left the Minister of State's Department to go to the parliamentary counsel. It is the invention of the counsel and, perhaps, the Department of Finance, but I will guarantee that it was not included by the Minister of State's Department. I am sure the Minister of State will confirm this if he is allowed to respond to the point. I know for certain that this is the case. I put it to the Minister of State, however, that this provision is not required in the legislation. Has anybody consulted with the people who will ultimately run this body? What objection do they have to politicians? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be straight about the real objection to including politicians on the board. A politician who was also a member of the board of Science Foundation Ireland would be in a position to return to the Houses and inform us that its budget was being cut to pieces, that it had not been allowed to take on a particular project or that it was not in a position to realise the goals it <Col N="426" />set out to achieve. The board would be improved by allowing this.</P>
    <P>This provision is there so that political parties will not abuse the nomination system by crowding it with their nominees. This is a very good reason for having it, but it is not a good reason for disbarring public representatives. I am sick and tired of everybody around here contributing further to and reinforcing the cynicism that exists in Irish life towards public representation. If Members of the Oireachtas took a bit of pride in their work, stood up to criticism and put forward their arguments, we would be a lot better at what we do. Being made doormats by everybody who chooses to criticise us is not part of what we do. We should come out fighting and put the boot in hard and often to those who would criticise us so they will think twice about doing so the next time. This section is a classic example of putting down politicians.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that we do not have boards crammed with political nominees with nothing to offer, the nominations should go through a committee system, like the example provided by the US Congress. If a Member is proposed for membership of a board it could be questioned at a committee and a case for that Member would have to be made. The House has previously discussed this issue. This would mean it is not decided in party committee rooms or elsewhere, but neither would we deprive people of ability of the opportunity to make a commitment in certain areas.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that we should deal with this in this way. It is not good enough to disbar a certain group. I guarantee that if any group other than politicians were disbarred they would be appalled. Can one imagine the reaction if teachers, farmers or women were disbarred? It is seen as fine to kick politicians around, stand on them and steamroll them into the ground &ndash; nobody cares. This is the way we do business here and it demeans political life.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any Member of either House who is appropriate for this position, but that is not the case I am making. We are telling the public that democracy needs their commitment and we ask people to put their names on the ballot paper and do something to develop our society. This will be part of the infrastructure of Ireland in the future. There is no gain in this section and I think it should be removed. It is not included in all legislation. Senator Coghlan has raised an important point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite instructive to see who, other than elected politicians, is disbarred from membership of the board. Section 9(6) lists the only others to be disbarred:</P>
      <P>A member of the Board shall be disqualified from being such a member where he or she&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) is adjudicated bankrupt,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" />(<i>b</i>) makes a composition or arrangement with creditors,</P>
    <P>(<i>c</i>) is convicted of an indictable offence in relation to a company,</P>
    <P>(<i>d</i>) is convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty, or</P>
    <P>(<i>e</i>) is disqualified or restricted from being a director of any company (within the meaning of the Companies Acts, 1963 to 2001.</P>
    <P>There is no other specification of who can be on the board. Only politicians and the people I have listed are disbarred; it is a funny group to have put together. This does not even say that members of the board should have science or business backgrounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 prohibits Members of the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or local authorities from membership of the board. This is now a standard provision in legislation establishing a public body. Similar provisions apply to the board members of Forfás, IDA and Enterprise Ireland under the Industrial Development Act 1993 and the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998.</P>
      <P>It is important that people who deal with the agencies and ask whether matters are conducted on a political basis know the decisions of our industrial development agencies to grant substantial amounts of taxpayers' moneys are made on a purely independent basis and there is no taint of party or independent politics attached. It is a difficult position for a politician to be in, therefore it is better to exclude not just Members of the Oireachtas but also members of local authorities. It would be wrong to include one category of politician and exclude another; politicians at local and national level should be treated equally as far as the foundation is concerned. While I appreciate there are some boards on which this provision may not be appropriate, I feel it is appropriate where the dispensing of research grants is involved.</P>

      <P>No. What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;no taint of party or independent politics attached&rdquo;? We know what it means; it means we will be answering the question. All those boards on which this has happened are mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public cynicism is fuelled because while not nominating a Senator or Deputy, parties will appoint someone like the head of a comhairle ceantair, the implication being that he &ndash; although it is more likely to be a woman because the party would be concerned about gender balance &ndash; would not be tainted in any way. That someone is not a Member of the Oireachtas does not mean he or she is not political. A party gen<Col N="428" />eral secretary could be appointed under this legislation. It is not the case that people from within the Oireachtas could not do good work on this board.</P>
    <P>I am an Independent politician and I have nothing against party politicians. I admire the work they do. Members of a party could be nominated to the board and take decisions on the merits of a case without having to be tainted by their political beliefs.</P>
    <P>The thinking that has led us to this is what caused the problems in Northern Ireland. I was sick and tired telling teachers from Unionist and Nationalist backgrounds that they could work together to ensure the children in their schools got proper education without being tainted by their political views. The idea that one takes political views into every committee one sits on is wrong. One might as well talk about people not being able to go to bed in case they bring their political views with them. It does not make sense.</P>
    <P>If we are worried by things being tainted by political views, then we should find a way of filtering nominations to ensure this does not happen. Excluding all politicians and lumping them with the people Senator Henry listed will only delight those who think all politicians are crooks.</P>

      <P>I will try to encourage the Minister and the Government to examine the position regarding local authority membership. It means that a member of a town council in Boyle in County Roscommon or anywhere else, who might be a scientist or someone who could contribute greatly to the foundation, would be excluded from membership. A person would have to decide if he or she wished to become a member of this board and, having become a member, would have to resign if he or she became a member of a county council.</P>

If this is taken to its logical conclusion, a politician should not even be a Minister because he or she has to make difficult decisions. When I was Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing I was responsible for the awarding of many grants and, therefore, I was a politician as well as Minister.

      <P>Senator Quinn and I have objected to this stipulation in other Bills. Like Senator McCarthy, I cannot understand why a well qualified person, whose advice is worthwhile, should be appointed if that person cannot question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister, or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy. It might be vital that this person who has the expertise should be in the position to make his or her views known. I support all that Senator McCarthy has said.</P>

      <P>It is proposed not to accept this amendment. This is a standard provision in this type of legislation. Ministers are answerable to Parliament for policy, while the function of the director general is to carry out such policy. While the director general is responsible for the day-to-day management of the foundation, including accounts, etc., it would not be appropriate for a director general to question or express an opinion on any policy of the Government or a Minister when appearing before Oireachtas committees. The director general is not being muzzled. He or she can express his or her views to the appropriate bodies. However, when appearing before Oireachtas committees it is to deal with his or her function of managing the institution and not with policy, which is set down by the Government.</P>

      <P>This section may seem harsh. In reality it is important for a director general to carry out the policies of the Government. If he or she does not carry those out, there is no provision in the Bill to reprimand or fire the director general, merely a recommendation. There is no provision stating that if he or she does not carry out those policies or in any way disagrees with the Government, he or she would lose his or her position. It is important not to have independent republics when establishing boards like this. The Government makes the policy to be followed by the board. Such policy has the sanction of the Oireachtas and the Cabinet. It is generally a good provision and one to which most directors general would adhere, without needing to be directed in a Bill. However, it is no harm to remind them of their responsibilities.</P>

They have a responsibility to work towards Government policy. If they have difficulties with Government policy, they have ample opportunity to influence that policy at the meeting that would take place. We cannot have an employee, the director general, in conflict with the Government. A director general <Col N="434" />manages Government policy. A Government is elected to set policy.</P>

Why does this Bill state the director general shall not question or express an opinion? That is an affront to democracy. I do not accept the Minister's response or what the Government Senators have just said. We are passionate in the strong convictions we have on this issue. What would happen if, for example, the Minister, in the opinion of the director general, was doing something that was not right and if the director general, who, I presume, will be appropriately qualified and be very expert, was not able to question or express an opinion before a committee of Dáil Éireann, which has to be the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to the appropriation accounts?

      <P>The amendment changes the term &ldquo;member of his or her household&rdquo;, which is an outdated phrase, to &ldquo;connected relative&rdquo;. We discussed the issue and have found a precedent for the use of a better word. The text is based on section 29 of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001. Where a question arises in relation to compliance with these disclosure requirements, that question shall be determined <Col N="435" />by the board and the outcome shall be recorded in the minutes. We accept the amendment to amendment No. 12 tabled by Senator Henry which proposes to delete &ldquo;the spouse&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the parent, spouse,&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for accepting my amendment to amendment No. 12. Although this is an important section, it will be difficult to implement. It is probably advisable that a quorum of the board consists of five and that its committees may include members other than members of the board. The reason I take this view relates to my efforts to try to keep up to date with medical research. A few years ago, Dr. Mary Angel, the then editor of a journal about which I am particularly enthusiastic, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, introduced a policy by which the findings of drug trials would not be published if anyone involved in them had a beneficial interest in the drug under examination. However, after about two years the journal found it impossible to keep to its policy because so many people had some involvement with the companies which owned the drugs under examination. Science Foundation Ireland will have considerable difficulty in ensuring that the people involved on the fringes &ndash; employees and so forth &ndash; or connected relatives do not have a beneficial ownership in companies, particularly as so many people own shares.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that small amounts of money or distant connections to companies, for example, through a pension fund, which could not be regarded as influencing the decision of a person, are acceptable. While I accept the need for this section, I do not underestimate the problems people will encounter in trying to avoid falling foul of it. In the past, Harvard researchers could not own more than $50 dollars of stock in a product or drug on which they were undertaking research. Right or wrong, this threshold was increased. One has to be concerned by the possibility that people will be influenced by personal investments they hold in companies manufacturing a device, drug, or development which they are examining. This is a difficult area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to accept my amendment. I am slightly concerned, however, by the use of the word &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;connected relative&rdquo;. I recall a similar discussion on family connections during the debate on a Bill being taken by the previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, which did not include the word &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; in its definition of connected relative. The Minister pointed out it would be impossible for him to know about everything in which his ten siblings were involved. It could easily arise that a person's siblings are involved in enterprises without that person's knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision may prove difficult to police in <Col N="436" />practice. Nevertheless, I accept the spirit of the section and agree that it is necessary. I welcome the arrangements for committees which provide that people other than board members may be appointed. Without this provision, one could have trouble ensuring their composition is sufficiently broad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made every effort to encompass every eventuality. The points the Senator made are important and her interpretation has been accepted. It is realistic to expect persons to be aware of their responsibilities regarding possible connections of close relatives. It is difficult to be definitive, however, given the nature of current relationships. One could include a person's partner's siblings or parents, for example, but where does one draw the line? It is difficult to define a connected relative. I commend the amendments, which try to close a loophole.</P>

The Government has the power to refuse approval, to approve the amount proposed with conditions or to approve a lesser amount. It does not have the power to increase the amount of the grant proposed.

      <P>I thank all Members for their valuable contributions and their good will towards the establishment of Science Foundation Ireland. As reflected in the debate today and on Second Stage, Ireland's sustained economic growth and prosperity will depend on establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation as well as excellence in research and development and a globally competitive knowledge-based economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 30 years Ireland has moved from being an agriculture-based economy to an economy driven largely by our success in attracting high technology investment. In that period we <Col N="443" />excelled in making products invented and developed by others. That approach has helped us to become a modern, confident economy which in the past decade has been the envy of much of the rest of the world but that strategy will not sustain us into the future.</P>
    <P>Industrial revolutions in the past have been based on coal and oil and most recently they have resulted from silicon-based electronics. The new revolution will be based on the creation, dissemination and application of knowledge and ideas. While we may lack the natural resources which would have allowed us to be leaders in past industrial revolutions we will be able to strive for leadership in the knowledge age. By growing, attracting and retaining the people who will create the knowledge underpinning future competitiveness and effectively utilising and commercialising that knowledge, we will continue to create highly skilled well-paying jobs for our increasingly educated labour force. Support through SFI for research will be central to that mission.</P>
    <P>SFI has already funded over 80 researchers, many from Ireland, with some of the largest Government grants for individual scientists in the world. With this support, eminent researchers from Belgium, Canada, England, Japan, Scotland, Switzerland and the US have been attracted to our universities and institutes of technology. This blend of talent from inside and outside Ireland will speed up our scientific capacities and competitiveness.</P>
    <P>We must now move our economy to a new plane, founded on a strong research ethic. We need to concentrate our resources on innovating and developing the ideas that underpin the products and service of the future.</P>
    <P>The setting up of Science Foundation Ireland is an ambitious project and will lead to a sustained, continuing transformation of the level of Irish scientific and engineering research and raise the perceptions and possibilities for scientific exploration nationwide. I am grateful to Senators for their support and I appreciate their co-operation in completing all Stages of the Bill so speedily.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on getting the Bill through the House this afternoon. If he had not explained it so carefully we might have been here much longer. I congratulate him on the way he dealt with the Bill. It is wonderful that it is going through. The Tánaiste, the Minister of State and the Government are to be congratulated on ringfencing the money for this research and development, which is so important for our future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we cannot stop with what we have now. I do not read the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> very often but the other day it carried the results of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development survey on 15 year <Col N="444" />old students. It is the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA, and it looks at the assessment of students' average reading, mathematics and scientific literacy in the 21 most developed countries in the world. We are well above the OECD average but why are Japan, South Korea, Finland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Britain ahead of us? We must improve and get up there. It is fine to be well above the average &ndash; the United State and Germany are below the average &ndash; but we have to ensure our 15 year olds are at the top of the tree.</P>
    <P>We are putting a huge emphasis and investment into this area. We should not just look at what we have established today, we should consider what is going on in all areas of education and science. I have been pressing the Department about the establishment of a science museum for as long as I can remember. We talk about getting children interested in physics, chemistry and mathematics, but there must be something tangible that we can show them. Members must have seen the announcement about the giraffe being stuffed at the Museum of Natural History. Scores of children and adults visit that museum every day. If something is interesting for people to look at, they will go to see it and become enthusiastic. It is essential that we build from the bottom, not only in terms of launching the science foundation but also in terms of establishing a science museum which children can visit and which will interest people.</P>
    <P>We must encourage our schools to look closely at science. We are concerned about the drop in numbers taking chemistry, physics and mathematics at higher level. We must consider all these areas in order that we do not have a science foundation with nothing to back it up. I congratulate the Government and the Minister of State for all they have done to establish the foundation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, for their contribution to the debates on this excellent Bill. I also compliment my colleagues in the House for their work. In the past I brought Bills through the Seanad and I always found it worthwhile to introduce a Bill here because it benefits from the input and expertise of our colleagues from Trinity College. They have earned their money today. Although their franchise is restricted, they have qualifications which are of benefit in terms of discussing legislation such as the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This excellent Bill will create employment opportunities and the contributions from all sides of the House to the debate on it have been worthwhile. The Minister of State considered the <Col N="445" />amendments put down and the discussions on them and the Bill has been enhanced by them.</P>

      <P>Is pribhléid dom bheith anseo chun an Bhille seo a chur os comhair an Tí.</P>
      <P>The Bill I am bringing before the Seanad today seeks to modernise the Opticians Act 1956, as there have been no substantive amendments to that Act since its provisions came into force in 1959. During our deliberations, one of my Department officials remarked that this Bill has been awaited for 30 years. There is now a pressing need to bring the legislation up to date with the modern practise of optometry, while advancing the interests of the consumer and ensuring that effective precautions are taken to safeguard the health of the public. I hope it will, therefore, receive the full support of the House.</P>
      <P>It is important to remind ourselves of the background to the regulation of the practice of optometry in Ireland. The primary purpose of the 1956 Act was to protect the public by a number of mechanisms. Those qualified to practise or those who, on the introduction of the Bill, were deemed to be experienced enough to practise now had to be registered. There was a commitment to fostering a continual improvement in the education and training of entrants to the professions. A set of rules was devised under the Act to control the activities of registered opticians and sanctions were put in place which would enable the Opticians Board to discipline those persons who breached the provisions of the Act, or the rules of the board as approved by the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of legislation to regulate the practice of optometry was given impetus by the creation of the National Health Service in the United Kingdom in the late 1940s. When the NHS was established, central professional committees were set up simultaneously to assess the applications of those who wished to be approved <Col N="446" />as service providers under the new system. In the case of the profession of optometry, some of those who applied had no formal training or qualification. They were, therefore, deemed by the central profession committees to have inadequate competence to act either as ophthalmic opticians or dispensing opticians in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Consequently, an influx of persons who claimed to be ophthalmic opticians and who had been excluded from the National Health Service arrived in Ireland, where there were no barriers to their activities at that time. As evidence of these matters built up, the then Minister for Health and his officials accepted the need for legislation to ensure adequate standards of training and education for those entering the professions, and controls on their activities and behaviour. The Opticians Bill was subsequently introduced in July 1955 and was passed in 1956. Following the appointment of the first Opticians Board and approval by the Minister for Health of the rules made under the Act, the provisions came into force in 1959.</P>
    <P>I now want to look in detail at the main provisions of the Bill. First, the title &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo; will be used in place of &ldquo;ophthalmic optician&rdquo;. There is no issue of principle involved in this change of title and the purpose of this amendment is to give a legislative basis to the use of the more modern title of optometrist.</P>
    <P>Sections 24, 25, 33 and 34 of the Principal Act will be amended to provide that being of good character and not having been declared bankrupt are requirements for the registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians trained both within and outside the European Union. In addition, having not been prohibited or suspended from practising because of a conviction for a criminal offence or serious misconduct in connection with the carrying out of professional duties will also be a requirement for registration for both professions.</P>
    <P>Sections 24, 25, 33 and 34 are also being adjusted to provide for the registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians in different categories: those trained in the EU; and those trained outside the EU. These provisions will correlate with the terms of the EU directives on mutual recognition of professional education and training, which were transposed into Irish law by S.I. 1 of 1991 and S.I. 135 of 1996.</P>
    <P>One of the main provisions of the Bill will be to deregulate the sale of ready-made reading glasses and to provide for their wider and cheaper distribution. Under the current legislation, only a registered medical practitioner or a registered optician may prescribe and/or dispense spectacles. In 1993, the Opticians Board adopted rules under which a registered optician could sell spectacles without prescription where &ldquo;the spectacles are intended to correct, remedy or relieve the condition known as presbyopia.&rdquo; I hope my pro<Col N="447" />nunciations are accurate; these terms show that health issues cover a very wide spectrum.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Attorney General previously advised that legislation to deregulate the sale of ready-made reading glasses was urgently required to avoid a potential liability in damages should litigation by the European Commission be instigated, as was proposed, and prove successful. My Department was subsequently advised, through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, that the Commission had decided to close the case. It is assumed that the Commission took this decision on the basis of our proposal to deregulate. However, under the existing legislation, the potential for action to be taken by private citizens in the Irish courts remains. In fact, a case was heard by the High Court in December 2002 and my Department is currently awaiting judgment on it.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Opticians (Amendment) Bill 2002, the specific details of how the sale of ready-made reading glasses will be deregulated is as follows. While section 49(1) of the Principal Act, which regulates the sale of spectacles, will remain unchanged, its provisions will no longer apply to the sale of ready-made reading spectacles by unregistered persons.</P>
    <P>The Bill redefines spectacles to exclude ready-readers, afocal sunglasses and afocal goggles and defines ready-made reading glasses separately. The separation of ready-readers from the definition of spectacles in the Act, has the effect of excluding them from the provisions of section 49(1). I should point out that contact lenses with or without focal power are included in the definition of spectacles and their sale will remain regulated.</P>
    <P>It was originally proposed that the sale of ready-made reading glasses should be subject to an age restriction and accompanied by the stipulation that clients must be advised that ready-readers are not a substitute for normal eye examinations. However, after consultation and detailed consideration, it was decided that the above proposals would not be included for the following reasons: it was realised that there would be practical difficulties with enforcement among sellers who are not registered with the Opticians Board; these stipulations are not enforced in other EU jurisdictions; imposing a labelling requirement would place an unfair burden on the industry; and, while worthy, these proposals are not medically necessary. The liberalisation of the sale of ready-made glasses already applies in the majority of member states of the European Union and should find favour with the general public.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, the Opticians Board has expressed concern over the lack of disciplinary powers to deal with allegations of professional misconduct or unfitness to practise against registered opticians. The existing legislation provides two <Col N="448" />categories of fines, reflecting the fact that certain offences under the Act are more serious than others. The amounts payable in the two categories are derisory by modern standards. For first offences, fines are £20 and £10 and, for second and subsequent offences, they are £100 and £50, respectively. It is proposed to provide for fines to range between &euro;500 and &euro;3,000, respectively. This will enable the board to apply reasonable discipline in an effort to ensure that those registered under the Act, as well as those commercial interests who may employ them, are obliged to behave in a manner which will contribute to the protection of the public by ensuring proper standards of practice and behaviour.</P>
    <P>The amendments to section 48(1) concern the provision of treatment and the prescription and administration of drugs. Under section 48(1) of the Principal Act, optometrists are prohibited from treating diseases of the eye or prescribing or administering drugs. The existing section 48(1)(<i>a</i>) prohibits the treatment of any disease of the eye and this is interpreted to mean that optometrists are precluded from undertaking even very minor procedures which would be otherwise legitimately done by a lay person, such as, for example, removing dust from the eye.</P>
    <P>Section 48(1)(<i>b</i>) of the existing legislation places an absolute prohibition on the prescription and administration of drugs by a registered optometrist who is not also a registered medical practitioner. However, in modern optometry practice it is not possible to conduct a proper examination of the eye without dilation of the pupil, which requires the use of mydriatic drugs. One effect of such drugs is to freeze the accommodation of the eye, that is, to reduce the ability of the eye to change focus. In practice, optometrists are interpreting the 1956 Act to the effect that the use of such drugs is lawful because it refers to the administration of drugs whose purpose is to paralyse the accommodation of the eye. Optometrists contend that paralysing the eye is not the purpose, but the effect, of their professional activities.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to remove the absolute prohibition on the prescription and administration of drugs in order to allow optometrists to carry out their professional function, while stopping short of facilitating their medical treatment of an injury or disease of the eye. However, in order to limit the use of drugs by optometrists, the following additional changes are being made in conjunction with the deletions of paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of section 48(1). Article 14 of the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 1996 will be amended, simultaneously as the Bill is enacted, to ensure that opticians will have limited access to just three diagnostic drugs. Under the amended regulations, optometrists will be unable to carry out therapeutic treatment as they will not be permitted access to therapeutic drugs. Control of the use of certain medicines by <Col N="449" />opticians would be put clearly within the remit of the Minister for Health and Children, and would safeguard against the use of potentially dangerous drugs in future. In addition, the regulations will stipulate that optometrists may use these drugs in the course of their professional practice only.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in the revised section 48(1)(<i>c</i>) there will be a continued prohibition on diagnosing diseases. It is also proposed to introduce an amendment in this subsection which will state that if an optometrist suspects the presence of a condition or a disease which requires medical attention, he or she will be obliged to inform the patient of this and recommend that the patient consult a registered medical practitioner. The new requirement for the referral of patients to medical practitioners where injury or disease is suspected will be indicative of best practice.</P>
    <P>The question of striking a balance has not been easy to resolve and there have been extensive consultations with the Opticians Board and the College of Ophthalmologists. At a recent meeting with the college, in which the president outlined the difficulties which many ophthalmologists have with the use of the word &ldquo;treatment&rdquo; in section 12(<i>b</i>)(4) of the Bill, I gave an undertaking to have my Department re-examine this area. Having examined the subsection in question and having consulted with the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, I will be proposing an amendment on Committee Stage to delete the words &ldquo;or treatment of the eye&rdquo; from section 12(<i>b</i>)(4).</P>
    <P>The decision to proceed with the provisions allowing optometrists to use certain drugs in the course of their professional practice was influenced in part by the fact that the UK General Optical Council permits the use of drugs by optometrists for diagnostic purposes, and is proposing to extend their provisions to allow optometrists to use drugs for therapeutic purposes also. The UK College of Ophthalmologists has accepted the General Optical Council's decision on diagnostic drugs.</P>
    <P>I have recognised from the start that unanimity on the issue of the use of drugs by optometrists would be very difficult to achieve. There are those who would wish to see a more restrictive approach and others who would wish to see a more liberal approach. However, I would hope that the Department's previous concessions and the proposed amendment, which I have just outlined, will enable a level of compromise, if not consensus, to be reached. Indeed, those representing optometrists were very clear in their correspondence that they were not talking about treatment, that they themselves were stopping short of treatment also. Therefore I feel I have got the balance correct in terms of how we have configured the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce this short Bill to the Seanad. I commend it to the House and I look <Col N="450" />forward to the ensuing debate and any helpful suggestions which may arise from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The original Opticians Act, which this Bill is amending, dates from 1956. It seems it has been 48 years since this area has been visited. In researching this Bill, I found that the then Minister was Mr. O'Higgins of the coalition Government and that prior work was done in the previous Government by Dr. Ryan.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of that Act was to bring order and regulation to the whole area of optical treatment. It revolved around the competing groups of diagnostic ophthalmic opticians, dispensing opticians and the medical profession. There seemed to be many problems at the time with very unqualified people making great claims about their optical products and their own abilities in the whole area. It was unregulated and, for somebody like myself who wears glasses, even dangerous to the visual and financial health of people. After the initial problem of how to deal with people involved in aspects of the business for some considerable length of time in a reputable way, eventually we arrived at the regulatory position we have today.</P>
      <P>The 1956 Act led the way for this country and indeed was copied in similar legislation in the UK. The success of the 1956 Act can be seen in the fact that we have not needed to revisit the issue until now. The Act formed the basis for the continued development of the profession for their good and that of the public at large. We now have a tightly controlled area with the Irish Optical Association playing a key role. There are some changes necessary after such a substantial timespan and that is understandable.</P>
      <P>The association to which I refer is now the Association of Optometrists, Ireland. According to a dictionary, optometrist means sight tester, which is quite relevant. This is in response to the world trend towards the use of this more definitive title for the profession formerly known as optician.</P>
      <P>The early educational base was weak but it progressed, with the 1956 Act and since, into a four-year full-time diploma course in ophthalmic optics and it is now getting degree status. This is in line with other qualifications such as in nursing.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposed amendments to the 1956 Act which are in line with the development of closer links with other countries, especially the EU, with monetary changes and with the updating of penalties and the recognition of optical aids such as contact lenses which were not available in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Register of Ophthalmic Opticians is to be known as the Register of Optometrists in response to the international acceptance of this denomination. All those currently registered will be re-registered, recognising that they have the necessary qualifications from Ireland, the EU or <Col N="451" />internationally. The amendments likewise deal with the registration of dispensing opticians in Ireland, the EU and internationally operating in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 11 which deals with the modernising of monetary penalties for breaches of regulations. Also the pound is replaced by the euro.</P>
    <P>While I am sure that the amendments have been drawn up with due care and consideration, I am confused by section 12, which states:</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Principal Act is amended by&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) substituting the following for subsection (1)&ndash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) A registered optician who is not a registered medical practitioner shall not suggest by any written or oral statement or by any action that the registered optician has made or is capable of making a medical diagnosis of a disease of the eye or that, in relation to the treatment of the eyes, the registered optician has done or is capable of doing anything other than&ndash;</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) in the case of a registered optometrist, the prescribing or provision of spectacles, or</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) in the case of a registered dispensing optician, the provision of spectacles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That appears to me to include the very restrictive element of the 1956 Act, where a registered optician who is not a registered medical practitioner shall not suggest by any written or even oral statement a medical diagnosis of the eye.</P>
    <P>The section further states:</P>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) inserting the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Where in the course of an eye examination or treatment of the eye, a registered optician referred to in subsection (1) suspects the presence of a disease or condition of the eye, the registered optician shall inform the patient of this and recommend that the patient consult with a registered medical practitioner.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister intends to delete the words &ldquo;or treatment of the eye&rdquo;. Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will propose an amendment to delete the words &ldquo;or treatment of the eye&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section seems to make common sense since if an optometrist sees something untoward in a patient's eye, he or she will alert the patient to this. Oddly, the title &ldquo;optician&rdquo; is used in section 12(<i>b</i>)(4) when earlier amendments have been made to substitute the word <Col N="452" />&ldquo;optometrists&rdquo;. Why continue to use the word &ldquo;optician&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Great progress is being made in this area of health care, particularly in terms of the use of laser operations. With an increasingly elderly population, this can contribute significantly to their quality of life. Hopefully, we can also export these technological advances to the less fortunate in Africa and the Third World. I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is timely legislation. It comes more than 40 years after the enactment of the 1956 Act, which served well in the situation that obtained at that stage. However, many sections of the Act are now outmoded and the Bill addresses that problem in a comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>I am informed by a representative of the Association of Optometrists, Ireland, that it welcomes the Bill. It is difficult to achieve perfection when drafting legislation and the association has communicated some slight concerns to the Minister, which, I am sure, he will address on Committee Stage. He has already mentioned one such change.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Opticians (Amendment) Bill. I remind Senator Feighan that old habits die hard. It will take time for the substitution of the old term &ldquo;optician&rdquo; with that of &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo; to be accepted. The Minister's intention is clearly defined in the Bill, which is long overdue, and I thank Senator Feighan for welcoming it.</P>
      <P>Too many people suffer poor eyesight unnecessarily. The Opticians Act has remained unchanged since 1956, even though there was agreement on a number of amendments as long ago as 1969. This Bill provides for modernisation in this sector of health provision. The proposed amendments provide for a number of changes to the original legislation which will bring these health professions into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the legislation have already been outlined and if I repeat them it is only to underline their importance. The Bill proposes to deregulate the sale of ready-readers. The Association of Optometrists has said that the deregulation of ready-readers should not be a substitute for proper eye testing. We are reliably informed that their protracted use can lead to injury to eyesight. Who am I to contradict those who are professionally qualified to make such judgments? The Bill also proposes to re-title ophthalmic opticians as optometrists in order to ensure that the registration of optometrists and dispensing opticians is clearly in accordance with EU regulations and requirements, to update monetary penalties and to remove the absolute prohibition on treatment and prescription or administration of drugs by optometrists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 amends the definition of spectacles to include ready-made reading spectacles, afocal sunglasses and afocal goggles and to clarify that <Col N="453" />contact lenses, with or without focal powers, are included in the definition. Like all fair minded people, I welcome that provision.</P>
    <P>The sale of ready-made spectacles is proposed to be deregulated and that is welcomed by the Association of Optometrists. This deregulation follows the example of many other countries in the EU and provides for more ready availability of these items. We are bringing the Irish position into line with that which obtains in other member states. While the Association of Optometrists, Ireland, supports this amendment, it highlights the fact that the use of such aids is not a substitute for a thorough eye examination. They should not be used for extensive periods.</P>
    <P>The deletion of section 48(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of the 1956 Act ends the absolute prohibition on treatment and prescription or administration of drugs by optometrists. It was ludicrous that a member of the community could remove dust from the eye, but people with a suitable qualification, such as opticians, were prohibited from doing so in their place of consultation or treatment. Section 41(<i>c</i>) is being inserted to provide that where an optometrist detects a condition or disease which requires medical attention, he or she can inform the patient and advise him or her to visit a doctor. This situation already obtains in the nursing sector. A nurse, by virtue of their professional qualifications or experience, can observe signs and symptoms in a patient and will advise the patient to consult their general practitioner. If it is in a hospital setting, the nurse will inform the doctor. This provision is only consistent with common sense, but, heretofore, that was not the case.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome this amending legislation. During their four year degree course, all optometrists receive both academic and practical training in pharmacology and the use of drugs in the eye. It does not make sense that after receiving this education it should go to waste. Members of this profession were under-employed under the old legislation. The Minister is recognising the worth of optometrists in removing this stipulation.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the drugs scheduled are for topical application only and may be used by an optometrist only in the course of his or her professional practice; they cannot be taken orally or injected. In addition, these drugs are not for resale and may not be given to the patient. This will enable optometrists to carry out their jobs fully and to the best of their ability. They will be able to look after a patient up to the point of facilitating medical treatment of injury or disease of the eye.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 10 amend sections 24, 25, 33 and 54 of the 1956 Act to bring their provisions into line with the terms of the EU directives on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and to provide that being of good character, for example, that they do not have a conviction for a serious misconduct, should be a requirement of <Col N="454" />registration. Nobody could argue with that. It is consistent with the type of good practice that relates to the registration of professional persons. It will provide the Opticians Board with the power to assess the qualifications of professionals both from within and outside the EU. The association is happy with this provision. It will introduce equity and transparency into the profession of ophthalmology and protect the practitioner from employing and being associated with unprofessional optometrists. The public will also be protected from being cared for by optometrists and opticians who have been guilty of malpractice in the past. If a person has blotted their copybook, this section makes sure they are left where they should be.</P>
    <P>Re-titling &ldquo;ophthalmic opticians&rdquo; as &ldquo;optometrists&rdquo; is covered by sections 3 and 4 of the Bill and opticians will be re-titled as outlined.</P>
    <P>The monetary penalties were ludicrous. The amounts payable under current legislation are £12 and £20 and for second and subsequent offences £50 to £100. One would give that to a garsún to do a message and there is no incentive not to indulge in malpractice. What is proposed by way of penalties, as outlined by the Minister, is common sense. This will introduce a deterrent to any rogue optician who may attempt to rip off a patient. Any optometrist or optician guilty of malpractice will pay the price, which is as it should be. This will improve the already excellent service provided to the public and prevent any unprofessional opticians or optometrists from spoiling the good name of these professionals.</P>
    <P>On 23 September 2002, the European Parliament and the Council adopted the programme for Community action in the field of public health. The programme came into effect on 1 January 2003 and its three main areas of activity are improving health education, responding rapidly to health threats and tackling health determinants. Commissioner David Byrne has played a pro-active role and has been heavily involved in the drafting and enforcement of EU policy in the field of public health. Some &euro;300 million has been devoted to the programme. This new public health programme embodies an integrated approach towards better health policies. The Opticians (Amendment) Bill 2002 is yet another example of the positive effects of the Europe Union on member states.</P>
    <P>There are a number of positive aspects of this Bill for the public. Perhaps everyone in this House has personal experience of eye disease in his or her family. A national free glaucoma-screening campaign is already up and running and Fight for Sight is manned by nurses and optometrists who travel around Ireland to raise public awareness of the seriousness of this eye disorder. As many as 12% of those screened for glaucoma have been referred to medical specialists and some 5% have had their sight saved thanks to the treatment they received.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" />Legislation such as this will regulate and improve the quality of eye care in the State. I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it to the House. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Senator Quinn.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the majority of the Bill's provisions, including the updating of the terminology, fines and the deregulation of ready-readers<b>. </b>While the institute of opticians has naturally been in contact with Members, I have also had contact from the college of ophthamologists. The Minister recognised their concerns about the use of the phrase, &ldquo;the treatment of eye disease&rdquo;, by stating that an amendment would be tabled by him on Committee Stage. I am glad of that because it saves my trying to fight for it.</P>
      <P>I share the concerns about the extension of the use of drugs for the eye. One thing that should cheer the Minister is that I wish fewer people could prescribe less rather that more and that, while these drugs affect the eye only, we must be careful that something that affects the eye does not have a systemic effect or have side-effects within the eye which we did not suspect at the time. For example, Chloramphenicol eye ointment was widely used at one stage until it was found to be capable of causing agranular cytosis. I used it, as did many others, and we thought it was wonderful. While one says these drugs are just being applied to the eye, the sight of the person is terribly important, as is their general health. We know that some of these drugs have side-effects and I am concerned that the local application may mask problems in the general system which, because the person does not have medical training, they will not recognise. I ask the Minister to consider these matters before Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister says this brings matters into line from an EU perspective. However, the only optometrists who can prescribe drugs in the EU are in the UK and the Netherlands. I do not know the situation in the Netherlands, but in the UK optometrists have to do an extra year in a hospital and an examination at the end of that year. We are not introducing that here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The drugs that optometrists want to prescribe are mainly local anaesthetics for the eye, as well as drugs that affect accommodation. The only reason for using drugs that affect accommodation is to examine the fundus of the eye. If one is examining the fundus of the eye, one is surely trying to diagnose the medical con<Col N="456" />dition. Diabetes is one of the most important problems regarding disease of the eye.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that optometrists will refer people to medical practitioners as they have done, but if people visiting optometrists are given the impression they are getting a full examination of the eye, they will have a sense of security that their retina has been looked at and any disease has been picked up. I would like to know more about why it is desirable that opticians should be in a position to examine the fundus and perhaps diagnose retinal diseases.</P>
      <P>These practitioners are also putting themselves in a situation where they are far more liable to litigation. Who will be held responsible if, after using drugs that affect accommodation, a disease of the retina is found? Will they be liable? They do not have medical training so they could not be expected to recognise these diseases but, having given the impression they are conducting more than an examination required for glasses, will they be liable under this Act if they miss any diseases present? I would like some guidance on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister said we will have to update the Medical Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 1996 to allow these drugs to be used and I want to know the view of the Irish Medicines Board and if it has been consulted.</P>
      <P>Optometrists are taking great responsibility upon themselves which I hope has been properly thought through. Even when using local anaesthetics on the eye one must be careful about warning people when they leave the examination not to get dust in their eye because they will not feel it. If they do not give these warnings, will they be liable for any damage done to the cornea? I hope these aspects have been carefully considered.</P>
      <P>While it might be a plus to allow people to prescribe for diagnostic purposes, people may think they have had a whole examination of their eye and any diagnosis of disease which may be systemic but which manifests itself in the eye, such as with diabetes, may be overlooked. I hate to sound like a doubting Thomas, but I see problems with patients perceiving they are getting a more extensive examination than they in fact are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for sharing her time with me. Listening to the Senator speaking reminds me of what a valuable asset it is to have such a variety of expertise among Members of this House. I will not attempt to touch on topics from that point of view. It is very interesting to think that this Bill amends legislation dating from 1956. I actually had a look at the 1956 Act, which was interesting. I know the Minister has experience of dealing with older Acts &ndash; I think he was involved in producing the Education Act 1998, which amended legislation dating back to 1831. Therefore, this is an easier Bill with which to deal in those terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" />Look at how the world has changed since then. When I first came to the Seanad, I examined every Bill to see whether I could detect anything in it with which I could be of help. Therefore, I looked out for the customer in every Bill. If it was a health Bill, I looked out for the patient; if it was an education Bill, I looked out for the student, and if it was a road traffic Bill, I looked out for the road user. When I looked at this Bill, I considered how the world had changed in my business since 1956. Back then I worked in a small grocery shop in the co-op in Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>In considering how the laws applying to the grocery business had changed since three aspects stood out. In those days the law did not allow competition, which was not in the public interest. Laws in regard to health and safety were very lax. There was no legislation in regard to best practice. They were the three headings under which I considered the Bill.</P>
    <P>First, there is the issue of competition. In those days there was what was called a closed shop &ndash; one could not compete in certain areas. Resale price maintenance prevented one from selling at a particular price. I, therefore, welcome the opening up of competition in the Bill, particularly with regard to reading glasses. I actually lost mine in Cape Town Airport last year but was able to purchase a pair at the airport for &euro;6. They were good enough to get me home. It is essential that we do not ban this. I welcome the legislation for allowing such openness.</P>
    <P>I then considered the legislation in terms of health and safety, on which I sought the advice of the Association of Optometrists, whose honorary secretary, Mr. Kevin Culliton, is present in the House. I realised that section 12 placed a statutory obligation on optometrists to inform patients if a disease or condition of the eye was detected. This has not been a statutory obligation up to now. The 1956 Act provided that optometrists should not treat any disease of the eye or administer any drug. The Bill relaxes some of the regulations in question &ndash; as Senator Henry talked about and the Minister for Health and Children explained &ndash; in a way that is quite permissible.</P>
    <P>The third consideration, on which the Minister touched, is whether we will have best practice. It appears the Minister has determined that the legislation is aimed at best practice in this area. I welcome the thinking behind the Bill and the Minister's willingness to consider amendments because it is not in the interests of optometrists to become involved in treatment other than of the sort referred to. I welcome the legislation, which will, after almost 50 years, ensure customers of optometrists will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to the House. He strikes a balance in bringing the Opticians (Amendment) Bill 2002 before us. As it is much easier to pronounce the word &ldquo;optician&rdquo; than &ldquo;optometrist&rdquo;, I will continue to <Col N="458" />use the word &ldquo;optician&rdquo;. I welcome the Bill which provides for a number of matters. First and foremost, it addresses the evolution of this whole branch of the health profession and brings its practitioners and their services into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>We can divide the amendments to the 1956 Act into two areas, one of which affects the public interest &ndash; other Senators and the Minister have referred, for example, to the sale of ready-readers and the use of restricted drugs &ndash; while the other allows the board to apply more realistic fees and, more importantly, access qualifications and professional standards both within and outside the European Union. I will not go through the entire Bill, which is short. As other Senators have taken time to go through it, rather than repeat what everybody else has said, I will touch briefly upon a few areas that I see as great achievements on the part of the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>It is great to see the deregulation of the sale of ready-readers, bringing us into line with other countries. At the same time, however, it is reassuring to know that the Association of Optometrists, in disseminating information to the public, will highlight the fact that the service is not a substitute for a thorough eye examination, on which it is to be commended because the onus is clearly back in its court in this regard. It is also good that we still have tight control over the sale of contact lenses and the use of prescription goggles and sun glasses. Last summer one of my young daughters went into Claire's Accessories in Dublin looking for transparent contact lenses. I asked her the reason she was looking for them and she told me that they made one's eyes look bigger. I went into the store with her but the lenses were not on sale. I am glad they are not because problems start when young teenagers do this.</P>
      <P>I shall refer briefly to the use of the three particular drugs that will now be used by the optometrist. I am very glad that the Minister has had the good sense to move in this area because I am sure he considered the four year degree course and the practical component students undertake as part of their training, which is concentrated on the use of drugs in relation to the eye. I cannot understand where Senator Henry is coming from but since 1959, the year I was born, this group has not seen an amendment to the legislation governing its profession. As a State, we owe a great debt to opticians. I am not aware of any optician who has been in trouble for misdiagnosing. My experience of opticians has always been that if they spot something, they will refer an individual on immediately. This legislation will allow them to do their job even more effectively. At long last, the Minister has given them the tools to carry out their work in a more professional manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like my colleague, Senator Glynn, I commend the Minister for bringing the Bill before the <Col N="459" />House. He has struck a balance, on which I congratulate him and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed and welcome their broad support for the legislation. We will deal with some of the points raised in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan welcomed the Bill, although he did suggest that section 12 was perhaps too restrictive. It is designed to achieve a balance by facilitating optometrists in terms of being able to examine for specific problems and use drugs in that process, while at the same time stopping short of treatment or a diagnosis of an eye disease or condition. It is carefully constructed to achieve this balance.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn welcomed the legislation. I know he was in discussion with a number of organisations that communicated their concerns to him. We have consulted with organisations in both disciplines and feel we have achieved the correct balance.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry primarily spoke about her concern about the extension of the use of drugs. This Bill does not extend the use of drugs and it does not change the parent legislation. Amendments to the Medicinal Regulations 1996 will facilitate the utilisation of the three drugs. This will happen almost as soon as the Bill is passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Drugs are used in diagnosis to ensure that the best possible examination can be carried out to gain information that might not otherwise be readily obtained. Cyclopentolate hydrochloride is a cycloplegic that acts on the muscle of the eye. It is used in making certain assessments of the eye and in promoting patient comfort. Tropicamide is used to facilitate a routine examination of the eye, achieved by dilating the pupil. Oxyburprocaine hydrochloride is a topical anaesthetic that produces surface anaesthesia within two minutes and its effect lasts for 20 to 30 minutes. Those are the drugs that will be facilitated in the context of an amendment to medicinal regulations.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry continually referred to people getting the impression that a full examination of the eye will take place. I do not think that is a fair reflection of what will happen or what is intended to happen. The Bill places a statutory obligation on optometrists, when they detect a problem, to immediately tell a person to seek further medical assistance from a medical practitioner or a consultant ophthalmologist. One could argue the Bill brings in extra protections in the form of these statutory obligations on optometrists. Under the Act, it would be wrong to give the impression that one is doing something more than is actually being done. I disagree with Senator Henry on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this as a relatively modest shift. Senator Henry is correct in saying that the <Col N="460" />Netherlands and Britain have moved in this respect. As already stated, Britain is seeking to go further. We have always had strong links with accepted practice in Britain and with its ophthalmology colleges, even though our colleges are separate. This has been in operation in Britain for a number of years and has not given rise to any concerns.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator Quinn's perspective. He made some interesting observations on the changes that have taken place during the past 50 years. He also pointed out that the Bill is pro-competition regarding ready-made glasses and has a strong element of health and safety built in, which is indicative of best practice. These are strong elements in this short Bill.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Feeney's concerns about pronunciation in this field, but practice and common usage will put paid to that. I welcome her support for the Bill and the fact that she pointed out it strikes a balance between deregulation of the ready-made glasses industry and consumer protection.</P>
    <P>This is a relatively short Bill which contains modest but important advances. I look forward to the Committee Stage debate on it. I thank the House for its consideration of Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I request the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to make a statement on the progress being made on the Carlow Regional Youth Service central youth facility.</P>
      <P>Carlow Regional Youth Service works to encourage and promote youth initiatives in the county. It offers a range of opportunities and supports designed to assist youth organisations and communities in the delivery of youth work. It also provides a number of services designed to meet the needs of young people in the county. The CRYS is responsible for running the Carlow drugs initiative, the youth at risk project, the special projects worker, the Carlow camp and teenage youth project, international exchanges, volunteer development, group and club development in sport, youth information services and the FÁS community employment programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" />It is proposed to redevelop the old library on Dublin Street in Carlow, which is currently the property of Carlow County Council. It has agreed to give the facility to the Carlow Regional Youth Services free of charge, once it is used for youth services. The development of such a facility will require funding of &euro;1.5 milion to &euro;1.7 million. It is planned to put in place a reception office, a youth information centre with access to computers and the Internet, a youth café with a kitchen, a computer room, an activity room, an exhibition performance area, a number of conference meeting rooms, offices for staff offering services from the centre and a child-minding facility, all of which will be wheelchair accessible.</P>
    <P>Carlow Regional Youth Service has offered to take on the role of developing and managing the project and managing the central youth facility when it is in place. The facility will be run according to the ethos agreed at the VEC young people's facilities and services fund sub-committee. The sub-committee agreed to assist the project in every way possible.</P>
    <P>There was a seizure of &euro;1.5 million worth of cannabis resin in Graiguecullen recently and a seizure of heroin in the nearby town of Athy yesterday. Those seizures prove the existence of the menace of drugs in the Carlow area and highlight the urgent need for such a youth facility to prevent young people from becoming exposed to the danger of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The main reason I tabled this matter on the Adjournment was to ascertain from where the necessary funding for this project would be available. Unfortunately, under the national development plan there is no specific heading under which groups such as the group seeking the establishing of this facility can apply for funding. There is the young people's facilities and services fund in the Minister of State's Department, but the required money for this project would not be available in that fund.</P>
    <P>The group met the Minister for Finance and explained its case to him. The group wonder whether money that will become available under the dormant bank accounts scheme could be ringfenced for this project. It will receive funding for the crèche from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but that will not be enough.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that the proposed centre will be in the middle of so-called Rapid area. While there is no specific funding available for this project under the Rapid programme, if that programme is to be worked fully, projects for places like Carlow and Graiguecullen, which are ear-marked under the Rapid programme, should be fast-tracked under the national development plan. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that the young <Col N="462" />people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 as part of the Government's overall strategy to tackle drug misuse. The fund aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them from the dangers of substance abuse. The target group for the fund are ten to 21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage, involvement in crime and/or drugs, etc.</P>
      <P>The main focus of the fund has been on the local drugs task force areas where integrated plans were prepared on the basis of detailed guidelines agreed by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. Local development groups were set up in each area and comprised representatives from the relevant local drugs task force, the local authority and the VEC. These plans were submitted for consideration, via the task forces, to the national assessment committee which is chaired by my Department. The plans were assessed against the guidelines agreed and recommendations were then made to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.</P>
      <P>There are 12 drugs task force areas in Dublin, including one in Bray, and there is one drugs task force area in Cork. Recognising that the drug problem is not confined to the local drugs task force areas, funding was also allocated to a number of urban areas, outside the task force areas, where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The areas selected were Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow. They were the only areas selected outside the drugs task force areas. The vocational education committees in these areas, and the health board in the case of Waterford, were asked to take the lead in developing integrated drug prevention strategies in consultation with relevant statutory and community-voluntary interests, on the basis of guidelines agreed by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.</P>
      <P>A separate allocation was also made to assist a number of voluntary organisations with a national or regional remit that have the capacity to deliver targeted education and prevention initiatives. Under this allocation, seven voluntary organisations were approved funding to deliver drug prevention education programmes, including peer education programmes, on a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amount of almost &euro;150 million has been provided under the national development plan to support measures under the fund. Since 1998, just over &euro;68 million has been allocated under round I of the fund. Of this amount, &euro;54.1 million has been allocated to local drugs task force areas <Col N="463" />while the urban areas of Galway, Waterford, Limerick and Carlow were allocated a further &euro;1.9 million. In addition, the voluntary organisations referred to above have been allocated &euro;0.6 million and implementation costs of &euro;2.5 million have also been allocated. The springboard initiative, which falls under the remit of the Department of Health and Children, was allocated an additional &euro;9.1 million. I have details of the types of projects funded, but they are not specific to Carlow.</P>
    <P>Applications have been sought from development groups in local drugs task force areas in relation round II of the fund in respect of facility projects only. The national assessment committee is currently examining the capital proposals submitted and decisions on round II will be made in light of the overall funding position for 2003. Arrangements for the other elements of round II, which will include seeking proposals from non-local drugs task force areas, have not yet been approved by the Cabinet committee.</P>
    <P>With respect to Carlow, an allocation of &euro;202,000 was made to Carlow in late 1999 under the fund. In late 2000, the development group in Carlow made a submission to the national assessment committee of the fund for the development of a central youth facility for the town and sought advice on how best to progress the project. It was informed then that it was not possible for additional funding to be made available under the fund at that time, outside their original allocation of &euro;202,000. My predecessor, the former Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, subsequently met representatives from Carlow Regional Youth Service in early 2001 to discuss its proposal.</P>
    <P>The Senator should note that the development group made a further submission to the national assessment committee in April 2001 seeking permission to use some of the funding allocated to it to develop the necessary plans to secure planning permission for the proposed youth facility. Following a meeting between representatives of the development group and the committee in May 2001, this proposal was approved and the decision was communicated to the Carlow development group.</P>
    <P>I am aware that drawings and costings for the proposed facility have been prepared and that Carlow Regional Youth Service is seeking significant funding from Government sources to enable the project to proceed. I understand that the cost of completing and fitting out the facility will be in the region of &euro;2 million. I am sure the Senator will appreciate that this is only one of a number of projects outside the local drugs task force areas that have signalled the need for a youth facility development in their areas and which have canvassed support from the fund over recent years.</P>
    <P>However, until such time as the Cabinet committee on social inclusion approves arrangements for round II of the fund for non-local drugs task <Col N="464" />force areas, I regret that the national assessment committee will not be in a position to consider proposals such as the Carlow youth facility project. It very much depends on round II allocations for the main local drugs task force areas, which are due and I hope will be made in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned dormant accounts. A separate board to collect and disburse money from such accounts has been established under the Department but it is independent. It is examining ideas about how it might allocate the money when it comes due. That will not be until late summer or autumn at the earliest. The Act under which the board was established specified certain areas in which the money could be spent. These include areas of disadvantage such as the one cited by the Senator. I imagine this would be one of the intentions of the board but its activities are only at a preliminary stage. It will probably dispense funds later in the year and while I do not know for sure, I imagine it will make public announcements in this regard. However, that will be in the second half of the year.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to appear to hog the fund, I emphasise that it was established to concentrate on drugs task force areas in Dublin. An argument was made for its extension to another four cities, which was done in a small way. It will be some time yet before we can make round II allocations and see if some additional funding can be given to those four cities or other places besides. Regional drugs task forces will be established in the coming months and arguments may well be made that areas under their remit should also share in the pot but that is in the future. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</P>

      <P>Despite many cash injections, Iarnród Éireann has unsuitable and unsafe passenger trains on its mainline network, especially on the Sligo and Westport lines. Locomotives break down regularly and people living in Connacht expect this as the norm. Passengers are considered second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>Recently a train on the Sligo-Dublin line was late and no apology was given. Carriages used on the line are unsafe and have no heating, despite the vast amounts of money allocated to Iarnród Éireann, of which we have waited four to five years to see any sign. The fact that the company undertook to investigate an incident on the Dublin-Cork line is an example of how it places greater emphasis on that line than on those to the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" />Will the Minister of State relay our grievances because we believe we are second-class citizens when it comes to rail travel to the north-west and west?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Feighan for sharing his time with me. I am delighted and proud as a Fianna Fáil Senator to acknowledge that the Sligo-Dublin line has received huge investment for line repair and new tracks under Fianna Fáil-led Governments. However, I am also a little sad to have to acknowledge that, while we have a wonderful line and a great track, the carriages and service leave a lot to be desired. As Senator Feighan pointed out the heating problem, I will not discuss it further. There is no catering service on the line. One cannot purchase hot food, despite the fact that the journey from Sligo to Dublin takes three hours. Breakfast or evening meals are not available.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago the chambers of commerce in the north-west campaigned and protested to keep the line open. They succeeded in doing so but, while the line remains open, the service is very poor and leaves a lot to be desired. All we ask is that the people of the north-west be given the service their fellow passengers enjoy in the west, south, south-west, east and south-east &ndash; everywhere except the north-west.</P>
      <P>I am also sad to say compensation arrangements are <i>ad hoc</i>. There have been instances where, when the company has known a train will be two hours late with passengers having to disembark and board a bus, vouchers have been given to passengers, usually to the value of &euro;5 off the price of the next train ticket. This is treating those who use the service as second-class citizens and is not right in this day and age.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for raising the issue. Generally, Iarnród Éireann was starved of investment for years. Significant amounts of money have been invested in recent years but initially they were spent on signalling and track renewal. The company's slogan, &ldquo;We're not there yet, but we're getting there&rdquo;, is true. The enormous investment it has received has mostly gone into signalling and track renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many carriages are on order but the company appears to lack them at present. Significant levels of funding have been and continue to be made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment in new rolling stock. In addition to the 38 new DART cars and the 20 diesel railcars delivered over the last two years, the first batch of 80 new diesel railcars was delivered recently. The balance will be delivered over coming months and go into service later this year after commissioning. In addition, 40 new DART carriages were ordered in 2002 and are being manufactured. On mainline rail, an order for 67 new intercity carriages was recently placed at a cost of &euro;115 million. This level of investment in new rolling stock, totalling <Col N="466" />approximately &euro;310 million, represents the most significant investment in new rolling stock for Iarnród Éireann in decades. Future additional rolling stock requirements of the company will be considered in the context of the strategic rail review, which the Minister hopes to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>Regarding the rolling stock on the Westport and Sligo lines, Iarnród Éireann has advised the Minister that the carriages used on the Westport route are Mark III vehicles acquired in the 1980s and that those used on the Sligo line date from the 1970s. The company has confirmed that these vehicles are air-conditioned and are safe for use on these services. While they might not be the best carriages in the world, it is not appropriate to raise concerns about their safety if engineers have given them a clean bill of health on those grounds</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has advised that the vehicles on these lines are occasionally replaced, for maintenance reasons, with older Craven carriages which were acquired in the 1960s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">

      <P>If a person catches a cold on a train, it cannot really be safe. If there is no heat, it would be possible to die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <P>The people down there are tough characters. That might happen to weak little Dubliners, but hardly to the people in question.</P>
      <P>Craven carriages, which have been in service since the 1960s, are occasionally used and weekend services are often augmented by their use. Iarnród Éireann recognises these carriages do not have the same comfort levels, but it has assured the Minister that they are safe for operation. The 67 new inter-city carriages that are on order will begin to enter service in 2005. These new carriages will facilitate the retirement of the older vehicles currently used on inter-city services.</P>
      <P>In addition, the entry into service later this year of the 80 diesel railcars, purchased for use on outer suburban routes, will release mark III carriages from those routes for use on inter-city services. This might give some temporary short-term relief. These new railcars will reduce the number of commuting passengers using key inter-city trains and will also be available to supplement inter-city rolling stock on Sundays. The Government is confident that the significant funding being made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment in its infrastructure and rolling stock will improve the safety of the network, increase the passenger capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of Iarnród Éireann services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-term future seems bright, but if a problem exists it is likely that it will persist for the moment. When these railcars are introduced on the outer suburban routes, I am not sure how many of the mark III carriages will be released, <Col N="467" />but they may give some temporary benefit before the arrival of the new carriages which were purchased at the significant cost of &euro;115 million. However, the new carriages are not due until 2005.</P>
    <P>This represents a long-term strategic investment by Government. Much investment has been put into signalling. Once the carriages arrive, Iarnród Éireann will be in a strong position for a number of years. It is trying to put right matters that were ignored for a number of years. The <Col N="468" />equipment on some of the other lines is probably far better.</P>
    <P>I used to work for CIE. However, I left the company ten years ago and I do not claim to be an authority on it any more. As the Sligo line would not have been the main source of revenue, it did not get the pick of the crop and I doubt if things have changed significantly. I hope the huge investment of &euro;115 million will provide a very modern service on all the lines.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 February 2003.</P>
