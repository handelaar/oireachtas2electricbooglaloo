      <P>I have received notice from Senator McHugh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the negative impact which the cutbacks in funding will have on community employment workers in the health sector.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to demand that the Burmese Government release at once Aung San Suu Kyi, a freeman of the City of Dublin, and to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Higgins on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on the need for a classroom assistant to cater for a special needs child who will be starting primary education in Culleens national school, Ballina, County Mayo particularly in the light of the strong recommendations contained in an assessment report carried out by a child psychologist.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Feighan on the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to establish a task force to explore ways and means of replacing the 350 jobs lost recently in Glanbia and to help secure the remaining existing jobs in the facility in Rooskey, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Bannon on the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the sudden closure, on Wednesday, 25 June 2003, of the Glanbia meat processing plant in <Col N="1462" />Rooskey; if the company had been paid Government grants and the interventions, if any, by the Minister to keep the plant open.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and I have selected the matters raised by Senators McHugh, Henry and Higgins to be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Feighan and Bannon may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re establishment of the all-party committee on the Constitution as a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to enable the committee, which has been examining the issue of property rights, to hold public hearings and have such hearings covered by privilege, as was the case in May 2000 when it was formally constituted as a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas to facilitate public hearings on the medical aspects of the abortion issue, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Taxi Regulation Bill 2003 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 4.15 p.m.; No. 3, Digital Hub Development Agency Bill 2002 <i>[Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil]</i>&ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 4.15 p.m. and conclude not later than 5 p.m.; No. 4, Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken at 5 p.m. and conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>

      <P>I wish to bring to the Leader's attention the Immigration Bill 2002. She will be aware that the House discussed all aspects and Stages of the Bill some time ago and that it is still with the Dáil. However, I understand that last evening, at the dead of night, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform published a raft of amendments to the Bill, many of which are expressly against the interests of those seeking refugee protection in this country. I understand the Human Rights Commission has highlighted many aspects of the amendments that, in its view, are draconian, unfair and against the interests of those attempting to have their claim for refugee status properly assessed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two hours have been set aside on Thursday for consideration in the Seanad of Report and Final Stages of the Bill. As the Leader knows, all the amendments must be dealt with by spokespersons by way of one statement. This is unacceptable to the Opposition. Will the Leader examine this issue between now and Thursday? We will not rubber-stamp legislation just because this is the final week of the session. We will especially ensure fair procedure and rights are given to those seeking refuge in this country. Will the Leader examine the time set aside for consideration of the Bill before Thursday? It would be unacceptable and wrong to have one opportunity to speak on what is effectively a new Bill. Will <Col N="1463" />the Leader raise this with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in advance of the debate on Thursday?</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see in excess of 7,000 people on the streets of Sligo last Sunday vociferously campaigning for the retention of their local radio station. It was a real example of people power. Now is the opportune time to debate No. 15 on the Order Paper, namely, a report by Senator O'Meara laid before both Houses relating to the issue of the Irish Radio and Television Commission and the right of appeal. It is clear an injustice has been done to the people of the north-west and that the view needs to be articulated and expressed in the House. Will the Leader allow Senator O'Meara's report to be debated in plenary session? The voice of the people of Sligo should be heard. It was interesting that, the day after their demonstration, I did not see one reference to it in any of the national newspapers, which is another example of the bias against the regions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I did not see it in the newspaper I read, the Senator might refer to it. We need to debate an issue in the House that causes such a large group to take to the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Brian Hayes said about the Immigration Bill. It has been very good that the Leader has managed to have so much legislation initiated in the House and most would agree that it has been well debated. However, it is treating the House shabbily if a Bill is changed completely at short notice. As I could not obtain a copy of the amendments tabled on Report Stage in the Dáil, I do not know what they are like.</P>
      <P>The Human Rights Commission has alerted all of us to its alarm about some of the amendments, one of which horrifies me because it introduces again this issue of a safe country of origin. It is not that long ago that I tried to have doctors from Iraq given sanctuary here because their lives were in danger there because they would not perform operations such as amputating limbs of deserters. I was told in response to my efforts that Iraq was a perfectly safe place. Some years later, half the world had to invade and occupy the country.</P>
      <P>I know it must be irritating for some Ministers to have to bring legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas but there are good ideas on all sides of the Seanad on these issues. I am surprised Fianna Fáil Members would put up with this because they put a great deal of work into the Immigration Bill. I am sure it is not just Members on this side of the House who are horrified by what is happening with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues on the Immigration Bill. No amount of talk of reforming the Oireachtas will have any meaning if this scale <Col N="1464" />of legislative gazumping can be imposed on us without proper debate. These amendments will be subject to a truncated debate in the other House and we will have to discuss them as one in this House, even though, as I understand it, they represent multiple pages of an increase in the size of the Bill. I am concerned about the Bill and the way in which this House deals with amendments to legislation made in the other House. That second debate, however, can be conducted in another forum.</P>
      <P>I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business &ndash; that No. 6 on the list of papers laid before the Seanad in today's Order Paper be discussed first. This paper deals with the Freedom of Information Act 1997 (Fees) Regulations 2003. We are now in the extraordinary position where to appeal a decision of a Department, citizens will have to pay one of the highest charges in the developed world. If I seek information under the Freedom of Information Act, I now have to pay &euro;15. That is affordable, no matter what my opinion about such a charge is. If a junior civil servant refuses that request, I then have to pay &euro;75 to have a senior civil servant to review that decision. If the senior civil servant refuses the request, I then have to pay &euro;140 to appeal to the Information Commissioner. In a week where we have been deprived of access to the correspondence between Mr. Justice Flood and the Government because of the filleting of the Freedom of Information Act, it is adding insult to injury to introduce a system of fees. I propose that this item be taken first today because it is a matter of considerable importance.</P>
      <P>Last week the European Union signed an extradition agreement with the United States. I do not remember voting on any EU treaty which conferred that right on the European Union but no doubt it was done at Intergovernmental Council level. One of the consequences of that agreement is to facilitate US-EU police co-operation. I did not know the European Union had a police force and would like the Government to tell the House what this means. We did not agree in any treaty to an EU-wide police force. It is extraordinary that the European Union will have a level of co-operation with US police forces greater than the co-operation between police forces within the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also taken aback that we will now extradite people for offences of any kind which carry a penalty in excess of one year in prison, to a country which locks people up without trial, beats them up when they are in custody and says through the United States Department of Defense that as they were not beaten up that badly, it is not that serious. That is what the US Government's own review body stated &ndash; that they were beaten up but not that badly; therefore, it is okay &ndash; and we have signed an extradition treaty with that country. Such an issue should be fully debated in this House. I am aware that it will have to be approved by the Oireachtas but I <Col N="1465" />am concerned about the route we are taking on this issue.</P>
    <P>As an Opposition Member, I found the front page of yesterday's <i>Evening Herald</i> particularly repulsive. The intrusion into the private life of the Taoiseach carried out by that newspaper was a disgrace to journalism and Irish newspapers. It should be ashamed of itself.</P>

      <P>I am no great fan of the Taoiseach politically, or of the party he represents, but this was an outrageous intrusion into an entirely private matter where, even though there may be an enormous degree of prurience, there is absolutely no public interest involved.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago I called for the sacking of the Rail Procurement Agency. Everything I have learned since confirms my view which I repeat now that the agency serves no purpose and should be sacked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader referred to the establishment of a committee on the Constitution. What plans, if any, does the Government have in regard to any other committees? Mention was made of two other possible committees, one on competitiveness and I forget the other one. Perhaps the Leader might like to avail of the opportunity to respond in that regard.</P>
      <P>On what day this week will we have the necessary resolution appointing Mr. Justice Alan Mahon as chairman of the tribunal investigating planning matters and Mr. Keys as a member of the tribunal, now that Mr. Justice Feargus Flood has begun his well-deserved retirement? I am sure we all wish him well in that regard.</P>
      <P>On the matter raised by Senator Leyden, I wonder how either felt about being replaced&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to follow that. In the week in which the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism travels to America to try to improve Ireland's competitiveness &ndash; I am sure all sides of the House wish him well in that regard &ndash; will the Leader reflect on reports in the national media this morning relating to a submission from RTE to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, seeking a special licence fee which would apply to bed and breakfast establishments and hotels, apart from a range of other establishments? I raise this matter because it is part of the wider issue of Ireland's competitiveness. Perhaps the Leader will consider having a debate on Ireland's com<Col N="1467" />petitiveness in the new session in the autumn and on the international image of Ireland which could be even further eroded as a result of submissions such as this one.</P>
      <P>I understand RTE is doing this because it is looking for more money. I declare an interest as my mother has a bed and breakfast establishment and the suggestion is that an extra licence would be necessary if there are two televisions in the rooms. Anyone who has stayed in hotels will realise there are already serious costs associated with tuning in to a television in a hotel room. The free to air channels are available but if someone wants to watch any of the movies, it is very expensive. It is like making telephone calls from hotel rooms.</P>
      <P>I suggest the Minister should push this issue further down his priority list and that the Leader should consider having a debate on the competitive nature of Irish society. It seems to me that there are elements in Irish society that are living in a parallel world. They are not living in the real world. If we lose our competitiveness there will be serious economic repercussions that will damage the international image of Ireland. I hope the Leader will give this some consideration. It does not just cover one Department but several.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business put forward by Senator Brendan Ryan. We are beginning to see a little abuse of democracy here, with the legislation that has already been referred to and the question of the human and civil rights of asylum seekers and immigrants. In the case of the Freedom of Information Act, which was widely discussed this morning on the radio, there can be costs of up to &euro;250 in accumulated charges for an individual to get information. That is not giving people democratic access to information. I deplore it.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the various people who mentioned Luas and the Rail Procurement Agency &ndash; I think it was Senator Ryan. It is absolutely extraordinary. Even <i>The Irish Times</i> has woken up to its farcical nature. There are two separate Luas lines with different gauges and there are also different vehicles. They then have this crowd Connex running it. I presume the name refers to connection, despite the fact that the two sets of lines do not connect. They cannot integrate with anything. Certainly the first part of the name is accurate &ndash; it is a &ldquo;con&rdquo; all right. They have been got rid of in England for reasons of financial probity. We should wake up in this country and install the underground.</P>
      <P>It would be very useful if we had even a brief debate on the proposed changes to the tax regime for the film industry, which earns a lot of money for talented people in this country. We are a prime location and I am afraid the Government is going to kill the goose that lays the golden egg if it removes this tax support that exists in all the other competing locations for films.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" />Senator Mooney declared an interest and I am going to be parochial as well. The entire street where I live was kept awake last night by an alarm. We tried to contact the alarm company, who said they were not accepting responsibility. They said they only sell the box and can do nothing if the person involved does not bother to have a service contract. Could the Leader of the House ask the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about the regulations? This causes a great deal of nuisance. Sometimes, at this time of year, people go away and their alarms ring for a couple of days. It is intolerable. Legislation should be introduced to ensure that one cannot sell an alarm system that keeps going off unless a contract for servicing goes with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on radio licences. We will have to revisit this with a great deal more urgency and vigour than we have already seen. There is a perceived arrogance at the moment, relating to a certain echelon telling the rest of the country what they should listen to and what aspirations they should have.</P>
      <P>What worries me is the emergence of new monopolies that are growing by the day. We have seen the example of Scottish Radio Holdings and their pervasive investing in the country. It is only one more aspect of globalisation. What is happening at the moment, in the present debate and in the surveys that we have heard about, is that people are being classified like cattle at a mart. We have to take a stand on this. The airwaves belong to the people of Ireland. This House will have to play a more central role in this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter that Senator Norris has mentioned, in view of the fact that 80% of the activity in the Irish film industry would disappear if section 481 were removed, and considering the fact that the Government gets a three to one return on its investment from this industry, will the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism come into the House and explain to us the Government's policy on the Irish film industry, as well as its policy on the protection of thousands of jobs in this industry?</P>
      <P>I refer also to the Freedom of Information Act, an issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes. It seems moves are afoot to place every obstacle in the way of those seeking information. The proposed charges inflict another burden. Is the Government afraid of accountability or trying to suppress it in every way possible?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek time to debate the issue of super-pubs. The Celtic tiger has had many benefits but the development of super-pubs marks a departure from tradition and fosters our culture of drinking. Pubs were intended to be public houses, not public warehouses. It is of no benefit to society when it becomes impossible for barpersons to monitor how much drink patrons are consuming. Some public houses may even disappear for the sake of greater profitability.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Ó Murchú's view on radio licences. County Tipperary is losing Tipperary Mid-West Radio, a strongly family orientated station catering for those who enjoy Irish music and home grown features. It will be missed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney referred to the issue of competitiveness, which was also raised last week by Senators Ulick Burke and Cox. I raise it in the context of job losses, including those announced yesterday in Navan, County Donegal and Macroom. I note the commitment given by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today to do everything possible to ensure the affected workers receive the assistance and retraining necessary for future opportunities. I know a number of people, some close to me, who have lost their jobs recently but have seen no evidence of any initiatives in this regard by the Government. I ask that the Minister come into the House to explain what she means by assistance and providing further opportunities. Many of the actions of the Government, for example, in relation to third level investment, are at odds with the notion of taking action to improve our competitiveness and create jobs. If the Minister comes before the House, I request that the debate include the issue of cutbacks in community employment schemes. At a time of job losses we should not be implementing cuts in schemes which provide a bridge to employment for the unemployed.</P>

      <P>I refer to the matter raised by Senator Ryan in which, as a director of Independent Newspapers, I declare an interest. I have not seen the edition about which he complained and will not comment further until I do. However, I would deeply regret any offence given or pain caused to the Taoiseach or any other person mentioned in the item. The private lives of public people are entitled to protection and should not be intruded into, except to the extent that the performance of their public duties is involved, which does not appear to be the case in this context. The better news from Independent Newspapers, for Senator Brian Hayes, is that we covered the protest in Sligo.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Brian Hayes and other speakers on this side of the House who oppose the manner in which the Leader proposes to deal with the Immigration Bill on Thursday. This is important legislation and to push it through the <Col N="1470" />House in two hours would be unacceptable. I ask the Leader to reconsider. There are so many amendments that the legislation looks like a new Bill. I have not even seen the amendments yet.</P>

      <P>I wish briefly to address another important matter. This year approximately 12,000 students, including my son, have availed of the J1 visa when travelling to the United States. They are required to have a job within 20 days and provide their social security number, which is a new requirement. However, many do not have their number &ndash; in many instances it is taking months to get them &ndash; and they may be deported. In view of this, I ask the Leader to seek the intervention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Many students have spent between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,300 to travel to the United States and it frightens them that they may be sent home within 20 days.</P>

      <P>I am sure all Senators support the efforts by the Minister for Health and Children to discourage the smoking of tobacco. I ask the Leader to draw the Minister's attention to a British company which yesterday announced it was targeting the Irish market to sell legally half price cigarettes. I will provide the name of the company for the Leader. If it is able to deliver cigarettes to customers who are perhaps under age at prices that eliminate the benefits of the Government's taxation policy, which inhibit smoking, it will undermine legislative measures in this area.</P>

      <P>For many decades British coarse anglers have been the mainstay of tourism in many areas. While the fisheries boards have undertaken studies, surveys and reports, unfortunately, they have failed to explain the reason fish stocks have declined. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to attend the House to outline his proposals to address this serious problem. If this matter is not addressed, we will be in danger of losing these most loyal of tourists because they will instead visit Sweden or Denmark.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed there has been no debate on the housing crisis during this session. I ask the Leader to arrange one for the autumn. Inflationary pressures have led to further increases in house prices with the result that well in excess of 50,000 families are on local authority waiting lists. I was appalled to hear the Taoiseach say last week that the needy would have to wait another two years until a report on the consti<Col N="1471" />tutionality of key housing policies was introduced.</P>

The Leader will be aware that the Minister for Health and Children promised that the risk equalisation policy, which was foisted upon the health insurance market by the VHI, would ensure health insurance would remain affordable. I ask her to arrange for the Minister to attend the House to explain what is happening as a result of risk equalisation. It is keeping competition out of the market, the consequences of which are reflected in the request by the VHI to impose another increase in insurance premiums, of approximately 8% in this instance. The only thing more outrageous was the Minister's comment that he found it acceptable. It is a disgrace. The matter must be debated in the near future.</P>

Radio Kilkenny found itself in a similar position to the one outlined. I call on the Leader to join me in expressing surprise at the belief of Senators on the Government side that too much power has been bestowed on the Broadcasting Commission given that amendments put forward in the Dáil to the relevant legislation by former Fine Gael Deputy Deirdre Clune were voted down by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, raised the matter of the Immigration Bill which comes before the House later in the week. He commented straightforwardly on the number of late amendments which have been attached to it. The Senator described this as a lack of fair procedure and I <Col N="1472" />intend to seek to speak to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the Bill is before us. I will report to the House regarding the matter. As the Senator said, if a Bill is not introduced in the Seanad, we find ourselves examining all amendments in a lump on Report Stage. While the procedure is correct, it does not seem the proper way to process legislation especially in the case of a large number of amendments. I will seek to discover how the matter is to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The Senator praised the group of 7,000 people which turned up in Sligo to protest against the change in the awarding of a radio licence. The purpose of the protest was to draw attention to the fact that there is no recourse to an appeals system in this case. As we all know, it is possible to make an appeal in respect of rent increases or the refusal of a medical card, but that is not the case in respect of a radio licence. This matter has been raised in the House before by Senators from Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to the Immigration Bill in respect of which we will have to seek a ruling before the legislation is before the House for the last time. The changes to the Bill were mentioned by Senator Ryan who also raised the USA-EU agreement on a common security and police force. He wished to know when the latter matter had come before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan commented also on the Railway Procurement Agency and raised the issue of the <i>Evening Herald</i>, which is not widely available down the country although we did manage to get a copy of the front page. It is inexcusable. It is wrong in any sphere to comment on a person's private life where it does not affect their public life. To comment in the fashion the paper did on a person's private life is hateful and I thank the Senator for raising the matter. I have always stated this point of view publicly.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden raised the matter of Ryanair but we are not permitted to name the person involved. The Senator showed us the relevant advertisement. The Cathaoirleach was within his rights to refuse to allow us to comment on it. The person whose name we cannot speak is an arrogant bully who seeks to intimidate the Taoiseach and to get what he wants through his wealth.</P>

      <P>Senator Cummins commented on the Freedom of Information Act and the tax changes in the film industry while Senator Hanafin raised the issue of superpubs.

      <P>Senator Tuffy raised the issue of job losses and said she had not noticed assistance from the Tánaiste in all cases. However, the Tánaiste is up front when job losses occur when many others would seek to hide. The Senator also made a valid point about CE schemes.</P>

    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes brought up the issue of the private lives of public people while Senator Terry supported the comments of Senator Brian Hayes on the Immigration Bill. She also mentioned the issues of J1 visas and social security numbers. Almost every Member of the House has received correspondence or e-mails from young people who are terrified that they will be deported and unable to return if they do not get social security numbers. The Senator asked that <Col N="1474" />the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, comment on this.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the cigarette company which intends to target Ireland with half price cigarettes. I do not know how it proposes to do this. Will it be through retail outlets or the post? One cannot sell to under age consumers. While I do not know the answer, I will endeavour to have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>i</i>) to establish a 24 hour free phone line to report complaints,</P>
      <P>(<i>j</i>) to introduce a central taxi monitoring and booking system with a single taxi contact phone number and electronic identification of the nearest available taxi,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment is simple. Section 9 sets out the principal functions of the commission. Will the Minister ensure these powers include the 24 hour free telephone line to report complaints? This may exist in theory but it is not practice. I am also seeking that identification be clearly visible both inside and outside the vehicle. At present it is difficult to see the identification cards on dashboards in most taxis. A case could be made to have the identification card on the back seat of the taxi where most people on their own travel.</P>
      <P>There is also the issue of centralised taxi monitoring and a booking system to avoid the scenario of people having to wait for hours. At present we do not know whether a taxi firm has 100 or ten taxis. We do not know how many are occupied, where they are, if one is readily available to collect a person or if the taxi has to finish another run first. I ask the Minister to consider the amendment and to accept it.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael proposed this amendment in the Dáil and, as a result, we inserted a new section 51. As Senator Brady pointed out, this is not a matter for the commission which is an independent body. There are 32 taxi meter areas in Ireland. The GPS is working in all these areas and if the taxi people want to use it, it is up to them. It is a commercially sensitive area. It is not for the commission to get into commercially sensitive matters but to regulate the area.</P>
      <P>We agreed to the inclusion of section 51 as result of a request from the Senator's colleagues in the other House. The procedure agreed provides specifically for the making of complaints in respect of the condition and cleanliness of a vehicle, the conduct and behaviour of a driver, overcharging and matters relating to hiring generally. This is provided for in the new section which was inserted as a result of an amendment proposed by the Senator's colleagues in the other House. It is not a function of the commission to provide back-up to the taxi people, who have an excellent GPS. The function of the commission is to regulate and the complaints procedure is set out in section 51.</P>

One of the amendments which was tabled in the other House last week asked that the commission would have the function of making recommendations to the Minister as to steps to be taken in respect of the position of persons who have experienced hardship by reason of the deregulation of the small public service vehicle market.</P>
      <P>The second amendment, which was tabled by Fine Gael, sought to review the payment structure of the taxi hardship panel. This is not an issue that should be forgotten. The fact that it is omitted from the legislation means it is left to chance whether the Minister and the Government will revisit the issue of hardship payments. The EU petitions committee produced a damning report regarding the payments proposed by the hardship panel and advised the Minister to revisit the issue. I mention these amendments now in order that I may put them on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 10, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>10.(1) The Minister shall establish a register of accessible vehicles.</P>
      <P>(2) Every State funded hospital and school requiring the use of an accessible vehicle, shall in the first instance seek the availability of a vehicle on the Register maintained in <i>subsection (1)</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment requires the establishment of a register of accessible vehicles and the guarantee of a certain amount of work for people who have gone to the bother of having their taxis converted, at huge cost, to being wheelchair friendly, through school runs or transporting patients to hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to some taxi drivers who, in hindsight, regret having converted their taxis, because they have not got the thanks they deserve for doing so, nor have they made money from the conversion. On a typical day a passenger waiting to be picked up will more than likely opt for the non-wheelchair friendly taxi. That may be because they are afraid of using a taxi which might be needed by somebody with a wheelchair. One way of getting around this difficulty would be to guarantee people who convert their taxis that they would get some work from the State. This is worth looking at and has been done in other countries.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. In the Dáil last week the Government included an amendment regarding the promotion of accessible taxis, but more could be done. A suggestion was made that there should be tax breaks. The acceptance of this amendment would recognise that people have to go to some expense to make taxis accessible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we should do everything possible for people who have made their taxis accessible, at great cost. I urge Senators to do what they can within their own health board or hospital areas to encourage them to use these taxis. We amended section 9 to provide that the commission would pursue the policy of making all taxis accessible. However we cannot include this amendment in primary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we passed this amendment it would create difficulties, particularly in areas outside Dublin such as Letterkenny, Galway, Carlow and Kilkenny. Imagine the difficulty a hospital would have in an area that does not have a large number <Col N="1480" />of accessible taxis. The hospital would have to say it could not get a person a taxi because of its policy to use only accessible taxis. In Letterkenny only ten out of 100 taxis are wheelchair accessible. The number accessible in Galway is 42 out of 361, in Killarney seven out of 71, in Cork 32 out of 647, in Athlone three out of 78, in Carlow six out of 44 and in Kilkenny four out of 95.</P>
    <P>While I understand the reasoning behind the Senator's amendment, unfortunately primary legislation is not the place for it. However, I urge the Senators to encourage their local authorities to promote the use of accessible taxis the owners of which have gone a long way in changing their taxis. It is hoped that in the future all taxis will be accessible. For the reasons I have mentioned, if this amendment was put in the legislation it would do a disservice to specific areas.</P>

      <P>I am concerned, and my colleagues who hold the transport brief will agree with me, that there seems to be a lack of accountability in this area. We are not allowed to ask the Minister questions about roads or Luas, rather we are told to ask the NRA or the Railway Procurement Agency respectively. Extra layers of bureaucracy seem to be put in front of us all the time. We are concerned that the Minister will not want to answer questions on this issue but will instead abdicate his role and put pressure on the chairperson of this new commission, who will then appear before the Oireachtas committee. I would appreciate any comments the Minister of State could make in order to clarify the situation and ensure that the new commission is accountable and that Members of both Houses can access information at any time. Unfortunately, there seems to be a general trend for Ministers to become less and less accountable, a situation which probably suits them.</P>

      <P>We have accepted the principle of the Senator's amendment in the Dáil. Section 29(2)(<i>c</i>) now provides that the annual report and accounts must be presented to the Oireachtas within three months of being presented to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 refers to Members losing their ability to make representations and Ministers not being accountable to the House. As I said to the Dáil, it has been agreed by the Government and the Opposition that we set up the commission as an independent body. As a consequence of that, the reasons the commission makes decisions to refuse licences cannot be the subject of questions to the Minister in the Dáil. The Minister is, however, responsible for all matters of policy and will be answerable in the Dáil by way of parliamentary questions from any Member. However, the commission is an independent body and cannot be brought to task by a Senator or Deputy as to why a person did or did not obtain a taxi licence. It must have that degree of independence. The commission will be responsible to any committee of the House, normally the transport committee.</P>
      <P>The substance of amendment No. 4 was the subject of detailed debate in the Lower House. As I pointed out on that occasion, the Bill establishes clear lines of responsibility for both the Minister and the commission in terms of their respective areas of responsibility to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister for Transport retains overall control of the legislative framework within which the provisions of this Bill will be broadly pursued and he or she is answerable to the Oireachtas in regard to such matters. Accepting this amendment would mean that operational matters and decisions which must, of necessity, be determined by the commission would be the subject of detailed questioning in the Houses. The Bill provides in clear terms that the commission is required to report to the committees of the Houses as required.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill on accountability and the response to the debate in the Lower House led the sponsoring Deputy to withdraw that amendment. One cannot have an independent body being asked why a person did not get a licence on every occasion. The reasons may be personal and it might be to the benefit of the applicant that this information should not be disclosed. That is why I ask the Senator to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <P>Our main difficulty with this section is that there is no defined period for a person to hold a licence. We feel that should be included in the Bill. Unless a licence is being revoked or suspended, a period of two years may be appropriate.</P>
      <P>There is also an issue about power being taken away from local authorities. Is that the case? It seems so on reading the section. The Garda, local authorities and the carriage office are in charge at present but there is concern that the local authorities' control will be diminished.</P>

      <P>The substance of amendment No. 5 was discussed in the Dáil and it was agreed that it would be withdrawn. I reiterate that a small public service vehicle must be insured.</P>
      <P>The Senator was referring to licences when he spoke after moving amendment No. 5. However, the amendment has to do with insurance. The Senator seeks to provide in amendment No. 6 as follows:</P>
      <P>A licence granted after the commencement of this Part shall be in force for such period stated in the licence being not more than 2 years from the granting thereof.</P>
      <P>The driving licence lasts five years and that was agreed with the Garda Síochána and taxi drivers some years ago. The commission can determine the length for which a driving licence should be held. The vehicle licence lasts for one year. They are two separate matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator suggests the vehicle licence should last for two years, but that cannot be done <Col N="1484" />because there is the matter of the national car test under which these vehicles are inspected every year. It would not be workable. Passing the test is a condition for obtaining the vehicle licence. I cannot accept that the duration should be more than one year because agreeing such designated periods is a matter for the commission, the Garda and taxi drivers, not for legislation.

      <P>Senator Browne said the section was too vague. It specifically indicates the type of offences which will prohibit people from holding a licence. The Senator's amendment is vague in that it provides as follows:</P>
      <P>a person being the applicant for or the holder of a licence is&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) convicted on indictment of any offence, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) convicted summarily of an offence and sentenced to a term of imprisonment,</P>
      <P>the person is disqualified for holding a licence, and, accordingly, where the person is the holder of a licence, the licence stands revoked.</P>
      <P>We have specifically stated the areas which prohibit a person from being granted a licence.</P>
      <P>There are people who have committed offences against agricultural regulations or waste management legislation, such as a farmer convicted of inadvertently polluting a stream, who, were we to accept Senator Browne's amendment, would be banned from holding a licence. I do not imagine that is what the Senator wants. We all want to ensure that holders of taxi licences are fit to deal with the public. I imagine that is the motivation behind the Senator's amendment. That is not to say that a person convicted of an offence under waste management legislation, such as polluting a stream, is not fit to deal with people.</P>
      <P>The importance of this section has been the subject of a significant number of comments by many contributors to the debates on the Bill. It provides the basis for granting to users of small public service vehicles a significantly increased level of assurance as to their safety by the removal from the operation of such vehicles of those who have been convicted of one of a range of serious offences. It represents a balance between the needs of the public and the rights of the operators and drivers to pursue their chosen livelihood. It is by necessity a fine balance and one arrived at after detailed consideration. Central to that balance is the fact that the section specifically refers to a range of offences, the commission of which would cast immediate doubt on the fitness of the convicted person to be engaged in the service.</P>
      <P>To widen the scope of the section to encompass all offences, which the Senator is attempting to do, would represent an undue prohibition on such persons &ndash; I gave examples of farmers or others inadvertently committing other offences not listed in the section. I consider that the section as proposed addresses the correct range of offences. We cannot include all offences because some do not relate to people being suitable to deal with members of the public.</P>

Offences are listed in the Bill which would prohibit a person obtaining a licence, but they do not deal specifically with people released under the Good Friday Agreement. The offences listed in the Bill, whenever they were committed, continue to be offences and to prohibit a person from holding a licence.</P>
      <P>In promoting a safer environment for the users of small public service vehicles, there is a need for the clarity evident in this section. I have purposely provided for such clarity to the extent that the section will have immediate and full effect. That is not to say that the application of the disqualification provisions is absolute.</P>
      <P>The section provides a clear and reasonable system of access to the courts for those engaged in the delivery of small public service vehicle operations. They can go to the courts. It is open to all people, regardless of whether they were released under the Good Friday Agreement. It is up to them. They have access to the courts like all others.

Any attempt by such a person to obtain a licence will necessitate all these checks. The checks already exist in the register held by local authorities and the Garda and the commission will have its own checks. There is an abundance of checking mechanisms at the disposal of the commission and they will quickly establish if a person has been disqualified under the provisions of the section.</P>

      <P>In page 26, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Courts Service shall furnish all relevant information to the Commission as from time to time may be required to maintain an accurate register.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The offences that would generate a disqualification under the Bill are, by their very nature, limited to those areas of behaviour that would place a question mark over the fitness of a convicted person to be engaged in the delivery of individual transport services. All such convictions are recorded by the Garda. This information can be passed on to the commission under agreed arrangements, where necessary, with the Garda. In addition, appropriate arrangements can be put in place to ensure that applicants for licences under the Bill will be required to provide confirmation that they have not been convicted of one of the offences in question.</P>
      <P>The Senator is seeking the details of the convictions but the Bill already contains a provision for applicants to give details. He says the courts will be in a better position to do that but the courts will not have records of all people who will apply for a licence. Accountants and others hold licences and there would not be any record of them within the courts.</P>
      <P>The commission and the Garda can come up with arrangements to deal with any inquiries that are made. Any records that the courts have would be at the disposal of the Garda. Whether the courts could release information directly to the commission is another matter but, between the commission's powers and those of the Garda, via the relationship with the courts, the information will be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 30, before section 44 to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>44.&ndash;(1) A person shall not drive or use or be carried in a small public service vehicle the subject of a small public service vehicle licence exclusively or primarily for the personal or private carriage of an individual.</P>
      <P>(2) A person shall not procure or seek to procure a small public service vehicle licence to be used exclusively or primarily for the personal or private carriage of an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" />(3) A person who contravenes this section is guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The need for this amendment was demonstrated when Michael O'Leary of Ryanair was revealed to have bought a hackney licence for his own private use so he could use bus lanes. This amendment would be a practical step towards ensuring that did not happen again. We do not want people earning a good salary to be in a position to buy a hackney licence and use it to reduce their journey times.</P>
    <P>It is an important amendment and I ask the House to accept it. Otherwise, our bus corridors will be clogged with huge Mercedes and Jaguars posing as hackneys or public service vehicles. They are private vehicles. We need to tighten this area. The problem was brought home to all of us lately by Michael O'Leary's antics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendment or the point made by the Deputy. If we insert the amendment in legislation, we would all be before the courts because I am sure a constitutional issue would arise. When the legislation is passed and we have set up the commission, the commission will be responsible for setting its own parameters and the pros and cons of the legislation. It is not for us to determine who should own the licence or for what reason. That is the reason I cannot accept the amendment. The commission will be responsible for setting its own parameters. I will not do so. This proposal should not be included as part of the legislation.</P>
      <P>In addressing the proposal there is a need to look in general terms at the provisions already contained in the Bill. In particular, I refer to the powers of the commission in relation to the determination of requirements and conditions to be applied to the licensing and operation of all small public service vehicles and their drivers. The inclusion of the provision proposed in the amendment would put in place a restriction on the freedom of the commission to apply and enforce the broad powers invested in that office. These powers include the determination of the conditions subject to which a licence may be granted and the conditions in respect of which a small public service vehicle may be operated. Different conditions can be applied to the operation of different types of small public service vehicles and in respect of different areas. If we were to include the provision in legislation, the case on everyone's lips could inhibit the work of the commission in dealing with this problem. I would prefer not to include it in the legislation but to leave the matter to the commission.</P>

      <P>When an advisory board is appointed to a commission, one does not ask that the advice given to a board should be made public. The advice is given on the basis that this is an advisory council. I have no intention of making such advice public. However, Senators should note that the Government amendment to the original section 29 of the Bill specifically provides that in its annual report the commission must set down what decisions it made following receipt of advice from the council. It will be available in the annual report, but it would be wrong of us to try to muzzle an advisory council. Let them give their advice freely in the knowledge that it does not have to be reported. Otherwise, the best advice may not be available.</P>

      <P>I hear what the Minister has to say. If the Minister had been here during the Order of Business, he would have heard many Senators raise with the Leader of the House the accountability of the BCI. Much unhappiness was expressed at the granting and withdrawal of radio licences. People want to see accountability, a clear-cut explanation as to why radio licences were granted or not granted. The same applies in this context. We want to make things more transparent and in some respects save the commission unnecessary work afterwards. The proposal <Col N="1493" />would remove any cloud of suspicion or veil of secrecy by providing for a more transparent, clear-cut system which people would understand.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State outline the rationale for his decision not to accept Senator Browne's amendment, which is a straightforward proposal to make public the advice given by the advisory board? The Minister of State's remarks appear contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the Freedom of Information Act and the thrust of the SMI process, an effort by the Government to expose to the public as much information as possible, with which he and some of his Government colleagues will be familiar. By laying this information before both Houses of the Oireachtas, we would simply allow it to be made public. The Minister of State's response and the rationale behind it are not well thought out. I ask him to reconsider his position on the matter, as the proposal offers the only opportunity for the House to get maximum benefit from the proposed regulatory authority, which has universal support among Senators. The information in question is a basic requirement and would be useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Senator's comments. As I argued previously, the Commission for Taxi Regulation may be brought before any committee of the Houses, including the Joint Committee on Transport. In addition, the Minister will answer parliamentary questions on policy. The board will act in an advisory capacity. Those appointed to an advisory council have a right to offer advice in private. It is then up to the commission to accept or refuse it. The Senator may even be seeking information on the advice offered by named individuals on the advisory board, which is not the way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case differs from other areas, some of which the Senator mentioned, in that the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be compelled to come before a committee of the Houses. The Senator's concerns are, therefore, addressed. As I stated, nothing is written in stone. It is better to try the approach we have proposed and if for any reason the legislation requires change in the future, this can be done. The advice given by members of an advisory council should not be made public as it could become the subject of misinformation, particularly given the manner in <Col N="1494" />which other issues are reported in certain sections of the media.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>That will depend on circumstances and the nature of the freedom of information request. Even under the Freedom of Information Act, certain areas are protected.

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I have tabled these amendments is that it is important, as I noted on previous Stages, that the issue of the hardship caused to a number of taxi drivers and their families as a result of the deregulation of the taxi market is redressed and the matter revisited by the Government. The matter should not be overlooked. Many Members, including Deputies of the other House, have noted that the payments made to compensate for the hardship incurred was inadequate in many cases. It is wrong that people operating in a regulated environment should suffer financial loss of such proportions due to an act of the Government without being compensated sufficiently. The Committee on Petitions of the European Union confirmed that the payments in this case were inadequate and asked that the issue be revisited. I am aware the Minister of State will not accept the amendments. I ask the Government to re-examine the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. This time last year I did not, as a member of the general public, have much sympathy for taxi drivers. Now, as a Member of the House who has had the benefit of sitting on the Joint Committee on Transport for a year and having met the families involved and, in particular, the association, FAIR, an impressive group which has lobbied hard and successfully highlighted its case, I have a much greater understanding for the families concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1496" />The taxi hardship panel made a recommendation on this issue. The Fine Gael Party regards the criteria it used in the selection process as questionable. We also disagree with the level of compensation it recommended, as it does not mirror the significant hardship being experienced by the families in question. Ultimately, it issued a recommendation and the Minister remains free to take a different view and increase the compensation levels, if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>This matter has been ongoing for three years. Senators will agree it is time for action. Members of the Joint Committee on Transport from all sides, including the Government parties, were unanimous that the level of compensation being offered was not adequate. I ask the Minister of State to address this aspect and increase the amount of compensation available. Families are in hardship as a result of the overnight deregulation, which, in hindsight, was badly thought through.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. Senators may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil has made a number of amendments to this Bill, which was passed by the Seanad last December. Amendment No. 1 requires the agency to include, as part of its development plan, indicative targets for numbers in employment in digital media enterprises in the area of the hub. It was made in response to an amendment put down by Deputy Coveney on Committee Stage in the Dáil and following a commitment I made to him to review it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 inserts a new provision to section 12. It requires that any directives given by the Minister to the agency be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. In addition, a notice that a directive has been given will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> within 28 days. I am satisfied that this amendment provides considerable transparency with regard to the way the Minister communicates with the agency and, furthermore, that it takes into consideration concerns raised with regard to this issue by Deputies Broughan and Coveney.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 provides for a representative of the local community to be appointed to the board. In the course of the debate on the Bill, a number of concerns were raised regarding the representation of local interests. In response to these, and to ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are fully represented, this provision has been inserted.</P>
      <P>Following the discussion of issues raised by Deputy Coveney, amendment No. 4 has increased from &euro;2,000 to &euro;3,000 the amount of the fine applicable to a person who, on summary conviction, is found guilty of an offence by contravening section 27(1). Having sought advice on the matter, I have been informed that this is the upper limit allowable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 5 and 6, I also presented an amendment relating to section 26(8) of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, <Col N="1498" />which will enable the application to Ms Etaine Doyle, Chairman of the Commission for Communications Regulation, of standard severance arrangements applicable to chief executive officers of State companies, that is, payment of pension at age 55 years or of an actuarially reduced pension at an earlier age. The current statutory provision in the Communications Regulation Act freezes the chairman's pension until she reaches 60 years of age. It was intended to address this matter in the Act, but it did not prove possible to reach agreement on the matter across Departments before the legislation was enacted.</P>

We are pleased that some of the amendments referred to by the Minister were introduced in response to proposals made by other members of my party. We especially welcome amendment No. 3, which allows for representation on the board by a member of the local community. That will be of great benefit and will give ownership of the agency and the hub to local people. I commend the Minister for accepting this proposal.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Government might also consider the establishment of a fund to support the businesses who are setting up in the hub with the help of the agency, especially with regard to escalating costs, including insurance costs, which could hinder their development. We accept these amendments and commend the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am especially pleased that section 15 has been amended to provide that a representative of the local community will be included on the board of the agency. I referred to this on Second Stage, having gone to see what was happening on the ground. Too often, action is taken in the absence of local community involvement. The move to make facilities available to the community in that area of Dublin is to be commended. It was ridiculous not to include a local representative on the body which is why I welcome the new provision. I commend the Bill to the House and I thank the Minister and all involved for their support of the measures it entails.</P>

The Bill was examined at consider<Col N="1499" />able length by the Dáil where, with all due respect, debate was informed by previous discussion of the legislation in this House. Many of the amendments discussed in the Dáil originated with Senators, whom I thank for their input.</P>
      <P>I wish the digital hub well under the auspices of the new agency. As Senators know, the agency is up and running and has been a very great success.

They oversaw the investment of a huge amount of taxpayers' resources in this facility and took a great deal of care over the birthing of this project. I thank the officials of the Seanad for the help they gave us in putting this Bill through the House. This useful legislation will provide a fine template for subsequent Bills in this area.</P>
      <P>A number of very innovative companies are operating at the digital hub, which I visited recently. I have been there often lately and each time I visit I see a change in the physical structure and in the complement of workers. As the saying goes, there is a lot more to be done and I look forward to seeing the hub develop into the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage in the Dáil, all Opposition parties urged that the member of the commission selected to act as chairperson in the event of the commission chairman being absent or indisposed should be described as &ldquo;deputy chairperson&rdquo; rather than as &ldquo;acting chairperson&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;acting&rdquo; was used in the Bill because a substitute was unlikely to be <Col N="1500" />required frequently and because the acting chairperson's functions were confined to presiding over meetings or calling them when the chairperson was unavailable or unable to do so.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage in the Dáil, I reiterated the view that &ldquo;acting&rdquo; was a more accurate and honest description but, in deference to the strength of the Opposition's feelings on the matter, I accepted an amendment which replaced &ldquo;acting chairperson&rdquo; with &ldquo;deputy chairperson&rdquo; in section 7. These technical amendments are consequential on the acceptance of that amendment and change the title &ldquo;acting chairperson&rdquo; to &ldquo;deputy chairperson&rdquo;. This occurs in a number of sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a problem with the amendment. However, I have put down amendments proposing that the deputy chairperson be the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. These amendments were not suggested to me by any person, lest anybody be under a misapprehension that they were. They are my own idea. Indeed, during the debate on Second Stage, I gave notice that I would put down amendments to give effect to the suggestions I made during that debate.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that if this House is to be treated with the status and respect to which it is entitled as a Chamber that is independent of Dáil Éireann and which initiates and enacts legislation, the Bill should provide that the position now called &ldquo;deputy chairperson&rdquo; should be held by the Cathaoirleach of this House. I may be wrong but at one stage the impression was given that the Cathaoirleach would not even be an automatic member of the commission. If that is true there must have been a change of heart because the Cathaoirleach is now, in his own right, a member of the commission.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle is the chairperson of the commission, and rightly so. It is patently obvious, from the point of view of respect for this Chamber, its tradition and the work it does, that the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad should automatically be the deputy chairperson of the commission. In other words, in the event of the chairperson not being in attendance at a meeting of the new commission, automatically the Cathaoirleach would take over the function and role of chairperson.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for putting this forward, apart from recognising the role and status of this House, is that if and when the Dáil is dissolved the Ceann Comhairle ceases to be chairman of the commission and therefore somebody else has to take over that role. This Chamber continues in existence until such time as the new Seanad is elected. From the point of view of streamlining, as well as recognising the status of this House and the role of the Cathaoirleach, it seems to be a logical and sensible step to have the Cathaoirleach of Seanad Eireann automatically written into this legislation as the deputy chairperson.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point on Second Stage that the deputy chairman should be the Cathaoirleach, for reasons that were stated. At that stage the Bill referred to the &lsquo;acting chairman' but it is proposed to change that. It is implicit in section 9(1) of the Bill which states:</P>
      <P>If Dáil Eireann is dissolved, the chairperson, or, if the chairperson is unable to perform his or her function, the acting chairperson of the Commission, continues to hold office until the chairman of Dáil Eireann is elected following such dissolution.</P>
      <P>From hereon the reference to &ldquo;acting chairperson&rdquo; will be changed to &ldquo;deputy chairperson&rdquo; of the commission. The only sensible method of reading that section is on the assumption that the deputy chairperson is a Senator and the Cathaoirleach is certainly <i>primus inter pares</i> when it comes to the Senators. It seems to be implicit, although not explicit, in the Bill that the deputy chairperson would be normally and by convention the Cathaoirleach and that is proper order. I would prefer to see this explicitly stated rather than implicitly understood.</P>
      <P>I am not certain whether technically speaking this is part of the Bill but the margin note of section 9(1) refers to &ldquo;Dissolution of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann&rdquo;. The Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong but this seems to be an error. The Constitution speaks only of the dissolution of Dáil Éireann. I looked for the term Seanad Éireann but there is no constitutional phrase. It expires, or its term of office expires, the day before polling day but nobody dissolves Seanad Éireann. On Report Stage, before it is concluded and goes for signature, it should be rephrased in some way.</P>
      <P>I support the principle and progress has been made in that we now have a deputy chairperson rather than an acting chairperson. In section 9(1) it seems implicit that that person is the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. I am not sure why it would not be sensible just to dot the &ldquo;i's&rdquo; and cross the &ldquo;t's&rdquo;. Perhaps if the Minister of State is not able to accept that immediately, he might consider it for the purposes of Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that. On Second Stage here I indicated that various possibilities could <Col N="1502" />exist and the Government was not attempting to impose any individual on the commission as deputy chairperson. Given that the Ceann Comhairle, like the Cathaoirleach, has to be above party politics, it seems reasonable for him or her to make the choice and for that choice to be made on one criterion, his view of who would best stand in for him in the interests of the commission. It is not my place to drop heavy hints to the chairperson as to who that person should be, particularly when we do not know who will be the ordinary members of the commission. As I said in the Dáil, I do not see the commission as the kind of body that should divide on party grounds. I do not see it splitting on the grounds of whether someone is from the Seanad or from the Dáil. It would be sad if the message went out that we expected there would be factions within the commission either among parties or between the Seanad or the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The priority is that the business of the commission should be conducted in a businesslike fashion. If the Cathaoirleach is unavailable his choice of deputy chairperson should be sufficient and I would expect, in a small group of ten people, that it would be a consensus decision. I am keen to allow the commission to make up its own mind when it is formed with regard to those particular decisions. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State's reaction because he does not want to be prescriptive but the Bill is prescriptive in making the Ceann Comhairle the chairperson. I cannot see why, from the point of view of recognising the status and role of this House, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad cannot be prescribed in the Bill. I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Mansergh in his reading of section 9(1):</P>
      <P>If Dáil Eireann is dissolved, the chairperson, or, if the chairperson is unable to perform his or her function, the acting chairperson of the Commission, continues to hold office until the chairman of Dáil Eireann is elected following such dissolution.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;acting chairperson&rdquo; will be the deputy chairperson. Implicit in that is the expectation that it would be the Cathaoirleach of this Chamber. I am at a loss from the point of view&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under provisions elsewhere in the Bill the commission is to be endowed with authority subject to authorisation by one or both Houses to defend proceedings taken against Members. The purpose of this amendment is the narrower one of giving the commission the powers now held by the Minister for Finance in one Act, that is, the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment ) Act 1996, to deal with proceedings taken against a Member or a parliamentary party by a secreterial assistant employed by that Member or party in respect of a personal injury sustained in the course of the assistant's employment. This measure was introduced in 1996 when a Deputy was sued in such circumstances and it was found that she would be personally liable unless there were legal authority for <Col N="1504" />the State to give financial support for legal costs and any damages awarded. Few such cases have arisen since.</P>
      <P>In essence, the commission will have the power to recoup in whole or in part to such a Member or party any award or settlement, together with the costs incurred. Needless to say, that facility can only be provided in instances where the person in question sustained the injury in the course of employment as a secretarial assistant by a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or by a registered political party and is paid by the Oireachtas Commission.</P>

      <P>The section to which these amendments relate allows the commission, subject to authorisation by the Dáil, Seanad or both, to initiate, intervene or apply to be joined as a plaintiff on behalf of a Member. The Bill as passed by the Dáil specifies that such proceedings must arise from the Member's performance of functions as a Member of either House or of a committee.</P>
      <P>The amendments add two extra phrases. The matters must arise solely from a Member's parliamentary functions. That could be regarded as a lawyer's refinement, and it is certainly in line with the intent of the Bill as introduced to the Dáil. While theoretical decisions as to what precisely the parliamentary functions of a Member are could keep a regiment of lawyers dancing around a pinhead for ages, the point to keep in mind is that the interpretation falls to the commission or to the House itself, and they are probably the best people to make the call.</P>
      <P>Probably a Senator going around canvassing for himself or a party colleague in a Dáil election and getting into an altercation would be outside it. A Deputy who spilled boiling water over a fellow guest at a local function probably could not expect to persuade the commission that the resulting case against him or her arose solely from parliamentary functions just because the invitation was addressed to the person in his or her capacity as a Member of either House.</P>

      <P>The Bill as passed by the Dáil distinguished between the commission acting as a plaintiff, which is where the prior consent of the Member's House was required, and its assuming a defending role, which is where such consent was not required. Following correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle, it was decided to table an amendment which restored the requirement of prior consent from the Dáil, Seanad or both as appropriate where the commission was to act as defendant. The amendment covers, in separate subsections, each of the groups which can be defended, namely, Members of the Dáil or its committees, Members of the Seanad or its committees, and Members of joint committees. The amendment also stipulates where the commission may take on a defence. It sets out in clear and concise terms that the only instance where it may take on such a defence is regarding legal proceedings initiated solely from the performance by them of their parliamentary functions as Members. It should also be crystal clear from the terms of the subsection that that relates to issues arising from their status as Members. It is not a free legal advice service for Members on other issues.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might ask the Minister the rationale behind this. We are setting up an independent commission comprising Members of both Houses which will be all-party or as representative as possible, presumably on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. Yet at the same time, from the point of view of authorising legal representation and advice at a certain stage, the decision must go back to the relevant House. On the one hand we are setting up an independent commission and trying to invest it with as much power as possible. It is to all intents and purposes autonomous, except in certain respects. Yet at the same time, from the point of view of authorising legal advice, one must go back to the Seanad in the case of a Senator and the Dáil in the case of a Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens in situations where the Houses happen to be in recess? For example, this House <Col N="1507" />will adjourn on Friday for the best part of three months, as will the other House. One would imagine, just as we have vested certain powers in the Committee on Procedures and Privileges without reference back to this Chamber, that, when we are setting up a new commission, which would be made up of 11 sensible people &ndash; or 13 if we have our way &ndash; that commission would have absolute power to decide whether it was prepared to provide legal advice or assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD" hpid="Mr. Parlon Mr. Parlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The House can conduct the business by committee. The criteria laid down are extremely tight: proceedings initiated solely regarding the performance by Members of their parliamentary functions. Clearly, the relevant House is most appropriate to make that call. Given the speed at which legal proceedings move along, I cannot see such a situation arising, even during our fairly lengthy summer recess. The legal system goes &ldquo;into recess&rdquo; for much of the summer too. However, there should certainly be scope to go back to whichever House is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is over-restrictive and does not conform to what is supposed to be the spirit of the Bill, namely, that we are setting up a group of 11 honourable people, representatives of all sides and from both Chambers, who will decide on a whole range of issues and matters of policy, administrative or otherwise, set down in the Bill. Yet when it comes to authorising legal advice, that must be done by Seanad Éireann or Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I cannot appreciate why the independence and good sense of the commission is not to be trusted or why the Minister must insert into the Bill an amendment saying that the relevant House will have to be consulted and give the go-ahead before such legal advice, presumably coming as a recommendation from the commission, can be provided to a Member. I accept that the courts are in recess, but the legal process goes on. Solicitors, junior counsel and senior counsel continue to take instructions and be paid for that. The members should be trusted. They are being trusted on a whole range of functions, yet on a rather elementary issue, namely, whether to give legal advice to a Member of either House, one must go back, presumably for a motion to secure such sanction.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that I fully agree with Senator Higgins. A House of the Oireachtas is to get involved in backing legal proceedings. If either House of the Oireachtas is to get involved in backing legal proceedings, it ought to be formally approved by the House as a whole. Obviously, the commission will be the prime mover and I am sure if the commission recommends it, in 95 out of 100 cases, the House will approve that without much debate. There is merit in the way in which the amendment is drafted. <Col N="1508" />Apart from anything else, if those involved in such actions know they have the whole House behind them, whether the House considers them right or wrong but certainly justified in taking legal action, it could strengthen their position.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept the view taken by Senator Higgins. The amendment is reasonable. As Senator Mansergh said, if the commission in most cases approves of the legal support being given, I cannot see a situation arising where either House would disapprove. In regard to how it will work in practice, I do not see the time limit of a recess or whatever being a difficulty. Clearly, people can obtain legal advice during a recess. The issue is who will pay for the legal advice. I do not see that as being a strong case.</P>

      <P>If someone is aggrieved by something a committee did or did not do and wants to <Col N="1509" />take legal action, the decision on who he or she shall target or name as the defendant is taken by him or her in their summons, presumably on the advice of a lawyer. Normally the practice has been to list all the members of the committee and as a group committee members do not like it. It upsets them and their families. In all the versions of the Bill we tried to do something about it and we encountered one insuperable problem. The plaintiff had the call on who to name and the lawyers generally went for overkill in case they ignored a possible defendant whose inclusion might be beneficial to them. The best we could do, therefore, was to provide an alternative target who might prove attractive to them.</P>
      <P>We spelt out in the version of the Bill before the House that it would not be necessary for a litigant to name all the committee members and that it would suffice to name the chair of the particular committee. The lawyers now feel that the explicit statement that it was not necessary to name all the committee members should be dropped and we should simply tell them it will suffice to go for the committee chair.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>

      <P>(ii) Seanad Éireann to conduct the defence of proceedings against members of a Committee appointed by Seanad Éireann, or</P>
      <P>(iii) Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to conduct the defence of proceedings against members of a Committee appointed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment, despite its size, follows from the requirement that the commission cannot act in a defence role without having the authorisation of a House or both Houses. It now caters for the one situation where that consent will not be necessary &ndash; where the committee which is having proceedings taken against it no longer exists. This is possible because a dissolution of the Dáil automatically terminates its committees and joint committees or because they had been abolished earlier.</P>

      <P>Section 4 deals with a whole range of functions of the commission. One of the issues to which we alluded on Second Stage was the provision of secretarial facilities. The point was made very forcibly from both sides that in this day and age a situation where Senators have the service, on a shared basis, of one secretary is not good enough. We are entitled on our own merits to a 1:1 ratio. I am sure Deputies would make the case in relation to the increasing and onerous workload being foisted on them on an ongoing basis that they should be entitled to possibly two secretaries, one in the constituency to keep the home fires burning and another to provide day to day secretarial facilities. In this day and age, for this small Assembly of 60 Members, the minimum requirement and entitlement is a 1:1 ratio. Are there any proposals in that regard?</P>
      <P>A matter mentioned by Senator Mansergh and one I mentioned previously on the Order of Business is the scandalous situation where the salary for incoming new recruits to the secretarial service of this House is being cut by &euro;70. It is a competitive market, but it is also a buyers' market. Good people are out there but they are being snapped up by the private and commercial sectors. We are entitled to the best possible secretarial assistance available. Our secretaries are not simply operating word processors and typing up speeches and letters for our constituents. Good secretaries are crucial. Not only do they take care of the mundane and ordinary duties, which are important, such as typing letters and speeches, but they download material from computers. To an extent they are unpaid advisers by virtue of the fact that it is not their duty.</P>
      <P>Many of us can testify, as I can, that our secretaries are excellent from the point of view of going after information, having the finger on the pulse, knowing exactly where to go and carrying out a whole range of exercises, public relations and otherwise, in dealing with the public when we are not around. Again, I ask the Minister to please insist that the retrograde and negative decision to cut the starting salary by &euro;70 is reversed immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the staff, they have jobs to do and to an extent they are unpaid amateur researchers. In some cases, they do it well. Research for Members is absolutely crucial from the point of view of enabling us to perform our functions properly as legislators. As I said on Second Stage, from the moment I became a Member of the other House, I was appointed spokesman on education. That was fine because I come from a teaching background. Later I was appointed spokesman on justice, equality and law reform and trying to wrestle with legislation and with the Minister who had the full bureaucracy behind him was a daunting task. Thanks to the benevolent and forthcoming assistance of those in the legal sphere and some members of the Garda Síochána, I was in a position to make a coherent response and challenge him. We do not expect researchers to be political, rather we expect them <Col N="1511" />to be constructive in relation to providing quality advice for Members so they can make a positive and constructive input to legislation. That is good for the Government as well not from the point of view of being political, but, as Jack Charlton would say, to put it under pressure.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of a thorough and vigorous debate and scrutiny of legislation, we need researchers. I presume the Minister will say it is a matter for the commission but has this matter been thought through at departmental level from the point of view of what the commission can do in providing research facilities? The three elements are the 1:1 ratio as a minimum for Members; the pay cut of &euro;70 and the crucial business of research and research facilities.</P>

      <P>In discussing this issue one should acknowledge the progress made during the years. When I worked in Leinster House in the 1980s, three or four Senators shared a secretary. Matters have improved greatly in that we now have a secretary for every two Senators and also get a secretarial allowance which helps with secretarial assistance in the constituency. I agree with Senator Higgins that we should move as soon as practicable and as soon as the public finances allow to a ratio of 1:1. There is evolution in the role of Members of both Houses. In the early 1980s when Members went into opposition, even Front Bench spokespersons went back to their jobs. There was a sort of one man Opposition in that era which Senator Higgins might remember. To expect both a full-time secretary here and a full-time secretary in the constituency is probably rather jumping one's fences.</P>

All of us depend on our secretaries. However, this is probably a matter for the commission to look at and deal with; it is not strictly a matter for legislation.</P>
      <P>Research facilities have improved considerably during the years, both in terms of facilities in the Houses of the Oireachtas and those available to leaders of parties. One no longer has a one man research office, which was the situation 20 years ago. These matters need to be looked at and improved on a gradual basis.</P>

      <P>I wish to comment on the points raised by Senator Higgins, which are echoed and agreed with by Senators right around the House, regarding supports for Deputies and Senators and the ongoing need for the development of supports for both groups considering their increasingly onerous roles. There are increasing demands on public representatives. Members <Col N="1512" />know it is essential for a public representative not only to have secretarial help but also, from time to time, research assistance. It is critical that this is built into the process and that there is room and scope for the development of such services. I echo the remarks of other Senators about the improvements there have been, particularly in regard to the secretarial allowance and backup.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators, myself included, are full-time public representatives. At my own expense I run a part-time office, almost full-time, in Nenagh in order to provide the fullest representation I can. Running a constituency office is increasingly onerous when one does not have the allowances that go with being a Member of the Dáil. Not every Senator operates at that level. I am not making a case just for myself but how many Bills have we had before the House in this term alone &ndash; 12 or 13?</P>

      <P>A lot more even than in recent times. In recent months a huge number of Bills have been initiated in this House. In fairness to Senators, we have done a good job but would probably have done better if we had research facilities available to us. We are willing to have legislation initiated in this House and carry out that role. Judging from the response of Departments and various Ministers they welcome our response. This section of the Bill is important. I echo the remarks of other Senators.</P>

      <P>The issues of support, research assistance and extra secretarial assistance will be matters for the commission. There is substantial extra monetary provision in the overall budget but far be it from me to pre-empt what the commission might decide. Senators have their own axe to grind. Senator Higgins was generous in his praise of the substantial improvements made in recent years in terms of the support Deputies and Senators have received. While there is more to do, it is a matter for the commission on which Senators and Deputies will be well represented. It will be up to them to make the decisions. It is parliamentarians who will make them and they will have the experience and good sense to decide what is best.</P>
      <P>Secretarial assistants are paid from public funds provided for parliamentarians. That has been the case since the 1970s. It was only in 1996 that the arrangement was given legal cover when secretarial assistance was included in the facilities which could be provided. At that stage there was one secretarial assistant per three Senators. The position has improved but there is still scope to improve the numbers of support staff within the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Senators are either former or aspiring Deputies. There would be some concern about a Senator having a full-time office or assistant in the constituency. A recent legal case &ndash; the Kelly <Col N="1513" />case &ndash; took a particular view regarding the balance between sitting Deputies or Senators using their facilities compared to someone who was not a Member of the Houses.</P>
    <P>The issue is for the commission to decide. Good sense will prevail in regard to how to spend to best effect to support both sides of the Houses the &euro;295 million that will be made available.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), line 42, after &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who shall be the Chairman of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As we have already argued this, I do not want to regurgitate the argument as the Minister of State does not seem disposed towards it. It seems practical, and would be a recognition of the unique role of the Chamber as a stand alone legislature, that the Chairman of this assembly should be deputy chairperson and that this should be enshrined in legislation. Senator Mansergh made the point cogently that is implicit in section 9:</P>
      <P>If Dáil Éireann is dissolved, the chairperson or, if the chairperson is unable to perform his or her functions, the acting chairperson of the Commission continues to hold office until the Chairman of Dáil Éireann is elected following such dissolution.</P>
      <P>However, that is only the case in the event of dissolution. What would be the situation in the interim?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State stated he was confident the chairperson will do the right thing. However, being confident of something and enshrining it explicitly in legislation, as a recognition of the role and status of this House, are two different things. I see absolutely no reason that a section should not be enshrined in the legislation stating that the deputy chairperson should be the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State may correct me but my reading of section 9 is that, in practice, the deputy chairperson must be a Senator. Otherwise, section 9(1) does not make any sense. If that position is to be held by a Senator, it should be the Cathaoirleach. I would prefer this to be stated explicitly rather than implicitly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1514" />There is also an issue for this House in that the title of the Bill is the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill. Is there a certain equality between the Houses of the Oireachtas or is it sufficient to accept that the Dáil is by far the most important political body and that the Seanad is, politically-speaking, somewhere in the back of beyond? When dignitaries such as President Clinton, President Mitterand or Nelson Mandela visit Leinster House, it is normal that the Ceann Comhairle greets that person and that the only other person with speaking rights is the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad. There is a certain equality in that but everybody accepts, in this bicameral Oireachtas, that the Dáil is the primary Chamber and the Seanad is secondary. However, if there was any doubt about the meaning of section 9(1) and its implications, I would be unhappy.</P>
    <P>It is a question of what place the Seanad has in our democracy. Is it semi-supernumerary or semi-redundant or is it a partner? After all, this is not a Dáil commission Bill or a House of the Oireachtas commission Bill, rather it is the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill. There are two Houses and, for the purposes of running Leinster House, they should be equal, notwithstanding the primacy of the Dáil. I plead with the Minister of State to examine this matter overnight. If he can say to me that, in practice, section 9(1) means that the Cathaoirleach will be the deputy chairperson &ndash; otherwise, section 9(1) does not make much sense &ndash; I will accept it. I am sure I speak for all Senators when I say that this is something we would like examined and corrected.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is correct that we are not talking about a body which will behave in a politically partisan fashion. Everyone will try to do the right thing so that the Houses of the Oireachtas operate smoothly and, as far as possible, by consensus. The best way of achieving that is to appoint people who have been taken out of party politics as chairperson and deputy chairperson. I rest my case and look forward to the Minister of State's reply and any overnight reflections he might have on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is fair to say that Senators are proportionately well represented on the commission. The Ceann Comhairle is not the chair of the commission by virtue of him being chair of the Dáil. Rather, his office has for many years been responsible for the Houses. In practice, I expect that the only reason there will be an acting or deputy chairperson is in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle. The Ceann Comhairle is above politics, as is the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, and I expect the best decisions to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cathaoirleach is used to a select and well-mannered debating assembly. Therefore, it might not be good for his health to attempt to chair a commission in which Members of the Lower House might be present and not behave in such a well-mannered fashion. In practice, this will work out fine. The Seanad has no reason to feel <Col N="1515" />slighted. The fewer responsibilities we dictate to the new commission at this stage, the better. I have full confidence in the new commission and how it will be made up and that it will run its own affairs efficiently and correctly.</P>

      <P>Senator Mansergh made the case as strongly and logically as possible. When there are ceremonial occasions such as joint sittings, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is brought in and is the second speaker. There is a range of other examples where the role and status of the Cathaoirleach is recognised. Yet, our chairman is simply a member of this commission to administer and regulate the affairs of both Houses, rather than being the acting or deputy chairperson in the event of the absence of the chairperson. The Bill states that &ldquo;the commission may appoint a member of the commission to act as chairperson other than the Secretary General&rdquo;. However, there is no guarantee, although we all hope that will happen. I am at a loss to know why the Cathaoirleach cannot be pencilled in as the second in command in the event of the chairman not being present or able to carry out his or her functions.</P>

      <P>I cannot concede to this amendment because it is necessary to set out the formal process for the appointment of the deputy chairperson. The Bill says that the appointment is to be made in writing by the chairperson of the commission. There has been much debate about who should be deputy chairperson and who should have an input into the selection process. The only person on the commission whom the Bill precludes from being deputy chairperson is the Secretary General. All other members have an equal chance of being selected for this role. The Bill does not preclude consultation between the chairperson and the members prior to the appointment of the deputy chairperson.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposals for the remainder of section 7, it might seem banal, if not overkill, to work out the scenarios in which it might be necessary to appoint a temporary deputy chairperson, and this is the function of this section. For these reasons, I cannot accept the proposals.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) The Clerk of Seanad Éireann.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a repeat of the previous arguments about recognition of the status of the House, namely, that the senior administrative officer in Dáil Éireann, who is referred to in the Bill as the Sec<Col N="1517" />retary General, or effectively the chief executive, should be accompanied in an assistant role by the Clerk of the Seanad who would then be called the assistant Secretary General or assistant chief executive. The arguments are exactly the same and I see no reason the Clerk should not be the deputy or assistant to the chief executive or Secretary General of the commission.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss as to why this was not originally included in the Bill and was not seen in the Department and the parliamentary counsel's office as being a logical recognition of the status, role and autonomy of the House. We are not subservient to anyone. We are a stand-alone legislative Chamber conducting our business of initiating legislation and amending legislation from the other House in a constructive and often less confrontational manner than the Dáil. The Seanad is enshrined in the Constitution as part of the legislative process and I cannot see the reason the Clerk of the Seanad cannot be included as a deputy to the Secretary General assisting in all matters relating to the administration of the affairs of the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Higgins's amendment and echo his sentiments in this regard. It is very important and I am surprised the Clerk of the Seanad was not included <i>ab initio</i> in the legislation. It is very important that he or she is included specifically in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State in his remarks on earlier amendments appeared to take the view that the commission should be left to do its work because it knows how to do it. That is fine. We all know from long experience, however, that if certain matters are not spelt out in legislation passed through the Houses, there is no requirement in future for certain actions to be taken. While we set out the spirit of the legislation and how we might like to see it operate in practice, unless that is specified, we have no guarantee it will happen.</P>
      <P>I have concerns about the status of the Seanad. We are the poor relation and increasingly seen as such. Much lip service is paid to our role, especially where legislation is concerned, and we have pointed this out already. We are happy to be used as the first House for legislation but we are not given the resources necessary to perform that function properly, nor are we given the status it should accord. This omission in the legislation is a good example.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State ensure that the status of the Seanad as an independent and important part of the Oireachtas is set out clearly in the legislation by the inclusion of the amendment?</P>

      <P>I wish to make clear before making further observations that we are no more discussing personalities than we were with the discussion on the deputy chairperson. We are discussing the office and the role it plays, which is well fulfilled by the individual in it at present. A point could be made, and perhaps this is truer of those of us relatively new to House than those <Col N="1518" />who have been Members for a long time, that the Clerk of the Seanad knows many matters most of us might not always know.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the Civil Service back-up to the commission. The majority of commission members are Members of the Oireachtas. I fully accept the argument in the speech of the Minister of State that the Clerk of the Dáil serves a dual function and his or her importance is key. At the same time, will there not be a Civil Service back-up to the commission in a deputy capacity in the form of someone familiar with the Seanad? It appears to be a serious gap that the Clerk of the Seanad was not included, fully accepting the point, if one wishes to make it &ndash; and I paraphrase, probably unfairly, something the Minister of State said on Second Stage &ndash; that the Clerk of the Dáil is roughly twice as important as the Clerk of the Seanad. Be that as it may, the question is if there should be an input from someone at a senior level sitting in on the meetings of the commission who would have a long familiarity with the workings of the Seanad and experience at a different end from that of elected Senators. It seems to me that the case is pretty unarguable that it should be so.</P>
      <P>Naturally, as a Senator on the Government side, I must support the Government, what is put before us and what the Minister of State says. We all get into positions where that is the case. I have never even known a Taoiseach who supported party policy 100%.</P>
      <P>There is a gap here and I ask the Minister of State to look at it overnight. The commission will be lopsided if it only has the Clerk of the Dáil in attendance and not the Clerk of the Seanad. This is the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill and there are two Houses of the Oireachtas, not one and a half or one and a quarter. This is like the arguments about the European Union. In one sense Ireland has equal status to Germany and in another it does not. The same is true of the Dáil and the Seanad. This case should be seriously examined before the Bill is passed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has said a number of times that one civil servant from Leinster House <Col N="1519" />is to be a member of the commission and I have no problem making the point again. The sole non-politician is the person who has been in charge of the staffing and financial business of the Houses for years. He is already the Accounting Officer for its Vote and formally designated as the Civil Service head of the office. The fact that he is also the Clerk of the Dáil is neither here nor there, he is a member of the commission because he has been the head Accounting Officer. He will not be a member of the commission as the Ceann Comhairle's adviser, he will be there as the chief executive officer to serve all members of the commission. He is not there as the Dáil's man. If the situation arose where this House insisted that the Seanad's lady should be a member of the commission, there would also be a case for having the Dáil's man on it.</P>
    <P>The case is clear &ndash; the Clerk of the Dáil is a member of the commission as the chief executive officer to serve all members and look after all the interests of both Houses. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Minister of State's argument. The Clerk of the Dáil is a member of the commission in two capacities that are set out. He is there as the chief civil servant running the Oireachtas but also as an immensely important civil servant who has years of experience of the workings of the Dáil. That experience is of benefit. I do not accept that he is only there as someone who administers the Houses. I see no rational reason there should only be one civil servant or the Clerk of Seanad could not assist the Clerk of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>It is a question of the respect due to this House. Is the Seanad a House of the Oireachtas or is it half a House? The Government should learn to respect the Seanad and there should be a civil servant to represent it. I do not believe there is anyone on the Government side who would disagree with me. I would be grateful if the Minister of State would take that opinion back to the Minister for Finance and tell him it is the unanimous view of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>There is no question that, in terms of Civil Service back-up, the Clerk of the Seanad has something to contribute. What is this artificial construct that only one civil servant may be attached to this body? Joint committees of the Oireachtas have more than one civil servant attached. The test should be if the Clerk of the Seanad can contribute something substantial to the work of the commission. That case is unarguable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also a question of respect for this House. I am not convinced by my experience in the last year that this House gets the respect it deserves and is not taken for granted. Look at the title of the Bill &ndash; Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill &ndash; are there two Houses in the Oireachtas? If the answer is yes, both the Clerk of the Dáil and Clerk of the Seanad should be attached to the commission. I have no difficulty at all in <Col N="1520" />accepting that the Clerk of the Seanad should be there in a deputy capacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to shake my grey hairs but it is 22 years since I was elected to this House. Many people, including public servants outside and some inside the Houses, forget that this is an autonomous House. If someone wants to change the rules relating to security here, it cannot be done without the agreement of this House through its Committee on Procedures and Privileges. A picture cannot be put up on the walls in this building without the agreement of both Houses of the Oireachtas and that agreement is not automatically forthcoming, as people have found out on occasion. To suggest that this commission can be established without reflecting the autonomy of both Houses by having both the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle and the senior civil servant of both Houses members of it is to fly in the face of the absolute distinction between the two Houses. It is to pretend that there is some overarching concept of the Oireachtas that is institutionalised and that can be used to circumvent the fact that these are two autonomous Houses.</P>
      <P>As Senator Mansergh said, there are many Ministers, particularly those who are inexperienced or who have never been Members of this House, who misunderstand or underestimate it. They get over this after they get a couple of roastings here because they have not prepared properly. It would be regrettable if this issue was to be the current Minister of State's baptism of fire. Either he comes up with a better argument or he is flying in the face of the established traditions of the Houses of the Oireachtas for many years.</P>
      <P>There is absolute autonomy between the Houses. Nothing can be done in the Oireachtas without both Houses agreeing. Even though we all accept the constitutional primacy of the Dáil, the Constitution, while it clearly establishes that primacy, also specifically establishes the autonomy of the Seanad within the structure of the Oireachtas. The principle is not who is Clerk of either House, it is to have the procedures, wisdom and autonomy of both Houses properly represented on the commission. To say, as the Minister of State said, that it is all about Accounting Officers is a nonsense and unworthy of a man I know to be of considerable ability and intelligence because it is much more than this.</P>
      <P>The Clerk of the Dáil is the civil servant who will run the commission. That is what civil servants do and they do it well. None of us could function in politics if we did not have good civil servants who advise, support and assist us. The Secretary General of the commission will be the adviser, supporter, assistant and provider of expertise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implication of this section, as it stands, is that the commission can get sufficient advice on the way Seanad Éireann works as an autonomous House without having the senior civil servant from Seanad Éireann on it to give that advice. <Col N="1521" />That is both wrong and offensive to this House. What is even more offensive is the weakness of the Minister's defence. What happened was that somebody decided it was not necessary for Seanad Éireann to have equal representation on this commission and then, perhaps having forgotten, decided to dig up a <i>post hoc</i> rationalisation for it. Whatever the reason, it does not have any merit.</P>
    <P>The Clerk of the Seanad is a member of many other bodies, including the Public Offices Commission. Why did we not hand over membership of the Public Offices Commission and so many other bodies to the Clerk of the Dáil? It was because we recognised, until now, the autonomy of the two Houses of the Oireachtas. This is the first time somebody has attempted to merge them together for reasons of either administrative convenience or, as I suspect, a slightly indifferent unawareness of the way the two Houses operate. It is unworthy of the Minister to produce what I would regard as a particularly paper-thin defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my colleague, Senator Mansergh, said. Understandably, he got angry and I do not blame him. The Minister of State will remember that we debated this point last week on Second Stage. As Senator Ryan said, not only is the Clerk of the Seanad a member of other bodies but she is also a member of the body which surveys the boundary commission and decides the way constituencies will fare under the new system. The current incumbent happens to be a lady but that is neither here nor there. It is about the position of Clerk of the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I understood this commission was all about us, the Members of the Dáil and the Seanad, the running of the Houses in a businesslike way, having control of their own budgets, being able to work out what they will do with that money and how they will best run the Houses of the Oireachtas. This so-called omission of the Clerk of the Seanad from the make up of the commission was not a mistake. On the contrary, whoever came up with the idea deliberately left out a civil servant from the Seanad of the membership. It was a case of, &ldquo;We don't have to do that and we will not do it because the excellent Clerk of the Dáil will do&rdquo;. He is an excellent Clerk of the Dáil but the Minister now tells us he is the Secretary General of the commission and will be acting in that capacity. It is even more important, therefore, that there is a member from the Seanad on the commission. It is a deliberate affront to this House that the Clerk of the Seanad is not included among the members of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at it this way. We recognise the primacy of the Dáil in the Constitution but we also recognise the autonomous nature of this House. Lest anybody wishes to put it down or say it is not important, it should be remembered that legislation for the good of the people cannot be passed until it has gone through all Stages in this House, like the Bill before us on which the Minister has been very generous with his time. People <Col N="1522" />may find that wearisome or say that it takes up too much time. The Minister should not laugh because he must have said that on some occasion. Ministers may find it a burden to come to this House, but they have a constitutional obligation to do so as do the civil servants who service the Departments.</P>
    <P>In my office we have found that, by and large, they are excellent to deal with and I would have nothing said about the Ministers whom I or the staff chase up. They are polite, courteous, willing and they turn up. We have a great rapport with them regarding the business of the House. I am particularly appreciative of that because when I came into this House I was not packaged and ready-made as Leader of the Seanad. I was a battered, bruised person who did not get through the general election and it took a great deal of stern talking to myself before I got to the stage of full acceptance. I have very much enjoyed the work of the Seanad, but I am getting off the point.</P>
    <P>It is a deliberate affront to this House that the Clerk of the Seanad is not included as a member of the commission. The Clerk of the Dáil is a very good man but the attitude appears to be that he can do everything. I do not believe he will do everything. The Clerk of the Seanad should be a member of the commission. If this amendment is not accepted or resubmitted on Report Stage, the committee of which Senator Ryan and myself are two of the five members should address it through the reform package we are putting forward. I believe it is not understood in the higher echelons that we feel affronted and put to one side.</P>

The House will take Report Stage of the Bill tomorrow. I will withdraw the amendment but I serve notice on the House and the Minister that I intend to resubmit it on Report Stage. There is an irrevocable case for the inclusion of the Clerk of the Seanad as a member of the commission. There are no cost implications involved and there is no excuse.</P>

    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 23 is not to have too many &ldquo;ands&rdquo; in the unlikely event of the Minister accepting amendment No. 24. If he did not accept the previous amendment on the rep<Col N="1523" />resentation on the commission, by right, of the Clerk of this House, he is unlikely to accept this amendment. I do not want to be too pre-emptive but we can anticipate that position.</P>
    <P>The point was made strongly on Second Stage by Senator O'Toole that there are now worker-directors, staff members and workers on all State and semi-State bodies. It is logical that the commission would have a representative of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I have reflected on the matter in the meantime but the more I reflect on it, the less I know about how it will work because we have so many different elements and grades including administrative staff, ushers, messengers and so on. I would like to hear the Minister's response but it is not my wont to push this amendment to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Higgins's amendment. It is important, in terms of the construction of the commission, that it should include a representative of the staff of the Houses. One can think of boards throughout the country at various levels, and not only in the public sector, where the voice of the worker is heard. Considering the power and the role of this commission, particularly in relation to staff in the Houses, it would be appropriate that the staff were represented on it. That would send out an important signal and enhance the work of the commission. It would get away from the notion of a top down style of management towards a more co-operative and partnership style which previous Governments and the current one have promoted strenuously over the past few years.</P>
      <P>One would think that instead of just talking the talk we would walk the walk in the setting up of this commission to run our own business in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is an important principle which might seem like a small thing, but it is a very important issue. The Government should take on board the need for partnership and best management in the work the commission can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was taken up by me very vehemently at Second Stage last week. This Government has prided itself on its partnership approach to all of its dealings. Since 1987 we have had a series of three-year programmes of partnership, with various titles but all meaning the same thing, that everybody is working together. The various social pillars, including the trade unions and the farmers, are all in the partnership agreements that serve the country very well, in good times and bad. In my five years at the then Department of Public Enterprise, many near confrontations were avoided through recourse to partnership, as well as common sense and discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how, if we are operating nationally in a partnership framework, there is no workers' representative on the board of the commission. They might also be referred to as an employees' representatives &ndash; the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo;<Col N="1524" />might be a bit too proletarian. If the voice of the employee is heard at that level, there is no reason why it would not work on a partnership level.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the tunnel-visioned idea that there cannot be an employee representative, which is the import of this amendment, and also that there is no place for the Clerk of the Seanad. It is becoming a form of club, an elitist institution which will not have the <i>vox populi </i>represented, despite the likelihood of its doing excellent work. Like Senator Higgins, I do not hold out much hope of having the representatives in question on the commission.</P>
    <P>All my life I have been an advocate of the worker's voice being heard. Long before I was a Member of either of these Houses I was the school steward, in my ASTI days. I flexed my muscles quite handsomely in that position.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have notes drawn up by his learned staff, but perhaps he would give us his own ideas on this.</P>

      <P>I support what Senator O'Rourke has just said. We have appointed worker representatives to public and State bodies. It is part and parcel of modern European social democracy. If one looks at the staff of the House, I do not think revolution tomorrow is what we are likely to be facing. If we do this on commercial State bodies, why would we not do it on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission? If we were to privatise the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas, then perhaps this would not be a clause that we would want to agree to, but I do not anticipate that development.</P>
      <P>The general secretary of ICTU sits in this House. The trade unions have contributed an enormous amount to the prosperity of this country and the progress that has been made over the past 16 years. I wish he were here to make the case again, but I do not think that what he or the rest of us have to say should be lightly ignored. I do not see what major objective and serious reason there could be for not including a member of the Houses' staff on the commission. It is the enlightened, progressive thing to do and the Minister comes from a party that calls itself the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>The Clerk of the Dáil will act as Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and I am sure the Leader of the House will accept that one person in that capacity is quite sufficient. The present Clerk of the Dáil was also a former Clerk of the Seanad. In background and experience, I believe he is well fitted to carry out the job.</P>
      <P>It is not the case that every semi-State company has a worker director. The Ordnance Survey of Ireland has no worker directors on its board. That is one example. As the Senator knows, we learn something new every day. That is something I was not too familiar with previously.</P>

      <P>In terms of the experiment suggested, it would not suit the case here. We could keep on adding to the commission until it was bigger than this House or the Dáil, under the proposals that have been made.</P>
      <P>As far as partnership is concerned, the staff in this House work very long hours depending on the legislation that is going through. This week is an example. There is a suggestion that as they will not be represented on this commission it is in some way a slight upon their work. That is certainly not the case. The Government is very committed to the whole concept of partnership between management and staff in all offices staffed by civil servants. I have more than a suspicion that members do not realise the wide range of matters that partnership committees deal with. Neither can they be expected to know the degree to which, in several Departments, they are supplemented by structural groups through which various staff groups interact with what we call the MACs. We have local management and advisory committees and there is already one in this office.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government made it clear, from the earliest announcement of the Bill, that they would welcome local arrangements which would provide for staff representation below the level of the commission. It will be for the commission, or the local management, to make any desirable moves on this.</P>
      <P>The commission will be autonomous and very representative. The only disadvantage to this House is a numerical one, compared to the other House. This House will have three representatives, plus its Cathaoirleach and will be well represented in making its case. I expect in such a small group the debate will be at a very high level. I expect that it will go about its business in the best interests of both Houses and that balance will prevail. The staff have their say within the structures of social partnership, which are sufficient. The arrangements made on their behalf under benchmarking suggest that they are very well represented in making their case.</P>

      <P>I am a little disappointed by the reply of the Minister of State. I do not regard worker representation as an experiment. It has been in place for the past 15 years and appears to be working reasonably well. Rather than regarding it as dangerous and something to be guarded against, we should be trying to introduce it wherever we can.</P>
      <P>On the issue of the number of members of the commission, the Minister of State said there would be one boss. The Taoiseach has a Tánaiste and I understand every Secretary General of a Department has a deputy Secretary General. Only the Secretary General of the commission, the Clerk of the Dáil, will not have a deputy Secretary General. I do not follow that argument.</P>

A strong case has been made in favour of the amendment on all sides of the House.

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and praise the initiative by the Department of Foreign Affairs, who, with Ireland Aid, Trócaire and Burma Action Ireland, organised a 12-day visit to Ireland for ten exiled leaders of ethnic nationalities from Burma. The courses and workshops they attended, both North and South of the Border, and which the Department was involved in organising, will be of great use to them in the future. Having met many of them, I can advise the Minister of State that they are particularly grateful for the moral support they received from people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is aware that Burma has been run by a military junta since 1962. The human rights of the people have been abused and slave labour is used to run much of the country. In 1990, the National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, won over 80% of the vote in free elections. She is the daughter of the great general Aung San, <Col N="1530" />who brought freedom to Burma from the British. However, the election result meant little to the military rulers and neither she nor her colleagues were allowed to take up the reins of government.</P>
    <P>Aung San Suu Kyi was kept under house arrest for over 12 years until recently, when she was allowed visit some parts of the country. During one such trip to north Burma, on 30 May, she was attacked. Eye witness accounts and news agency reports say that when her motorcade approached the town of Tibayan, a mob of soldiers, police and others, including convicts dressed as monks, attacked the cars. Some members of the National League for Democracy were killed, beaten to death with clubs and stabbed with bamboo stakes. More recent reports say that piles of bloodstained clothes can still be found in the area. There can be no question but that a very serious event took place there.</P>
    <P>After this dreadful episode, the generals arrested Aung San Suu Kyi and other National League of Democracy members and their leaders and closed down their offices across the country. Since that time, Aung San Suu Kyi has been held in prison. The United National special envoy, Mr. Rosali Ishmael recently met the leader, but in his report he could not confirm where she was being held, although he said she was well. The military say she is in protective custody, but violence continues against her supporters.</P>
    <P>Aung San Suu Kyi is a freeman of the city of Dublin, an honour not lightly given. Her son received it on her behalf. Although she was awarded the Nobel peace prize, she could not leave Burma to collect it in person and nor could she leave to attend on the death of her husband in England two years ago because she knows that if she leaves Burma, she will not be readmitted.</P>
    <P>Given her years of captivity and the treatment she has recently received, one cannot but fear for Aung San Suu Kyi's health and perhaps even for her life. She is greatly admired internationally and especially in this country. On behalf of all those who support her so much, I ask the Minister of State to make immediate representations to the leaders of the military junta, to demand her release and to make a public statement to this effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The Government unreservedly condemns the imprisonment of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy, and demands her immediate and unconditional release. On 30 May 2003, she was travelling in northern Burma. According to reports, her supporters were attacked and fired on by followers of the Union, Solidarity and Development Association, a group which supports the Burmese regime. Along with 18 others, Aung San Suu Kyi was detained and unconfirmed reports at the time indicate that she received head injuries. I understand she has since <Col N="1531" />been brought back to the Rangoon area and is now in custody. Recent reports indicate she is being imprisoned at the infamous insane prison. At the time of the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese Government also announced the closure of a number of offices of the National League for Democracy and universities.</P>
      <P>On 10 June 2003, Mr. Rosali Ishmael, the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General, was allowed to visit Aung San Suu Kyi in her prison cell and he reported her to be unharmed. Mr. Rosali stated that he had received assurances from the regime that she would be soon released, but, to date, it has not responded to the calls by the international community and she has not yet been released, nor is she allowed visitors.</P>
      <P>On 2 June 2003, Mr. Solana, the representative for the European Union common foreign and security policy, issued a statement condemning the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi by the military Government of Burma. He urged her immediate release and the reopening of the offices of the National League for Democracy. He added that the regime's repressive behaviour confirmed its lack of interest in the return to democracy. It will almost certainly, and rightly, reinforce the European Union's resolve to stick to the current policy of sanctions against the military regime. The Government fully associated itself with Mr. Solana's statement.</P>
      <P>A <i>démarche</i> on behalf of the EU was also delivered by the acting presidency in Rangoon to the Burmese authorities. It sought the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her party officials and the reopening of the National League for Democracy offices and universities. The European Union called on the Burmese authorities to refrain from any action which might inflame further tensions and co-operate fully and constructively with Razali Ismail, special representative of the United Nations Secretary General.</P>
      <P>Statements have also been made by Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, on 31 May and 23 June regarding developments in Burma. He called on the regime to release immediately Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the NLD and work with all parties, including the NLD, to bring about national reconciliation in Burma as soon as possible. Recent events in Burma have been discussed by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Burmese and ethnic leaders of the Democratic Movement in Exile. Recently, these leaders participated in capacity building training in Ireland which was funded by Ireland Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Events were discussed at EU level by Ministers at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 16 and 17 June. The Council adopted conclusions on Burma which called for the release of Suu Kyi, the reopening of universities and the offices of the National League for Democracy and the holding to account of those <Col N="1532" />responsible for the attack on Suu Kyi. The conclusions called on the Burmese Government to enter into substantive and meaningful dialogue with the opposition, expressed support for the efforts of the UN Secretary General's special representative and called on ASEAN countries, as well as China, India and Japan, to use their influence with Burma to effect change. Furthermore, the Council agreed that the ministerial level EU Troika which had been planned to visit Burma in July this year would not go ahead.</P>
    <P>In view of the further deterioration of the political climate in Burma, the Council decided to review and strengthen the EU common position and extended the scope of the visa ban and assets freeze to include further members of the regime. The Council has also decided to enforce the prohibition on technical training or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of arms, munitions and military equipment.</P>
    <P>On 3 June the Burmese Foreign Minister, Win Aung, wrote to Foreign Minister Papandreou of Greece, which holds the EU Presidency, setting out the Burmese Government's version of recent events. A common response on behalf of all EU Foreign Ministers setting out our agreed position has since been sent. The European Council at Thessaloníki, on 18 and 19 June, expressed its continued grave concern over developments in Burma. It urged the Burmese authorities immediately to release Suu Kyi, as well as other members of the NLD, and reopen NLD offices.</P>
    <P>Since the detention of Suu Kyi, the EU Troika has carried out a series of <i>demarches</i> in the region. These contacts have taken place with several of the Foreign Ministries of members of ASEAN, including Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore, and, in the wider region, India, China and Japan. At the recent 36th ASEAN ministerial meeting in Phnom Penh on 16 and 17 June, in an unusual departure from ASEAN's policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of its member states, the Foreign Ministers engaged in a reportedly frank exchange regarding recent developments in Burma to which an unprecedented reference was made in the final communiqué.</P>
    <P>The ASEAN regional forum, which includes the USA and the European Union among its members, also met on 18 and 19 June. Delegates expressed their disquiet and pressed the Burmese Foreign Minister to take steps to release Suu Kyi and enter into dialogue with the Opposition. At the meeting Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, was vocal in his calls for the release of Suu Kyi and asked that more pressure be brought to bear on Burma by ASEAN partners. Proposals are at an advanced state for legislation in the USA to impose trade restrictions on imports from Burma. The US Administration is also working on a travel ban of senior Burmese officials.</P>
    <P>On 23 June the Japanese Vice-Foreign Minister, Mr. Tetsuo Yano, travelled to Burma where he conveyed a message from the Japanese Government which requested that Suu Kyi be set <Col N="1533" />free as soon as possible. Since then Japan has decided to freeze any new development assistance to Burma. This week Indonesia assumed the chair of ASEAN and it is expected that its Foreign Minister will lead an ASEAN delegation to Burma in the coming months.</P>
    <P>Later this month Ireland will be represented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, at the ASEM Foreign Ministers' meeting in Bali on 23 and 24 July. This meeting of EU and Asian Foreign Ministers will be hosted by the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Wirajuda, and will provide an important opportunity for Ireland, with our EU partners, to convey our serious concerns on Burma to our Asian partners. The ASEM process represents the best forum through which to strengthen dialogue and partnership between the European Union and Asia on issues of common concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I am quite sure he is right to say it is best that nearby Asian countries bring pressure to bear but it is truly dreadful to think that when EU Ministers travel to Bali, Suu Kyi might still be imprisoned in Burma.</P>

      <P>Ronan Jordan was born on 1 June 1998 and lives at 9 Fenian Road, Ballina, County Mayo. Individual assessment of Ronan was conducted in a Montessori school setting over four separate sessions, the most recent of which took place on 7 April 2003. With the permission of the House, I wish to read from the report on an assessment of Ronan carried out by Sinead Quinn, a psychologist with the Western Health Board. It states:</P>
      <P>Throughout the assessment, Ronan presented as a highly distractible child with a very limited attention span. Behavioural difficulties were also evident in the form of general non-compliance with the assessment process. The significance of Ronan's speech and language difficulties was also evident during assessment. His speech was frequently difficult to understand even with contextual clues. Ronan's class teacher, whom he knows for approximately two years, reports that she can continue to experience difficulty understanding him at times. Given the extent of Ronan's speech and language difficulties, it is also likely that Ronan experienced some difficulty understanding the standardised language used as part of the assessment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ronan's cognitive ability was assessed using the Wechsler pre-school and primary scale of intelligence, revised, UK edition. On the basis of Ronan's performance during this assessment, he obtained an overall result consistent with functioning within the borderline range of ability, between low average and mild learning <Col N="1534" />disability. His performance on both verbal and non-verbal sub-tests was also indicative of functioning within this range of borderline range of ability.</P>
    <P>Speech therapy reports indicate that Ronan presents with a severe receptive language disorder, a severe expressive language disorder and significantly delayed phonological development. Speech therapy assessments also indicate significant difficulties with intelligibility, attention control and listening skills . Informant reports suggest that Ronan's self-help skills are, approximately, age appropriate. I understand that Ronan has required considerably more individual attention and support than many of his peers in Montessori school.</P>
    <P>Regarding Ronan's social skills and relationships, the report indicates the following:</P>
    <P>Teacher reports indicate that Ronan initially experienced considerable difficulty interacting appropriately with his peers when he first attended Montessori. While Ronan has made good progress in this regard, it is likely that he will require some support in this area on transition to primary school, at least in the initial stages. Informant reports together with observations during assessment would suggest that Ronan can be quite assertive and demanding within his relationships with both children and adults.</P>
    <P>There is a history of concern for Ronan's behaviour within home, school and speech therapy contexts. He presents as a head-strong and determined child who can present with significant management difficulties. Within speech therapy contexts, for example, I understand that poor levels of compliance during sessions resulted in his speech and language therapist supporting him in an alternative format for a time, that is through a school based programme. Ronan's history of non-compliant behaviour may be particularly significant in the context of his forthcoming school placement in that difficulties of this nature will significantly impede his ability to access the curriculum.</P>
    <P>Ronan is a pre-school child who presents with severe receptive and expressive speech and language disorder and significantly delayed phonological development. He also presents with potentially significant difficulties in the areas of behaviour, attention and concentration. Despite high levels of support and input within home, educational and speech therapy settings to date, Ronan continues to experience considerable difficulties within these areas.</P>
    <P>The report's recommendations are as follows:</P>
    <P>Given the range and extent of Ronan's difficulties he will require very high levels of support within the school setting in order to meet his needs appropriately. Ronan has been proposed as a candidate for admission to the <Col N="1535" />speech and language class, Scoil Croí Íosa but was unfortunate not to obtain a place for this academic year.</P>
    <P>Consequently, given his forthcoming placement in a mainstream infant class [at Culleens national school, Ballina, which has agreed to take him] Ronan's receiving school is strongly advised to apply for the following support for him:</P>
    <P>Access to resource teaching hours. In this regard, it is hoped that the Department will give due consideration to the significance of Ronan's speech and language difficulties, together with recognition of his other areas of difficulty as outlined and to the fact that he narrowly missed placement in a local speech and language class.</P>
    <P>Access to classroom assistance hours. It is advised that, in the first instance, full-time classroom assistance be made available to Ronan for the first two terms of his junior infant year, with a review scheduled for the end of his first term. The school are advised to seek the involvement of their educational psychologist as part of this process.</P>
    <P>The school should apply for these supports as soon as possible in an endeavour to have them in place when Ronan commences school in September 2003.</P>
    <P>Ronan's receiving school are also advised to liaise closely with their educational psychologist in relation to how best school staff can meet Ronan's variety of needs within a mainstream class/school setting.</P>
    <P>In addition to Ronan's placement in an appropriately supportive school environment he will also continue to require access to support and input from speech therapy professionals. It is my understanding that Ronan is <Col N="1536" />to continue receiving therapy within the community clinic setting.</P>
    <P>The school in question has made a strong recommendation and I quoted the psychologist's report. It is clear and decisive in making the specific recommendations which I have raised in presenting this Adjournment Matter to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's position on this matter. The Minister for Education and Science is most anxious that all children receive an education appropriate to their needs.</P>
      <P>The pupil in question is due to start in Culleens national school, Killala Road, Ballina, County Mayo, in September 2003. An application for resource teaching and special needs assistant support for the pupil was submitted by the school and received in the Department on 3 June 2003. The Department is currently processing applications for special education supports made by schools after 14 February, 2003. The process involves an examination of each application and supporting professional documentation by the National Educational Psychological Service or NEPS and schools will be informed of the outcome at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>The application, together with professional reports, in respect of the person referred to by the Senator will be considered in this context. When the NEPS has submitted its recommendation, officials from the Department of Education and Science will convey a decision to the school authorities. I hope this clarifies the position for the Senator and I thank him once again for giving me the opportunity to respond to the matter of special needs support for the child in question. I will raise the matter personally with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.25 p.m. until 10.30&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, 2 July 2003.</P>
