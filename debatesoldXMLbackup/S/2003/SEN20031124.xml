      <P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the status of phase 2b of Mullingar Hospital, with particular reference to the possible loss of its accident and emergency and maternity services, under the proposals of the Hanly report.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Order of Business and I welcome the fact the legislation is before the House.</P>
      <P>Last week, in reply to a question I posed, the Leader kindly informed me that two pieces of legislation currently on the Order Paper, Nos. 7 and 8, are still with the Department awaiting additional amendments to the principal legislation.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What other legislation does the Government propose to bring to the House in the four weeks before the Christmas recess? This side of the House would co-operate with the Government in bringing forward legislation. Can the Leader tell <Col N="1254" />the House what additional legislation is required in order that we can be as constructive as possible on the matter?</P>
    <P>Over the weekend we heard of the tragic death of an 18 month old child from a virulent strain of influenza. In the United Kingdom in the past number of weeks, six children have died from this form of the disease. Given that the Minister for Health and Children will meet a committee within his Department to address this issue this week, would he consider coming to the House to make a statement on the matter? Many parents of young children are concerned by this and while no one wishes to whip up concern about epidemics, information on the record of the House would be useful to the public and to Members. This particularly virulent form of influenza is devastating for young children and we extend our sympathy to the parents of the young boy who died last week. I ask that statements be made by the Minister for Health and Children or by a Minister of State from his Department during the course of this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Senator Brian Hayes on No. 7, which has been raised on several occasions by Senator Henry, and No. 8. What legislation will come before the House before Christmas? Although we received a list a month or six weeks ago, I am not sure of the current position. There are currently six Seanad Bills before the Dáil, some of which were rushed through this House following considerable pressure, which is a little like the approach being taken to legislation this week. Senators are entitled to know the exact position with regard to legislation before the Dáil which was passed by this House, legislation due to be taken in this House before Christmas and the legislation on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Last week, we noted the decision of the courts to find George Redmond guilty of the crime of corruption. A crucial issue has been raised by this case, about which, I am sure, Senators will have been asked questions. I understand it is a crime to offer a bribe inasmuch as this bribery is also corruption. I have no interest in talking about the Director of Public Prosecutions or anybody else, but I want to know precisely what is the law and what is Government policy in this regard. It does not do the law any good if people give evidence of offering what appear to be bribes &ndash; I choose this word wisely &ndash; on the basis of which other people are found guilty of accepting bribes and of being corrupt without any follow-up against the people who offered the money in the first instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a major issue. In terms of trust and confidence in the legal system and the way we do our business, we are entitled to hear the Government's view on this matter. If there is a problem or the law needs to be changed, the <Col N="1255" />House should be informed. My understanding is that offering bribes is a crime. Are steps being taken to respond to this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>A speech in which the Taoiseach stated civil servants must earn their benchmarking payments has been widely reported today. Many people will be asking questions about Deputies, Senators, Ministers and the Taoiseach. I do not agree with making simplistic, headline-seeking remarks on the number of days we sit or the way in which we sign in because most politicians, including me, work at least five days per week. I frequently give up most of my free time on Saturdays and Sundays to do political work. The focus should be on whether the work we do in the House when it sits is worthwhile and effective. This week's business, for example, has not been organised in the most effective manner, in that the Committee and Final Stages of important legislation have been squeezed into two days with a drip-feed of MEPs scheduled on the remaining two days. While I support the idea that the House should have a greater role in monitoring European affairs, it is not being done properly. I wonder why Pat Cox, MEP, who recently came before the House, is to come before us again this week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, a Chathaoirligh, I thought you were preventing me from speaking. The Labour Party has produced proposals on Dáil and parliamentary reform. Will the Leader have a proper debate in the House on how we can organise our business more effectively? This should involve examining changes to Standing Orders, ways in which we could have proper parliamentary investigation and so forth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senators will join me in marking the 40th anniversary of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy which took place on Saturday, 22 November 1963. Some five months before his death the President graced the Houses with his presence at a joint sitting of the Dáil and Seanad. My father was honoured to be <Col N="1256" />a Member of the Upper House at that time and was present in the Chamber for it so it has a resonance in my family, as it has in many others on both sides of the House. Perhaps the Leader will commend RTE, even if it was just a short clip on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; programme last night. It brought back many memories for those who remember that time. I compliment Peadar Lawless, the former head usher, who was featured in the programme but why he was outside the gates of Leinster House rather than inside is a question somebody might answer. Will the Leader consider suggesting to RTE that it do a programme at the end of this year showing this archive material because we only see clips of it from time to time?</P>
      <P>I wish to mark yet another atrocity that has taken place, this time in Istanbul, since the House last met. Yet again the world was visited by indescribable horror. One had only to look at the images conveyed from Istanbul and Italy in recent days, showing grieving families, girlfriends who lost their boyfriends and mothers who lost their sons, to wonder when it will stop. The Minister, Deputy Cowen, is currently in Africa and I compliment him on stating that Africa will be brought to the top of the agenda during the EU Presidency. Given what is happening in the world today, and when one thinks of what happened in 1963 it seems like an age of innocence in comparison, will the Leader invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House before the end of the year so we can debate these international issues? Ireland is taking on a more important role from January as EU President than it has ever done in the past. In that context, the Leader might consider allocating time before the recess for a debate on the international situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes's call for more information on the legislation to be brought before the House before the Christmas break. The Residential Tenancies Bill has been before the Dáil for some time, but it was due to come before the Seanad this session. That has not yet happened. Are any two Ministers in Cabinet speaking to each other or has the Taoiseach any friends in Cabinet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, or the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to the House to discuss the serious situation that has arisen with the administration of the disabled person's grant scheme? The Irish Medical Organisation has written to each medical practitioner advising a payment of &euro;65 for the completion of the certificates for the disabled person's grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it is urgent. Much hardship has been inflicted on elderly and disabled people because there is a huge backlog in the scheme. A serious problem has also arisen with regard to the completion of certificates. It is important to have a debate on this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I support the construction workers who are picketing the offices of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There is an obligation to provide for workers' pensions. The construction workers are expressing their anger that their employers, the developers, have not been paying the mandatory contributions to their pension schemes. The figure runs to more than &euro;30 million. These people often put lives at risk because developers do not take their obligations seriously and provide for the health and safety of workers. I ask the Leader to ask the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social and Family Affairs to address this problem and ensure that measures are put in place to provide for the pensions of these construction workers.</P>

      <P>I would like a debate on the fishing industry with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. While I realise he has probably been in this House more than any other Minister in recent months, it has been to debate his communications brief. It is important to have a debate on fisheries. A new licensing regime was put in place last week which has been welcomed by many people. It has removed much uncertainty for fishermen who could not get a licence and whose fishing boats have been tied up for the past five to seven months. However, others do not agree with the licensing regime. Perhaps it would be useful to debate the issue in the House, particularly as there is an important Fisheries Council meeting in December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to free up gardaí from administrative duties and have them out on the beat in order to increase resources. I am concerned, however, that this could lead to the closure of rural Garda stations. I would like to hear the Minister's viewpoint on the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole's concerns on bribery. It appears extraordinary that just one side of the equation is prosecuted. For a bribe to be effective, someone must make it. The initiation of the criminal act comes from someone other than the person who receives the bribe and he or she must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>This leads me to comment on Senator Terry's remark. She called for a debate, which I support, on construction workers. Fair is fair &ndash; one must maintain proportionality. How could the construction industry be expected to maintain full contributions when it was contributing so generously to the pension arrangements of people like Mr. Redmond? They must live in the real world.</P>
      <P>On Senator Tuffy's comments about a debate on whether we are using our time properly in the House, I think that would be counter-productive. This would be seen by the media as another bit of navel gazing. At my age, my navel has been gazed out of existence so I could not agree with this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what has been said on the other side of the House about the appalling situation in Istanbul. One's heart would have to go out to the people whose lives were blasted there. It is <Col N="1259" />important that this House continues to monitor the situation. I have asked the Leader to continue with a debate on Iraq and its consequences world-wide because I think we did a useful job in analysing the situation. The Leader and many other Members who warned that a hornet's nest was being stirred up are tragically being proved right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week we heard of the intention of the Government and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to further extend the period applicants for the back to education scheme must be on unemployment assistance prior to gaining access back into education. That runs contrary to statements made by many Ministers including the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, who trumpeted his intention of providing greater access to education for the disadvantaged. How can those two different stances be reconciled? It was the most severe and callous assessment, to deny people access to back to education allowances. Many people who are trying to get a second chance are being excluded by this Government. I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to return to this House. Furthermore, I support my colleague, Senator Finucane, who requested that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, come into the House, now that he is reviewing all rural Garda stations. His is said to be outsourcing secretarial work currently performed by members of the Garda. If he is releasing manpower in this way, it should be put back into the rural stations that have already closed rather than continue to close them and allow criminals to run freely through the countryside. There are law and order problems in the countryside as well as in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to those who are concerned about the implications for bribe takers without it being recognised that to offer a bribe must, similarly, be a crime. I question the policy we appear to have adopted of handcuffing people. I understood that people who were charged before the courts were handcuffed if there was a danger of them escaping or running away. I was surprised to see a 79 year old man who did not seem likely to run away, being handcuffed. I do not know the rules. I wonder if we are adopting what appears to be the norm in the United States, which means that everyone charged or arrested is handcuffed.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider a debate on the policy implications of social capital in view of the interesting report on the subject from the National Economic and Social Forum which was launched three weeks ago? It is a reminder that the glue holding the fabric together is often the voluntary non-governmental organisations. This is a worthy document, well worth a debate and I would welcome the opportunity to have it brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the issue raised by Senator Terry as regards the non-payment of their statutory contributions by certain employers. I believe a small number of employers flout the law in this regard. I am a former Minister of State in the Department of Labour. There is a raft of legislation dealing with labour affairs in general. It is not so long since construction workers had to march on the streets to ensure safety regulations were applied to sites. This is a further indication of the neglect of this important section of the community. Construction workers have made a major contribution to our economic performance in the last few years. To get an idea of how active the sector is in this city one just has to look out the window. It is only fair that construction workers get their entitlements. It will create an enormous problem in a few years if not summarily dealt with. I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, who is responsible for labour affairs, to get involved so we can find out why the law is not being enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Finucane's request that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come into the House to explain his proposed reforms of the Garda. As Senator Ulick Burke indicated, there are huge problems with law and order in rural as well as urban areas. Over a number of years we have seen the continuous decline in the number of manned rural Garda stations. Any proposal to decrease that number further should be seriously discussed in this House. I urge the Minister to come to the House to discuss the proposed reforms.</P>
      <P>I raised the possibility of a debate on the arts a couple of weeks ago. It has not appeared on either the Order of Business for last week or the schedule for this week. I urge the Leader to find time, if possible, to have such a debate in the next couple of weeks. We have not had a debate on the arts in the Seanad so far, so we should have one as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Like others I was truly shocked at the bombings in Istanbul. I am sure many Senators noted the words of Canon Ian Sherwood who spoke after the memorial service yesterday and who is a constituent of Dublin University. He said we need to address the reasons for these terrible atrocities. If the Leader can organise a debate on Iraq I hope we can extend it to include such issues.</P>

      <P>In the light of Ireland's impending Presidency of the EU it would be appropriate to invite the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the Seanad as we seem to have forgotten that agriculture is still a mainstay of our economy. While it does not make headlines in the national newspapers it is very important to many Senators, including me and my constituency. We have a difficulty regarding sheep tagging because during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease sheep <Col N="1261" />were tagged individually. The Minister should, during our Presidency, ensure we return to a flock tagging system which is more suitable. Can the Leader please invite the Minister to the House for a debate on agriculture before we assume Presidency of the EU?</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, asked correctly what other legislation will come before the House before Christmas. As I said last week, amendments to the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 will be circulated today and we hope to speak on Committee Stage of that Bill next week. There have been almost 200 submissions on the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2003. I cannot say when that Bill will emerge as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is currently processing the submissions. We have been informed that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill 2003 will be on Report Stage in the Dáil this week. It will come to this House next week when I hope we will be able to take it.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon asked about the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003. The Dáil referred this to the select committee on Friday last. The committee will discuss it before it returns to the Dáil and then to this House. I understand the State Airports Bill 2003 will go to the Dáil and then come here before Christmas. Those are the only Bills of which we have notification so far. The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill 2003 should be before the House next week.</P>
      <P>Following the sad death of an 18 month old child from the Fujian strain of influenza A, people with young children are very worried because they did not envisage young children being so susceptible. It would be very useful if the Minister for Health and Children could come here and speak about it. We will submit that request.</P>

    <P>Senator Joe O'Toole asked about Bills before the other House. I have no control over Bills before the other House. They are taking an inordinate time which I do not understand but that is not our business. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003 which is before us today is not being rushed. I scheduled it to run until 6 p.m. last Thursday and it finished at 3.20 p.m., so two and a half hours of debating time were left. Nevertheless, there was a good debate on the Bill, those who spoke had excellent points to make and they received a good hearing. It was quite remarkable that two and a half hours should have lain fallow in that debate but be that as it may it was not rushed. There will be a full afternoon allowed for debate today. Furthermore, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be here. She has not passed the Bill to anyone else. She took it for most of Thursday and she will be here all afternoon as well. It is a mark of great respect to the Seanad that the <Col N="1262" />senior Minister is coming here for the debate on the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator Tuffy asked about benchmarking and civil servants. It is for the Taoiseach to speak about that matter. We have proved in this House that Members are willing to sit longer hours and why should they not? There is nothing wrong with extra sittings. They are appropriate. We are present in great numbers today and we are delighted with ourselves.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy asked about Seanad reform and objected to the visit of Pat Cox, MEP, to this House. As the Cathaoirleach pointed out, that issue was discussed at length. The Senator's party has a representative on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Ultimately, he proposed it and I seconded it.</P>

      <P>I am telling the Senator how it came about. There will be a debate on the Estimates tomorrow.</P>
      <P>There is a very important Bill before the House and I wanted time to concentrate on it. We gave it plenty of time last week, although some two and a half hours of debate time was not used. I prefer to be straightforward about this issue. We scheduled a great length of time for the Bill and further time is scheduled for it tomorrow. The Tánaiste is due to bring the Bill to the Dáil on Thursday and Friday, after which it will proceed to Committee Stage. The Bill will be an Act before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy also talked about Seanad reform and I hope she will be as enthusiastic when we get the report in January. I imagine the Senator will be enthusiastic because she is a very assiduous Member of the House. I look forward to her being a very strong supporter of Seanad reform. We will see how it all works out, but for today we are very pleased to be here and to prove that benchmarking works.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney mentioned RTE's 40th centenary programme on the death of President Kennedy. I imagine we all kept switching across the various television stations. Different stations had different films on the subject and John Bowman presented a very good radio programme about it on Saturday morning. If RTE was to combine all its archive television footage on President Kennedy, it would make a good programme.</P>
      <P>The events in Istanbul brought terrible grief. I will ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to attend the House. I am sure he would like to do so before the year end to talk about the international situation.</P>

      <Col N="1263" />I pointed out to Senator Bannon that the Residential Tenancies Bill is only now gone to the select committee. There are numerous committees sitting this week, but there is not one piece of legislation before any of them. They are merely meeting deputations and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has been asked to attend the House in connection with the disabled persons grant scheme. There have been many complaints about the scheme.</P>

      <P>Senator Terry raised the construction workers' pensions. I do not know why the protest is outside the office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I am perplexed about it. The issue, which was also raised by Senator Daly, of construction workers being left short of their proper pensions would surely be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. I will take up the matter because it has been raised twice.</P>
      <P>Senator Kenneally asked that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources attend the House for a debate on fisheries. We have information on the new fisheries box and an important meeting on that issue is scheduled for December.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane approved of freeing the Garda of administrative duties, but he expressed concern about the possible closure of rural Garda stations. We will try to get the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House to discuss that issue.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris, O'Toole and Quinn noted that those who give bribes are as much at fault as those who take them. I do not know the legal position. The issues of people giving bribes and accepting bribes are never treated contemporaneously. This is a matter we should try to clear up.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also raised the matter of the construction workers' pensions, while Senator Ulick Burke brought up the matter of the back to education allowance and the extra time now necessary before a person qualifies for it. He asked about inviting the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, to the House. She was here the week before last.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn spoke about bribery and the NESF report on the policy implications of social capital. Senator Mooney also raised that issue. I have the report, which is excellent, and may be able to include the issue on the agenda next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Daly supports Senator Terry on the issue of non-payment of statutory contributions by certain employers. Senator John Paul Phelan asked about Garda reform and called for a debate on the arts. The leader of the Opposition asked <Col N="1264" />for that debate some time ago. The Minister was in the House last week to speak on tourism but we have told him that that this Seanad has had no debate on the arts. We will endeavour to get him back to the House on this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of Iraq, Istanbul and the international scene, as did Senators Norris and Mooney. Senator Feighan suggested that we invite the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the House before the Irish EU Presidency begins, particularly with reference to sheep tagging and the need to debate the issue fully in the House. I would welcome that debate. We are lucky at the moment that Ministers are free to come to the House regularly but once spring comes and our Presidency begins, we will find it difficult to get hold of them. However, we can debate Seanad reform then or do as we are doing today. I cannot find any other occasion in its record of the Seanad sitting on a Monday.</P>

It will then be up to him or her to recruit staff members, which should happen a few weeks from now. However, if the Senator's question concerns when we will be able to deal with the first cases, I hope it will be in February 2004. I want to consult with the MIAB chairperson, Dorothea Dowling, after the legislation becomes law because we do not want to set an unrealistic commencement date.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 31, after &ldquo;actions&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than an action involving a claim for damages arising from a breach of the Constitution or the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, or a claim for aggravated or exemplary damages&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 deals with the claims that will be allowed to go before the board and these amendments deal with some of my concerns. The number of claims before the board is huge, with an estimated 12,000 employer liability claims arising in a year. If the assessment board is staffed by 100 people, they will have to deal with a huge number of claims under that heading alone. If it is extended, as is intended, to motor insurance claims, there will be a greatly increased volume. To provide a catch-all in the Bill could be lazy or could catch every tort that might come down the road. If we intend to provide for certain types of claims, we should do that and not say the board can do whatever it wants and deal with any other civil action that may arise.</P>
      <P>In the amendment we specifically refer to the limited number of claims dealing with breaches of constitutional rights and cases that might arise under the European Convention on Human Rights Act where aggravated damages might be appropriate and the courts, if they were hearing the case, would decide that the circumstances of a particular claim were so egregious that such damages be awarded. This would happen where a claimant has been messed about by a respondent or where the circumstances of the case were outrageous and involved civil servants or the Garda Síochána. There have been cases in recent times involving allegations of breaches of constitutional rights as a result of wrongful imprisonment or incidents in the street. Were those incidents to come before the courts and the courts found in favour of the claimants, they would award aggravated damages. The Tánaiste did not intend that such cases would be dealt with by the assessment board and we should be clear about that in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well disposed to this amendment and have consulted with the Parliamentary Counsel on it. I will come back on Report Stage here or in the Dáil with different wording if we cannot accept that of the Senator. I take the point and we are happy to accept it, subject to legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with that. Will the Tánaiste address the issue of the volume of claims she expects the board to deal with? Apart <Col N="1266" />from the principle behind the Bill, which my party accepts, we are concerned that the board will have the resources, staff and time to deal with the huge volume of claims which could come before it. Does the Tánaiste expect it will be extended to motor insurance claims at an early date or will that take several years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the proposals from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Transport are in place, the volume of claims in this area could be reduced over time. We are talking about 27,000 cases per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill proposes that a case must be dealt with within 15 months so 27,000 cases per annum will have to be dealt with. That is an extremely ambitious target. Is the Tánaiste satisfied, based on the staffing put in place by the interim board, that this is achievable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied on the basis of the work that has been done in advance of the statutory establishment of the PIAB that we will have the necessary resources. Whatever resources are needed will have to be applied to the area and since this will be a self-financing board, if additional resources are required they will have to come from the fees that will be levied on respondents, but the organisation will be able to meet the challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for going on about it but the subject will arise later so we should deal with it now. Can the Tánaiste give an indication of the staff numbers involved from the start and if regional offices will be part of the arrangement, whether from outside or by transferring existing civil servants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, we are talking about a central office. The board has identified a suitable premises and it is negotiating with the landlord with a view to acquisition. We are looking at a staff complement of approximately 80 to 100 and an annual bill of &euro;7 million to &euro;8 million. These will not be civil servants. Many of them will come from the private sector. Obviously, once employed, they will become civil servants, working for a State body. We envisage that many of the people who come to work in the PIAB will possess expertise from the private sector in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following definition:&ndash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;medical practitioner' means a registered medical practitioner as defined by section 5 of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House. The words &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo; occur in section 11(3)(<i>c</i>) and in section 24. Section 11(3)(<i>c</i>) refers to a report from the medical practitioner who is treating the patient. Section 24 refers to those people to whom the claimant may be referred if he or she or the respondent is not happy with the medical report.</P>
      <P>I realise that section 24 allows the referral of a patient to someone who is practising outside the State. However, the Tánaiste should seriously consider section 11 and decide who can give these medical reports. When I discussed this earlier, I was told that, in general, it was expected to be the general practitioner, but if it is left as loosely worded as the &ldquo;medical practitioner&rdquo;, the range of persons who could supply the reports could be very wide and it would not be confined to registered medical practitioners. They could also be people such as chiropractors or those involved in acupuncture, who are all very worthy but may give different types of reports from those that are expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not illegal to call oneself a medical practitioner in this country once one does not claim to have qualifications. One can treat people although the legal situation regarding animals is much stricter. One cannot go around calling oneself a vet, but one can say one is a medical practitioner. Alternative medicine is becoming more popular with patients so one could get a report from a very wide range of people. We saw reports this weekend of a person who came here promoting herbal medicines having a meeting with the <Col N="1268" />Minister for Health and Children. This may be a valuable area to investigate.</P>
    <P>However, even if we apply it solely to section 11, it might be wise to limit it. Otherwise, how could one consider the standardisation of the reports? As Senator McDowell pointed out, there will be a very wide range of reports. If one looks at the way they are framed, from the point of view of the terminology of people involved in osteopathy, chiropractice, physical medicine, as opposed to physiotherapy, and physical therapists, we could run into many difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is not necessary. The board would be conscious of the requirement of a proper medical report. If it receives reports from outside the State, the question of registration under the Medical Practitioners Act 1978 would not apply. It would be totally restrictive. The amendment is unnecessary and should not be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

We have established definite standards in Ireland over the years. One cannot build a hotel, for example, without certain stipulations. We passed legislation relating to opticians a couple of years ago. I am not sure what the answer is, but it appears Senator Henry's concerns should be met. Senator Leyden said that it would not be correct to accept this amendment. However, there is a concern and it should be given consideration.</P>

      <P>I am well disposed to what Senator Henry is seeking to do. Unfortunately, I do not have any legal ingenuity about how we would do it. We have consulted on it and we may consult further. From time to time it may be necessary to go outside the State to get the type of medical expertise appropriate for specialised injuries. The medics involved, therefore, would not be medical practitioners under the 1978 Act. That is the difficulty. The PIAB would refer medical reports to its own medical panel, which would consist of properly registered members under the 1978 Act. I had a discussion in advance of this with Senator Henry. I will reflect on what she said and consult further with the Attorney General to see if it is possible to do what she wants. If it is not, I assure the Senator that the PIAB will refer medical reports from non-registered practitioners to its own independent medical panel of experts. Perhaps I could reflect on how that might happen and come back to the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if it is possible, but could one state that a medical practitioner means what I have stated in my amendment under section 11 of this Bill? That would obviate the problem in section 24. It is only under section 24 that we refer people outside the State, unless we are going to start taking reports from people outside the State, which would be possible. People must have some type of qualification before they give these reports. Otherwise, it could be left incredibly wide open. I am sure there are fine people on the Limerick border giving medical treatment at present. They do not need any quali<Col N="1270" />fications. We could start a cottage industry with local specialists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in that there are few assessment reports from the type of people to whom we referred. The reason is that one might be faced with having to bring such a person to court where he or she would be given short shrift. When the threat of being exposed in open court is not there, it is perhaps more likely that people would chance their arm by putting in reports from people who do not have the qualifications we might wish.</P>

We know that traditional medics, if I can call them that, do not have high regard for the alternative way of doing business. A person would be foolish if he or she did not have someone from what I would broadly call Senator Henry's branch of the profession. I am not being funny when I say that.

      <P>I would like the Minister to reconsider this because the patient might consider that he or she had received better satisfaction from whoever he or she had gone to and that he or she was better off getting a report from that person. This is a new area. One could find that some people rapidly become professionals at giving such reports. I hope I am forgiven for saying it, but I have seen some people, who could be described as hired guns, writing reports which were considered satisfactory. I ask the Minister to look at this overnight. Once the Minister is happy, that will be fine with me.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister mean to have the damages assessed? The reason is that insurance companies regularly agree and pay damages in circumstances where they do not think they should be liable because they want to get it off their books. It is not unusual for them to pay out even in circumstances where they think they should not pay out without the consent of their insured. They might agree to run it through and if the damages are not high, they will pay it. If, on the other hand, the damages are more than a certain amount, they will take the case to court. I can envisage insurance companies doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that cases which have not been settled can be brought before the PIAB retrospectively. Quite a number of people are interested in this area because some cases which are quite clear cut, where there is no question about liability or where liability has been accepted, could be brought before the PIAB for speedy settlement on both sides. This was brought to my attention by an employer who is concerned about outstanding cases which seem to be dragging on. He is anxious to see them brought before the PIAB. I was asked whether the effect would be retrospective and if it would it apply to outstanding cases, as I hope will be the case. If both parties agree to bring a case before the PIAB this should be allowed for in the legislation. Both parties must agree in any case, but employers have said to me that they are anxious to see some cases which have been dragging on for years brought to the PIAB for settlement. The legislation should cover that, with the consent of both parties. Will it be possible to apply the legislation in this way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McDowell is correct that currently many insurers pay up small amounts because it is cheaper than going to court. A person might accept &euro;2,000 to &euro;5,000, for example, which amount would not obtain much in terms of expert advice. Under the new arrangement all the legislation, particularly the Civil Liability and Courts Bill initiated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will result in a new regime and we will see respondents contesting cases where they believe somebody is either exaggerating his or her injury or making a fraudulent claim. Cases such as these might have been let go through the system in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last 18 months I have urged the insurance companies not to take a short-term view of whether it is in their interest to settle something but to pursue those cases which they believe are exaggerated or fraudulent. We have seen a huge improvement in that far fewer per<Col N="1273" />sonal injury cases are now being taken against insurance companies than was the case 18 months or two years ago. All the evidence suggests there has been a decrease. Much of this is not to do with the legislation, which is not yet on the Statute Book, but with the culture and environment being created by advertising and so on. People are beginning to feel the pressure &ndash; they know making a claim is not a costless act.</P>
    <P>On Senator Leyden's point, it may well be that some people will slip through the net, although I do not know what point he was making about employers. However, the procedures that will be in place, the PIAB, the change in culture, the book of quantum and so on will make a huge difference. I do not expect the increase in volume suggested by some on the basis that as this is a paper-based system, it will be much easier to obtain a couple of thousand euro. I do not believe that will be the case; anyone who took that view would be very foolish indeed in view of the new regime that will be in place next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment is to provide people with an entitlement to legal representation in their dealings with the PIAB if they so choose. While the PIAB may prefer to deal directly with claimants, there will no doubt be some claimants who would like the assistance and guidance of their family solicitors, for example, in dealing with the board, provided they are prepared to pay for the legal advice personally. We should recognise that there are some cases in which people require advice and support in dealing with the board. As we all know, a great many people have difficulties in dealing with State bodies. They would like to have the possibility of representation in dealing with the PIAB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" />It is also important for the sake of balance that individuals have the right to retain advisers to help them in dealing with the PIAB. While insurance companies handling claims through the board will have access to lawyers, actuaries, medical advisers and engineers &ndash; a whole spectrum of professionals &ndash; an individual claimant is deprived of representation under the legislation and will have no such support.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent for this in another agency under the control of the Minister's Department, the Employment Appeals Tribunal, where a similar system of representation has operated successfully for a number of years. Individual claimants appearing before the tribunal are entitled to represent themselves or be represented by union or legal officials. Under the rules of the tribunal, any claimant who hires a lawyer must do so at his or her own expense. There is no evidence to suggest the entitlement for people to hire lawyers to act for them has resulted in the tribunal costing more money or operating less efficiently. If the Minister continues to insist that people are not entitled to be legally represented in their dealings with the PIAB where they are happy to pay for representation themselves, concerns may be raised that the true motivation for excluding representation is to institutionalise the inequality of the parties.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we deal on a daily basis with the queries of constituents. It is possible that if representation is not allowed, we may in some way become facilitators of representation for people who are going before the PIAB. They will come to us looking for advice in the absence of the possibility of representation. It is an important amendment and I urge the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate the Minister's response, but there is nothing in the Bill to obstruct any person appearing before the board from obtaining legal advice. Irrespective of the concerns of the Law Society, most people will seek the advice of a solicitor before going before the PIAB and nothing in this Bill will prevent them from doing that. The one difference is that the PIAB will not award costs to the applicant. The insurance companies will have legal advice all the way through. This concern has been expressed on behalf of the Law Society. To allay people's fears in this regard I will explain that the costs of the insurance companies will not be recouped by the PIAB, but neither will the costs of the person making the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing in the Bill can prevent an applicant seeking advice on completing the forms and preparing the case. There will be little difference from the current system. Most cases &ndash; 70% or more &ndash; do not appear in court at all, so most of the work is documentation prepared by solicitors on behalf of their clients. Solicitors have done great work in this regard. In most cases the 40% claim would not arise without going to court. It only occurs when barristers and so on are <Col N="1275" />involved, which is not usually the case. If the Minister feels it is appropriate to include that amendment, so be it; but nothing in the legislation could prevent the applicant from obtaining the advice of a solicitor. In most cases he or she will obtain this advice before proceeding with the case but these costs will not be recouped. The applicant will then be in a position to negotiate the fee with the solicitor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Leyden is correct that it is not possible to prevent people from seeking legal advice. Unless she has had a change of mind, the Minister appears to want to prevent people from using solicitors as agents. If a claimant wants a person to act as an agent and communicate with the board on his or her behalf, the board should at least have the courtesy to communicate with that agent. Members of the Oireachtas find themselves in an analogous position in regularly dealing with Departments of State on behalf of individual constituents. If a Deputy writes to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, he or she does not expect to receive a reply saying the Department will not deal with him or her and will only write directly to the constituent. That would be tantamount to saying it is none of the Deputy's business. If someone chooses to have an agent communicate with the board on his or her behalf, as is their right, it is only right that the board should reply to that solicitor.</P>
      <P>The principal point is that those costs are not recoverable. We accept this as do the legal representative bodies. The costs of legal representation will be covered in the award made by the assessment board, assuming it does not go any further. This is what the Bill is about, seeking to reduce costs and specifically legal costs. Where the claimant effectively accepts that he or she has to pay the solicitor, we should not only allow this but also insist that the board should deal with the solicitor if that is what the person wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has been the subject of representations received by many Members and I am seeking clarity on it. Is there any real imbalance between the claimant and the company? This legislation seems to treat the claimant and the company as the principals. However, in court cases, the <i>de facto</i> principals are often the legal teams on either side. As I understand it, the principle behind this Bill is to put the lawyers in the back seat rather than having them dominant and in the front seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Leyden said, claimants presumably can resort to legal advice at any stage of the process and if there is an oral hearing presumably they can bring a lawyer with them. Nonetheless, the dealings of the board are with the claimant rather than the lawyer. It is important that this point is cleared up. We are trying to clarify whether there is any substance to the view that <Col N="1276" />this is in some way weighted against the claimant. This is also what the Law Society is trying to establish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator John Paul Phelan and Senator Mansergh said. All Members favour the general purpose of the legislation. It is important that those most affected, the claimants, are happy that their rights are respected in every way and they have full access to the services they require to ensure their claims are fully processed. I accept what Senator Leyden said about the legislation not debarring a claimant from seeking legal advice. Obviously, they have to pay for such advice themselves.</P>
      <P>It is important that we ensure the public sees this Bill as providing a level playing pitch. While the legislation does not only deal with the speeding up of claims and hopefully reducing the cost of insurance in due course, it must not be seen to impinge on the entitlement of people to have claims processed fairly and fully. If this requires a minor change of phraseology, such as that proposed by Senator Phelan, it is something the Tánaiste should consider. It is important that the tone is properly set and that people are aware their rights are fully covered even though we are talking about a new style of assessment and basis for decisions on claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tease this out further as it is a crucial point in the Bill. It could be more efficient for a claimant to nominate his or her solicitor to take on the responsibility and deal with the book of quantums and how settlements are moving. Claimants may want someone with such <i>gravitas </i>to advise him or her. A client would know that he or she has to pay for this service. This is reasonable; if one hires an architect, one pays a fee.</P>
      <P>If a person is not in a position to make a case, will the claimant go to the Minister or other Members of the Oireachtas to complete the application? Will we become the advisers? I am sure Members have had to fill tax forms &ndash; they are dreadful.</P>

      <P>I have filled in farm tax profiles with constituents. It is difficult work and one can spend hours on it. If my constituent does not get tax clearance based on it, I will then advise him or her to visit a consultant that deals with such matters. However, some constituents may insist that I help them out again as I successfully completed the form previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Solicitors are professionally qualified and know the position. They need to quickly adapt to this issue and will advise their clients accordingly. Some people will be comfortable with submitting claims themselves. For example, one can register <Col N="1277" />land without the presence of a solicitor. There is no legal requirement to use a solicitor and one can get the forms and maps from the Land Registry and transfer the land themselves. When dealing with transfers of property, most people find it more convenient to use a solicitor. After all, solicitors do this on an ongoing basis and can do it more quickly because it is in their field of expertise.</P>

The judge told me not to be so quick to accept responsibility as he was going to put him down straight away. We settled the case.</P>
      <P>I do not have any hang up about solicitors being involved; after all, insurance companies will have legal advisers. The chairman of the insurance company will not deal with this and it will be left to the company's solicitors to deal with it. If companies will have legal representatives, why not allow claimants to have such representatives if they so wish? I am flexible on this issue. While it should not be necessary for a claimant to have a solicitor, they should be allowed to hire one. It is the Tánaiste's call and I will support whatever she decides.</P>

      <P>Insurance companies will have the best and most expensive legal advice available to them and claimants, if they so wish, should be able to use a solicitor to deal with the PIAB. That would be a fair way of doing business. There is genuine concern that such people may not get a fair opportunity. There are people who do not even like to fill out application forms and who come to public representatives to help them to do so. I can imagine how such people might feel if they had to face the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on their own and I can envisage them being reluctant to do so. They should be allowed, if they wish, to have a solicitor represent them at a hearing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support the amendment. I understand there is nothing to stop a claimant seeking legal advice. The Bill tries to avoid having another layer, with its implications for legal costs. If the outcome of the board's assessment is not satisfactory to the claimant, he or she can reject it and go back to the old way. If we set up the PIAB and then put legal representation back into the equation, we will be back to where we started. If the suggested figure of between 30% and 40% extra cost due to legal implications is <Col N="1278" />correct it does not make sense to have a PIAB and legal representation as well.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden referred to people feeling they needed personal representation. This will be a paper-based system so there will be no question of going with a solicitor to a hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. I know it will be a paper-based system. The paper would be prepared by a solicitor, who would be in direct communication with the claimant and the board. I realise there will be no personal appearance by the solicitor or the claimant but the paperwork would be dealt with by a solicitor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing to stop a claimant having a solicitor to draw up paperwork for him. However, the communication will be directly with the claimant and not with the solicitor, in order to avoid the expensive fees that have added to costs in the past.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Leyden although it is interesting that his initial remarks were almost directly contradicted by his subsequent remarks, perhaps not for the first time. I also agree with what Senator Quinn said about reducing the delays and costs associated with the existing court system.</P>
      <P>People have legal rights and we should not infringe the right to legal representation. We all understand that the new system will be paper-based but some people will have to have legal representation in dealing with the PIAB. All public representatives are familiar with people who come to us for help. I accept that the Bill does not prohibit legal advice. Legal representation will be necessary in some cases because some people will not be able to deal with the PIAB. That is the purpose of the amendment.</P>
      <P>I am glad there seems to be widespread agreement in the House regarding these amendments. I understand what the Tánaiste is trying to do and that we are trying to reduce costs. The Employment Appeals Tribunal, where this system currently exists, allows the claimant to pay costs. If such a system were adopted by the PIAB it would be a welcome development. I urge the Tánaiste to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mansergh referred to a level playing field. It is unreal to suggest that an individual, who does not have legal assistance or representation, is in the same position as an insurance company, which has a bank of professional advisers, including assessors and legal professionals, available to it in the normal course. Someone in a working class estate in Dublin, Limerick or elsewhere, who may never have gone through the process before, is not in the same position as a PLC which deals with these cases as its primary business all the time. To suggest that such a person could be in that position without the provision of some sort of independent assistance, legal or otherwise, defies belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" />We are all assuming that this will be a paper-based system but the Bill does not seem to state this. The Bill sets out procedures which must be followed but it does not specifically prohibit the board, its representatives or an assessor from dealing with an individual claimant. The Bill does not prohibit an assessor from arbitrating in some way. If, for example, a claimant suggests to the board that his injury is worth &euro;15,000, is it prohibited for the assessor to suggest, in turn, that it might be worth &euro;10,000 and for them to negotiate &euro;12,500? That sort of arbitration or negotiating process does not seem to be specifically prohibited in the Bill, and why should it be? It might be possible for the board to do its business more quickly if there were some sort of informal negotiating process.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter at this point because if the Bill leaves open the possibility of some sort of informal negotiating process, there is all the more need for some sort of assistance, legal or otherwise, to be provided for the person making the claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <P>We must be clear about what we are trying to do here. If there are legal issues in dispute, it is always important to have a lawyer. If this board was going to deal with legal issues there would have to be legal representation. However, it will not do that. There will be no oral hearings and legal issues will not be a matter for the PIAB. They are a matter for the courts.</P>
      <P>A culture has grown up in Ireland where some people, if they have an accident, are more likely to go to a lawyer than to a doctor. If Senators were making the case that the Bill should make provision for medical professionals to be made available and for people to be given money to pay for medical advice or representation, it would make more sense. If someone has a broken leg, for example, it will be the job of the PIAB to assess how much the injury is worth, based on the book of quantum. It is not the job of the board to examine legal issues. There will be no oral hearings and the rules will define the procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone wants to have legal advice, he or she will be free to do so. Section 7 makes it clear that &ldquo;Nothing in this Act is to be read as affecting the right of any person to seek legal advice.&rdquo;. If a claimant wishes copies of correspondence to be sent to his or her legal adviser, that will happen. However, we are not providing for a regime in which the PIAB will deal with lawyers and not with claimants. We are setting up this board in order to reduce the cost of delivering people's entitlements to them. Approximately 40% of the cost of personal injury claims comprises legal fees. In Ireland, barristers are involved in 70% of personal injury cases. The corresponding figure for the United Kingdom is 4%. In Ireland, it takes six times longer to get what one is entitled to than in the United Kingdom. The purpose of the PIAB is to reduce substantially the cost of delivering to a claimant what he is entitled to and <Col N="1280" />to speed up the time in which that happens. The system will be paper-based, unlike the Employment Appeals Tribunal which involves a series of oral hearings. The two situations are completely different.</P>
    <P>I hope Senator Leyden is not advising everyone in Roscommon not to pay taxes. We need a lot of money. I know he is an accountant as well as a Senator. He says that when he helps people with forms, they suddenly realise they do not need to pay any tax. If that word gets out he will find a large number of people queuing at his door. Not many people like paying tax.</P>
    <P>We do not wish the PIAB to become a quango creating an additional layer of bureaucracy which will add costs. The purpose of the Bill is to reduce costs and to speed up the process. In time, I hope the PIAB will become part of the courts infrastructure, where its more natural home will be, when it has been successfully established for a number of years.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the staff of the PIAB, around 80%, will be assessors. They will make assessments based on medical evidence using as their guide the book of quantum which the PIAB has also been charged with compiling. This will be important in ensuring consistency and uniformity.</P>
    <P>The intention is that awards will be broadly in line with those claimants would receive in court. Our aim is not to try to stop people receiving their entitlements but to give them their entitlement in a much cheaper and efficient fashion, while also removing, in as far as it is possible, lawyers from the process. The statistics make for dismal reading with 70% of cases here involving barristers as opposed to 4% in the United Kingdom. This is an indisputable fact and one of the reasons we have had to go down this route to find an alternative, cheaper way to do business.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, I was not advising any of my clients not to pay tax but pointing out that in cases in which I have advised on farm tax profiles, the people concerned have found they had no obligation to pay tax. I am sure the Tánaiste also fills out these forms. My point is that public representatives will be brought into the loop by constituents asking us to contact the PIAB and complete the forms. We are frequently asked to fill out other forms for constituents, which we are entitled to do. If constituents do not go to solicitors, they will probably approach public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To clarify, if one completes a form for a constituent, whether a tax form or another form, one fills it out in full accordance with his or her instructions and takes no responsibility for the outcome, although one hopes the person in question will receive justice and fair play and will pay no more than their obligation. Although I often advise my clients to go to an accountant, sometimes they prefer public representatives to complete the work for them, particularly if they were satisfied with the outcome in the past. This is a major responsibility and, as such, I do not want <Col N="1281" />public representatives to assume the role of solicitors with regard to the PIAB. It is inevitable, however, because we will be asked to complete and submit forms to the PIAB on behalf of constituents. I would prefer if solicitors assumed this role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We anticipated that the Tánaiste's response would be that agents, that is, solicitors, would be copied correspondence from the PIAB. It is silly and almost petty to state that while one is prepared to copy a letter, one will not acknowledge that a claimant has chosen to be represented by a solicitor by refusing to send a letter directly the solicitor. If one is prepared to accept that a solicitor is involved in the correspondence, one should be courteous and provide that the board send the correspondence directly to the solicitor.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste did not address the issue I tried to tease out with regard to the paper based nature of the process. I appreciate this is the intention and the PIAB should not entail hearings of any kind. I have not, however, seen in the Bill any prohibition on informal contacts which may amount to informal negotiations. If, for example, a claimant telephones the PIAB and asks an assessor whether, for example, an assessment has been reached, which may or may not be the case, will the assessor entertain the possibility of dealing with the individual claimant in what amounts effectively to negotiation?</P>
      <P>By ensuring the assessment is acceptable to both sides, one could expedite the whole process and achieve one's objective, namely, a quick, fair and acceptable procedure which produces a result and does not end up in court. The reason I make this point at this stage of the debate is that by allowing telephone or face-to-face contact to take place between the claimant and the assessor, one creates circumstances in which people may require advice or want to be represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste repeated her point about liability being accepted &ndash; we will come to the substantive point later &ndash; but there are many cases in which liability is not clear cut. For example, someone involved in a road accident may have contributed to the accident and may, therefore, expect the award to be reduced accordingly in court, or circumstances may arise in which a person is concerned about taking a case to court because the evidence is poor &ndash; for the sake of argument, there may be no witnesses. To put it in simple terms, there are circumstances in which one would accept a low award for a broken leg, simply because one may be concerned, either for liability reasons or due to a lack of evidence, about the prospect of going to court. If legal advice were available in such circumstances, it is likely a solicitor would advise a client to accept a low award on some occasions. The issue of liability needs to be completely cleared up, otherwise it will remain <Col N="1282" />parked, whether in full or in part, and result in a greater requirement for legal advice than would arise if it were dealt with from the start.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McDowell's comments. The Tánaiste has not properly replied to his crucial point on levelling the playing field. While we all accept the need to reduce bureaucracy and speed up the process, the great weight of professional expertise will continue to rest with the insurance companies, while the ordinary bloke in the street will try, with the help of legal advice, to represent himself. We are burying our heads in the sand if we think everybody will be in a position to take legal advice. Although this is an option for perhaps 90% of the population, there will be others for whom it is not possible. We should accept and make provision for this fact. I ask the Tánaiste to reconsider her response to the amendments.</P>

      <P>Lawyers may not always be of benefit and may be an encumbrance. There are many cases of claims of various kinds in which the legal fees take up a considerable percentage of the award. I concur with the Tánaiste's point that we need to cut down on this and disagree with the notion that the client is not equipped to manage this process or will be at a disadvantage without a solicitor. The principle of the Bill is that the claimant may have additional advantage in many cases. This needs to be borne in mind in the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mansergh has made a fair point. The purpose of the PIAB is to be a friend, rather than an enemy, of claimants and secure their entitlements quickly, efficiently and inexpensively. One pays for this process through one's premium, by putting one's job at risk or by other means. The procedures Senator McDowell described are more appropriate to the rules than the legislation. One cannot specify in legislation what procedures need to be followed.</P>
      <P>The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators is involved, with others, in drafting the procedures. There will be no question of negotiation between an assessor and a claimant or respondent. While the assessor may have contact with the claimant for the purposes of clarifying some matter to which the claimant has referred in his or her claim &ndash; this will be provided for in the rules &ndash; there is no question of entering into negotiation.</P>

      <P>The PIAB must be seen to have a fair, objective procedure. Those with good advocates should not receive more than those who do not. This would raise the possibility that those with legal representation would be able to make a better case and convince an assessor. The assessor will make the recommendation based on <Col N="1283" />the medical facts, rather than dialogue or discussion with the claimant.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (3)(<i>b</i>), line 39, after &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(other than without prejudice correspondence)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is essentially a technical amendment. The section requires that a claimant provide copies of all correspondence or that he or she can be required to provide copies of all correspondence. At present, the rules of court do not oblige claimants, plaintiffs or their solicitors to provide copies of without prejudice correspondence.</P>
      <P>It is the practice, when dealing with assessors, insurance companies or between solicitors, to provide that certain correspondence is, as it were, off the record. The courts have taken the view that this should be encouraged because it is a means of settling claims. It is a method by which some certainty can be given to negotiations while at the same time the negotiations can be conducted in a way that will not ultimately be reviewed directly by the court. The amendment provides that if an item of correspondence is expressed to be without prejudice, with a view to encouraging settlements and so forth, it should not be discoverable by the board and the claimant should not be required to provide a copy of it to the board.</P>
      <P>Have I clarified the intent of the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The section requires that copies of all correspondence between the claimant and the person or those persons with regard to the claim be provided to the board. If an effort has been made in correspondence, typically involving a solicitor at an early stage, to settle a claim or from an assessor in an insurance company, who might offer an amount of money without prejudice or without accepting the claim, the amendment provides that this correspondence should not be discoverable by the board because it would inevitably prejudice the board. Typically, without prejudice correspondence is correspondence in which an offer is made but where it is <Col N="1284" />not intended to be binding and can, effectively, be taken off the table.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Somebody who intends to make a claim generally goes to a solicitor in the first instance. If there are preliminary negotiations with an insurance company and there is correspondence which discloses an offer being made, generally from the insurance company to the claimant, under this section the correspondence would have to be submitted to the board. The normal process in a court case is that correspondence which is expressed to be without prejudice is not discovered. The intention behind that is to allow people to negotiate without prejudicing any court case that might subsequently occur or any assessment that subsequently takes place. It is essentially a device to encourage settlement. The assessment of the board would or could be prejudiced in circumstances where that correspondence had to be submitted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (3)(<i>c</i>), line 3, after &ldquo;injuries&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and whom the claimant proposes to call as a witness in the event of bringing proceedings in respect of the claim&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with medical reports. Again, I am seeking to replicate the situation that applies in court cases. Under the legislation, the board can require all medical reports or all correspondence between a claimant and his or her doctor or consultant. The amendment suggests that the claimant should only be required to produce those reports or that correspondence on which the claimant would rely if they were in court.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual to get an unsatisfactory report from a doctor. Medical practitioners do not see producing reports for lawyers or for claims as a priority. Understandably, they see their priority as patient care. Detailed reports setting out the nature or circumstances of an injury, the prognosis and so forth are sometimes not easy to get. It is not unusual for a claimant to decide not to use a certain report or to get a report from a doctor that is unsatisfactory and have to go back to the doctor to get a satisfactory one. In a sense, that is a reflection on the doctors but I understand their perspective in this regard in so far as they see these reports as something one dictates before breakfast rather than something that is accorded priority in the course of one's day when looking after patients.</P>
      <P>Only reports on which the claimant intends to rely in court should have to be disclosed to the board. Otherwise, one could end up with many inadequate reports going to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the amendment. It is inappropriate as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is not restricting parties' decisions in any subsequent litigation. It is now the exception in litigation for doctors to be called as witnesses since the content of exchange reports are usually agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is correct that reports are agreed. However, it is not unusual for a particular report to be unused. One regularly gets reports from doctors that are simply inadequate. They do not regard it as their priority, which is understandable. One, therefore, might choose not to use the report. One exchanges the reports on which settlement is based but one would not necessarily exchange every report in the document wallet.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (3)(<i>e</i>), line 3, after &ldquo;injuries&rdquo; to add the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;; provided that such report shall not be pre<Col N="1286" />pared without the informed consent of the claimant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Matters have changed slightly since the beginning of the debate when I discovered that the medical practitioner does not have to be a doctor. When I discussed this with those who were involved in drawing up the legislation I was told that this person would probably be the general practitioner. There was some trouble here and I was sorry that the Irish College of General Practitioners, the general practitioners' committee of the Irish Medical Organisation or any of the other bodies involving general practitioners had not been consulted about the legislation. They were anxious about the fact that they would have to produce these reports because there was a problem involving a conflict of interest.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medical Council guidelines warn doctors that they are not to be advocates for the patient when writing medical legal reports. However, it can be a sensitive matter if the person writing the medical legal report is the claimant's general practitioner. The GP knows the family history, everything that has happened to the claimant, how the accident has affected him or her and the person's history before the accident. There is some conflict in that regard because the general practitioner will want to do their utmost to try to help the patient recover from his or her injuries while at the same time having to judge the severity of the injuries and their impact for a medical legal report.</P>
    <P>That is the reason expert reports were frequently sought. It meant that those who were not so intimately involved with the patient could send a report to and give evidence in the court. That the general practitioner does not have to give the report means the patient can be referred to another practitioner or the patient might realise it is better to get somebody other than the general practitioner to produce the report. If someone reads in a report that the injury did very little to make the person's back worse, he or she will go back to the doctor and ask what he or she meant. General practitioners remember the fall from the bar stool in Torremolinos in 1993. It will avoid that type of awkwardness, which will be a good thing. I will pass the information on to my colleagues in the Irish College of General Practitioners and the IMO general practitioners' committee.</P>
    <P>Once one begins legal proceedings, confidentiality is waived. Does the same apply here; if one begins proceedings, is confidentiality waived? I was trying to discover the position in the United Kingdom. Under the Medical Reports Act 1988, league reports are exceptional in that no one breaks the law if he or she sends a report directly to the board. It appears from section 11 that the person is supposed to put everything together. As Senator McDowell said, some reports are sometimes considered unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I understand in the United Kingdom it is considered a good idea by the Medical Protection Society and the Medical Defence Union, includ<Col N="1287" />ing other medical protection bodies, to hand the report to the plaintiff and give him or her 21 days to look at it before handing it in. While consent is implied when people ask for reports, it is considered better practice to get informed consent. I do not know if the Minister had time to read the report, Managing and Protecting the Privacy of Personal Health Information in Irish General Practice, which has been prepared by the Irish College of General Practitioners and the National General Practice Information Technology Group, dealing with the giving out of information. With so much medical information being computerised nowadays, it is far easier to access information. They do not have to read our writing, therefore, it is much easier to get a great deal of information. Sometimes patients do not fully understand when they sign waivers or say they have given one the amount of information that may be accessed. The report states as follows:</P>
    <P>Patients and Doctors often do not foresee that information given in the context of a particular consultation might at a later date be accessed or used by others who have a different intent or &lsquo;purpose of use' for that information. Frequently patients give consent to release information concerning their health, without understanding the full implications of their decision.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that this information can be passed on to other places, therefore, it would be wise for whoever is providing the report &ndash; a medical practitioner in the accepted sense of the word under the Medical Registration Act &ndash; to get informed consent. I do not know whether it matters if others such as paramedical staff or social care staff are filling in the reports because we have no legislation in this regard. These people may not need to have concerns about either confidentiality or consent. I must frame my amendment differently, because someone who is registered under the Medical Practitioners Act would need to remember the advice given to them under the various rules of confidentiality and consent, particularly bearing in mind the effect of the Data Protection (Amendment) Act, which was brought to this House in 2002 and which makes the accessing of computerised medical information so much easier.  </P>

      <P>What we are talking about here is the medical report the claimant will submit to substantiate the claim. Clearly the claimant will ask, seek or inquire of the doctor whether he or she will give a report on their medical condition. I would have thought it a form of consent if one asks a doctor to give a medical report. The doctor <Col N="1288" />gives the report to the claimant who then makes the application to the PIAB. Obviously if one is making a claim, the respondent must be given a copy of the report. It would be unreasonable not to do so. Under current law as defined by the Supreme Court on 24 July 2003, the plaintiff who sues for damages for personal injuries, by implication, necessarily waives the right of privacy he or she would otherwise enjoy in regard to a medical condition. This is in the Michael McGrory <i>v</i>. ESB case which was adjudicated upon.</P>
      <P>I am not sure I understand the point Senator Henry is making. Is she suggesting that in some sense the patient is not aware he or she has given consent for the report? People would have to ask the doctor for the report and submit it. It is not the doctor who submits the report, but the claimant who submits it with the application.</P>

      <P>When one seeks a report, there is implied consent. However, we have been warned by the Medical Protection Society and the Medical Defence Union to get informed consent from the patient. In other words, it must be explained in one syllable. The report Managing and Protecting the Privacy of Personal Health Information in Irish General Practice states:</P>
      <P>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;it is appropriate that the medical practitioner (or some other clinical member of the practice) should be present to clarify any aspects and to permit any concerns of the patient to be discussed and resolved.</P>
      <P>One is not just supposed to give over the report. These people may have sought legal advice but they may not be sure the report they are now giving can go on and on, and that it is totally in the public domain once they have given over the report. This is why one must get informed consent.</P>

It would be totally unreasonable and very unusual if a claimant claimed he or she sustained particularly injuries and the respondent was not aware of the medical allegations being made in regard to the claimant's condition. I would not describe that as being in <Col N="1289" />the public domain because the matter will not be reported in the newspapers or anything like that.</P>

      <P>Section 13(1) says that as soon as practicable after receipt of the application the board serves a notice on the respondent. We want to put in a time limit of 14 days. As the Tánaiste rightly points out, the whole purpose of the Bill is to speed up the process of dealing with claims. It should be possible to put in time limits at the start of the process, with which there would no difficulty in dealing.

      <P>I do not think it is reasonable to stipulate a time like 14 days. &ldquo;As soon as practicable&rdquo; is used in most Bills, and in fairness to the workings of the board it would have to ensure a quick response. This would have the effect of <Col N="1290" />tying the board down. Someone might object if they do not get a reply within 14 days and this could create difficulties.

      <P>Concerns have been expressed by the legal profession that in principle these proposals are totally open-ended as to the speed with which cases are dealt with. I accept that in practice the board will deal with matters speedily, but will the Tánaiste say what obligations exist other than &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;? Is she satisfied that is sufficient obligation to ensure expeditious dealing with claims or whether something specific should be put in place, as Senator McDowell has proposed, or some alternative to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the current regime it takes a great deal of time for one to get one's entitlement and six times longer than in the UK. The whole purpose of the Bill is to expedite the delivery times so people can receive their entitlements much more quickly. There are specific time limits in the Bill. We are talking about a period of 15 months from the time the claim is made. The claimant has a year in which to make the claim. We are reducing the Statute of Limitations to a year. We have to be practical, however, as regards what we do. When a claim is made, in the first instance, the PIAB will have to identify the parties. It might not be clear as to who is the respondent. For this reason, to set a limit of 14 days is unreasonable. We do not want to tie the board's hands behind its back. As with the next amendment, many of the issues raised can be dealt with in the rules and procedures. To prescribe them by statute is unreasonable. If the PIAB gets a claim from an individual it then has to satisfy itself as to the claimant's identity, check the social security number with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and find out who is the respondent. I believe 14 days is too short and therefore the words &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; after receipt of the application is fair. There are strict limits, in any event, both on the time the PIAB has to make up its mind and that taken by the respondent and indeed the claimant to reply to an assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to insert a time limit at the start of the process so that when the claim is initiated the respondent has to be told within 14 days. While I accept it might be difficult further down the line to constrain how the board deals with cases as regards time limits, depending on how things develop, it does not seem unreasonable to put it right at the start of the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste said something interesting in response when she indicated it might be necessary to determine who is the respondent. Will she elaborate on that? Does she anticipate the board will have a role in helping to determine who the respondent should be? Or will there just be a <Col N="1291" />form indicating that it is unclear who the respondent is and therefore the board cannot deal with the case? She seems to be suggesting the board would aid the process in some way by determining, for example, that a particular insurance company might be involved or the identity of the respondent and by making preliminary investigations into the claimant's identity through checking social security numbers and so on. Does she see that as standard preliminary procedure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator is referring to the legal issue as to who is responsible for a particular case I am not getting involved in that. The entire working of the PIAB is based on simplicity of approach. Form filling will be simple and clear. The PIAB will itself be involved in educating the public and disseminating information as to procedure. It is about doing things in a consumer friendly way. I do not anticipate there will be complicated documents or that the application form will be complex. If a claim is made by an individual the social insurance number and identity of the claimant must be confirmed. The claimant may not be sure who is the insurer. Fourteen days is a short period and could be unreasonable if, for example, it coincided with a holiday period. What we want is something workable and practical, speedy but done in accordance with the board's rules rather than written into the statute.</P>
      <P>There are significant references to time limits later in the Bill. These are time limits for the respondent to respond to the assessment and for the claimant to respond, within which the claim must be made and on the PIAB as well as extensions in certain circumstances. There are many time-related limits in the Bill for good reasons, not just for efficiency, but as regards the claimant's rights under the Constitution. One has to ensure the claimant is not denied the right to proceed to litigation perhaps at a subsequent stage if he or she is not particularly happy with the PIAB's assessment. Such a process should not be unduly delayed. That is why there are the type of time limits as proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>It is not. I accept the principle that it is something that could and should be dealt with in the rules. It would not be the first time <Col N="1292" />we set up a process that was intended to be simple and fast. I have in mind the process to the Ombudsman's office, which is intended to be simple and fast. The reality is that it takes a long time in many cases, far longer than originally intended, simply because of the volume of work. It proved to be a successful and popular process which attracted far more cases and claims to be decided on than had been envisaged, or for which there were not the resources with to deal with. It is not difficult to envisage, given the volume of cases we currently have to deal with &ndash; the Tánaiste mentioned 27,000 as a likely annual figure &ndash; that time limits will slip quickly. That being so, we should include, if not in primary legislation, an obligation in the rules that at least simple things such as the initial notification should be dealt with in a relatively short period.</P>

      <P>It is of a similar kind. It does have somewhat more implications. It requires the respondent to respond within 21 days when he or she receives the initial notice from the board. This relates to another issue, which will be dealt with shortly in greater length, that is what the response of the respondent amounts to.</P>
      <P>My contention, which is shared by the Fine Gael Members, is that the response of the respondent should amount to an acceptance of liability. Where it allows a case to go before the board it should be required to accept liability. It is in that context that we propose imposing a time limit. I assume the Minister will say much the same as she said to my last response so perhaps we should keep that argument for the substantive issue in a couple of minutes.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), line 39, after &ldquo;states&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in open correspondence to the claimant that the respondent accepts liability for the claim and states&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest fault in the Bill as it stands is that it does not deal with the issue of liability, as the Minister has suggested this afternoon. It is in effect parked or set aside. Either party can revive it at the end of the process so that if one party dislikes an assessment, if it is too high for an insurance company or too low for a claimant, that party can go to court, not just to assess the <Col N="1293" />value of the claim but to look at the whole claim anew, including the issue of who is at fault.</P>
    <P>Two issues at least arise. First, if the assessment process takes 15 months as envisaged here, it is possible that the claimant or the plaintiff in court will be seriously prejudiced by then having to go back and look at the issue of liability. If people take the spirit of the Bill and the process seriously, regarding this as a lawyer-free zone where legal advice is not required and as a simple up-front process by which they can go to the board to have injuries or loss of earnings assessed, it is possible that they will think the issue of liability is accepted and covered. Unless they go to a lawyer they are likely to think that because that is how the Minister and others are selling it publicly.</P>
    <P>The claimant may behave in a fashion that will not help him or her if he or she ends up in court in a year's time. For example, he or she might not accumulate witness evidence in the way that he or she might otherwise do. If one knows that something is likely to end up in court or if one wants to allow for the possibility that it will, one ensures that one knows the witnesses and where they live, and gets their statements in so far as possible at an early stage while they recall what happened. One asks an engineer to look at the scene of an accident and document it. In other words, one accumulates evidence with a view to maybe establishing one's case. It is part of one's armoury when in court. If this Bill requires that process to be delayed for up to 15 months, and if a claimant has to start again perhaps 18 months or more after an accident occurred, he or she could, and very likely will, be seriously prejudiced. It is also quite likely that he or she may have been, through ignorance or through malign influences, misled into thinking an issue which he or she thought had been dealt with, namely liability, was not in fact despatched.</P>
    <P>Conceivably, insurance companies will play the system. They may not do so in every case but they may do so with relatively small cases such as those worth &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 which they will put through the system, knowing that delay is likely to help them rather than the claimant, with the intention all along of going through the court system at the end, or if the assessment is not to their liking. The assessment will to some extent at least flush out the claim and the claimant, and the sort of evidence likely to be available to them. The Minister will no doubt say that is not admissible in court and of course it is not. In theory nothing that happens during the assessment process is admissible in court. The very fact of a delay and of the insurance company knowing in advance how much it is going to cost does inevitably prejudice it and gives it more bullets in its locker than is fair if the company has not been obliged to accept liability in the first place.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this problem so that if people are encouraged to go down this route, as they should be, they should do so in the knowledge that fault has been dealt with and can<Col N="1294" />not be revised at the other end. In that way if an assessment is not acceptable it can go to the court only on the issue of quantum and not to revive an issue which the claimant thought was dealt with in the first place.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator McDowell and the Labour Party amendment. It goes to the nub of the Bill and I urge the Minister to look at it. There is a great case to be made for accepting and dealing with the issue of liability at the start of the process rather than leaving it there as a last chance saloon for the insurance industry if it seeks to reject the ruling of the board. It goes to the heart of the Bill and will change it. However, in order to make it more effective and to deal with the problem that the establishment of the PIAB aims to resolve the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly cannot accept this and if I do the PIAB will be killed before it starts and everyone knows what will be the effect of that. There are times when the respondent may have full indemnity, for example if an employee falls off a chair at work, the respondent may decide to pay the compensation and then to sue the chair manufacturer. We cannot have a situation whereby in order to use the PIAB one has to put one's hands up and admit liability and pay all. There may be others involved.</P>
      <P>Both Senators know that the result of not parking liability or of the respondents admitting liability would be that this board would never happen. The respondents will be paying for this service. The insurance companies will effectively pay for the PIAB. The idea that they would run things through it, pay the associated costs and then go to court is unacceptable. The argument has no credibility. Obviously, we cannot say there is no evidence for it as it has not started yet but I would be amazed if somebody who will pay the bill at the end of the day would decide to take this route and then at the eleventh hour as it were, decide to pursue the matter through the legal process.</P>

      <P>Currently it takes a couple of years for a claimant to get a case into court. Only about 10% of cases end up in court, 90% are settled either in advance of the hearing or at the door of the court. Even under the current system very few cases go to court. My Department has received strong legal advice from the Attorney <Col N="1295" />General on this legislation. The kind of safeguards that we would all want to see for claimants in our society are not in any way undermined by the establishment of the PIAB. On the contrary, claimants will receive their entitlements more quickly than is the case under the current regime. Some of the amendments being suggested do not apply at all under the current regime, which is a very slow cumbersome procedure from the time one makes a claim to the day one is heard in court if one is not satisfied with what may or may not be offered. It takes many years. Under no circumstances will this board add to that time. With the PIAB in place there will be fewer cases in the courts and because of the mediation system which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is bringing in through his legislation, and other changes even with PIAB, people will be able to get into court much more quickly than they can under the current regime.</P>

      <P>I gather the Tánaiste is contemplating a change of job sooner than I am. As a solicitor I would not like to be in a position where someone approached me 15 or 18 months after going through the lawyer-less process of the PIAB and informed me of an accident 18 months or two years previously which he or she thought was dealt with through an acceptable settlement, but then found that the insurance company would not pay up. One would then have to reconstruct a case from the start, from perhaps 18 months or two years previously. That is a genuine difficulty, something that does not currently arise.</P>
      <P>I accept all the Tánaiste says about delays in the current process, but one thing that is done quite promptly is that the initial evidence is charted and the statements are taken in at the start of the process. The way in which the PIAB is being promoted will certainly induce some claimants to avoid going through that initial process because they will think that a case pursued through the PIAB is quick and easy, with liability sorted, and with no need to go through the business of witnesses being contacted for statements and so on. One will end up having to reconstruct cases 18 months or two years down the road, and that is not fair.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael has a problem with this section. As Senator McDowell pointed out, many people have a problem with section 16. Concerns have been expressed in this House during the Second Stage debate on the PIAB that there is a risk of adding to the bureaucracy and the costs if the matter is not dealt with correctly. There is a fundamental flaw in the PIAB which has not been addressed to date. Under the Bill as proposed, the claimant is obliged to take a case before the PIAB if the insurer so directs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance company ultimately decides whether the case goes before the PIAB. However, as I understand the legislation, if an insurance company is not happy with what emerges from the PIAB, it can reject the assessment and proceed to deny the liability in subsequent court proceedings. We have discussed this issue while considering the amendments tabled by Senator McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, this gives the insurance company two bites at the cherry. The company can compel the claimant to go before the PIAB but can reject the PIAB assessment if it does not like <Col N="1297" />it, and put the claimant through a fully defended set of legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case to be made for obliging the insurer to accept liability if it directs a case to go before the PIAB. There must be a potential penalty for an insurer with regard to the PIAB ruling. Otherwise, there will be a serious risk that insurers will cherry-pick the forum and effectively force claimants to go before the PIAB and subsequently before the court. I know the Tánaiste does not envisage that happening but it could well happen in a number of cases, if not in the majority thereof.</P>
    <P>If the PIAB is to reduce costs and streamline procedures for the delivery of compensation, then parties appearing before it must see an incentive for dealing with the body and accepting its recommendations. If an insurer agrees to send a case to the PIAB, that amounts to an admission of liability by the insurer. Accordingly, if parties are unable to accept the assessment produced by the PIAB, the matter should then go to a court hearing, but only to discuss the extent of damages, not the question of liability. That is the nub of amendment No. 12. If the Tánaiste does not agree to delete section 16, this amendment provides for the provisions of section 16 coming under the new section 32(4), on which I will speak later.</P>
    <P>We are all in broad agreement as to the thrust of the PIAB and what it is trying to bring about, but there is an element of the insurer having it both ways that we must try to counteract. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that if a case comes before the PIAB, the issue of liability will not be discussed in any subsequent hearings and that those hearings would deal only with the issue of the amount of damages to be awarded.</P>

      <P>There is a misunderstanding here. It is not the insurance companies, but the law in the first instance, which will compel claimants to go to the PIAB. Both parties will be free to reject the PIAB settlement. I do not understand the point being made by Senator Phelan. Is he suggesting that it should be mandatory for someone to accept the PIAB assessment?</P>

      <P>The point goes back to liability. The insurance company must accept that if a case is brought before the PIAB, liability will be dealt with at that stage, and not parked and possibly brought up again in any subsequent court case. I understand what the Tánaiste said. Perhaps I did not make my point very well; she will have to forgive me. My colleague, Senator Coghlan, was to deal the issue but had to withdraw this morning. The Tánaiste was not the only one in doubt about attending this House. I too was in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance companies appear to have the option of an each way bet. We have already discussed at length the weight of professional help that lies with the insurers rather than the claimant. That brings us back to the point raised by Senator McDowell regarding liability, and <Col N="1298" />whether it is parked or dealt with at the outset of the process. That is the issue.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Tánaiste's reply to a previous amendment, it is clear that this amendment would in effect emasculate the process. Explicit admission of liability obviously forecloses options. If an issue is not contested, one could argue that that is a <i>de facto</i> admission of liability, but effectively this is allowing people to play out a scenario on the assumption that for example, liability is accepted, with supposedly unclear results, and both sides then free to accept or reject the result. To go the route the Opposition wants would remove the flexibility and pragmatism and, as a result, effectively stymie the entire operation of the PIAB.</P>

      <P>In the first instance, we would need a plethora of lawyers and all the other individuals necessary to deal with liability issues, which are a matter for the courts. The legal issues are not a matter for the PIAB. It is being set up to assess what people are entitled to and ensure it is paid to them as quickly as possible. That is its whole function and purpose. The issue of liability does not arise in many cases.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan apologised privately to me for being unable to attend as he had an engagement in Northern Ireland. It is unusual for either House to meet on a Monday and I understand he could not be here. I am not in a position to accept his amendment.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 deals with those circumstances where the board has discretion not to deal with a particular type of case and sets out four or five such circumstances. This amendment, in my name and that of the Labour Party Senators, removes discretion from the board. It is self-evident that the board should not deal with cases of the kind set out in this section. Our amendment proposes that the words &ldquo;be required to&rdquo; be deleted. That, in effect, would make it mandatory for the board to decline to deal with cases where, for example, <Col N="1299" />the issues are particularly complex, there is an insufficient body of case law available to provide guidance or the book of quantum is inadequate to deal with them. Rather than giving the board discretion to decline cases, we suggest the Bill should require it to decline to deal with cases of the kind set out in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to give discretion to the board. What may be declined in the first few months of the existence of the board may be something the board is capable of handling in time. We are talking about unusual cases where perhaps the medical evidence is uncertain. The Senator said that there is not much case history available. That will change over time. What may be unsuitable for the board in its infancy, either because the law in the area is not well developed or medical evidence is not clear &ndash; matters which are more appropriately dealt with in a court scenario &ndash; could change over the first couple of years of the board's existence. There is rapid change in this area. The most effective way to facilitate the changes that happen in this area is to give the discretion to the board. That is fair and reasonable. The board will not take on work it cannot deal with fairly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go to war on this but there is an issue. The draftspersons obviously think there are certain types of cases with which the board should not deal. There is no oversight of the issue and if the board makes a decision, that is the end of the matter. The board can then deal with a case with which the Tánaiste and those who drafted the Bill think it should not, such as a case dealing with psychological damage. Nothing prevents the board from doing that if it so decides, although it may decline. I assume the purpose in framing the section in this way was to take such cases out of the ambit of the board. If that was the intention, the Tánaiste should go the whole hog and remove the discretion from the board's ambit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>

The small fees paid by claimants will be returned when they are successful and the only fees that will be held will be those where the claimant does not get an award. The insurance companies will pay the &euro;8 million.</P>
      <P>I must discuss the detail of the operation because until now I have been concentrating on getting the legislation right. It will not be on the basis of the award, however, it will be on the basis of the cost to the insurance company. If something is simple and can be assessed quickly, even if there are large damages, it would be unfair to level the same costs as on a more complicated case that requires more work or the recruitment of outside expertise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear any speaking note the Tánaiste has on the specific duty of care the board has towards vulnerable people. It appears to provide for legal advice in certain cases and I would like to hear the circumstances and how such advice will be delivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it appears to the board during the process that a claimant or respondent is not fully aware of the legal consequences of any action or inaction by him or her under the Act, it shall be the duty of the board to do one or more of the following: To advise the claimant or the respondent, as appropriate, of the desirability of taking legal advice regarding the process; to advise the claimant or respondent, as appropriate, of the legal consequences of an action or an inaction during the PIAB process; and to provide such reasonable assistance to the claimant or respondent, as appropriate, to enable them to carry out the necessary steps. Section 29(3) provides that the board shall inform the respondent or claimants, as appropriate, of the fact that any actions set out by the board have been carried out. This places a legal requirement on the board to satisfy itself that vulnerable persons are fully protected. We deal with minors in another area, as the Senator knows, but this deals specifically with other categories of citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste's comments are interesting because the section deals with vulnerable people but people who are not obviously vulnerable might make a mistake during the process. Even the relatively simple business of filling out forms can become confused and people might not realise if they get two medical reports that the second one has to be passed on because they do not appreciate its importance. They could end up with an incorrect assessment because they have not given the best possible evidence to the board.</P>
      <P>The section envisages that if the assessor realises this is happening, he will contact the claimant and tell him or her to submit the best possible evidence. In normal cases involving a claimant who is not transparently vulnerable, there should a reminder process that need not deal with legal advice where an assessor will tell that person that he has not submitted the best possible evidence or medical reports and that it is in his interest to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This goes back to the question of legal advice. Most people making an application to the PIAB will get legal advice when completing application forms. It is clearly indicated that there will be some cases where people will be advised to get advice. It is self-explanatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comes back to the question of the role of solicitors in the PIAB. I would advise people to seek advice before going before the PIAB to ensure the claim is in order and they do not disad<Col N="1304" />vantage themselves by submitting a claim that is not fully comprehensive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This deals with the duty of care to vulnerable people and the Senator is satisfied with that. It puts an onus on the board. The board will operate an information help line and if the claimant makes an inadequate claim, there will be a requirement on the board to get all the information. This will operate as an inquisitorial regime where the assessor will have to find out the nature of the injuries, what exactly happened, the extent of injuries and if they need to be assessed by the medical referees. I do not know how many cases will see all evidence of injury being referred to the medical referees, that is a matter for the assessor, but if the board does not do things fairly and appropriately, and does not establish credibility, it will always be open to legal challenges. I do not think the Senator needs to worry about the board's or the organisation's determination to get it right and to make sure that where there are deficiencies they are put right, leaving no gaps in the information the assessor needs before he or she makes a determination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While the note in the margin of the section refers to &ldquo;vulnerable parties&rdquo;, the section itself does not specify &ldquo;vulnerable persons&rdquo; at all, unless I have missed it. It simply refers to a situation where the board considers it to be a reasonable inference from the manner in which a case is being pursued that it is not being done properly, which could apply to not just vulnerable parties, even though one would have thought vulnerable parties would be a small minority. If the board forms the view that somebody is not progressing their own claim properly, do they have an obligation to contact that claimant and tell them they are not doing it properly and that they need to get their act together?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not actually say &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo;. It is possible that it would be incomplete. It is possible that somebody may have an initial medical report but does not go back for a subsequent report and should do so. If they were receiving advice from anybody, they would be advised to go back and get a second medical report. They may go to a doctor three or four weeks after an accident. They may get a particular prognosis that could change. They should go back to the doctor six months later and provide the board or the assessor with a subsequent medical report. This section seems to envisage that an assessor, who would very likely see that this is the case, should contact the claimant and tell them they are not doing themselves any favours and that they need to know the up to date position. Does the Minister foresee that happening?</P>

      <P>If one takes the example of employer liability insurance, the first cases to be dealt with will be the ones affecting employees. Many of them will be members of trade unions and I have no doubt there will be advice available to them from many quarters. I do not envisage them acting as solo players. Where there are deficiencies and the assessor is not in a position to stand over it and make a clear determination, the onus will be on them to get all the information they require from the claimant, including medical evidence. I am not certain that there will be many cases where the initial medical advice following the first couple of weeks of the injury will be the final advice on which the assessor will base his or her assessment. It may well be that there will be subsequent advice. That is why the time lag is 15 months rather than the very short period of three, as one has got to see what medical advice becomes available some time after the accident and not just in the immediate aftermath. The recovery and the prognosis for the individual's future are relevant matters. Clearly, it will not be decided on the basis of one letter from one doctor. In many cases there will be much medical advice, no doubt, accompanying applications at different stages in the process.</P>

We are simply saying that any such notice should contain the quantum of any assessment and should not give any opinion beyond that or any details that might be used or relied on in any subsequent court case, if one was taken. In other words, an assessment should be a straightforward number without the benefit of further opinion which might prejudice a court case.</P>

      <P>The Senator is suggesting that the board should just give the assessment. It is important the board gives the basis on which they made the assessment. In fact, that was one of the things asked for most frequently by many of the groups that came to see me in respect of this legislation. A note prepared for me on the basis of legal advice says the PIAB needs to explain the basis of the assessment to all the parties in line with their procedures, including details of what the assessment is comprised of and how it was arrived at. It would be very unreasonable to just get a letter from the PIAB, either from the respondent's perspective or from that of the claimant, saying they are being assessed and they should just get X amount without being given some idea of how that amount was arrived at. I do not see how that could prejudice any court hearing in any way. Why would it? In any event, I would have thought it would be desirable in any potential court hearings that the assessment of the PIAB and the basis on which it reached that assessment was available.</P>

      <P>This is essentially a technical amendment. Subsection (2) refers to any enactment or rule of court which requires a settlement to be ruled. I am advised by the party's legal people that this is most likely to arise in the case of a lodgement being made and that the court rules to deal with lodgements. That is what we should cover in this section. The whole regime of lodgements, as the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment knows, is basically that if a certain amount is lodged in court, the plaintiff can only recover costs if the lodgement is beaten and the court subsequently awards more than the lodgement that is being made in court by the insurance company. I am told the rules referred to in this subsection should be the rules that relate to lodgements.</P>

      <P>Again, this concerns a technical issue. Cases where an assessment arising out of a recommendation of the board in an infant case would still have to be ruled on by the courts so the judge could assess whether it was adequate. We are saying that in circumstances where the judge decides it is not adequate the effect, for the purposes of any subsequent court case, should be as if that had been made as a result of court proceedings and not as a result of the board's proceedings, because currently as the Bill is drafted the ruling of the court arising out of an assessment of the board would not stand for the purpose of further court hearings, and I am advised that it should do.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4) Where a claimant or his or her solicitor disputes the amount of fees and expenses specified in a statement under this section, that amount may be the subject of review by the person or authority which would have jurisdiction to review the fees and expenses had they been incurred in proceedings to recover damages amounting to the value of the assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment allows me to tease out the issue of costs which the Minister envisages will be recoverable under the section. Section 44 deals with expenses incurred by the claimant in preparing the claim and it envisages that costs will be awarded. My amendment specifically seeks to create a review mechanism where that is not agreed. I am more interested in the Minister's view about what expenses will be allowed in the first instance. Does she envisage, for example, that legal expenses incurred before the claim was submitted will be allowable? If someone gets the assistance of a union representative or agent of any kind in preparing a claim or the additional letter of claim, will that be allowable? What expenses does the board have discretion to award to a claimant?</P>

      <P>I accept the general principle, but we can take the principle of lawyer bashing too far. It is still likely that one of the first ports of call by someone involved in an accident will be the legal profession for legal advice. To say we should not pay this as a matter of principle because it is going down the slippery slope of making it a court related or legal process rather than a claim or an insurance based process is going too far. However, I sense I will not get any joy from the Tánaiste on that matter.</P>

      <P>When a person is injured at work, he or she does not appreciate that liability is an issue in many cases. Many people do not realise that we have a fault based system which requires a person to establish that the employer or someone driving a car is at fault before he or she can recover money for injuries sustained. Many people do not know such basic facts which we take for granted. To say, as the Minister has said in such a dismissive fashion, that a medical report or advice is the only thing that matters is ignoring a serious level of ignorance among the public about their rights in certain circumstances and about the nature of our compensation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a growing belief that if a person is injured, he or she is entitled to compensation. However, that is not the case. A person must establish that someone is at fault. If people are under the impression, as many are, that they can recover in all circumstances, they may not take certain basic steps, which they should take, such as gathering evidence or getting witness statements at the start of the assessment board process. They should be told by someone that the <Col N="1311" />matter may end up in court and that they should get an engineer, for example, to look at the equipment in work which injured them before it suddenly disappears. That would be basic advice to give to someone who was injured as part of an accident at work. People should be told to take a photograph of the machine and to get an engineer to look at it. A doctor will not tell a person such things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only part of the jigsaw to solve insurance problems; it is not the full picture. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will introduce the Civil Liability and Courts Bill which will include a requirement on claimants to set out the basis for their case. The purpose of establishing the PIAB is to provide a consumer friendly mechanism for delivering compensation. This is not an anti-consumer organisation; it will be a consumer friendly organisation which will help claimants and be involved with them. We want to create a culture where the first port of call for a person who has received a personal injury will be the PIAB, not the courts. I envisage the PIAB as the place where 95% of personal injury claims will be resolved. I hope its credibility will be such that few people will feel the necessity to take the court route. Its credibility, success and future depends on establishing itself as a consumer friendly organisation, which I do not have any doubt it will be, driven by a dynamic board. I am conscious that there are people in the environs of the House in the Law Society of Ireland and the PIAB.</P>
      <P>We have developed a system and a culture in relation to insurance which is unsustainable. That is the only reason we are going down this road. I remember when former Deputy Des O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce, people discussed the notion of putting something similar in place. However, for one reason or another, it did not happen. If we had not arrived at this crisis, we would probably not be doing it now either. I do not want people to think that this is about taking from genuine claimants and those who merit appropriate levels of compensation. This is about helping them. If most normal people, particularly those I know, were given a choice, they would not go down an adversarial court route. They would prefer this type of mechanism to give them that to which they are entitled. When we put together informal non-adversarial ways of settling disputes between parties, whether through the Labour Court or the LRC, they work extremely well. This will also work well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a legislator with legal expertise, Senator McDowell is right to question the premise of the legislation. However, there is an underlying view among those with a legal background that this will collapse in the first month and that it will not get off the ground because it is unfair and no one will want it. At the end of the day, the consumer will decide whether it works. If it does not pro<Col N="1312" />vide satisfaction for claimants, it will not be a success and will not last. It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>Somebody in the House asked on Second Stage whether there would be a review after five years. We will not need one because if the board is not successful, it will not be able to sustain itself financially. There is a huge onus on the PIAB to establish itself as a consumer friendly organisation with fair procedures that can not only stand the test of time, but stand the test put to it by any court proceedings. I have no doubt that early on in the life of the organisation somebody will take a judicial review of some of the assessments. The board will operate on the basis that everything must be totally above board &ndash; i's must be dotted and t's crossed. It will not try under cover of night to sneak a small award into one's bank account which is much less than that to which one is entitled because that clearly will not be acceptable.</P>

There is a need for a simpler, quicker process. Many of the criticisms the Tánaiste has levelled at the current system are entirely justified and fair. I am only seeking to ensure one thing. There will still be many people who do not understand the quicker system and will need some assistance to get through it. It is not unreasonable for them to rely on lawyers and others for that assistance.</P>

      <P>In page 29, subsection (2), line 23, to delete &ldquo;9&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;6&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I was interested in what the Tánaiste said about the last amendment. She expressed her desire that at some stage up to 95% of claims could end up being dealt with through the board, which would be a marvellous achievement for the Tánaiste. If we are to move in that direction we must ensure that the target dates are such that they will provide an incentive to claimants and insurers to use this facility. I concede that a target date of nine months is reasonable, but as we set out on this new road we must try to be more daring.</P>
      <P>A six month timeframe would be advantageous from two points of view. It would clearly show insurers and claimants that we are serious about making this board work effectively, efficiently and transparently and making it the normal route for the majority of claims. It would also put an onus on the Department and on the State to ensure the board has the resources and staff to make the system work. All our targets and aspirations will come to naught unless this happens. The board will need significant resources to ensure its work is done properly. If we provide for a six month timeframe, it puts pressure on everybody to deliver. As we develop this new approach, we should set the bar high. A six month timeframe would be a positive step in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense I will speak against my own amendment, which seeks to shorten the time within which the board must deal with an assessment. Nine months would be perfectly adequate for this, but I have a difficulty with one aspect, which is why I tabled my amendment. As matters stand, section 49 provides that if something is not dealt with within 15 months, having been prolonged in the first instance by six months, it is open to the board or the assessor to go back to the claimant and ask him or her to consent to prolonging the time further. It is not difficult to imagine this happening frequently. If we were being pessimistic we would say that in three to six years, if the board is as successful as we would like it to be, it will be regular and commonplace for the assessors to ask claimants to prolong the time.</P>
      <P>I would be happy to allow the nine month timeframe to stand, provided it is an absolute deadline or the circumstances in which consent would be sought for prolonging the time were seriously limited, so that it would not become routine for the board to prolong cases beyond the nine month or 15 month period. As matters stand, where the Bill states nine months or 15 months, it is in fact open-ended. There is no limit provided the claimant consents. There should be a limit within which the board will be absolutely required, unless there are exceptional circumstances, to make a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the heads of the Bill were published we did not have such deadlines. These time limits are the duty of the board; they have been written into the legislation. It is the intention of the board to deal with things more quickly, but sometimes it could be unfair to a claimant to deal with a case quickly because the medical evidence could be evolving. It is often six or nine months after an injury, sometimes longer, before the evidence is available. That is why there is a provision that where the board feels it cannot make an assessment within a reasonable timeframe, it will issue an authorisation to the person to go through the courts.</P>
      <P>The timeframes set out here are reasonable in all circumstances, as Senator McDowell acknowledges. The intention is to deal with things even more speedily, which will be possible in the simpler cases. In many other cases, however, the proceedings will take this long. Telling the claimant that the board cannot make the assessment in this period and giving him or her a date by which it might be able to do so will be the exception rather than the rule.</P>

At the Freedom of Information Commission, for example, the time limits are meaningless because the consent of the person seeking the information is forever sought to prolong the time. The claimant in that case knows well that if he or she does not consent, the request will be refused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>Many concerns were expressed to me by those in Senator McDowell's profession about the time limits for making a claim, the point being that in certain instances people hope an injury will get better but it does not &ndash; or it gets worse &ndash; and sometimes assessing the scope of an injury within a relatively short period is difficult. Further, in other types of legal suits, companies have much longer periods in which to make claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the heads of the Bill that were published did not have these specific timeframes. We have moved in this direction after receiving legal advice from the Attorney General to ensure we do not unnecessarily delay some<Col N="1315" />body's constitutional right to take a case before the courts. I am advised that in many cases the longer the gap between the accident or injury and the litigation, the more unfavourable it is to the respondent rather than the claimant. One can argue either way about this point.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that we have a framework that works and is practical. As the Senator and others have acknowledged, the medical evidence does not always become immediately clear. We are talking about mandating an organisation where the practice will be to deal with cases quickly. The PIAB intends to operate differently from almost any other State organisation. It will operate six days a week and will have much longer hours of work than is the norm to service the needs of those who use it. It will offer information, layperson guides and helplines. If one is a genuine claimant, the board is there to help, not to try to stop one from getting one's entitlements.</P>
      <P>Based on the advice I have received, the timeframes are appropriate. It may be unfair on the claimant to assess what he or she is entitled to within the first month or two. Whatever the injury, it may be that one has not recovered as anticipated and the initial prognosis may have been mild or it may be discovered later that the injury is more serious than first realised. For those reasons, the nine month timeframe, extending to 15 months, is appropriate.</P>
      <P>I understand the points the Senator raised about the legal profession. Under the current regime it can take forever for one to receive one's entitlements. With the PIAB, claimants will get their money more quickly in the vast number of cases. I envisage only a small number of cases going to the courts. The organisation will not be able to sustain itself if it does not have that level of credibility among claimants.</P>

      <P>If someone has a personal injury they must make an application to the PIAB within 12 months. The Statute of Limitations for personal injury cases is being reduced from three years to one year both in this Bill and in the legislation the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is introducing. The PIAB has a certain timeframe to make an assessment and the indi<Col N="1316" />vidual can accept or reject it. If one has not made the application within the timeframe, one cannot do so. The other issue which arises is that of reopening the case. This cannot be done with the PIAB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not know the answer, I presume one's court entitlements are not affected. I will have to take advice on this point. When the PIAB issues its determinations and the claimant accepts it, it is closed. If something unknown were to arise later, I do not think it could be reopened. I will seek legal advice on what court rights claimants will have in such circumstances. I will examine whether claimants have forfeited all their court rights as a result of accepting an assessment from the PIAB.</P>
      <P>We earlier dealt with the issue of the PIAB sending cases to court or giving one an authorisation to do so as it cannot deal with the case. However, I do not think this is the type of case Senator Mansergh is talking about. If the PIAB realises it is not a case it can deal with, perhaps for reasons of the medical consequences, the board will send the case to the courts. The Senator is talking about a different type of case. I do not know what currently happens&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the ironic benefits of the current system is that because it takes so long to get the case to court, it is unlikely anything will happen subsequently that will require a reapplication to court. However, I do not think this was intended. If the speed with which the PIAB deals with cases is such that some effects of the injury have not become apparent, the case Senator Mansergh makes is not unimportant.</P>

      <P>I invite the Minister to make some comments on the preparation of the book of quantum. This is the only reference in the Bill to the book of quantum and it does not spell out in any great detail what it does. It only states that it will contain general guidelines as to the amount that may be awarded. The impression is some<Col N="1318" />times created that these are relatively simple things and in certain cases that is the position. Particular types of disabling injuries can matter more to some people than to others. For example, if my right hand were disabled I would have a serious problem because I can do very little with my left hand. Others may have a different view or be more ambidextrous. A particular injury could be much more serious for a person who does one job rather than another. Someone who requires to be dextrous and active and does physical work may be substantially more disadvantaged by a particular injury than someone who has a desk job. Does the Tánaiste foresee that the book of quantum will deal with issues of that sort?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The book of quantum is a guide, it is not a bible. The impact of an injury on someone's capacity to carry out his professional work would have to be borne in mind. I understand that much information has been made available by the courts service. Tenders will shortly issue for someone to compile the book of quantum and IT systems and so on are being developed for that. The book of quantum will simply be a guide. One must take into account the different circumstances in different cases, as would a court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Among the public who have heard about the Tánaiste's proposals in this regard, a view is setting in that there will be set awards for most injuries. I am sure things will not be as simple as that. A simplistic way of considering the book of quantum would be to look at recent court awards and to calculate an average of typical awards for a broken arm or back injury, for example, taking account of individual circumstances. Notwithstanding the fact that a percentage of each award relates to legal costs &ndash; that is a debate in itself &ndash; does the Tánaiste consider that present levels of awards are generally fair, compared with awards in Britain and Europe? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Senator Bradford asking if I think people get too much? In genuine cases I do not think that is so. When I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business a couple of months ago almost every person at the meeting, from all parties, felt we should cap awards. I was surprised, but the view of the joint committee was that awards were excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" />The purpose of this Bill is not to reduce awards but to pay what someone is entitled to, or might normally expect to get through the courts process, in a different way. One of the difficulties that arose in the past &ndash; I speak from my political experience as opposed to my ministerial experience &ndash; was the huge inconsistency in court awards. I understand there is greater clarity and consistency now than there might have been in the past. I have heard various accounts of judge A awarding Y amount and judge B awarding Y plus 10% or 50%. Of course, every case is different but if there are discrepancies based on the personality of the presiding judge rather than on the merits of the case it can cause difficulty and confusion from time to time.</P>
    <P>The legislation is not about capping awards. It is about delivering compensation in line with what could be expected in the courts. The issue of capping awards will be for another day and another forum. I understand that some Members of the House would wish us to go down that road. That would require a very different process. It is not one I have given any thought to or necessarily support.</P>

      <P>In page 31, subsection (1), line 43, to delete &ldquo;and the chief executive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the chief executive, while he or she should be entitled to attend a board meeting, would not be a voting member of the board. This issue has arisen with other State boards. It is a normal provision that the board directs and the chief executive is an employee who acts on the direction of the board. While he or she must attend meetings to know what the board wants, there should be a separation of powers between the two. The chief executive should not be a member of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>In most public companies and charitable organisations the chief executive, while subject to the board, is also a voting member. The chief executive has, presumably, by far the greatest knowledge of any person on the board and should have a right to participate in decision making and in the instructions the chief executive is given to carry out. I do not agree with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>For the board to work the chief executive must have an important role and be a <Col N="1320" />member of the board. It is reasonable that someone of that calibre should be a member of the board. It lessens the chief executive's effectiveness in dealing with the board if he or she is not a full member of it.</P>
      <P>I compliment our colleague, Senator O'Toole, who is a member of the interim board. I note the Bill does not include a provision to exclude Oireachtas Members or local authority members from membership of the board, which is unusual. Other Bills have excluded Members of the Oireachtas and local authority members from the boards of statutory bodies. If such people are suitably qualified and are nominated there is no reason why they should not be there. Members of this House, for example, who have the relevant experience would be most suitable for membership of the PIAB. I compliment the Tánaiste on not excluding her Oireachtas colleagues from membership of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mansergh. It is now the custom and practice in both public and private bodies for the chief executive officer to be part of the board. It is good from the point of view of corporate governance and the smooth running of an organisation that the chief executive officer is given equality of treatment with other board members. A chief executive officer is placed in a difficult position if he or she must attend board meetings merely on the basis of informing the board of what might be happening in the organisation. From every perspective it is a good thing for the chief executive officer to be an equal member with others. He or she will, after all, be charged with running the organisation on a day to day basis.</P>
      <P>Arguments could be made for and against that practice. Some feel good corporate governance requires that the chief executive officer is not a full member of the board. However, I think it works well if he or she is a full member. To the best of my knowledge, in all the organisations under the remit of my Department the chief executive officer is a full member of the board. I think it works well and is good practice. In the past, the role of chief executive officer and chairman were sometimes performed by the same person or the chairman's position was an executive function, which is not good practice. It is correct procedure to have an independent chairman and a separate chief executive officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste correctly anticipated the point I was about to make. I had in mind a particular State board whose chairman was also its chief executive officer. It is now generally accepted that this practice should be avoided on State boards. In a sense, we are seeking to go a step further by ensuring the chief executive officer could not be a voting member of the board and would be permitted to attend <i>ex officio </i>only. While it is clear the Tánaiste does not intend to accept the amendment, the proposal deserves further consideration not only in the <Col N="1321" />context of the Bill, but of State boards generally. If it is not good for the chief executive officer to be a chairman, he or she should not have a vote in the first place. I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator McDowell's amendment is slightly more inclusive than amendment No. 35 in the name of Senator Coghlan. I am suspicious as to the reason Senator McDowell is passing the buck.  Unfortunately, I was not present for the debate on Second Stage when many of the speakers stated that the purpose of the Bill was not to bash the legal profession. The small minority of legal practitioners, whom Senators have at times blamed for contributing to the high cost of claims, does not reflect the full picture in terms of the legal family.</P>
      <P>When establishing a board to make decisions which, I admit, relate simply to claims where liability has been conceded, we should nevertheless have room for people who can bring legal expertise to the work of the assessment panel as questions requiring legal input or interpretation will arise from time to time. In appointing representatives from a broad spectrum of fields, it would be inappropriate to exclude representation from the legal field. The amendment tabled by Senator Coghlan calling for representation on the board from the Law Society, as well as the addendum by Senator McDowell as regards the Bar Council, is worthy of the Tánaiste's consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My reluctance to speak to the amendment arose from a certain diffidence in proposing that an organisation of which I am a member should be represented on the board. Nevertheless, the case in favour of doing so stands up. Irrespective of whether we like it, members of the Law Society and the Bar Council have significant experience of the type of business which will be dealt with by the new board. In addition, their perspective, namely, the rights of claimants, would not necessarily be shared by everybody else on the board. It is correct and reasonable, therefore, to expect that perspective to be reflected on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated on Second Stage, the impression being created is that the assessment board is a creation of the insurance industry and that its function is basically to carry out insurance assess<Col N="1322" />ments under a different guise with State<i> imprimatur</i>. The fact the legislation is being dealt with by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment lends to this impression and it is important that it be corrected. One way of doing this would be to ensure the legal bodies are represented on the board. I commend my amendment and the Fine Gael Party amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be surprised if the Bar Council or Law Society wanted to have a representative on the board, given the level of opposition they have mounted to the legislation among Oireachtas Members. Both organisations put a strong case against the board being established. I do not know whether the Senator wants Conor Maguire of the Bar Council to be appointed to the board. In that case, who would represent the Law Society? I understand lawyers and barristers will be appointed to the board in any case but that they will not represent the associations of the legal professions directly. The difference is that representatives of the profession would take instructions from their respective organisations on the management of the board. It is important the PIAB is independent and seen to be independent. While it might appease the Law Society and Bar Council to appoint their nominees to the board, I do not believe the Tánaiste is inclined to do so.</P>

      <P>I remind Senator McDowell that I am also the Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs. The PIAB will serve consumers, insurers, employers and employees, rather than barristers and solicitors. Professor Denis Cusack, a member of the board, is both a barrister and a doctor, while Frances Cooke, another member of the board, is a member of the Law Society who works as a lawyer with the Revenue Commissioners. These two members of the board have been appointed because of their professional expertise on an independent basis, rather than as representatives of either the Bar Council or Law Society.</P>

      <P>As the Leas-Chathaoirleach correctly pointed out, we have discussed amendment No. 37 already. I do not wish to delay the House but ask for his indulgence since I did not argue in favour of the amendment earlier in the debate. The reason for the amendment was to remove the gagging order. It is fairly routine when setting up a State board that its members or, at least, its chairperson is obliged to uphold Government policy when appearing before a committee of the Oireachtas or elsewhere. In this <Col N="1324" />case, there is no cogent reason this obligation should apply as the board is not carrying out Government policy in any serious sense. It is, therefore, unreasonable to impose the traditional gag in these circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am pleased with the news we have just heard. A clause such as this is a rather blunt instrument. One does not want a chief executive opposing or undermining Government policy in a systematic fashion. On the other hand, there should be a degree of freedom, given the development of an ethos of constructive contribution to the development and evolution of policy in various areas. It may be the case, in certain circumstances, that something has to be said which would be a measured, implied criticism of some aspect of Government policy. In practice a good deal of this probably happens already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision smacks just a little of the ethos <Col N="1326" />of a more authoritarian age of government which we have largely left behind. I urge the Tánaiste to look at the possible rewording of such clauses. I accept that one does not want conflict between chief executives and Government but this provision, at least in form, is a blanket ban on expressing anything. A chief executive could make a positive and constructive contribution, from everybody's point of view, to the development of policy and public debate on an issue. In practice, they often do. I am not entirely happy with this type of clause being standard in legislation. Perhaps it could be looked at again and, while providing adequate protections, formulated to be a little more nuanced in its expression.</P>

We will omit that aspect unless there is some legal implication involved. I presume it is a policy issue, therefore, I do not understand why a board which will be financed by non-public funding should have such a stringent requirement. There are aspects relating to medical registration, including other matters, on which clarification is required. I anticipate the Bill will come back to this House after the other House has dealt with Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage.</P>

She went out of her way to facilitate the taking of the legislation last week and again today. I am deeply indebted to her and to all the other Members who put so much time and effort into preparing their contributions. It is a good Bill which has broad support. There are issues around legal representation and so on, but apart from that the Bill has broad support from all parties in the Oireachtas. The legislation is just a small aspect of this matter. The credibility and effectiveness of the board will determine its success or failure. There is a group of very determined people on the board, including a Member of this House, Senator O'Toole. These people will be driven by an outstanding chairperson, Ms Dorothea Dowling, who will make sure the legislation works effectively to drive down the cost of insurance and deliver claims to genuine claimants.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Hanly Report.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to welcome the Tánaiste to the House to take this important matter on health facilities in the midlands, particularly the status of stage 2B of Mullingar Hospital.</P>
      <P>A nationwide campaign against the Hanly report is now being planned by hospital action groups to oppose plans to centralise acute hospital services. The level of opposition to the report has been outlined by the chairwoman of the Irish Medical Organisation consultant committee and other prominent specialists. It has sparked opposition not just from the Opposition, but there has been strong opposition to the report from within the Government parties. It is heartening to know that even there the total impracticality of much of the report is recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is with the situation at Mullingar Regional Hospital and how the report, including report No. 149, which the Department of Health and Children plans to publish after the local elections, will affect this vital facility for the Midland Health Board area. Its future status has supposedly been assured under phase 2B of the midland <Col N="1329" />region's hospitals. The people of this area need assurances that the development of Mullingar Hospital will go ahead despite the report. Mullingar Hospital has 203 beds and the number is to increase to 311 under phase 2B. There are 25 consultants attached to the hospital and 202 full-time nursing personnel. There were 1,850 births in the hospital in 2002, with upwards of 1,900 forecast for this year. The accident and emergency department treated 29,000 patients in 2002 and this figure is expected to increase to more than 30,000 this year. In-patient numbers for 2002 were more than 13,000.</P>
    <P>The Government promised that &euro;57 million was ring-fenced for the development of the hospital. The shell was opened in 1997 by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan. The control plan was signed off by the members late last year and I understand it is going to the Department of Health and Children next week. More than 40% of all accident and emergency cases in the Midland Health Board area are treated in Mullingar Hospital. It is totally impractical to think that, despite Government assurances for its expansion and development, this medical hub for the midlands could conceivably be downgraded to local cottage hospital status. Let us not pull any punches here. The real issue here relates to people's lives. Proximity and quality of service are of paramount importance in medical emergencies.</P>
    <P>Mullingar is the only acute hospital from Sligo to Dublin on the N4 route. The downgrading of the accident and emergency department in the hospital would have the effect of reducing the service to 150,000 people currently living in the Longford-Westmeath catchment area. It would mean ambulances by-passing Mullingar Hospital and driving a further 45 minutes to bring patients to Tullamore Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>What is the future of the maternity unit and its staff at Mullingar? As we have already learned to our cost, the lack of maternity services at local hospitals can lead to the tragic loss of life.</P>
    <P>Under the national spatial strategy, the three hub towns of Mullingar, Tullamore and Athlone will see their population increase to 60,000 each. This will mean that Mullingar Hospital will eventually serve a catchment area of 300,000 people. The implementation of the proposals of the spatial strategy and the redeployment of people without the necessary basis of good and readily available medical care would be tantamount to madness, but the elimination of these facilities, which are already in place and due for expansion, would be a disaster for the area.</P>
    <P>The rationalisation and concentration of services may be a good idea in some specialities, but vital maternity and accident and emergency departments, where time is of the essence in life-threatening situations, should not be among these. The removal of maternity, accident and emergency and other services from Mullingar would be dangerous and morally wrong. I ask the Tánaiste for a commitment to complete phase 2B <Col N="1330" />of this essential development plan for the midlands. I hope she will give me assurances on the future of the Midland Regional Hospital in the Mullingar area. It is vitally important to get positive answers this evening and to send a message of assurance to the people of the Longford-Westmeath catchment area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who is unavailable.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to alter the services provided by the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar. The report of the national task force on medical staffing, the Hanly report, deals with the reorganisation of acute hospital services in two regions, the East Coast Area Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board. A second report will consider the role of acute hospital services in the rest of the country, taking account of the principles set out in the Hanly report. It is anticipated the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar will be examined in this context.</P>
      <P>The Hanly report addresses the need to improve patient care, reform medical education and training, and support the continued provision of safe, high quality acute hospital care 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The report sets out the measures needed to comply with the EU working time directive by reducing the working hours of junior doctors and introducing a consultant-provided service. No viable alternative has been advanced.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the principles set out in the Hanly report will mean a better service for patients. It involves harnessing the contribution of all our hospitals and providing a wider range of appropriate services and procedures in local hospitals. The report states that a full range of acute hospital services should be available within each region, so that patients should not have to travel outside other than for specialised supra-regional or national specialty services.</P>
      <P>The Hanly report recommends investment in local hospitals to provide more services for patients, including elective medical and surgical procedures, out-patient services, pre- and post-natal maternity services and better access to diagnostic facilities.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the Hanly report, in conjunction with the development of acute bed capacity and appropriate resourcing and reform of ambulance services, will mean hospital services are provided in the most appropriate setting. It will ensure that all patients, wherever they live, have equitable and rapid access to high quality emergency care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next phase of the development of Mullingar Hospital, phase 2B, was approved in July 2001. The design team has recently completed its work on the development control plan. Some minor amendments are being made to the plan and, following its acceptance by the Midland <Col N="1331" />Health Board, it will be submitted to the Department of Health and Children for approval. The phase 2 development has been costed at approximately &euro;57 million at 2001 prices, and is designed to increase the number of beds at the hospital from 198 to 311. The project is scheduled for completion in April 2008. There are no plans at present to alter the services provided by the Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar. A group is being established to consider the role of acute hospital services outside the east coast area and the mid west region, taking account of the principles set out in the Hanly report. The Midland Regional Hospital at Mullingar will be examined in this context.</P>
