      <P>I have received notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the plans for providing a radiotherapy unit at the regional hospital in Limerick, if it is his intention to provide a satellite radiotherapy facility and, if so, when this facility will be provided and the equipment that will be provided for it.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and Members may share time. This item is to conclude not later than 1 p.m. with the Minister being called to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome that the Government chose to accept Senator Quinn's Private Members' Bill last night. It is important we acknowledge that and I do so. It sends an important signal to other Opposition Senators. There appears to be more legislation coming from this side of the House than the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is the Government choosing to close down Parliament next week? Why, following 14 weeks in recess from July to October, will this House not sit next week? There are important issues to be debated. We must all wait until the following week because Ministers have decided <Col N="538" />to take a mid-term break. It is not good enough that this House will go into abeyance next week. The Government is treating this place as a doss house. There is a grievance on this side of the House because of the tactic of not introducing legislation in the House and the Government's decision to take this latest mid-term break. It is not right. It is a dumbing down of Parliament to which I have referred previously.</P>

      <P>I seek an explanation for this latest twist. There is no reason for the House to take a break next week. It is ridiculous that the Government is closing Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has strict laws relating to the detention of persons who are accused of crimes but, unfortunately, this is not the case everywhere. The issue of the detention of people in Guantanamo Bay has been raised previously. It is totally in contravention of international law and people are also being held in Iraq in a similar manner. A freeman of the City of Dublin, Aung San Suu Kyi, is also being detained in Burma. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to discuss what representations he and his Department have made regarding illegal detentions in various countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the comments of Senator Brian Hayes. It is not unusual in early July for Opposition Members to condemn the Houses going into recess until October. Sometimes one can reasonably cast doubt on the bona fides of those who make those protestations but no Member in either House believes that taking next week off can be justified. I do not understand the logic behind it as it makes no sense. While the Houses are committed to the week off, it would be a minor reform in the context of the useful discussions that were held in September and such a break should be done away with forthwith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not present for the Order of Business yesterday but I would like to reflect the frustration of others regarding the impasse that has been reached in Northern Ireland. I am one of many who have always viewed the decommissioning process as a confidence building measure rather than a logistical exercise. Sinn Féin and the IRA are well resourced and in position to replace the arms that are decommissioned should they choose to revert to violence. The purpose of decommissioning was always to build trust and it <Col N="539" />is utterly absurd that a decommissioning act can be carried out but details are not provided so that confidence can be built. I hope both Governments and those responsible for the obligation of confidentiality being placed on General de Chastelain will make the necessary moves over the next few days to break the impasse.</P>
    <P>I refer to the provision of a national stadium and national sports infrastructure. It is 18 months since Deputy O'Donoghue became the Minister responsible for this issue. He has been promising on almost a monthly basis that a Government decision is imminent, yet none has been reached. The Government is in the farcical position of having paid national sporting organisations to put their stadium plans on hold while failing to reach a conclusion itself. The House debates many issues with which the public does not connect but this is one issue in which the public has an interest and, if the Minister was invited to the House, it would give us an opportunity to send a signal to Government that it should get its finger out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Criminal activity in Limerick city has been discussed recently and this week has provided further evidence of the effect of the criminal fraternity on the local population. Ten jurors out of a total of 579 were eventually appointed to take a case in the Central Criminal Court in Limerick, despite the assurance of Garda protection for those participating in the case. That is symptomatic of the fear of the criminal fraternity in Limerick. The original objective behind the transfer of the Central Criminal Court from Dublin to Limerick was to save expenditure. However, a reign of fear has gripped Limerick city and the operation of the jury system there must be a serious concern for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Under the system, 90 out of a 100 potential jurors can be objected to by defence counsel. I have done jury service and a person can be objected to as a potential juror because somebody does not like the look of him or her. The jury system must be examined, particularly in terms of how it operates in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement of the provision of additional aid to the people of Iraq by the Government as it is badly needed. However, I am concerned that a number of countries have decided not to provide aid or assistance because they are worried about the lack of governance in Iraq. I hope this issue will be discussed by the EU and the UN. There is an urgent need for assistance and perhaps we will have an opportunity to debate this issue shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Following on from Senator Kitt's comments, I noticed the amounts provided by the Government and they are small in terms of the needs of Iraq but I am glad of that. It is not the duty of this or other European countries whose people massively opposed this illegal war to clean <Col N="540" />up the mess after the Americans. They waltzed in there with their own intentions, which were principally profit and power, and now they are looking to us to clean up the mess after them. We should be tough in dealing with them.</P>
      <P>I compliment my colleague, Senator Henry, on raising the question of Guantanamo Bay and putting it in the context of the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi because the Americans have shattered respect for international law and they are still illegally sequestering people and holding them in impossible conditions at Guantanamo Bay. Until these issues are resolved, we should not help them to clean up the mess they have created as the result of a tissue of lies.</P>
      <P>Could we have a debate on the Irish film industry and, in particular, the tax provisions which are in some difficulty? The president of the Motion Picture Association of America visited Ireland during the week. The film industry in America is powerful and he made it perfectly clear that if the Government persists with its intention of removing these incentives, Ireland will not be at the fair. We have a tremendous pool of talent in terms of technical people and actors and we have wonderful locations but we will put ourselves totally out of step with every other country in Europe if we do not have tax breaks. It is in our interest to maintain them. It may be unpopular because people want new hospitals and so on but jobs and income must be generated. I will support the Government if its wishes to maintain this tax incentive because it is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House to debate price increases? There has been a significant rip-off of consumers over the past 12 months. The Government is responsible for 60% of the increase in prices. Stealth taxes are being introduced on a daily basis, which I could list until lunch time, but there have been increases in the cost of gas, electricity, motor tax, the television licence and so on. The average householder must pay an additional &euro;650 per annum. It is important that this issue should be debated and not allowed to go unnoticed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I, like other Members, seek a debate on Iraq. The fact it is no longer in the headlines does not mean that people, particularly those with a regard for human rights, should not be vigilant. The detention of the Guantanamo Bay captives is a serious matter that will come back to haunt us when international justice is being debated in the future. Many issues are at stake. The US Administration may not accept that the captives are legal combatants, but it should consider the matter of ordinary human civil rights. The fact that people are being held to ransom at Guantanamo Bay is a worrying development. It is important for Ireland, which has always had a particular position in the international community when it comes to fair play <Col N="541" />and human rights, to be vigilant and to continue to debate the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, mention that the House may not sit next week. I have not heard any reference to such an adjournment from the Leader, who is normally rather informative. I am surprised that I have not received a letter or any other form of communication to explain the matter. I look forward to hearing clarification of this subject from the Leader.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the proposal to create an office of environmental enforcement. There has been a slight growth in the number of offices enforcing various matters. Will the new office be established by means of new legislation or by way of a ministerial order under existing legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House in the next few weeks to discuss the Government's plans to resolve the difficulties caused by last year's decision to scrap the first-time buyer's grant? Senators on this side of the House agree that it was a very bad decision. A debate on the matter could also involve a discussion of the abolition of the section 23 tax breaks. I believe that this decision has added about &euro;100,000 to the value of every relevant property, with the consequence that houses are now even less affordable for young people. We need to debate in this House the affordability of housing for young people and the correction of the anomaly that exists.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss road building projects throughout the country. A recent newspaper report suggested that the Minister is trying to fast-track the construction of motorways from Dublin to Cork and Galway. It is clear that other projects, such as the upgrading of the N9 and the Ennis and other bypasses, will be downgraded as a result. It is time for a debate on this matter in the House. We realise that money is not as plentiful as it was some time ago, but we need to decide whether to proceed with major projects at the expense of smaller-scale projects. Should priority be given to major projects? It would be helpful to have a debate on this matter in the run-up to the Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to advise the Government of a certain matter. Senators are aware that the last commercial Concorde flight will take place today. Given that it is an ill wind that does not help somebody, perhaps the Government might benefit from a great bargain. It might solve its transport problems by acquiring a Concorde jet. A spectacular deal might be available.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes noted the successful passage through Second Stage of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship and Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2003, which was brought forward by Senator Quinn. All Members of the House are pleased that the Bill was approved last night. I encourage all Senators, from all parties, to propose Private Members' Bills. I am preparing such a Bill at present.</P>
      <P>If there is a quality I cannot stand in a person, it is hypocrisy. We have been treated to a double dose of hypocrisy in the House this morning. Several Senators on the other side of the House asked me if the Houses will take a mid-term break of one week. I will spare their blushes by not naming them, but I reiterate that they occupy the Opposition benches.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry rightly mentioned the detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and she also spoke about other illegal detentions. I have requested a debate on the matter and it is being examined.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell was not too hasty when he spoke about the adjournment of the House for a week. I will not say any more on that matter because one is not allowed to draw attention to the absence of other Members. He also mentioned the need for confidence-building measures in Northern Ireland. He argued that the quantity of arms being decommissioned should be made known to the various leaders in the North but, given that I said yesterday that I thought the House was treating the matter in a serious and grown-up fashion, perhaps we should not make such demands. He also called on the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to come to the House. Such a request has been made in respect of a fine tourism report that has been published and that we want to debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane mentioned the difficulties that were encountered in acquiring the required number of jurors for a court case in Limerick. I am sure all Senators have noted this problem. This reluctance to participate in jury duty is a telling sign of people's fear of those involved in criminal activity. We cannot allow it to continue. The Senator asked for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's attendance in this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt said he is glad that additional aid is being sent to Iraq. Senator Norris asked why we should send aid to Iraq, given that the US has made a &ldquo;mess&rdquo; there. I am aware that a donors' conference is taking place today in Madrid. The United States wants other countries to contribute to clearing up the area.

    <P>Senator Coonan raised the issue of Concorde. He might take a trip on it himself. He asked if we would engage it for the Government.</P>
    <P>We have dealt with four Bills in the House since this session began. Senator Brian Hayes said there was no legislation coming before the House, which is a total exaggeration. All the Bills we passed are piled up on the Dáil Order Paper and the Dáil cannot get through its legislation. It is not for us to criticise it or decide when it considers Bills we have dealt with, but because there are so many Bills on the Dáil Order Paper, we cannot put through many more because they will join the queue. We will discuss two new Bills the week after next. I reiterate that the hypocrisy smells deeply&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this important Bill has been introduced in the Seanad. I welcome the opportunity to address the House on it and I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions.</P>
      <P>The Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 is, as its title indicates, a wide-ranging Bill relating to aspects of the marine environment. It updates our legislation on the protection of the marine environment through giving effect in our law to several internationally agreed instruments. These include: the protocol to the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation &ndash; OPRC; the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage &ndash;  the Bunkers Convention; the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Antifouling Systems for Ships, 2001 &ndash; AFS Convention; and Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention &ndash; the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships done at London on the 2 November 1973 as amended by the protocol done at London on 17 February 1978, known as MARPOL 73/78. The Bill also amends Part III of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992.</P>
      <P>The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999 gives effect to the OPRC. The convention was designed to ensure that proper arrangements are in place in each member state of the International Maritime Organisation to deal with emergencies arising from spillages of oil into the sea. Resolution 10 of the 1990 conference that adopted the OPRC invited the IMO to initiate work to develop an appropriate instrument to expand the scope of the OPRC to apply, in whole or in part, to pollution incidents by hazardous substances other than oil and prepare a proposal to this end. The IMO adopted a protocol to that effect in March 2000.</P>
      <P>The 1999 Act provides for the preparation of oil pollution emergency plans by harbour authorities and operators of offshore installations and oil handling facilities and their submission to the Minister for approval. It also provides that the Minister may direct a local authority to prepare and submit such a plan for approval. The Irish Coastguard, formerly known as the Irish Marine Emergency Service, which was set up in 1991 as part of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, has been designated as the national response agency and has made the necessary arrangements to give effect to the convention. The Irish Coastguard is also to be similarly designated for the purposes of the protocol. The Bill amends the 1999 Act to give effect to the terms of the protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ships travel faster through the water and consume less fuel when their hulls are clean and smooth and free from fouling organisms, such as barnacles, algae and molluscs. Therefore, they are coated with anti-fouling systems. During the 1960s, the chemical industry developed effi<Col N="547" />cacious and cost-effective anti-fouling paints using metallic compounds, particularly the organotin compound tributyltin, TBT. By the 1970s most seagoing vessels had TBT paints on their hulls. During the 1960s the chemical industry developed efficacious and cost effective anti-fouling paints using metallic compounds, in particular, the organotin compound tributyltin &ndash; TBT. By the 1970s most seagoing vessels had TBT paints on their hulls.</P>
    <P>The awareness of the harmful environmental effects of organotin compounds gradually grew in the late 1980s. Scientific studies have shown that organotin compounds, particularly TBT, used as anti-fouling systems on ships pose a substantial risk of adverse impacts on ecologically and economically important marine organisms. The IMO held a diplomatic conference on the control of harmful anti-fouling systems for ships from 1 to 5 October 2001, which adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems for Ships 2001. This convention provides rules to ban the use of organotin based anti-fouling systems &ndash; TBT &ndash; which are harmful to the marine environment and provides a mechanism through which other harmful anti-fouling systems may be banned or regulated in the future on a global basis.</P>
    <P>The use of organotin anti-fouling compounds has been restricted in the State under by-law 657 of 1987. This by-law did not, however, apply to any boat used or intended for use solely on the sea, whose hull is made of aluminium alloy or whose overall length is more than 25 metres. The convention applies to all vessels and will enter into force 12 months after its ratification by at least 25 states representing at least 25% of the world's tonnage, a target which has yet to be reached. The convention includes fixed application dates, namely, 1 January 2003 for the prohibition of the application of TBT coatings on ships and 1 January 2008 for the elimination of active TBT coatings on ships.</P>
    <P>European Union member states were prominent in promoting this measure and were anxious that the terms of the convention be applied as far as possible at the earliest possible date. Accordingly, the application of TBT has been prohibited on European Union ships and ships entering EU ports as of 1 July 2003 in advance of entry into force of the convention. European Union member states have been urged to introduce the legislation necessary to ratify the convention as soon as possible. Ireland has consistently advocated a ban on anti-fouling systems to apply internationally as set out in the convention and should, accordingly, introduce the necessary legislation to enable the State to ratify it as soon as possible. The Bill fulfils this requirement.</P>
    <P>The Sea Pollution Act 1991 makes provision for the prevention of pollution of the sea by oil and other substances and to give effect to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships done at London on 2 Nov<Col N="548" />ember 1973, as amended by the protocol done at London on 17 February 1978, MARPOL 73/78, also known as the MARPOL Convention. Regulations covering the various sources of ship generated pollution were originally contained in the five annexes of the convention.</P>
    <P>MARPOL is continually under review at the marine environment protection committee of the International Maritime Organisation and amendments are adopted as considered necessary. The convention has been modified by the protocol of 1997, whereby a sixth annex was added relating to prevention of air pollution from ships. The Bill amends the 1991 Act to enable regulations relating to annex VI, the prevention of air pollution from ships, to be made.</P>
    <P>The Bunkers Convention builds on arrangements which are in place at international level in relation to civil liability and compensation, arising out of oil spills from tankers, which have been adopted in connection with the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances by sea &ndash; HNS. Senators will recall the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill 2003, which was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas recently and updates our legislation with regard to spills from tankers. The Bunkers Convention introduces a civil liability regime for ships other than oil tankers.</P>
    <P>The Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill 2000 currently before the Dáil gives effect in Irish law to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in connection with the carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1996, HNS convention. The Bunkers Convention complements the conventions relating to liability and compensation in respect of oil spills from tankers and hazardous and noxious substances. This Bill similarly complements the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts and the HNS Bill through introducing arrangements in respect of spills of bunker oil.</P>
    <P>Section 15(6)<i>(b)</i> of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 empowers the Minister to refuse to grant a licence to the owner of a passenger boat who has been convicted of an offence. Section 16(2) gives the Minister powers to suspend or revoke a licence where an owner fails or refuses to comply with a condition of a licence, but the provision only applied to the vessel to which the licence applies. The Minister has no powers in relation to any other vessel that the owner may have, that is, the Minister can only act with regard to the boat in respect of which the convictions were made but cannot do anything about any additional boat the owner may have. The proposed amendment will enable the Minister to revoke any or all passenger boat licences held by an individual who has been guilty of an offence, even when the offence has occurred on another vessel. The penalty provisions in the Act in respect of passenger boats will also be amended to bring them into line with the current maximum permissible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" />Those are the elements of the Bill. It would assist the House in its consideration of the Bill to refer to the context in which it is being introduced. Owing to the international nature of shipping, action to prevent pollution of the marine environment is most effective when taken by agreement at regional or international level. Our valuable but vulnerable coastline has convinced us of the importance of achieving the highest standards of safety on ships. Ireland has consistently supported measures in this regard at European Union and international levels. It is important, therefore, that our legislation complies with accepted European Union and international standards while addressing specific Irish concerns.</P>
    <P>The condition of the marine environment does not remain unchanged but is continually evolving. Similarly, the state of international shipping and other factors which affect the marine environment are continually changing. International and other instruments are accordingly kept under review and updated as required. The <i>Erika </i>incident off the coast of France in December 1999 led to a reassessment at European Union and international levels of many aspects of the regulatory arrangements which apply regarding maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment. This process was given added impetus in November 2002 when the Bahamas registered tanker, <i>Prestige</i>, laden with 77,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil, broke in two off the coast of Galicia in Spain, spilling an unknown but substantial quantity of its cargo.</P>
    <P>Following the <i>Erika </i>incident measures have been introduced or agreed as regards the compensation available to victims of pollution by oil tankers &ndash; as I stated, legislation to give effect to these measures was passed recently by the Oireachtas; the regulation of ship classification societies; the accelerated phasing-out of single hull oil tankers; the strengthening of port State control measures and ship reporting arrangements. In addition, the European Maritime Safety Agency was established by regulation in August 2002 for the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of ships within the European Union. The agency is to enable the Commission to offer the full range of professional services needed to discharge its duties in this connection. All member states are represented on the board of the agency.</P>
    <P>Following the <i>Prestige </i>incident, European Union Ministers committed themselves to building on the progress which had been made during the previous few years. To that end, a number of new measures were introduced. The Council of Ministers and Parliament have adopted a proposal by the Commission to further accelerate the phasing-out of single hull tankers and to ban the carriage of heavy grades of fuel oil in single hull tankers. Member states have requested the IMO to introduce similar arrangements to be applied internationally. A proposal by the Commission concerning sanctions for offences involving pol<Col N="550" />lution of the marine environment is under consideration at EU official working group level.</P>
    <P>Belgium, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom decided earlier this year to present the International Maritime Organisation with a joint request to designate certain maritime areas a particularly sensitive sea area &ndash; PSSA &ndash; to strengthen its protection of particularly vulnerable areas. The limit of the PSSA proposed coincides with the 15th meridian, the Porcupine Bank, and includes parts of the special waters of the north-west Europe zone as defined under the MARPOL convention, the English Channel and coastal waters, and certain parts of pollution response areas and exclusive economic zones along Spanish, French and Portuguese coasts. The aim of the exercise is to protect our marine environment and coastline from oil spills by discouraging vessels from entering into the particularly sensitive sea area. It was proposed to ban certain tankers and others, for example, double hulls and some single hull tankers, would have to state their intention to cross the area 48 hours in advance.</P>
    <P>The PSSA request was considered by the MEPC in July 2003. Irish experts from several Departments and agencies together with colleagues from the other five states attended to support the request. The MEPC agreed in principle to the request for designation and referred the matter to an expert navigation committee for examination. This committee is expected to report to the MEPC next year. The MEPC did not accede to the request to ban tankers as proposed; it is open to the states concerned to introduce other protective measures. Possible proposals in this regard are being considered by the officials and experts concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing the Oil Pollution (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill earlier this month, reminded the House that in Ireland we succeeded earlier this year in averting a serious oil spill. An incident occurred on 28 January 2002 off the coast of Donegal involving a 22 year old single hull Panamanian registered tanker, the <i>Princess Eva</i>, which had the potential for pollution similar to the <i>Prestige</i> or the <i>Erika</i>. The vessel was carrying 55,000 tonnes of heavy oil from Copenhagen to the USA. On 28 January 2003, the vessel experienced heavy weather off the north west coast of Ireland. Following an accident on board in which two crew members were killed and another severely injured, the vessel entered Donegal Bay where the two bodies were transferred to shore. An oil spill was averted due to the actions taken by the Irish Coast Guard and the maritime safety directorate of my Department.</P>
    <P>Events such as these serve as a reminder of the vulnerability of our coastline and of the importance of adequate protection for the marine environment. These events have also focused the Minister's attention on the provision of safety services. He is satisfied that the establishment of a single agency responsible for all safety matters is the <Col N="551" />best course of action. He intends to submit proposals to Government for decision in this regard as soon as possible. This matter is at present being discussed with trade unions and staff representatives with a view to resolving industrial relations issues which arise and charting the way forward for the development of marine safety services. The Minister and I look forward to debating the legislation required with Members of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of the process of providing adequate protection for our marine environment. I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions and have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Department's officials for sending me a briefing note on the Bill. This is a composite measure to implement international conventions and protocols, which is why it is described as a miscellaneous provisions Bill. We have been discussing pollution at sea a great deal lately, particularly oil pollution. This Bill is part of a cohesive package to deal with that area.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the banning of TBT, the chemical used on the hulls of vessels, and said that it would apply to 25% of the world's tonnage. The European Union is good at legislating on these matters and operates as a single entity. However, many ships operate under flags of convenience. The protocols, conventions and so forth will affect 25% of ships but what will happen with the other 75%? Has the International Maritime Organisation looked at this in the context of non-EU countries and shipping companies? This is obviously effective in the European context but if we want to protect the marine environment it must be implemented on a 100% basis or it will not be successful. Does the International Maritime Organisation look at the global situation and seek to apply it to the other 75% of shipping?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent incidents have focused our attention on the vulnerability of our coastline. As an island country, we must always be conscious of it and support measures which will assist in eliminating pollution at sea. It is most important for our coastline, our marine economy and the tourism sector. If we wish to focus people's minds on these Bills, we need only talk about two recent incidents rather than talking about the technical aspects. The Minister of State spoke about one of them. The other is the break up of the <i>Prestige</i> last November off the Galician coast when 77,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil spilled into the sea. We were reminded every night by the television of the effects it had on the coastline of Galicia in Spain and its impact on the tourism industry and the local community. It forcefully brought home to viewers what can happen as a result of such incidents. Interestingly, the vessel was registered in the Bahamas. Would the convention regarding <Col N="552" />TBT apply to Bahamas registered vessels or are these vessels part of the 75% I mentioned earlier?</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal to put marine safety under the remit of a single body. The people of Donegal should be complimented on how they dealt with the <i>Princess Eva</i>. We were fortunate that as a result of their efforts the 55,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil did not end up on the Donegal coastline. The <i>Prestige</i> incident demonstrates the importance of this and what can go wrong. Fortunately, the same thing did not happen with the <i>Princess Eva</i>. When we discussed the Oil Pollution (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill I suggested that we should have a suitable type of tug vessel available. I am interested that the Minister is entering discussions with the UK to consider, given the expenditure involved, whether it is possible for both Governments to acquire a vessel to deal with the eventuality of a ship breaking up and threatening our shoreline. The new research vessel could act as a holding mechanism for a ship but it would not have the towing capacity. If we had a vessel in place to prepare for and deal with pollution at sea incidents, the jigsaw of an effective marine safety mechanism would be complete.</P>
    <P>I will digress a little to voice my concerns about another area in the marine sector. Bord Iascaigh Mhara has always been identified with fish and it has been a successful marketing engine for the marine industry. I am concerned about talks, which appear to be at an advanced stage, on merging Bord Bia with BIM. Has this been thought out fully? I am concerned for the marine industry and the respect it is accorded. It suffered a blip with the formation of the new Government when people in the industry felt it was being left out because it was no longer a separate ministerial entity. However, it was combined with communications and natural resources and they were reasonably happy with that. This industry is having problems at present, particularly with regard to the catch it is permitted, and this development will aggravate it further. I will be surprised if there is not an outcry against the proposal to merge BIM with Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>It was always considered necessary to have a separate entity to market fish. Most of our fish is exported so it is most important that this entity remain in place. The Minister of State's colleague from Wexford will have a short honeymoon as chairman of BIM if the two bodies are to be merged, although perhaps he will emerge as the chairman of both bodies. The fishing industry is worth &euro;547 million in exports and there should be careful consideration before merging BIM and Bord Bia. I would expect a reaction against it.</P>
    <P>It is not the first time this idea has been floated. It was floated a few years ago when I was a Member of the Lower House. There was a strong belief in the Department of Agriculture and Food that it would be worthwhile. I was pressed by senior members of the Government to support the idea but I had extreme reservations. People in the industry, particularly Joey Murrin, rang me <Col N="553" />at the time urging me not to support it because it would weaken the industry. I respected his comments. I ask the Minister of State to give careful consideration to that matter and to the position of the marine industry in general.</P>
    <P>I made most of the comments I wish to make on this matter in respect of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill. The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will be debating aquaculture in the near future. I hope the Minister of State will have received the legal advice before that debate takes place because, as stated previously, we are anxious that the aquaculture industry should be seen as respectable and should enjoy consumer confidence. Consumers should feel that the industry is operating to proper standards, etc. I look forward to the legal advice being finalised at an early date, hopefully before the committee engages in its debate on aquaculture.</P>
    <P>This Bill is another important component in the mechanisms to deal with pollution. It is all very well that people are good consumers and that they respect the marine environment. However, the International Maritime Organisation must consider this matter in global terms. It is correct that the EU should make provision in respect of it for its member states but I would be concerned if it were not dealt with on a worldwide basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred success in terms of replacing single-hull vessels which carry major risks in terms of oil pollution. To what degree have double-hull vessels replaced their single-hull counterparts? Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and his officials. I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking on the Bill. However, I must admit to being somewhat confused because two weeks ago we debated the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill 2003, which is similar to a large extent to the measure before us. Part of that confusion arises because I assumed the protocol to the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation 1990 would have been included in the previous Bill. However, I am sure there are very good reasons for its inclusion here. I have also noticed some other similarities with the previous Bill, including the conversion of international units of account into the currency of the State and also the issuing of compulsory insurance certificates.</P>
      <P>We cannot have any discussion on the pollution of the sea without considering the marine environment and particularly the urgent restoration and maintenance of fish stocks. It is important that there should be a strengthening of regional fisheries organisations and we should also include improved data collection and compliance with the various measures laid down by different states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" />Global sustainable development and poverty reduction require healthier and more sustainably managed oceans and seas. The fisheries sector alone is the main source of protein for 1 billion people, as well as being a major provider of livelihoods as it gives rise to some 5% to 10% of the world's food supply. There is growing pressure on the marine environment. The decline in marine biodiversity and the depletion of fish stocks are of increasing concern, as is the use of flags of convenience, particularly for fishing vessels, as a means to avoid management conservation measures. This is hardly a new phenomenon as the use of flags of convenience has been responsible for greatly reduced standards of safety and manning levels, leading to all manner of difficulties, accidents and disasters. The recent sinking of the <i>Prestige</i> has again demonstrated that tanker safety and pollution prevention have to be further improved.</P>
    <P>The International Maritime Organisation is primarily concerned with the safety of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution, but it has also introduced regulations covering liability and compensation for damage such as pollution caused by ships. In March 2001, the International Maritime Organisation finalised a new convention to apply the principles of the Civil Liability Convention to all types of commercial shipping such as bulk carriers and container ships. This convention, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage 2001, better known as the Bunkers Convention, provides for ship owners to be strictly liable for fuel oil spills and requires them to carry compulsory insurance to cover any pollution damage following such a spill. In accordance with a commitment in the Government's ocean policy, Australia was closely involved in the development of this convention which is expected to enter into force internationally within the next few years.</P>
    <P>In November 2001, the European Commission made a proposal for a decision of the Council authorising the ratification of the Bunkers Convention. The regulatory objective of the convention is to provide adequate, prompt and effective financial compensation to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when carried as fuel in ships' bunkers. It is applicable to damage caused in the territory, including the territorial sea and in exclusive economic zones of states parties. This authorisation was necessary because there was a legislative gap between EU law, on one hand, and international liability conventions, on the other. As a consequence, member states did not have the authority to ratify this convention by themselves as only the Union has the right to negotiate, conclude and fulfil the international commitments set up by it. However, only states may become contracting parties to the convention and, therefore, a situation arose whereby neither EU member states nor the Union were in a position to approve the convention. The Council decision exceptionally authorising ratification of <Col N="555" />the convention by member states was proposed in order to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>In its communication following the <i>Prestige</i> accident, the European Commission repeated that the total level of compensation available should be augmented to &euro;1 billion. Furthermore, in the communication, the Commission reiterates the need to introduce penal sanctions against any person &ndash; including legal persons &ndash; who has caused a pollution incident through grossly negligent behaviour. The Commission also reiterated its proposal arguing for the need to amend the international oil pollution compensation regime so that the right of ship owners to limit their financial liability will be abolished.</P>
    <P>This is an important point and the example often taken is the loss of income suffered by tourist resorts where oil pollution in their areas caused people to stay away, thereby resulting in an economic loss to traders and hoteliers. One of the most recent disasters of this nature in European waters was caused by the sinking of the oil tanker <i>Erika </i>on Sunday, 12 December 1999. It was carrying 26,000 tonnes of fuel oil and it broke in two 60 miles off the beautiful coastline of Brittany in France. A coastguard official, referring to the impending environmental disaster that eventually struck 250 miles of French coastline, said that there was a clear danger of pollution but could not indicate how serious it would be. The seriousness soon became apparent. It became an environmental and economic disaster, with wide reaching consequences, not just directly for the environment and for bird and marine life, but also for the people who rely on the sea or tourism of Brittany and coastal regions further south for a living.</P>
    <P>The spill caused havoc along the mid-western coast of France in the vicinity of one of its busiest seaside resorts, La Baule, which caters for hundreds of thousands of French and international tourists each year. In addition to the trade of this major resort being seriously disrupted and a huge threat being caused to its lucrative tourist trade, the fishing industry, consisting of many different interests, was also devastated. Overall losses to the sea industry have been a grim reality for the many Bretons who rely on the fruits of the sea to earn a living. This stretch of coast has many oyster beds that were contaminated with oil and, as a result, many oyster farmers have gone out of business. So too have the freelance fishermen who rely on collecting cockles, mussels and clams at low tide, a precarious living at the best of times. The sea-salt industry, situated on the marshy land just inside the coast, was also threatened by the polluted water. However, the greatest impact has been for sea birds. Over 20 times more were killed than when the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> sank in 1978 spilling 233,000 tonnes of oil. This is due to the fact that many more birds were wintering in the region at the time of the <i>Erika's</i> break-up.</P>
    <P>In economic terms, concern over oil pollution reduced bookings to the coastal resorts which rely <Col N="556" />heavily on the seasonal tourist trade. The French Government had to mount a major clean-up operation along the coast. However, despite the provision of huge resources, a fear of the carcinogenic effects of the deadly oil remained for some time. A constituent of mine who is familiar with the area, told me of the terrible effect the disaster has had on the region. A favourite pastime of the local population was to walk out along the shore at low tide and collect the wild oysters from the rich beds. They would come back to their village carrying buckets full of oysters, a natural bonus to those lucky enough to live in the area. The <i>Erika</i> disaster put paid this. While financial compensation might help the affected population economically, no amount of money could compensate them for the psychological damage a simple coastal community suffered because of this disaster.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning that the Bunkers Convention is accompanied by an IMO resolution which urges all contracting states to ratify or accede to the 1996 protocol to the 1976 convention, thereby providing greatly increased funds against which claims, including Bunker pollution claims, can be brought. However, there are still difficulties in the insurance area and some effort has been made to restrict the burden of this obligation. Only the registered shipowner is required to have insurance and that is restricted to ships over 1,000 tonnes and even this figure appears to have been a compromise. Not surprisingly, the shipowners' organisations and their insurers argued for the highest threshold possible, while coastal states argued that it should be as low as possible so that the maximum number of incidents would fall within the insurance requirement.</P>
    <P>The convention allows the contracting states to declare that registered owners are not required to maintain insurance or other financial security to cover Bunker pollution claims where their vessels are engaged exclusively on domestic voyages, that is, voyages within the territorial seas of the state regardless of the size of the ships. I ask the Minister to clarify Ireland's position in this respect.</P>
    <P>I notice there is an exclusion for shipowners which excludes liability or damage resulting from an act of war, or if it is caused by the act or omission of a third party with intent to cause damage &ndash; for example, sabotage &ndash; or that which is caused by the negligence or wrongful act of any government or other authority responsible for maintaining navigational aids. This provision could also include the present scourge of international terrorism, of which we have seen too many major and spectacular acts in recent years.</P>
    <P>As is often the case, two or even more ships can cause a pollution incident. Article 5 provides that in such a case and where it is not possible to determine from which ship the pollution came, then all the ships involved will be held jointly and severally liable. This means that any party can be sued for the whole of the claim or each can be sued for a proportion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" />No debate is needed on the question of single hull vessels that are used as oil tankers on our seas. Many of the worst pollution disasters have been caused by damage to these vessels and we must apply as much pressure as possible on those countries and companies which continue to use single-hull vessels to discontinue the practice in the best interests of global society. We have too many examples over the last 30 or 40 years, of which the French experience is only one, of massive damage being done to our environment, in many of those cases in circumstances that could have been relatively easily avoided. We have suffered our own share of oil pollution and one need look no further back than the Whiddy Island disaster when the <i>Betelgeuse</i> exploded with the loss of 50 lives. Of less significance, though extremely important in their own right, were the huge environmental and legal problems it caused.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction and a visible effort on the part of the Government to discharge our own and international obligations and try to put pressure on those who treat our environment and our safety procedures with disdain. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their thoughts and constructive contributions on this Bill. While Senator Kenneally talked about confusion, I do not think it is easy to confuse a Waterford Senator. He has a good grasp of the problems of the sea and the coastline.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane raised the issues of TBTs. The convention will take effect and apply internationally once 25% is achieved. After the accession states join the Union, the EU will control 40% of the world's tonnage.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane also raised the availability of a tug. We are holding ongoing discussions with Britain in this area. However, we have a certain level of response and the Irish Coastguard has anti-pollution equipment stockpiles in Dublin, Killybegs and Castletownbere. There is also a pool of trained personnel from harbour and local authorities who have attended national training courses and can be called upon. The coastguard also has contracts with specialist companies experienced in oil spill response to provide equipment and personnel in the event of a tier three response. The Irish Coastguard maintains close links with the EC's civil protection and environmental accident unit and can call for immediate assistance should an event similar to the <i>Prestige</i> incident occur in the Irish pollution responsibility zone. As a result of this co-operation, the Irish Coastguard sent 1,200 metres of boom and oil recovery equipment to Spain to assist Spanish authorities in dealing with the <i>Prestige </i>incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in the process of acceding to the Bonn agreement between north European countries which provides for mutual support in marine pollution incidents. Ireland is a member of the EU pollution management committee which can pro<Col N="558" />vide experts and support from EU countries in response to a call from a member state.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Irish Coastguard received funding to provide for a marine pollution and salvage section. In the past, the coastguard has successfully responded to all incidents. To prove the handling of the <i>Princess Eva</i> was not just good luck but also good management, the coastguard has successfully responded to nine incidents this year involving vessels that posed a threat of marine pollution.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane also mentioned Bord Bia and BIM. While I am not passing the buck, the Minister is dealing with this issue.</P>

      <P>Senator Finucane also raised the single-hull ban. The regulation has been in force in the EU since 21 October 2003. EU member states seeking similar arrangements must apply to international standards.</P>
      <P>In response to an issue raised by Senator Kenneally, the previous Bill was fast tracked to meet the deadline of 1 November 2003. This Bill provides for the remaining items. Regarding the Bunkers Convention, the EU urged member states to introduce legislation and this Bill fulfils that requirement. Limits of compensation are covered in a recent Bill and sanctions are currently under discussion at EU working group level.</P>
      <P>Senator Kenneally also raised the issue of insurance for our flag carrying vessels. Any ship carrying more than 2,000 tonnes of oil in bulk as cargo is required to have insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank that covers liability for pollution damage under this convention. We cannot allow any such ship under the Irish flag to trade without a certificate of insurance. Ireland currently has no oil tankers under its flag.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kenneally also raised the issue of insurance for foreign flagged vessels. Under the Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999 ships from convention and non-convention countries arriving at an Irish port carrying 2,000 tonnes or more of cargo oil must carry a certificate of insurance or other financial security. The master of the ship must produce this on demand to any inspector or <Col N="559" />harbour master. If a ship fails to carry a certificate on board, or the master of the ship fails to produce it, the master shall be guilty of an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions I have raised the importance of a radiotherapy facility for the Mid-Western Health Board region. I raise it because many people who suffer from cancer require radiotherapy treatment and must travel long distances for it. The expert review group's conclusions were greeted with much disappointment in my area, although from soundings taken in advance of the publication of the findings it was known that the mid-west and south east areas would not get radiotherapy services. The group has focused on what it calls three centres of excellence in locations in Dublin, Cork and Galway.</P>
      <P>Regarding the expert review group, many of its findings and research were flawed. For example, within the report itself, an independent study was carried out on the priorities of patients, with travel distance ranked 13th. The Minister regarded this as significant but what he did not say is that many of those interviewed for the survey were from the Cork and Dublin areas, where travel is not a factor because they are near the locations for radiotherapy. The Cancer Care Alliance is composed of eminent people in the oncology sector and it has stated that this analysis, and the component on travel, being used to justify the three different locations and to say facilities were not needed in other areas is a flawed approach. I do not need to elaborate any further as to why the group takes this view.</P>
      <P>It is significant to view the breakdown of people who had to travel: those travelling 0-10 miles made up 44%, 11-30 miles made up 16% and 31-60 miles made up 20%. A place like Mount Collins, at the very tip of County Limerick, is probably 180 miles from St. Luke's hospital, Dublin. Ranking the travel factor as justification for concentrating on three locations because cancer patients do not rate the travel distance is flawed and information exists to contradict that justification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" />The report also contains justification for concentrating on having four to six linear accelerators in different locations. That contradicts a professional report done in the UK by Calman Hine, which stated that there is justification for having at least two linear accelerators for a population cluster of approximately 300,000. Our disappointment in the mid-west is due to the fact that we have the money available to provide capital funding for the linear accelerators. A very good charitable trust in the area provided that funding and all it wanted was a commitment from the Department to provide the staffing resources for the facility. It was not as if it asked for the capital investment to be provided.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, would be present. He lives in Limerick and is well aware of this situation and the concerns of people in the mid-west region. He recently floated the idea of a satellite and I wanted to find out what he meant by that &ndash; when it would happen, how many linear accelerators would be provided and so on. I do not know if that question will be answered or if I will get the obfuscation that happens here at times; sometimes I wish the Minister would respond before I articulated my concerns so that I could ask questions afterwards.</P>
    <P>I have said in my area that Deputy Michael Noonan will be remembered as Minister for Health for the legacy of improvements he provided to the regional hospital. I congratulated the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, on his appointment at a council meeting and said if he wanted to be remembered for one legacy after his years of office, he should provide radiotherapy facilities for Limerick Regional Hospital. The mid-west region demands it.</P>
    <P>A unique feature of the mid-west region is the lack of private hospitals. In other areas private hospitals operate in parallel with public hospitals and in many cases those with VHI can choose to attend private hospitals outside their own areas. The regional hospital in our area is doing a very effective job and is being developed. It has a modern oncology unit and radiotherapy facilities are an essential component of that unit.</P>
    <P>We should think first of all of those suffering from cancer &ndash; one in three people will contract the disease in their lifetimes. Many of those sufferers are not able to travel long distances for the care they require. It is recognised by those in the palliative care sector that the condition of a sufferer travelling long distances is aggravated. I saw people's concerns when canvassing for the last election. A mother who had developed breast cancer told me: &ldquo;I am four miles from Limerick city. Isn't it shocking that I have to go to Dublin for treatment and farm out my four children when I am getting only a few seconds of treatment?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a human dimension to this matter. If one talks to people the most important issue for them is health care. It is interesting that Dr. <Col N="561" />Watson and Dr. Rogan, two members of the expert review group, dissented from the main findings of the report on the basis of equity and access. A mistake has been made and this issue should be examined again. The population of the mid-west region would justify two linear accelerators and they would be an important component in treatment in the area.</P>
    <P>There is extreme disappointment in our area and it is the same in Waterford and the south east. I want to see what is likely to happen in terms of radiotherapy in the mid-west in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for raising these matters on the Adjournment and I apologise for the absence of the Minister. This gives me an opportunity to set out his position on the future development of radiation oncology services nationally.</P>
      <P>As the Senators will be aware, the Minister for Health and Children recently launched the Report on the Development of Radiation Oncology Services. This report is a most authoritative analysis of radiation oncology and provides a detailed plan for the future development of radiation oncology services here. The Government has accepted the recommendations of this report.</P>
      <P>The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, it has agreed that the first step of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The Minister agrees with the report's conclusion that this is the best model to provide a radiation oncology service to the highest standards. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the backbone of the future service expansion. The development of radiation oncology services along the lines recommended in this report is the single most important priority of the Minister in cancer services in the acute setting.</P>
      <P>With regard to Cork, in the short term, the Minister has approved the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the Cork centre and the necessary capital investment amounting to &euro;4 million to commission this service as rapidly as possible. He has now approved the appointment of a project team to prepare a brief for the rapid expansion of current capacity from four to eight linear accelerators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Galway, the Minister also intends to prioritise the necessary resources to <Col N="562" />ensure that the radiation oncology centre in Galway is in a position to treat patients, commencing in spring 2005. He has also requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate the expansion from three to six linear accelerators in the medium term. The Minister will also give early approval to the establishment of a project team to plan this expansion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the eastern region, the report recommends that there should be two treatment centres located in the eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas. The Minister has asked the chief medical officer of the Department of Health and Children to advise on the optimum location of radiation treatment facilities in Dublin. He proposes discussing the implications of the report with the board of St. Luke's Hospital shortly. The chief medical officer will apply the guidelines established by the group. Based on the advice from the chief medical officer, who will be supported by the Department's hospital planning office, the Minister will decide on the location of the services.</P>
    <P>Radiation oncology centres will be required to provide services on an equitable basis which will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. The radiation oncology centres will provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions. This is currently the case and as more radiation oncologists are appointed, it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that in a patient survey carried out on behalf of the expert group, distance to travel for treatment was ranked 13th in order of importance. Highest level of patient care was considered to be the most important aspect of service. The Minister fully endorses the report's findings that equity of access to the highest quality radiation oncology facilities is a right of all cancer patients.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided that in the further development of services consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north-west. Such consideration will take into account the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's intention to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology. The twin objectives of equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme need to be supported by a co-ordinating mechanism, as recommended in the report. A National Radiation Oncology Co-ordinating Group has been established. The group will <i>inter alia</i> facilitate improved access to existing and planned services. The group will comprise clinical, technical, mana<Col N="563" />gerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions.</P>
    <P>The Report on the Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland marks a significant milestone in radiation oncology services nationally and its guidelines and recommendations are essential in the development of these services for cancer patients over the next number of years.</P>
