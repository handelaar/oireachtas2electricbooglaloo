      <P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to make a statement on the up-to-date position on the application for the construction of the new swimming pool at the Mall Complex, Longford.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mansergh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide funding at the earliest opportunity for the repair and refurbishment of the unacceptable and substandard facilities at St. Ailbhe's vocational school, Tipperary town.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the reason the decentralisation of 10,000 jobs announced over three and a half years ago to areas which had not previously benefited from decentralisation such as counties like County Roscommon has still not commenced and if there are any proposals for decentralisation to Roscommon, Boyle, Castlerea and Ballaghaderreen.</P>

      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the contingency plans he has to address the ongoing funding shortfalls incurred by the Cheshire Foundation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Higgins of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to institute an <Col N="1110" />immediate inquiry into allegations contained in a newspaper (details supplied) on 22 June 2003 that RUC officers may have colluded in the murder of the late councillor, Eddie Fullerton, at his home in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Bannon, Mansergh and Feighan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators McHugh and Higgins may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001 &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 4.30 p.m.; No. 2, motion re Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, to be taken at 4.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 5.30 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time, the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than 5.25 p.m.; No. 3, Arts Bill 2002 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 7.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time, the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage at approximately 7.20 p.m.; No. 4, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2002 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 7.30 p.m. and conclude not later than 8.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed as far as Fine Gael is concerned. As the Leader knows, we will conclude our consideration of Report Stage of the European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001 later today. Last week Dr. Maureen Gaffney and her colleagues at the National Economic and Social Forum produced a fine report on the lack of rights given to same sex couples. The report included a number of recommendations concerning the rights of such couples. It suggested that such people should have the right to adequate pension and inheritance cover and that such partnerships should have civil recognition. It was found last week that 9% of the population of the State were unmarried but cohabiting. This specific group, which is growing all the time, is given very few rights in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader agree to a debate on this issue at some stage? Perhaps it will not be possible to have such a debate before the recess. It is quite clear that many people such as those involved in same sex relationships and cohabiting couples are involved in relationships which are outside the traditional family type. The fact that those involved in cohabiting relationships, in particular, <Col N="1111" />have virtually no rights has fundamental implications for tax and pension provisions. The House could use its particular role, experience and knowledge to make suggestions in relation to this area, on which there should be a debate in the House in the coming months, perhaps in the next session, when we can draw on the recommendations of last week's report. Such a debate would be very useful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should note the fact that benchmarking awards will be paid to politicians during the course of this month and next month. We will not receive the payments before anyone else but at the same time as most of the rest of the public service. I would like to make two points about this development, which is crucially important. Any moneys to be allocated have been hard won and hard fought across the negotiating table. Cases were made by people like me on behalf of various groups. At no time was it envisaged that people were seeking more than they deserved or was it suggested that anyone got more than they deserved. I am not even slightly impressed by those publicly sending money back in respect of increases which have been hard fought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is Senator Ross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Some may be better able than others to afford to send back money. It is an easy way to receive positive and warm acknowledgement and affirmation from the public. Any increases received by any group such as politicians, teachers or anyone else as a result of benchmarking were hard earned and well deserved. This should be made clear.</P>
      <P>The benchmarking process also includes a real commitment to restructuring and modernisation. Over the last week many have asked what politicians will do to earn their increases. It is not true that we will decide to talk longer and louder to earn the extra moneys we will be given but we should make a commitment to restructuring and modernisation. It is more important than ever that we focus on the work of the sub-committee reviewing the Seanad. Each group and party should make a public commitment to making changes, some of which might be uncomfortable, to show that we are prepared to make and live with changes and make them work.</P>
      <P>Some groups such as retired teachers are paid on a monthly basis rather than on a fortnightly basis as is the case with their colleagues. I would like the Leader to ask the Department of Finance to explain the reason retired people cannot avail of fortnightly payments. The frequency of payment is important to those on lower incomes when structuring their weeks. I would like a response on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody who watched the performance at Croke Park on Saturday night when <Col N="1112" />the Special Olympics World Summer Games were opened could have failed to have been impressed by the huge level of goodwill and sense of celebration of people with disabilities. This is also true of those who participated in or observed the torch runs in towns throughout Ireland last week. The goodwill and positive feeling in relation to those who have come to visit us from around the world are huge. It is notable that the role of people with disabilities and their sense of difference are being properly and rightly celebrated, probably for the first time in our history.</P>
      <P>Is it not ironic that, at the same time, disability groups throughout the country are discovering, as a result of cuts in community employment schemes and a narrow attitude on the part of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the operation of such schemes, that services for people with disabilities will be closed down in the coming weeks and months. This is an extraordinary situation. In the interim, the Oireachtas is still awaiting the introduction of a rights-based disability Bill. This is more than ironic; it is nothing short of a disgrace.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the discussions at a European level in regard to the Fischler proposals on agricultural reform are still awaited. Even though it is not known when the talks will conclude, I request that the Leader ensure, in so far as is possible, that time will be set aside for the House to debate the outcome of the discussions, which are the cause of a great deal of concern.</P>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on the report of the National Economic and Social Forum to mark how far we have come on equality issues but also to outline how much remains to be done on that front.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the appropriate Minister or Ministers to come before the House for a detailed debate on the urgent matter of planning and, more specifically, to debate the appropriateness going forward of State funding for organisations, the integrity of which must be called into question? Members know to what I am alluding in this regard. I refer to the organisations which persist in implementing a policy that is obstructionist in nature. Bearing in mind that the State promotes urban and rural renewal, the approach of these organisations, which benefit from State funding, is unacceptable. There is a need for an urgent debate on this matter because action is needed.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Transport to come before the House for a debate on road tolling charges? At present, the Irish Road Haulage Association is boycotting the Drogheda bypass. Hauliers have justifiable grievances against high toll charges, which are a further burden on the industry in addition to high motor taxation, high fuel costs&mdash;</P>

      <P>The roads that are being improved by the Department of Transport are much the better for it. We have a huge number of bottlenecks in respect of which action must be taken. We must also provide facilities for hauliers. No matter where one goes in the EU, facilities are available every 30 kilometres or so for drivers to take breaks in the interests of health and safety. It is important that we debate this issue, particularly in terms of the lack of facilities for hauliers. It is also important&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support Senator MacSharry's call for a debate. I am aware that one State-funded organisation has objected to a &euro;40 million development in Sligo town. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>On Saturday morning last, a distressed parent came to me in regard to the high cost of motor insurance which has forced his son, daughter-in-law and grandchild to return to England. The young man, who has a good job, paid a premium of &euro;4,000 for his car insurance. He had a slight accident on a narrow road &ndash; it was a 50-50 situation. The insurance company settled the claim without his permission for &euro;1,000. That increased his insurance by &euro;3,500 in that year, despite the fact that the claim was only &euro;1,000. His premium is now &euro;7,500. Through the good offices of the Cathaoirleach, I request that somebody in the office of the Insurance Ombudsman be made directly responsible for dealing with what is happening to young people in relation to the cost of motor insurance.</P>

      <P>A Freeman of the city of Dublin, Aung San Suu Kyi, the democratically elected leader of the Burmese people, has been imprisoned in Burma for over a month by the military Government, although there is no charge or conviction against her. People in this country, especially the members of Burma Action Ireland, have expressed grave concern to me about her safety and, indeed, her health. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to write immediately to the military Government, expressing our concern about this lady? Also, I request a debate in this House, before the end of this session, on the abuse of human rights in Burma, an issue in which many in this country have taken great interest.</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on planning, particularly in so far as it relates to rural development. I am glad to note that South Tipperary County Council has not adopted its county development plan, having refused on two occasions to do so, because of the issues relating to restrictions on new houses in rural areas. I understand several other counties are doing likewise. I have also notified the counties concerned of the existence of a body in Britain, to which I referred previously and which has a particular section dealing with planning matters in Ireland, which it does not regard as a foreign country. I regard the situation as a very worrying one, on which a debate in this House could focus.</P>
      <P>I also refer to a matter I raised in the House two weeks ago &ndash; the reported possible closure of unit 88, the Irish language section of the Revenue Commissioners. As I mentioned on that occasion, it has been one of the bright lights in terms of recognition of this being a bilingual State. I am glad to report to the House that the closure will not now take place. There is also some better news in that I understand this particular service will now be extended to all the regional offices.</P>
      <P>I add that I greatly welcome the opening of a beautiful new gaelscoil in Tullamore yesterday. That is another good sign for the status of the Irish language, about which all of us should have a positive feeling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday and today, we have heard of two further broken promises from the Minister for Education and Science. Yesterday, we learned of cutbacks affecting 300 additional discretionary teacher posts throughout the country, affecting up to 700 schools. As a result, certain minority subjects will have to be withdrawn, with particular reference to physics and chemistry for leaving certificate. It is very difficult to reconcile this action by the Minister with his utter<Col N="1115" />ances in this House only a month ago, indicating his support for the sciences.</P>
      <P>The current withdrawal of support by the Minister will affect many small schools which, over the years, have fundraised to provide such subjects and eventually secured recognition from the Department. Yet, the Minister expects teachers, without any facilities, to introduce a new science curriculum at junior certificate level. I am not sure whether he is aware of the fact that, on the one hand, he is promoting science while, on the other hand, he is killing it off at another level. That is despite the encouragement he has got from IBEC, Forfás and the trade unions on the necessity of those subjects in education. Perhaps if the Leader were to approach the Minister, he might be favourably disposed towards reviewing his decision in this regard. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come into the House for a debate? </P>
      <P>It was announced today that St. Mary's school for girls with impaired vision would close. This means they will not have anywhere to continue their education in September. I know some girls with impaired vision from rural Ireland must travel to Belfast for residential education. We were promised a centre of excellence but the Minister for Education and Science has broken that promise. I ask him to come into the House and tell us about his two broken promises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible to arrange a debate in the House on fisheries? Perhaps the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources would come into the House for such a debate. He has been here on a number of occasions but it has always been in relation to communications matters. There is an urgent need for a debate on fisheries. A decision was taken in recent days on the doubling of charges at the five major fishing ports around the country. There is much difficulty in the industry following the renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy. The negotiations on the 50 mile box are ongoing. This is a difficult time for fishermen and their difficulties are compounded by these draconian increases in charges. It would be useful if we could have a debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I want two issues in relation to next year's local elections discussed in the House in the presence of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The first refers to the election turnout which, as we know, has been falling dramatically in recent years. The first time I stood in the local elections in 1985 almost 65% of the people voted. If current trends are anything to go by, the turnout next summer will probably be between 40% and 45%. All political parties must address this issue. We should consider the introduction of measures such as weekend or two day voting to stem the tide. This issue needs to be urgently addressed by the House and the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" />The second issue relates to electronic voting, the concept of which all political parties support. However, the system which has been introduced is open to question. As late as last month, a report was issued by a computer scientist in the National University of Ireland, Maynooth which highlighted the possibility of the system being open to abuse. We need to address these issues as a matter of urgency and have a debate on them with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ulick Burke's request for the Minister for Education and Science to come into the House to enlighten us about the two issues which seem to have caused confusion among the public. The first relates to St. Mary's school for visually impaired girls. We all agree that if such a facility was not available even for six pupils, as is the case currently, it would be unsatisfactory. However, my understanding from the Department and the media is that consultations are taking place between the Department and the authorities involved to put appropriate alternative arrangements in place. The order has confirmed publicly that the facilities and services will not be withdrawn pending the establishment of such facilities.</P>
      <P>As regards concessionary posts for curricular needs, does the Leader agree that the Minister has not broken any promises? The number of second level teachers has increased substantially from a low figure in 1997 to 25,500. The pupil-teacher ratio, for example, has decreased from 16 to 14 and is projected to be approximately 13.6 this year. This is happening at a time when pupil numbers at second level schools, particularly over the past seven years, have fallen dramatically.</P>

      <P>Three young men died last week in a car crash near where I live. Perhaps it is only when something happens close to one's home that one realises the huge tragedy of the road deaths we hear about on the radio every day. It is unlikely that we can solve this problem, but there are some things we can do. Would it be possible to bring the Minister responsible here for a debate on provisional driving licences? I have mentioned this many times before. Hundreds of thousands of those who are driving have never passed a test and there is a six-month wait for tests in many parts of the country. This is something we can grab hold of and deal with.</P>
      <P>The tragedy of the deaths of three young men is not unusual nowadays, although three deaths in one car is perhaps a little unusual. Every day since then we have read of more deaths on the road. We can do something about this. Let us make sure the Minister tells us what he intends to do.</P>

      <P>Before the Special Olympics began, I raised the issue of the many people who have disabilities. Those people were hoping that the Special Olympics would put the spotlight on them and it has. As Senator O'Meara said, the country really has risen to the occasion and this has focused attention on those with disabilities, but the Government must hang its head in shame over our treatment of them. Many of these people will be without services very shortly. The Minister should come here and explain why he is not delivering a service to those people. It is shaming for all of us, especially the Government.</P>

I hope the Minister for Transport will play a constructive role in organising a meeting with the IRHA immediately to prevent any future tragedies on the Slane-Drogheda route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Feargal Quinn about the recent tragic deaths in Dublin. I ask the Leader to pass on to the Minister for Transport a suggestion that he should consider using more radio advertisements to warn about the dangers of speeding. While TV advertisements are effective in a way, although they have been proven not to <Col N="1118" />reduce road deaths, cars do not have televisions. Most road deaths occur late at night. Constant radio advertisements reminding us to slow down and wear our seat belts while in the car might be more effective in reducing the incidence of death.</P>

      <P>I share the concerns of my colleagues regarding the tragic incident in which three young people were killed. I am not sure what we can do. Perhaps a debate on the matter would allow the House to contribute ideas, but I am at a loss. There has been a most scarifying series of advertisements on television and if that did not put people off, I do not know what will. Young people are like that, unfortunately. Particularly after an examination, they have a feeling of exuberance and exhilaration &ndash; they think they are indestructible and can do anything.</P>
      <P>I feel desperately sorry for the driver of that car. If I had been one of the people in that car I would prefer not to have survived, because the burden on that poor man, who is just starting his life, and his family will be so destructive. I support the call for a debate on this matter, but I am impoverished &ndash; I have nothing to offer. I cannot think of anything further that can be done, but perhaps some of my colleagues can.</P>
      <P>On the question of disabilities, as an Independent I believe it is important that we approach the issue in a constructive light. I am tired of people saying it is the Government's fault, the Government's responsibility. I prefer a more constructive approach. There is no question that one can criticise the Government, but the wonderful celebration of the Special Olympics provides an opportunity for the Government to review the situation in a positive light and give encouragement to people.</P>
      <P>We have all been moved by the Special Olympics, but what a contrast with the other Olympic Games, with its sleazy, wretched, money-driven, drug-crazed, power-mad context. That is what passes for the Olympic Games nowadays. Compare that with this wonderful celebration of the human spirit that is so totally different. We are lucky to have had this opportunity here and we have an Irish element in the creation of the games in Eunice Shriver, who is a member of the Kennedy family. We can be pleased about that.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes's comments about looking again at the question of same sex couples, but also everybody outside marriage, particularly because of a report produced by the National Economic and Social Forum, in the launch of which I will be taking part tomorrow. It is important, a Chathaoirligh, and a good reason for having a debate, as this is an independent, non-partisan body clearly calling for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a debate in the House, and in the Leader of the House we have somebody who introduced the first item, which is often forgotten, of non-discrimination, in the protocol that went right through the health service before the crimi<Col N="1119" />nal law was changed. For that reason it would be appropriate if we had another debate, if possible, and perhaps facilitate the introduction of a domestic partnership Bill through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, talked about the NESF report, which is to be issued tomorrow, relating to the rights of cohabiting couples, including same sex couples. We have come far when a body like the NESF can issue such a report and have it debated. That is good, open and promising. One of the earlier debates on this issue took place in this House in Private Members' time on a motion put forward by the Independent Group. It was a very responsible, calm and interesting debate. We will see after the publication of the report when we can have a further debate.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the issue of people sending back their benchmarking money. We did not get it yet. A person debating on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; stated that it was not benchmarking that was at issue, rather that he was redistributing the money due to him on relinquishing his county council seat while remaining a Deputy. I did not hear of anybody sending it back, but since we have not received the money it would be hard to do so. We rely on Senator O'Toole to ensure that it comes. We have always acknowledged that the money was indeed &ldquo;hard fought for&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Senator also made a good point in asking all of us in view of our benchmarking to look seriously at Seanad reform and the necessary changes, which will not always be very comfortable, in the Senator's words. I hope that is the way the issue will be treated.</P>
      <P>The issue of retired teachers being paid on a fortnightly rather than a monthly basis and allowing them to plan their incomes in a better fashion is very important and could be brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Meara that the way people responded to the Special Olympics was an affirmation of everything that was right in the world and presented the most marvellous and inspirational spectacle, which includes listening on a daily basis to the progress of the athletes. Senator O'Meara states that a disability Bill, based on a rights principle, should be introduced. I understand that the relevant Minister is working hard on that matter. Speaking on behalf of the Government parties, I can say that while a lot has been done, much more remains to be done. There will never be a perfect world in which every wrong can be righted, but I agree with the Senator that there is more to do.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara also requested a debate on agriculture, which is very important. However, we should wait until final agreement has been reached on the Fischler proposals before engaging in such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators MacSharry and Scanlon raised the issue of planning, in respect of which several Senators sought a debate. Such a debate had been <Col N="1120" />scheduled but, unfortunately, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, was in hospital for ten days with a back injury. I will arrange time for such a debate. I take the Senator's point about organisations which are in receipt of State support and which, in turn, are stopping major and important urban developments.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon has a difficulty with the cost of road tolls. I understand that all of the new major roads will be tolled, which is the way of the future. As Senator Browne said, I wish that the Irish Road Haulage Association would halt its boycott of the Drogheda bypass because its members are using a very dangerous bridge on an alternative route. The bypass has improved matters to a great extent.</P>
    <P>Senator Scanlon referred to a &euro;4,000 insurance premium for a young driver, which is exorbitant. Insurance costs for young drivers and small businesses are retarding progress because people cannot afford to pay them. The Tánaiste is working hard on these issues but, given the horrific tale outlined by the Senator, progress cannot come soon enough.</P>
    <P>As Senator Henry correctly pointed out, the freedom of the City of Dublin has been granted to the leader of the opposition in Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi. I will be glad to raise the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The measures being taken against Aung San Suu Kyi appear to have become more repressive, including the type of surveillance to which she has been subjected.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú mentioned rural development planning and I am delighted that his campaign for unit 88 in the Revenue has been accepted. I note also the Senator's point in respect of the gaelscoil in Tullamore.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the withdrawal of discretionary posts. As Senators who worked in the teaching profession are aware, there is a good appeals mechanism for such posts at second level. Most cases are dealt with fairly, as Senator Fitzgerald said. I take Senator Ulick Burke's point about the science subjects because physics and chemistry should be part of the school curriculum in a modern country such as ours, although there has been a falling off in the number of students studying them.</P>
    <P>Senator Brady mentioned the school for girls with impaired vision, which is a matter for discussion between the relevant authorities and the Rosminians, who are coming to an arrangement about the girls' education. While the number of girls involved is small, it is important that they should receive a proper education and I am sure that adequate arrangements will be made in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Kenneally requested a debate on fisheries following the introduction of charges at all major ports. It is over a decade since there was a change in such charges and, like everything else, they have to be revised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" />As Senator Bradford said, it would be worthwhile dealing on a cross-party basis with the subjects of voter turnout and electronic voting. They are matters which affect all of us. Voter turnout is declining everywhere, including the United Kingdom, the United States and Ireland. A new group headed by Mr. David Begg which will examine various aspects of our democracy held an interesting meeting in the Oak Room in the Mansion House earlier. One of its aims is to increase voter turnout.</P>
    <P>I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government whether his Department has produced a definitive report on the flaws, failings and good points of the electronic voting system. Under our system, one presses a button and a vote is cast. We gave out about the long count prior to the election of President Bush but there was a way to check the result the later. I will try to fit in a debate on this.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald also referred to St. Mary's school and discretionary teaching posts, while Senator Quinn raised the deaths of three young men last week and asked what were the Minister for Transport's plans to deal with the number of provisional driving licence holders. There was a great deal of debate about this issue but it has died down. The number of provisional licence holders is huge and it would be a major task to put a shape on it. However, a number of fatalities involve provisional drivers.</P>
    <P>Senator Brady mentioned the discussions relating to visually impaired girls at St. Mary's school. I hope they come to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>While Senators Terry and O'Meara praised the great attention being paid to people with disabilities, Senator Terry highlighted the loss of jobs on community employment schemes for such people. That is one area in which schemes cannot be cut back. The administrators of community employment are trying to do this but everybody says the arts and the maintenance of parks are important. However, those who care for people with disabilities in a particularly intimate way as personal assistants are the most important. I will establish how the schemes can be streamlined in order that they can be kept in employment.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne called for a debate on tolling. I agree that the Irish Road Haulage Association should call off its boycott. Road deaths take place mostly at night. It might be worth examining the possibility of broadcasting radio advertisements about speeding regularly.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris was constructive in his comments on disability. He is correct that the issue is significant. Families of people with disabilities have highlighted this because they are so open, involved and constructive themselves. It is a wonderful lesson to everybody. The Senator supported the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on the NESF report following its publication tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after line 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) Protocol No. 13 to the Convention concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances, done at Vilnius on the 3rd day of May, 2002;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment was also discussed on Committee Stage. I have tabled it again because, as Protocol No. 13 will come into force in less than two weeks &ndash; on 1 July &ndash; it should be incorporated in the legislation. I have read the report of the Committee Stage debate and I cannot understand the Government's reasoning in not including Protocol No. 13 at this stage because it will come into effect and is similar to what is contained in the Constitution. Protocol No. 6 will be superseded by Protocol No. 13, which is stronger and absolutely prohibits the death penalty.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments. I hope he has reconsidered the position since Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to explain in any greater detail the reason the Government cannot accede to this amendment. The matter was explored in some detail in the Lower House and on Committee Stage in this House. The primary issue is that it is not the practice to include a reference in legislation of this type &ndash; that is, a Bill which proposes to give effect to rights &ndash; to an international instrument which will come into force at a future date. The protocol in question will not come into force until 1 July next but in all probability the Bill will be signed by the President before that date. We would have to incorporate in the legislation a reference to a contingency &ndash; a highly probable contingency, I agree &ndash; were we to follow the route proposed by the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The death penalty has long since been abandoned by the State. It was finally abolished in statute law in the Criminal Justice Act 1990 and had not been used since 1954. The passing of the 1990 Act fulfilled our obligations under Protocol No. 6 which extended the protection of life pro<Col N="1123" />vided for in Article 32 of the convention in that it expressly abolished the death penalty in peacetime and created an enforceable right not to be condemned to death or executed.</P>
    <P>Protocol No. 6, the predecessor of the protocol referred to in the Senator's amendment, allows for derogation in time of war or imminent threat of war. We ratified the protocol on 24 June 1994. Under the 1990 Act, the State was in a position to ratify the second optional protocol to the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which also abolished the death penalty but allowed for a reservation in time of war. At the time of ratification of that particular international treaty the Government declined to avail of this qualification.</P>
    <P>The statutory changes effected by the 1990 Act were not reflected in the Constitution. Without a constitutional prohibition, the Oireachtas could have reintroduced the death penalty by statute in circumstances allowed for in Protocol No. 6, for example, in time of war. The Government could also have invoked the procedure under Article 28.3.3º of the Constitution to proclaim a public emergency and use the emergency provision to provide cover for the utilisation of the death penalty. The last Government submitted the Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution Bill to the people in 2001. It was approved by the people in a referendum as a result of which there is now full constitutional protection for the right to life and protection against the death penalty written into the Constitution. The death penalty cannot be reintroduced at any stage because the public emergency clause in our constitutional arrangement was also amended.</P>
    <P>State practice now conforms entirely with UN practice and best international practice in this respect. It goes beyond UN practice and conforms to Protocol No. 13. Therefore, it is not strictly necessary to add this protocol to the Bill. The people have entrenched its substance in the Constitution. In practical terms, it is difficult to see what the amendment would add to the substantive provisions of the Bill. Having said that, I appreciate the Senator's motivation in tabling it. It is regrettable that because of the legal drafting tradition we do not anticipate future contingencies and the Government does not think possible to incorporate proposals in legislation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is now a totally abolitionist State in relation to the death penalty and our constitutional provision which can only be amended by the people goes beyond UN practice and is fully in line with best up-to-date European practice. I doubt if many other European states have such a record in their parliaments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 19, after &ldquo;exercised&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall include any person or body certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature, but in relation to a particular act, such a person or body shall not be an organ of state if the nature of the act is private&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was tabled by Senator Henry on Committee Stage. There are a number of similar amendments. The purpose of the amendment is to encompass in the legislation bodies such as schools and hospitals. I know there is an argument that some of these are private. In reply to this amendment on the previous Stage the Minister of State said:</P>
      <P>If one examines the issue of hospitals, one sees that a health board is a body established by law under the definition provided by the Act. In the case of a private hospital, other considerations would apply.</P>
      <P>However, these other considerations are not spelled out by the Minister of State who makes a kind of logical jump to say it is not possible or very difficult in legislation to construct a list. We have had this argument before. However, that was not my intention or that of Senator Henry. We want to extend the definition in these very clear circumstances and deliberately avoided any suggestion of a list in the amendment. There is a suggestion of making the test more inclusive in terms of human rights.</P>
      <P>What exactly is a private hospital and what is so special about it? What are the rights of patients in a private hospital? Are they not at least the same as those of patients in a State hospital? Is the Minister of State contemplating turning a blind eye to violations of the European convention if they occur in private hospitals or schools as opposed to State hospitals and schools? It is worth asking this question. If I recall correctly, the Minister of State also said we were perhaps blurring the focus by including two standards. If it is necessary, let us have two. They are not necessarily two standards but if that is the case, so what? If it protects the rights of the citizen, I do not care if we have six standards. I am not interested in the technical problems that may be created for courts but the protection of the rights of the individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State may well be able to come up with an answer. An answer is required as to the reason, if this is the case, as it seems to an ordinary person such as me, patients in a so-called private hospital or students attending a private school as opposed to a public school <Col N="1125" />should have less rights and the European convention should not come into operation.</P>
    <P>We now live in quite a sophisticated society. Perhaps we need this double focus because the degree to which institutions within the State are genuinely private is quite different from what it would have been in the Victorian era. There is a whole network of supports within the State in which private hospitals and schools participate. It is astonishing that a proportion of schools and hospitals should appear to be exempt from the operations of the Bill, even though we know these are two of the prime locations for abuse of the rights of the vulnerable. It seems to be more than ever necessary for these rights to be protected.</P>
    <P>It may be irritating for these amendments to be tabled again but this is done in the light of further thought on the matter and the desire to get further information from the Minister of State. There are some amendments in my name, tabled just because I did not call a vote the last time and in the hope of a deathbed conversion by the Government, which upon reflection will eventually see sense. On a number of these issues, it has changed its mind, having more or less indicated during the Dáil debate that it would make a change. Although it then had a kind of hiccough, perhaps a reversion is possible. I have asked a number of questions and will not go on at any greater length. I would be grateful if the Minister of State replied to those specific questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment and thank Senator Norris for tabling it again. I was more concerned after the reply from the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to my amendment which was worded the same as this one on Committee Stage. In this country we have a long tradition of private institutions carrying out functions for the State. As I pointed out when we had this debate on Committee Stage, I was not looking for the Minister of State to make some sort of list now because, unfortunately, we have ended up with one from the Laffoy commission where private institutions which were carrying out functions for the State had to be investigated. I strongly believe this amendment should be accepted.</P>
      <P>I was particularly anxious about the reference to private hospitals and how they would be different. Even as we speak, under the national treatment purchase scheme, we are paying private hospitals to carry out work on public patients. They should not be treated under a different regime to public patients within public hospitals. I am more anxious now than I was after hearing the Minister of State's replies on Committee Stage because of our long tradition of private institutions carrying out work for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On numerous occasions it has gone badly wrong and now the State is paying for public patients to be treated in private hospitals &ndash; it is not as though they have wished themselves into this situation. The State has purchased the treat<Col N="1126" />ment for them, yet apparently they will not be covered by the same legislation as public patients being treated in a public hospital. I require no deathbed conversion; I wish the Government good health and hope the amendment will be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>How well we know it. Here we have no abiding city.</P>
      <P>When considering this amendment, we must start with the European Convention on Human Rights. The fundamental principle, common to the legal tradition of all member states &ndash; more markedly to those of a civil than a common law tradition &ndash; is the distinction between public and private law. In this provision of the Bill the Minister is trying to grapple with that fundamental distinction between matters which pertain primarily to private disputes between parties, be they corporate or individual, and public law, which lies in the public domain. When the convention was adopted, it was always intended by the high contracting parties that it was an instrument of public law that regulated on the international plane the relationship between the contracting states and their individual citizens.</P>
      <P>The heart of the Bill is section 3 which obliges the organs of the State to perform their functions in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention provisions and creates a remedy in damages where there is a contravention and no other remedy for damages. While I do not want to anticipate further discussion, I am certain we will be arguing whether that was the appropriate mode of implementation. However, that is the appropriate mode for the purposes of this discussion.</P>
      <P>Given that this is the case &ndash; this issue would arise on any mode of implementation &ndash; a distinction must be drawn between that which clearly lies in the public realm, that is, in the realm of the State and its relation with its citizens, and in the private realm, that is, a dispute between private individuals. It is not intended to incorporate the convention for the purposes of creating individual rights in private disputes between citizens. Therefore, some standard, rubric or definition must be provided to guide the courts. The decision of the Government is that the concept of the &ldquo;organ of the State&rdquo;, which interestingly for the purposes of the Bill is different from the purposes of an organ of the State in the Constitution, should be the talisman used for the purpose of making that distinction.</P>
      <P>The definition section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;organ of the State&rdquo; includes a tribunal or any other body (other than the President or the Oireachtas or either House of the Oireachtas <Col N="1127" />or a Committee of either such House or a Joint Committee of both such Houses or a court) which is established by law or through which any of the legislative, executive or judicial powers of the State are exercised.</P>
    <P>Once there is, therefore, an establishment by law or an exercise of any of those powers of the State, other than by those designated bodies, then there is a public body which is subject to the conventional rules. That is the way it is laid out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Senators are proposing in the amendment to introduce a super-added requirement or standard which, in my view, would only confuse the issue before the courts. Under the amendment, the courts would be obliged to consider &ldquo;any person or body certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature, but in relation to a particular act, such a person or body shall not be an organ of state if the nature of the act is private.&rdquo; In this amendment, a similar attempt is assayed to provide a standard whereby we delimit what is the public sphere from the private sphere.</P>
    <P>The courts will be left with the difficulty of interpretation to which I refer in particular contexts. In the context of our domestic law and judicial review proceedings, the issue has always arisen about whether university disciplinary tribunals and the Turf Club have a sufficient public character to be amenable to judicial review proceedings or whether they are, essentially, of a private character. A court looking at this question, under this particular Bill, will have to decide whether the body is established by law. The latter will capture a great range of bodies.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to private hospitals. Many private hospitals in this State are established by law, be it in the form of public or private Acts passed by the current or previous Parliaments.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to schools, a great many of which are also established by law. With the Education Act, the legal recognition of schools is now considerable. The idea, therefore, that somehow, by this definition, schools and hospitals are entirely outside the scope of the Act is simply not correct. I do not want to anticipate anything the courts will decide, but, as I said on Committee Stage, it is difficult to provide an exhaustive list on a subject of this kind.</P>
    <P>What has been provided in the Government proposal is a definite standard, based on the organ of State. I conceded in committee &ndash; perhaps in jurisprudential curiosity &ndash; that the idea of the organ of State in the Bill is not the same as an organ of State under the Constitution; it is a different definition because some of the higher constitutional organs have been expressly excluded for other reasons, about which, perhaps, I anticipate we might have another discussion.</P>
    <P>On this definition, the substance of the amendment tabled by Senators Norris and O'Toole is incorporated in the proposal before the House and that to introduce the alternative standard of &ldquo;such a person or body shall not be an organ of <Col N="1128" />state if the nature of the act is private&rdquo; would only to add to the confusion. That, essentially, is my case on this amendment, although I do accept that it is designed to elucidate this issue of where one draws the boundary line.</P>
    <P>This is an issue which, ultimately, we must leave to the courts as an exercise of interpretation, given the large and variegated number of bodies concerned. However, to reply to Senator Henry, I do not accept the proposition that schools and hospitals, as such, are excluded from the scope of the Act simply because of the expression used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator rightly traced the very varied history of many of these institutions. That history concluded in recent decades with an increasing assimilation to the State and to the public sphere, but it is difficult to say with legal certitude in the case of any of these entities. The health boards and all the hospitals within them are clearly established by law, but the voluntary hospitals were established by enactments over many decades and, on one view of the matter, are established by law.</P>
      <P>The question then of a pure hospital established under the Companies Act, as would be the case with some modern private hospitals, would again raise issues of interpretation as to whether incorporation under the Companies Act would constitute being established by law for the purposes of the Act. Without anticipating what might be decided, that might well turn on the amount of public funding which was committed to these institutions. They are questions of degree on which a court would have to make a judgment in the case of the application of the convention proceedings in a concrete case and it would be difficult for us to legislate by anticipation for all the different kinds of cases which might emerge.</P>

      <P>There may have been some confusion because Senator Henry put the amendment down originally. We all got the same list of amendments and then she teased the matter out with the Minister of State, who may have assumed that she was the proposer. It is some<Col N="1129" />what confusing, a little like the difference between public and private functions, organs, etc.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State seemed to suggest that even what we think of as private institutions, when carrying out a public function, may already be covered by this legislation and that any institution established by law is automatically covered. Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of organ of State includes any body which is established by law. I went through the various implications of that with the Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That certainly makes it broader than we assumed because one of the problems we were thinking about is private hospitals &ndash; which have an excellent record &ndash; such as the Blackrock Clinic. What was concerning those of us on this side of the argument was that groups such as those to which I refer might be outside the operation of the law. However, it seems that the Minister of State's position is that they are very clearly within it or at least that there is a strong possibility that the courts might interpret this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to the courts to make those interpretations. I do not want to be giving an interpretation in advance of a concrete adjudication. I raised the issue about the hospitals and I gave the example that many of the older voluntary hospitals clearly had a foundation in statute. Where some of the newer private hospitals are established by companies under the Companies Act, I suspect an issue would arise as to whether incorporation under that Act was sufficient to amount to something being established by law within the meaning of the statute, whether that was an essentially private or public exercise. I suggested that that it might well turn on the issue of how much public funds were committed to the institution in question. That is speculation.</P>
      <P>Our difficulty is that there is a very long list of bodies which carry out mixed private and public functions. We are trying to provide a standard based on established by law or performing executive, legislative or judicial functions of the State and, on that basis, the courts will have to make a call on whether the body falls within. The alternative for us was to formulate an exhaustive list, which would be difficult to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do understand the Minister of State's difficulty in terms of lists. We have had this problem on a number of legislative proposals over the years. I understand that to do so is technically difficult and usually a waste of time. That is why we were trying to frame something which did not involve the list system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I may tease this out a little further, the kind of institutions about which people would be concerned would be, for example, institutions which already have a fair degree of exemption because they have been exempted by this Government and by the proposals of the previous coalition <Col N="1130" />Government, which included the Labour Party, from the operation of legislation such as the Equality Act.</P>
    <P>I refer to institutions of which, for example, the Roman Catholic Church would be the proprietor. Does the Minister of State imagine that Catholic schools and institutions will be taken in? Are they private or public? They are certainly treated as private in terms of much of the equality legislation and they are excluded. It has always seemed extraordinary to me that a Christian organisation full of brotherly love, tolerance, etc., should want to get out of provisions on equality and fairness in employment, etc. Are they excluded or will they be included here, in the Minister of State's opinion?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State obviously cannot give a clearer reply. This is because they did not go down the proper way. They did not do the legislative incorporation, which every legal body told them they should. They chose the worst of the three options and everybody told them. I will not, therefore, apologise for the tangle we may be in this afternoon. It is all of the Government's own making. If we get tied up in knots here and if we are a little tiresome, all I can say is that this is the price.</P>
    <P>In terms of public and private, I return to the Bible which states that by their fruits shall ye know them. One can tell what is a public or a private body by the behaviour in which it engages. Such bodies can be a mixture. They can on one occasion be exercising a public function and on others be exercising a private function.</P>
    <P>I want to echo what I said on the previous occasion. I am absolutely delighted with the Minister of State's acknowledgement that an organ of the State is not an organ of the State for the purpose of this Bill. That is just wonderful. If he carries on like this, we could cure disease by saying that cancer is not a disease in the meaning of this Bill and we could cure thousands of people all over Ireland. It is a marvellous way to behave, saying that something that is fact is not fact for the purposes of this Bill. I love it; it is surreal.</P>
    <P>It also raises the question, however, of whether this is constitutional. If a thing is defined in the Constitution in a certain way and then we give a different definition in a legislative proposal, does that impugn the constitutionality of the legislation? I do not know. It is a technical question and I am not sure if the Minister of State and his advisers will have an answer at hand. If they have, I would be very glad to hear it because it seems that where there is a conflict between the Constitution and the law, the Constitution wins. I would regard that as obvious. In particular, the Irish version of the Constitution wins. We have the supreme legislative document which is the Constitution of Ireland. I do not know if this causes a problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is correct. The Constitution has supremacy in relation to the particular Bill and, upon enactment, over this legis<Col N="1131" />lation and there is no question about that. A wider question could conceivably arise where the court in Strasbourg decided that a provision of the Constitution itself was in contravention of the European Convention and that would be a horrible vista for any Irish Parliament to contemplate. Happily, it has not happened yet. There is a substantial degree of convergence between the rights conferred by Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution of Ireland and the rights recognised in the convention.</P>
      <P>On the question of the schools, the Senator will be aware of the position of the universities which now rests on statute, but that one particular university, the University of Dublin, which the Senator represents here in the Oireachtas, took umbrage at the course adopted and decided that to preserve its essentially private character, it would promote a Private Bill through these Houses to regularise its position in relation to that legislation. That is a very practical illustration of the difficulty the courts will be confronted with in determining whether an act is essentially public or private in character.</P>
      <P>Likewise regarding the first and second level schools, not all of them are established by law &ndash; far from it &ndash; but they have been recognised by law for many years. The recognition in the Education Act 1998 is more comprehensive than any previous recognition, although that Act still has written into it another biblical maxim which the Senator did not refer to: &ldquo;Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God that which is God's&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>These are very technical amendments, as the Senator rightly acknowledges. They relate to the doctrine of judicial notice, which is that branch of the law of evidence that says to the court: &ldquo;What can we know without having to have it proved before us?&rdquo;. For example, the Act of the Oireachtas has to be proved by simply handing in a Stationery Office copy. There are many wonderful branches of the law about whether judges should know the different types of animal that are in a zoo, for example, or whether Seanad Éireann has 60 Members or whether the boundary of County Louth begins at Carrickallan when one crosses the land frontier from Northern Ireland. In the present context, our legal advice is that the phrase used in the subsections concerned &ndash; I know there are some cognate amendments tabled by Senator Norris in respect of it &ndash; is the correct way of putting this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister was receptive in the other House to looking at this issue again, but having discussed the matter with the Attorney General, the legal advice was strongly that the words which the amendments seek to delete should remain in all three subsections and that they provide a greater accuracy in relation to the matters of which a court should take notice, namely that the court had jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>We propose this amendment to delete subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) of section 5. If there is a declaration of incompatibility by the courts, this subsection would seem to reinstate the validity of the provision being ruled incompatible by the court. The section is not necessary and my colleague, Senator Ryan, made a very strong argument against it. It implies that even though the provision has been ruled invalid, the State could continue to use the provision or the law concerned. This subsection is an overstatement of the position and is not necessary in the legislation. I ask the Minister of State for his comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Tuffy has raised a very interesting question about the operation of this legislation. The core provision is section 5(1) which gives the High Court or, on appeal, the Supreme Court, the power to make a declaration of incompatibility between a statutory provision or rule of law &ndash; I presume a rule of law would relate to a rule of common law &ndash; that it is incompatible with the State's obligations under the convention's obligations. It is an interesting issue as to what would happen regarding a rule of law, whether the court's decision, of itself, would be sufficient there or whether the Oireachtas would have an obligation to follow that through with legislation.</P>
      <P>The second subsection to which the Senator has drawn attention provides some degree of protection for the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the statutory provision or rule of law in respect of which it is made. The declaration of incompatibility is a declaration by the courts that a provision of our law, though perfectly valid and subsisting legally and constitutionally, is at variance with the convention. In other words, the litigant no longer has to travel to Strasbourg. He or she can establish, before the courts established under our Constitution, that a particular law passed under our Constitution is at variance with the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the constitutional position of the Oireachtas is to mean what the Constitution says it means, how is it possible to say or to maintain that an Act of the Oireachtas which has been complied with is now inoperable and repealed and that damages can be awarded because an organ of the <Col N="1134" />State acted precisely in accordance with its provisions? How can one say to a health board, a local authority, the Garda Síochána or the Director of Public Prosecutions that it did nothing wrong and carried out its responsibilities in conformity with the wishes of the Oireachtas as expressed in legislation, but that it is now liable in damages? Can one say that the body in question is not protected and its acts have no continuing validity because a right under the convention, which does not have the force of law in the State, has been breached? This legislation provides for the declaration of incompatibility to be submitted and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so that the Oireachtas can take the necessary steps to cure the legislative breach that has been established.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, for constitutional reasons, that the primacy of the national provision had to remain in force. The position is that the <i>status quo ante</i>&ndash; the legal state of affairs &ndash; will apply. When the declaration has been made, the Government has to consider, as a matter of priority, what has to be done in light of the commitments in the convention about the application of the right which has been infringed. The undertaking by the Government to secure the rights of citizens against the obligation provides an effective remedy within our constitutional framework. Clearly, a breach of international law is established once the court makes the declaration and the Government must cure the breach. It is going too far in relation to this measure, in my respectful view, to say that there is an immediate exposure in damages and liability to the State itself because of that breach of our international obligations established before our courts.</P>

      <P>A similar amendment to amendment No. 8 was discussed on Committee Stage. This amendment has been tabled because the Labour Party believes that the Bill, as it stands, is not workable. The Taoiseach might not come into physical possession of a copy of an order containing a declaration of incompatibility within 21 days of the making of the order by the judge, as it would have to be perfected, etc. It would not be possible for him to carry out the requirements of the legislation in such circumstances. This amendment will allow for the physical drawing up and perfection of the order to have taken place, subject to the rules provided for this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" />The amendment has not been proposed to cause a delay in informing the House.

I said I would bring the matter to the attention of the committee. I still believe that is the best way to deal with this issue. I do not believe we should clutter up legislation with procedural matters which should more properly and appropriately be dealt with in the rules of court, which provide for the implementation of the legislation before the courts.</P>

It can take six weeks for an order to be drawn up and perfected. The purpose of this amendment is not to include unnecessary procedures in this section, but to make it workable.</P>

      <P>It is important for the Senator to know that under this legislation, the Attorney General, the legal adviser to the Government, and the Human Rights Commission must be given notice of proceedings in accordance with the rules of court that will have to be made following the enactment of this Bill. Upon enactment, the rules of court, which are statutory instruments adopted under the courts and justice legislation, will have to have specific provision to regulate the operation of this legislation. The Attorney General has the right to appear at and to become a party to proceedings.</P>
      <P>As the Senator pointed out, certain obligations regarding the laying of copies of the declaration before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days are placed on the Taoiseach under section 5(3) of the Bill, when a declaration is made. The inclusion in the Bill of a provision along the lines of this amendment would involve a level of detail not required in a Bill. I will undertake to bring the Senator's views on this matter to the attention of the rules committee so that an appropriate provision can be made in the rules of court, if it is deemed necessary to do so.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 30 and 31 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Where as a result of an incompatibility between a statutory provision or rule of law and a Convention provision, or a failure to act in a manner compatible with a Convention provision, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence in circumstances where but for the incompatibility or failure the person would not have been so convicted, or would have been sentenced to a lesser penalty, the person the subject of such conviction or sentence may apply to the Minister pursuant to this section for a recommendation to the Government that the Government should advise the President to pardon the person concerned, or alternatively for a recommendation that the conviction or penalty be commuted or remitted, and the Minister may following such inquiries if any as in his or her discretion he or she sees fit to make, make such a recommendation.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed at length on Committee Stage. The Labour Party feels it contains an important principle, that a person who is convicted wrongly should be able to have the conviction overturned in some way. The proposed new clause states that &ldquo;the person the subject of such conviction or sentence may apply to the Minister pursuant to this section for a recommendation to the Government that the Government should advise the President to pardon the person concerned&rdquo;. We all know of cases of people who have been convicted wrongly. While compensation is an important aspect of such cases, we should also consider the way in which the fact of having been convicted attaches to one's reputation. I am interested in the principle. There should be a system of revisiting criminal convictions in such cases.</P>
      <P>Other matters, such as whether there is a statutory precedent in other legislation, were discussed when this amendment was brought forward by my Labour colleagues. A precedent for such an amendment exists in the Criminal Procedure Act 1993. I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's comments on this proposal.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. It addresses one of the most serious issues in the Bill which has not been rectified, even though the Minister said he would re-examine it when Deputy Costello raised it in the Dáil. There are real problems of incompatibility between the convention and the legislation in the case of persons who have been convicted. Deputy Costello pointed out that convictions can stand in the way of persons who wish to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" />We have all seen the mess that exists for many people who have tried to travel to the United States since the twin towers disaster of September 2001. I am sure the Minister of State will have read in the newspapers about a lady who was resident in the US for 30 years and whose husband and family live there at present. She has not been allowed to return to the US for the past seven months, since she came to Ireland for a wedding, apparently because her US residency papers are not in order. It is not as if this issue will not have practical significance for people. It seems wrong that people should be unable to get redress, through no fault of their own, because this Bill only allows for <i>ex gratia</i> monetary remedies.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to ask that these people should have redress and the right to a re-trial, if that is necessary. Presidential pardons are all very well, but they depend on the President. I am quite sure that our President would be a person of great compassion and charity who would want to rectify everything she possibly could. Do presidential pardons exist in the United States of America? What is the general view in regard to this area? The current regime certainly has some peculiar views on justice.</P>

People have been refused visas for various reasons and it would be dreadful if a person were wrongly convicted and that, due to incompatibility, there was no possibility for them to have a re-trial. Something must be done to allow such cases to be properly treated. The problem with the Bill is that there are no remedies for a vast array of circumstances.</P>

That is the net point which these amendments seek to address. The question of payments, be they <i>ex gratia</i> or otherwise, does not arise under these amendments. What does arise, however, is what happens if one has a valid conviction in Irish law which is nevertheless found to be incompatible with the system of the convention. The person so convicted has stains on his or her character and a conviction which is at variance with the provisions of the convention.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to address the issue through the introduction of a statutory provision in regard to the power of the President to pardon an individual on the advice of the Government. If one examines the text of the amendment, however, it is clear that all it proposes is that someone can write to a Minister. I do not have to remind Members of either House that one can always write to a Minister. There is not much point in providing for that by way of statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" />The amendment proposes nothing that is not already part of existing practice, despite the fact that quite a few words were spent in formulating it. I have to assume that Senator Tuffy and the draftsman are only too well aware that the power of pardon is vested exclusively in, and may only be exercised by, the President, strictly on the advice of the Government. That procedure is written into the Constitution. As a result of that constitutional provision, the House could not initiate legislation which would provide for the establishment of a board to advise the President or the Government in regard to this issue. The advice must be received by the President from the Government. There is very little we can do to hedge about that basic provision.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, however, that if it was established that a person was wrongfully convicted in breach of the European convention, the Government would make such a recommendation to the President. It is surplusage to provide in the legislation that a person can write a letter to a Minister in order to make a recommendation to the Government. While I understand the spirit in which the amendment is tabled, it is unnecessary in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11, which is taken with amendment No. 9 and which seeks to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal, is far more in point. While it is one which is fairly tabled, a great deal more consideration would have to be given to its drafting to ensure that the character of the amendment corresponds exactly with the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the jurisdiction established in that court under the Courts of Justice legislation.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage, a case is pending before the Supreme Court on this issue at present. As I understand it, the provision under Irish statute law was deemed to be constitutional, but a subsequent decision in Strasbourg deemed the Irish provision to be at variance with the convention. There is a conviction at issue in the precise circumstances canvassed by the Senators. That entire matter is before the Supreme Court where it will, no doubt, be decided upon in due course. The Minister would prefer to leave the matter until the Supreme Court clarifies the legal position because this will facilitate the drafting of legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) In relation to any declaration of incompatibility, the Court may grant such other non-monetary relief or remedy, or make such order, within its powers as it considers just and appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us back to the issue of non-monetary relief or remedy, which is so important in this legislation. On Committee Stage, I thanked the <Col N="1139" />Law Society and the Bar Council for the great deal of work they put into considering the Bill and briefing me on it. I also wish to thank the library staff, who managed to provide everything I sought from them.</P>
    <P>While I did not go through every case lost by Ireland before the European Court of Human Rights, I was particularly struck by the most recent &ndash; DG <i>v</i>. Ireland. The case in question related to a young man who had been incarcerated in St. Patrick's Institution in Mountjoy even though the High Court judge had serious misgivings about doing so because the individual was a minor. On appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, it was found that the child's rights had been violated.</P>
    <P>I presume that people who bring cases under this legislation will be granted free legal aid as they fall into that category in other contexts. It is fine to take a case before a lesser court of law where the proceedings will not be overly expensive, but once the action moves to the High Court it can be extremely expensive. If an individual is trying to argue a declaration of incompatibility in the High Court, regardless of whether there is an immediate prospect of personal benefit, I would certainly hope that he or she would have the benefit of free legal aid. It is extremely important that we would ensure it is available in regard to these important points of convention law. I am taking it that this is the position, but I would be grateful if the Minister of State would clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>To return to the case DG <i>v</i>. Ireland, what is being proposed by the Minister does not provide any remedy for this person. As I argued on Committee Stage, the convention states that remedies are not discretionary, yet in the legislation before us the only monetary remedy is discretionary. That is most unsatisfactory. The young man to whom I refer eventually got his costs and &euro;5,000 which, of course, did nothing for him. Due to the current state of affairs in respect of suitable accommodation for such people, the monetary remedy will not do any good for anyone who finds themselves in a similar position. It will not prove beneficial for judges, who &ndash; as the Minister of State knows better than I &ndash; are sometimes at their wits' end trying to find places of accommodation for difficult cases such as this.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the individual in the case DG <i>v</i>. Ireland had been in the care of the State since he was two, so it was not as though the State had not had a great involvement in his upbringing, which was, obviously, entirely unsatisfactory. A person like that will not have any remedy at all, which is why the amendment contains a reference to non-monetary relief or remedies.</P>

      <P>Senator Henry is under a misapprehension on one specific point &ndash; that there is an intention in the proposal before the House to reverse the DG case, either in substance or as to procedure. The proceedings in the DG case were taken to Strasbourg where the State was found to be in breach of the European convention and an award of damages and costs made, with which the State is in the course of complying. There is nothing in the legislation which takes away from this. What it actually addresses is the quite distinct question as to whether the establishment of a breach or a declaration of incompatibility in Irish law gives rise to a claim for damages in Irish law, in addition to the claim for damages under the Strasbourg system. The Government's proposal is to exclude the possibility of a right for damages in those circumstances following on a declaration of incompatibility.</P>
      <P>The Government's view, on the basis of the legal advice available to it, is that the measure of damages in such a case is primarily a matter for the European convention system &ndash; it is the court in Strasbourg which decides the level of damages to which one is entitled in the event of a breach or a declaration of incompatibility between domestic legislation and the European convention system.</P>
      <P>On the basis of what Senator Henry is advocating, the result of this amendment would be that, say, in the DG case, the Irish courts could also award damages, quite apart from the Strasbourg court. That would introduce a very novel and uncertain element into the European convention system, whereby a separate scale of damages would be available in the Irish courts, above and beyond what was available under the strict letter of the convention in Strasbourg.</P>
      <P>That is not to say the Government has not, in its proposal, addressed the issue of concern raised by the Senator. This is where the whole issue of an <i>ex gratia </i>payment comes in, under section 5(4). I appreciate that, by uttering the words <i>&ldquo;ex gratia&rdquo;</i>, any Government spokesperson, acting on legal advice, exposes himself or herself to criticism. However, the purpose of the <i>ex gratia </i>system now being written into this legislation is to give the Attorney General and the Government, in their discretion, the power to make compensation prior to any decision in Strasbourg, in order that at least the person who has a declaration of incompatibility can obtain the appropriate monetary award from the Government, by way of settlement, prior to the determination of proceedings in Strasbourg. That operation now becomes possible under this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does not become possible under this legislation &ndash; what is sought in the amendment tabled by Senators Norris and O'Toole and moved by Senator Henry &ndash; is the giving of power to a person who has obtained a declaration of incompatibility, either before the Irish or Strasbourg courts, the next right to go to our courts, apart from Strasbourg, and obtain damages in <Col N="1141" />that regard. That right is not conferred by this legislation. The view of the Government is that the scale of damages in such cases should be laid down by uniform standards in Strasbourg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought this legislation was with a view to having European convention cases taken here in order that people would not have to go to Strasbourg to have their rights under the convention vindicated. That is quite clear. However, what I am seeking for a person concerned in this regard is not damages but a remedy. The DG case took about three years to get to Strasbourg. The person concerned was only about 16 years old on being put into St. Patrick's and starting this case. It took at least two, if not three, years to get as far as a ruling in Strasbourg. At that stage, the person concerned would have been old enough to go to St. Patrick's.</P>
      <P>My argument is that the person had been in a position to go before the courts in Dublin at age 16, that there was still no remedy, even in the event of winning the case, because there was still no appropriate institution available. The required remedy was a place to go to, not money. Money was of no use to the person concerned in a situation of being put out on the street at age sixteen and a half or whatever. What was needed was an institution to which the person could go. If such an institution was not provided, the next person who appeared likely to be put in St. Patrick's because of the absence of an adequate place in the State, would be in the same position. No remedy was being provided to deal with a situation deemed wrong. One could not simply give money to the person in the DG case and put them out on the street. Some money &ndash; not a great deal, I believe &ndash; was given to the person at age 18 years and one can only hope it was, somehow, sensibly used for their benefit.</P>
      <P>This person, as those who have read the case will know, had been treated abominably by the State &ndash; I refer to all of us, not just the Government &ndash; from when they were about two years of age. This was not the only instance &ndash; there was a constant breakdown in State services for the child. For that or any similar child, there was going to be no remedy as a result of taking the case. It was my hope, in the context of this legislation, that the approach would not be simply in terms of providing a few euro to get rid of the person concerned but that we would also try to remedy the circumstances in which Ireland was found to be in breach of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has raised a much wider issue. The court in Strasbourg makes declarations of incompatibility. Under this Bill, the Irish courts will be empowered to make similar declarations. The Senator has disavowed any interest in conferring a jurisdiction on our courts to award damages, stating further or other relief may be appropriate. However, under the Constitution, the Supreme Court has confirmed, after some considerable time in divergent High Court <Col N="1142" />cases, that the courts do not have the function of specifically directing the Government to carry out certain activities such as, for example, opening residential centres for children and that, in fact, this is a trespass by the Judiciary on our duties, as a Government and Legislature, to provide for these matters.</P>
      <P>I found the Senator's intervention very interesting. It confirms in my mind the grave suspicions and doubts I have in relation to the comments and advocacy, from the Opposition benches in both Houses, on the need for a rights based approach. Rights based approaches ultimately mean that the Government and Legislature abdicate their responsibility and power of choice in relation to public expenditure and allocate to the courts the function of determining priority in expenditure matters &ndash; a course about which I have very grave reservations. The very area the Senator has outlined has only confirmed my doubts in that regard. In the particular area to which she has referred &ndash; the care, protection and total support of young children in difficult circumstances coming before the courts &ndash; because of the difficulties outlined in the case which was taken to Strasbourg, the State has decided to invest an enormous sum of money in developing high support and special care units for children who are out of control and have not come before the criminal courts.</P>
      <P>This investment has been made and huge difficulties have been encountered in training and retaining staff in the particular institutions. All this work has been done as a result of the court decision. Also, as a result of the court decision, other areas are not getting the expenditure they require. In effect, the decision has been entirely removed from the political process. That is the consequence if one goes down that road. I am glad the Senator opened the issue, thereby allowing me to express a view which I know is shared by other members of the Government in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the amendment, to allow the courts, either in Ireland or Strasbourg, to say, &ldquo;You are in breach of this particular provision of the convention &ndash; this is what you must now do,&rdquo; would be, in effect, to bring judicial powers, whether on the international or domestic level, straight into the business of the Executive and the Legislature. For example, when the judgment in the Airey case was handed down in relation to civil legal aid and the State was found to be in breach of its obligations in that regard, the obligation was then cast on the Government and the Legislature to draw up a scheme of legal aid. However, the court could not take it upon itself to draw up the scheme and issue a circular setting out the persons entitled to legal aid and calling on the Minister for Finance to supply &euro;X to fund the scheme. In effect, that is the end result of giving such powers to the courts.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&ndash;(1) A Minister in charge of a Bill in either House of the Oireachtas must before the Second Reading of the Bill:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) make a statement to the effect that in her or his view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the Convention provisions (referred to in this section as a &lsquo;statement of compatibility'), or</P>

      <P>(2) The statement must be in writing and be published in such a manner as the Minister considers appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I thought this was a good idea because if one looks at the text of the Good Friday Agreement, it states the measures brought forward will ensure at least an equivalent level of protection of human rights as will pertain in Northern Ireland. This pertains in the legislation in Northern Ireland. I am only trying to be consistent with the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose behind this amendment is to provide for the Minister to make and publish a written statement on compatibility or incompatibility. It seems to be based on section 19 of the United Kingdom Human Rights Act where a Minister must either make a state<Col N="1144" />ment about the Bill and whether it is compatible or whether the Government wishes to proceed with the Bill in the absence of making a statement. The development of the position in this area in the United Kingdom since the Act came into force two and half years ago is interesting because the provision has not delivered on its promise. The formula adopted for a compatibility statement to date is brief and uninformative. No reasons are given as to why a statement of compatibility is made on the basis that legal advice should not be disclosed. We have often heard this touted also. In cases where no statement of compatibility is made, this is explained by the Government on the grounds that convention issues are frequently complex and that a debate in Parliament provides the best forum for Ministers to explain their thinking on the matter.</P>
      <P>Unlike the position in England and Wales, which do not have yet have a human rights commission, it is important to note that our Human Rights Commission can be requested by a Minister under section 8(<i>b</i>) of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000 to examine any legislative proposal and report its views on the possible implications of such a proposal for human rights. The Minister has already used this provision on several Bills. The Attorney General, as guardian of the public interest, has a function in relation to the protection of the Constitution and the vindication of constitutional rights. The Attorney General is more habituated to this type of exercise than the Attorney General of England and Wales who does not have to tender similar advice to Her Majesty's Government and can rest assured on the enactment of a sovereign Parliament. There is a distinction between the two jurisdictions in that respect. The Government is satisfied the experience of the Attorney General in this area, combined with ministerial power to refer the matter to the Human Rights Commission, are more sufficient safeguards than a paper reference to a compatibility issue.</P>
      <P>There is also a constitutional issue in the amendment in that it purports to legislate for a House of the Oireachtas. Under the Constitution, the Houses of the Oireachtas are established by the people and their internal regulation is a matter for Standing Orders of each House. There is a question mark over whether we can legislate along the lines proposed by the Senator.</P>

There is a clear definition of the convention, the same convention referred to in the amendment, namely, the convention within the meaning of the Act and the protocols thereto. It may have arisen from a discussion on Committee Stage where Senator Ryan wanted various specific articles of the convention incorporated in the reference. I explained how those provisions were already self-executing international law and did not require any domestic statutory vesture. We were concerned to ensure all the rights conferred on citizens which could be brought before the courts were conferred and that, for example, the right of individual petition or the compulsory jurisdiction of the court were not matters which could be brought before our courts because a citizen had the right to go to Strasbourg and invoke these provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June 2003.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent Garda operation in County Louth and the PSNI discovery of a large van bomb in Derry are clear indications of the continuing need for perseverance in the fight against terrorism. Members of this House will need no reminding of the circumstances in which these provisions were enacted in 1998, namely the Omagh bomb in August of that year. There was a determination that those responsible for this mass murder would not succeed in subverting the democratically expressed will of the people on this island and that the conflict should be resolved only by peaceful means and on the basis of consent. To date, one person has been convicted in this jurisdiction on a charge related to the Omagh bomb, and the investigation is continuing with excellent co-operation between the Garda and the Police <Col N="1148" />Service of Northern Ireland. It is worth reiterating that the Garda Síochána will never give up the search for those responsible.</P>
    <P>Senators will recall that in recognition of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the provisions of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas to see whether the circumstances then prevailing justified the continuance in force of its provisions or there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to convince the Oireachtas that they were no longer needed. Under section 18 of the Act, therefore, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, and by virtue of resolutions passed by each House of the Oireachtas on 20 June 2000, 26 June 2001 and 18 April 2002, sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 will cease to operate on 30 June 2003 unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for a period not exceeding 12 months, as may be specified in the resolution.</P>
    <P>Also included in the Act was a requirement for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of its provisions. Such a report was laid before this House on 18 June. The conclusion of that report was that the renewal of the provisions for a further year was necessary. The sad reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bomb continue to pursue and plan a campaign of violence and there is no change of substance to the circumstances which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee to review the Offences Against the State Acts 1939 to 1998 was published last August. This extensive report deals with complex issues of law and policy and involves important considerations concerning the balance to be struck between national and international security and civil liberties and individual rights. Those recommendations in the report of direct relevance to the purpose and scope of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 were considered in the context of the preparation of that legislation and the Bill, accordingly, will give effect to a limited number of recommendations. A fuller consideration of the recommendations of the committee will be finalised once this Bill has been enacted and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will then bring further proposals to the Government.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the individual sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which this House is being asked to continue in force for a further 12 months, outline their purpose and indicate how they have been used in the past year.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 17 have not been used since 23 March 2002. Section 3 provides that in proceedings related to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of his or her intention to call a <Col N="1149" />person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 3 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1972. The effect of the 1972 provision is that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of such an organisation should be evidence that he or she was then such a member. It originally defined the expression &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 of the 1998 Act was to expand the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; to include movements, actions, activities or associations. This simply aligns the definition of the word in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 established the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences Against the State Act 1939. While this section was not used during the period under report, one person remains before the courts after being charged with such an offence prior to that period.</P>
    <P>Section 8 made it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Section 12 made it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.</P>
    <P>Section 17 builds on the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 relating to the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, whenever any person is convicted of an offence, to order at its discretion the forfeiture of any property in his or her possession which was used or intended to be used to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, is to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.</P>
    <P>The rest of the sections with which we are dealing have been used in the reporting period. Section 2 provides that in any proceedings against a person for membership of an unlawful organisation, where evidence is given that the accused, when questioned, failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appears proper. This provision has been used on <Col N="1150" />many occasions in questioning persons arrested on suspicion of being members of an unlawful organisation. Charges do not result in every case in which the provision is used but since 23 March 2002 the section has been used on 43 occasions. In cases in which this section was used, six persons were convicted during the period under report after being charged prior to that period.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences Against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts or any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided the offence carries a penalty of five years of imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. This section was utilised on one occasion in the reporting period.</P>
    <P>Section 7 made it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences. This section was utilised on 18 occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 9 made it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution, or conviction of any other person for such an offence and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána. This section was utilised on 17 occasions.</P>
    <P>Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act &ndash; which otherwise is 48 hours &ndash; to 72 hours on the authorisation of a District Court judge. The judge must be satisfied, on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf. In the reporting period, 32 persons have had their periods of detention extended under this provision, and nine of these were subsequently charged with offences.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the <Col N="1151" />Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence and about which they wish to question the suspect. This section was utilised on two occasions.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 14 is to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing such offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act. This section was utilised on 83 occasions.</P>
    <P>The foregoing information on the use made of the provisions of the 1998 Act in the reporting period is based on information received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid before this House. This report, together with the previous reports, shows that the key provisions of the Act are taking effect. We have seen the results of this legislation since its inception. Of course, the most significant result in the Garda Síochána's fight against subversive activity was the conviction of a person on a charge of conspiracy to cause an explosion in relation to the Omagh atrocity. The provisions of the 1998 Act were used appropriately by the Garda Síochána in this case and will continue to be used in their efforts to bring to justice all of those responsible for that horrific act.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it should be noted that the number of persons held under extended detention under section 10 over the past 14 months was 32 as against 39 in the previous nine-month period. This is a relatively modest number, and one which, taken together with all of the other information I have outlined, goes to support the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's view that the provisions of the Act are reasoned and proportionate, and are being implemented by the Garda Síochána in a measured and restrained manner.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, some provisions which did not take effect in the context of court proceedings during the period under report, but even here the Garda authorities have informed me that the provisions in question have been utilised where appropriate by the Garda during the investigation of offences. Members of this House will appreciate, of course, that many of the investigations at issue are, of their nature, ongoing.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has had considerable success in the reporting period in combating those who would subvert through the use of violence the democratic wishes of the people on this island. I am sure the House will join me in congratulating the force on its achievements, but the threat to life and to our democratic values, which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act, remains. So too, I am sure, does the determination of this House never to give in to such a threat, but to provide the Garda Síochána and the criminal justice system with all legitimate means of combating it. The 1998 Act is an important part of those means and it is proving its worth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" />Much has been achieved in the implementation of the peace process, and much remains to be done, but there are still those who would threaten to subvert that process through violence. The 1998 Act is part of the democratic response to that threat, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform asks the House to continue in force the relevant provisions of that Act for a further 12 months. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the resolution. It is important that the House debates this matter. When the resolution was proposed in 1998, the Opposition sought assurances from the Government that these understandably draconian provisions would be debated on a yearly basis in the House. That agreement has been honoured every year since the Act was passed, by both Houses of the Oireachtas. It is important that we use this space to reflect on the progress to date. I note the fact that the report was laid before the Oirechtas early in June, outlining some of the information that the Minister has given the House. It is important that the House returns on a yearly basis to this issue because of the exceptional circumstances that led to the introduction of this Act in 1998.</P>
      <P>For those outside this House who hold the view that there is no longer a threat from armed groups, illegal, unlawful organisations in this State, I say they are sorely wrong. The threat continues from dissident, allegedly republican organisations and we must counter that threat. The first responsibility of a democratically elected Government is to secure for its citizens the jurisdiction in which they live. That is why it is absolutely essential that the provisions contained in this Act continue until such a time as we have wiped out forever this fundamentalist, anti-democratic, neo-fascist group of people who still refuse to accept the wishes of our people, North and South.</P>
      <P>The Minister is right to point out the example in County Louth. People should be on their guard. We saw in Merrion Square on 8 May last a small incendiary device which could have caused mayhem to members of the public, members of the Garda, Members of the House. We saw on the 6 May an attempted bomb attack in Armagh city, where two police officers escaped injury. As the Minister said, in County Louth a bomb was discovered following good investigative work by the Garda Síochána and, I presume, the local community. A 1000 lb bomb was found which was ready to be primed and used presumably over the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who think that these people have gone away and are not planning to attack our democracy again would need to have some sense and realise that the threat they pose is real. This side of the House gives full support to the Government and the law enforcement branches of the State in countering this threat and defeating it. They remain a small group of people who are totally against the new consensus that we have <Col N="1153" />established on this island both North and South. We must counter and defeat them.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by reports I receive about the new recruiting ground that the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA have in some universities. We know of the case that appeared before the courts in London last April, where a group of young people were convicted on terrorist charges. It seems that there has been infiltration of some of our colleges by these fundamentalist organisations, that they are intent on derailing the peace process and that they have at their disposal a small dedicated new young corps of terrorists who are prepared to bring mayhem and destruction to this country and the neighbouring island. We also have to counter that.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons many elements of the Unionist community and the security establishment in Northern Ireland state it should not fully demilitarise is the threat posed by these illegal groups. If they are genuinely serious about bringing about demilitarisation, which entails the removal of British Army installations along Border flashpoints and elsewhere in Northern Ireland, they would simply go away. It is their continued threat which allows the argument to be made that such installations have merit and justification.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin has never publicly asked people, North and South, to co-operate either with the Garda Síochána or the Police Service of Northern Ireland with the investigations that followed the Omagh bombing. I call on it to embrace the cross-party support in this House, the Lower House and throughout the country for people to come forward with information that could lead to the conviction of persons who were responsible for the Omagh atrocity and other atrocities. We have had one conviction in the Omagh case and I will not refer to another case which is currently before the courts. I ask Sinn Féin to make that call because now is the time to get off the fence.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is from Limerick city, which has been troubled in recent months by feuding gangs. Recently, a newspaper alleged that arms from the Continuity IRA were sold directly to some of these groups. If there is any truth in that &ndash; and I have no reason to doubt it &ndash; does it not demonstrate once again the necessity for decommissioning in this State and a complete clamp-down to end such activities? Decommissioning is not just an important issue for Unionists, it is also important for people in this State because we cannot have unlawful groups &ndash; be they ten or 100 &ndash; attempting to act as mafiosi in their own communities, directing terror or, in the case to which I referred in Limerick, directly selling illegal weapons to what might be described as ordinary decent criminals as opposed to politically motivated criminals. Decommissioning is not just important for those groups on ceasefire, it is also important in light of the continued threat posed by the Real IRA, the Continuity IRA or any other IRA group that may take their place in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" />In recent years, much good work has been done by the Criminal Assets Bureau in getting to the root of ill-gotten gains and those who amass huge sums of money through criminal activity, including illegal drug dealing. The CAB needs to direct more of its attention, however, to the paramilitary fronts that exist in the State. I refer not only to dissident groups but also to the continued presence of the IRA. I have been informed &ndash; there is no reason for doubting it &ndash; that the IRA has simply moved its operations and, instead of murdering people here and in Britain, is now attempting to front legitimate businesses. Have we seen the kind of concentrated effort by the CAB and other law enforcement agencies to ensure that these paramilitary fronts are exposed and that their profits are confiscated? The Minister of State should take that point seriously because we cannot have such groups &ndash; even those that are on ceasefire &ndash; attempting to diversify their illegal activities.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the communities that know who these people are to do their patriotic duty by informing the Garda Síochána of their activities and whereabouts. The case in County Louth clearly came about as a result of good intelligence. When people witness this type of activity, it is their duty to inform the Garda Síochána about it; nothing could be more patriotic than doing so. I appeal to those in the communities that are harbouring these people to ensure that information is passed on, either to the Garda Síochána or the Police Service of Northern Ireland, so that, once and for all, those responsible for illegal acts can be rooted out of our society.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach inniú.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State pointed out, the recent developments in counties Louth and Derry serve as chilling reminders that there are people who remain bent on reversing all that has been achieved in recent years. The fact that, thankfully, there has not been any atrocity on the scale of that which occurred in Omagh almost five years ago, is cause for relief but not complacency. Since the Omagh bombing, there have been several foiled plots by dissidents to cause carnage on a similar or even greater scale. These plots have been foiled thanks to the unstinting dedication and tenacity of the Garda Síochána and others.</P>
      <P>It is also important to note the repeated success of the Garda Síochána in securing prosecutions against members of dissident republican organisations, with the result that many of their most senior figures are currently serving prison sentences. This has undoubtedly been a major factor in preventing the commissioning and execution of further outrages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our corpus of anti-terrorist legislation, including the Act now under discussion, that makes these prosecutions possible. The fact that dissident organisations have been so continuously thwarted in this way is an obvious argument <Col N="1155" />against the unwarranted weakening of any such legislation. The Minister of State has illustrated that the bulk of these provisions were utilised during the period under review. The statistics on the utilisation of the sections in question show that the Garda Síochána is careful and conscientious about employing the Act's provisions.</P>
    <P>Given that we live in a society where terrorist groups ignore the democratic will of the people, it is essential that the State equips itself with sufficiently strong powers to fight these groups. As long as there remains a challenge to the security of the State from terrorism &ndash; and there clearly is such a threat at this time &ndash; the full weight of the law must continue to be applied. Constant vigilance is required, together with unyielding pressure on the would-be saboteurs of the relative peace this island has enjoyed in recent years.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Act are strongly weighted against these groups. The Minister of State has clearly illustrated that inference can be taken from an accused person's failure to answer material questions. In addition, they do not have the right to call witnesses without the permission of the court, unless prior notice has been given. Any statement or conduct by them can be taken as reasonable inference. Failure to mention certain facts which an accused later relies on, can also be the subject of such inference. Possession of an article giving rise to reasonable suspicion is an offence. It is also an offence to collect, record or possess information useful to unlawful organisations, as it is to withhold information to prevent offences.</P>
    <P>We have had many debates in this House about the activities of paramilitary organisations other than the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA, which have moved from specific republican activities to organised crime. The involvement of elements of the Provisional IRA, the INLA, the UDA and the UVF in this regard should be tackled by extending either some or all of these provisions in the fight against crime. Many of us would wish that there was no necessity to operate the provisions of this Act, but there is a compelling case to be made for their use against terrorism and organised crime. Who could deny that the effects of illegal drugs on society are not as serious or as grave as the consequences of terrorism? Other crimes have a similar adverse effect. It needs to be ensured the full rigour of the law and resources of the State will be mobilised in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>While I omitted the Official IRA, I presume many of its members are rehabilitating within the ranks of the Labour Party and perhaps there is no need to extend the legislation to cover them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret it is necessary to continue to enforce the provisions of the Act. I also regret the need for anti-terrorist legislation. However, we all sincerely hope the day will come when such <Col N="1156" />legislation will no longer be required. I wonder whether that day might be hastened by the establishment of a truth and reconciliation forum or commission through which many of the activities of the past 20 or 30 years that have manifested themselves in serious crimes could be arrested by addressing them in a way that would give rise to people making genuine expressions of regret for these activities and everybody could come together as part of a healing process in order that the negative effects of the period could be harnessed into a positive approach for the future on this island, which is absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>Our record on tackling terrorism in this part of the island has been good throughout the 30 years. It should be ensured similar high standards prevail within the United Kingdom. People are worried about the all too frequent reports of collusion between the security forces in Northern Ireland and paramilitaries during that period. I sincerely hope such collusion has not continued up to the present day.</P>
      <P>I join previous speakers in endorsing the extension of the Act for a further 12 months. It is appropriate that it should be reviewed annually. However, it may be beneficial if similar provisions in the Act were applied to other serious threats to the State from the criminal world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his presentation. The Labour Party accepts and supports the need for the legislation following the atrocity of the Omagh bombing. We also accept there is still a threat to our democracy from the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA, in particular. While I agree it is important that this emergency legislation should be monitored and revisited annually, at the same time, we must get to the stage where such legislation is no longer required. There are concerns regarding the length of time that has passed since the legislation was introduced as an emergency measure and the conviction of only one person under it.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a more comprehensive review of the principal Act and the implementation of the report on it, mentioned by the Minister of State. While I reiterate our support for the continuation of this legislation, it is important that we should revert to legislation that reflects a stable and peaceful society, which largely is the case in Ireland except among minorities which do not want peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. While it is necessary to review the legislation, it is a pity that we, as a nation, found it necessary to place such legislation on the Statute Book in the first place. However, that is the reality and we have a responsibility, as legislators, to face up to this. There is evidence that proves the legislation was both justified and necessary. I welcome the Minister of State's outline of how the 1998 amendments were used over the past 12 months. It is important that the Act should be reviewed <Col N="1157" />because it proves it was necessary in the first place.</P>
      <P>There is no place for those who undermine our democracy and the will of the people. We live in an era in which terrorism affects those who engage in such actions or atrocities and in which people can be terrorised in their own homes through images of terrorist acts on television,. It is important that at all times the necessary legislation should be in place to confront this threat to the society in which we aspire to live.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Republicanism&rdquo; is one of the most abused words in the English language. So-called republicans hijack and abuse it to carry out criminal acts. A stage has been reached in the peace process where a distinction must be made regarding criminal activity which cannot be tolerated. Lip service cannot be paid to the support of extortion and protection rackets, kneecapping, punishment beatings and smuggling to raise funds. These are criminal activities for which there is no place in society. We, as legislators, must face up to this. Certain groups in society and certain Members of these Houses pay lip service to such activity. The people I represent and I do not aspire to such a society.</P>
      <P>Tributes must be paid to the Garda and the Defence Forces which provide us with the protection we need. People question the cost involved in supporting the Defence Forces but democracy, like other aspects of our lives, requires an insurance policy. Our Defence Forces provide such an insurance policy. If they uphold democracy for only one day in the history of the State, they will have earned their keep. They must be in place and must be supported to ensure they are capable of meeting the threat they encounter on a day-to-day basis.</P>
      <P>I join previous speakers in appealing to all parties in the Oireachtas to support the enforcement of the legislation and its spirit. It is time we grew up as a society and moved forward in the real world to face up to what is acceptable. I congratulate the Minister of State on his contribution which was informative and necessary. We must maintain vigilance against the threat to our democracy. There is not only an internal threat, as we live in a world where external threats are increasing day after day. Similar legislation may be needed to address the external threats facing western democracies that we support. Everybody must be vigilant. My final appeal is to all democratically elected parties to embrace democracy, separate it from criminal activity and move forward in order that we can continue to grow the State for the benefit of all who live in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the ongoing provisions of the Act which was passed in 1998. We are all conscious of the background when they were first made. After the tragic events in Omagh when so many men, women and young children died in the most barbaric circumstances, the proposed legislative measures were tough and draconian and may <Col N="1158" />have been too far reaching. However, the Government had a decision to make and matters were taken out of its hands by the events in Omagh. It had to do something and in enacting this legislation took the the right decision. The legislation was reasonable and balanced.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the British-Irish Agreement, which was endorsed by the people of the North of Ireland, and in the light of the slaughter that took place in Omagh the Government was faced with two questions. Was it necessary to protect the institutions of the State and its citizens with some form of legislation and was the proposed legislation, which continues today, reasonable and balanced? The answer to both questions is yes. It was of paramount importance then, as it is now, that we did not allow groups of people to destroy what had been achieved by the Good Friday Agreement. We must do whatever is necessary in law to prevent them from succeeding in that regard. As public representatives and as a Government, we have a mandate from the people, North and South, to continue to implement the Agreement in all its aspects at all times.</P>
      <P>For this reason I was delighted to see Mr. David Trimble dealing successfully last week with the wranglings in his own party. Whether one likes him, he is a brave individual who sees the Good Friday Agreement as the only chance for the people he represents. It suprises me that intelligent people such as Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson cannot see that this is the only opportunity they will have. We have heard from Mr. Blair on numerous occasions that this is the only opportunity they will have to wrest themselves away from what they had in the past, something to which, I am sure, none of them wants to go back.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to say this legislation is a cast iron guarantee that no atrocities will be perpetrated. That is the reason we must continue to look to the Garda, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the intelligence services in Britain which have done a wonderful job in putting a halt to many atrocities which might have taken place. We might have had several other Omaghs but for their vigilance. We need only look at the discovery of a 1,200 lb bomb in the North last week or the individuals recently stopped on the Border carrying bomb-making equipment to realise how effective and successful they have been. Had that bomb been planted and gone off it would have been three times more destructive than the Omagh bomb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this legislation was introduced, there were concerns that it would affect civil liberties. The passage of time has put those concerns to bed and people are now satisfied that legislation such as this can survive in a democracy. There is no reason the criminal law should ignore those who direct or train individuals in unlawful organisations or grant immunity to those who possess items that could be construed as being able to commission subversive offences. There is no reason the collection of information, as set out in <Col N="1159" />section 8 of the Act, should not warrant criminal sanction. Section 9 states the offence of withholding information is far reaching but not without precedence in legislation. Many Acts, for example, road traffic Acts, demand that people give additional information at certain times or face criminal sanction. There is no circumstance where a person should be allowed the luxury of silence where that silence could cause an atrocity to be perpetrated.</P>
    <P>I realise that this legislation was initially enacted for a short period but the ongoing activities of subversive organisations create a need for it to continue. The people of the North have too much to lose. We remember the economic dynamic released when the first ceasefire took place. People from the South began to travel to the North, some for the first time in their lives. Direct investment, supported by the USA through multinational companies, has brought about a terrific improvement in the economic lives of the people in the North of Ireland. Tourism has improved dramatically. As a consequence of this, employment opportunities are far greater than before. There is too much to be lost by not keeping our eye on the ball and making sure we do what we can to ensure the survival of the Agreement.  </P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the unanimity of the House. I deeply regret the necessity of renewing this legislation. One would have hoped the causes which made it necessary would have disappeared. The Minister of State has made clear the successful use of the legislation by the Garda. It is one of its outstanding achievements in the past five years to have managed, since Omagh, to keep dissident terrorist activity, which has resulted in loss of life, to an absolute minimum. Our praise for the force cannot be too high.</P>
      <P>This legislation was drawn up after the Omagh bomb. The first concern of the Government at the time, apart from pursuing the perpetrators and showing solidarity with the victims and their families, was to ensure there would be no repetition of the bombing, in so far as it lay within our power, and persuade the Real IRA to stop. The safety of the State and its people and the people of the island was at stake. A great deal depended on the firm reaction of the Government and the Oireachtas to that event. The Good Friday Agreement was in its infancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation was drawn up with the specific purpose of deterring any decision by the Real IRA to continue its campaign. This was in the face of certain efforts, which I deeply resented, from across the Atlantic to encourage it to continue. A ceasefire was declared but after an interval of about one year, notwithstanding the fact that the ceasefire was, as far as I know, never publicly withdrawn, the campaign resumed. I saw a justification made by a spokesman that it had <Col N="1160" />been forced to stop and that therefore its promise to stop had not been valid.</P>
    <P>Since the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people, and overwhelmingly by Nationalists, North and South, any possible basis for continued armed struggle was removed. In August 1998, the INLA &ndash; it had been prepared to move before the Omagh bomb &ndash; recognised the futility of continuing and declared a firm ceasefire, which, in my opinion, it has kept ever since, whatever about the unlawful activities of a certain number of its members. <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> suggested, on 13 October 2002, that most of the original Real IRA leaders in Portlaoise prison believe that the organisation no longer has any future. According to the report, they were interested in the possibility of early prison releases arising from a permanent ceasefire by the entire organisation. However, it has since emerged that the organisation, inside and outside the prison, was split.</P>
    <P>The Continuity IRA is the only implacable group rooted in a threadbare legitimist fiction, spun by a sad old sea-green incorruptible from County Roscommon. While it is true that the Éire Nua document of 1969 put forward one model that could, in the right circumstances, be discussed and appeared to make allowances for different traditions, the bombs that went off subsequently drowned out &ndash; and continue to drown out &ndash; that message. One cannot attach credibility to attempts at conciliation if all the time one is using, deploying and threatening force.</P>
    <P>It should be obvious that any continued campaign, on the part of whatever group, is morally wrong, democratically unjustifiable, politically deeply counter-productive and militarily absurd. The political and democratic path, however thorny &ndash; we see in current circumstances how thorny it is &ndash; is the only way forward. It is a complete illusion &ndash; unfortunately, it is a rather hard-bitten illusion &ndash; to believe that even a successful or financially damaging attack will have any more effect than in the past in persuading a country that has just fought, to use its own language, &ldquo;a war on terrorism&rdquo;, to succumb to anything that a minuscule splinter organisation might have to throw at it.</P>
    <P>For the moment, this is the Republic and we must build out from it. The attempts &ndash; perhaps rather belated &ndash; at understanding and rapprochement are to be commended if the republican ideal of uniting Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter is to mean anything today. It was rather telling when Paul Bew, a fine historian and adviser to David Trimble, made the point that the conflict over the last 30 years was the first time that attempts to establish a republic in different generations dating back to the United Irishmen did not have a significant input from the Protestant tradition.</P>
    <P>If republicanism means anything, it means bringing together traditions. Yes, putting the case for independence is good, but we must let go for good &ndash; regardless of what the Unionist com<Col N="1161" />munity may or may not do &ndash; the notion that we can force, coerce or out-vote by way of one community overtaking another. We can only do it by dialogue and co-operation. We have something to build on. In some respects, we have made more progress today than we have made in 200 years. We must build on this and let go of the ways of the past.</P>

      <P>I thank everyone who spoke on the motion, particularly Senators Jim Walsh, Minihan, Kett, Mansergh, Tuffy and Brian Hayes for their support. I thank Senator Brian Hayes for seconding the motion.</P>
      <P>I have taken note of various points made during the course of the debate which I will discuss with the Minister and the Garda Síochána. These include: the question of dissident terrorists trying to recruit people in universities and other third level institutions: the fact that the Criminal Assets Bureau should pay more attention to paramilitary organisations that have moved into different areas of crime; the feasibility of a truth and reconciliation commission; the use of the Act against other types of crime; and the use of similar legislation against external threats.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Mansergh in congratulating the Garda on its wonderful success in combating dissident terrorist activity since the Omagh tragedy. Senator Brian Hayes referred to the situation in my area, about which he is correct. The information available to me from the Garda is that the Continuity IRA is supplying awesome weaponry to a gang on a particular side of that feud. It is only as a result of the vigilance and good intelligence available to the Garda in Limerick, supported by the emergency response unit, that a number of appalling tragedies have been averted. I congratulate the members of the Garda Síochána who are doing a magnificent job in very difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>I thank the House for its unanimous support in allowing the Government to continue these provisions as and from 30 June. Like Senator Tuffy, I look forward to the day when we will no longer have to use such legislation, but, unfortunately, that day has not yet arrived.</P>

    <Title>Arts Bill 2002: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the passage of this Bill through the Dáil, I explained that although it was drafted and published before I assumed ministerial responsibility for the arts, I was very happy to take it on and sponsor its passage through the Oireachtas. There are some areas of <Col N="1162" />the Bill that I felt it necessary to change, and I will deal with these issues later.</P>
      <P>The Irish arts sector today is much bigger, more dynamic and more diverse than has ever before been the case. This has happened for many reasons. The opportunity is being taken to bring many of the provisions of the 1951 and 1973 Acts into line with what are now standard provisions relating to the functioning of statutory authorities. However, the Bill proposes a number of key changes I want to outline to the House in more detail.</P>
      <P>The arts will be defined, for the purposes of the Bill, in a way that continues to refer to constituent art forms, but which will be sufficiently flexible to include traditional, as well as emerging and innovative art forms and art forms in any language. Dance and circus will be included for the first time.</P>
      <P>As Minister, I will have overall responsibility for the promotion of the arts both inside and outside the State. The Bill provides that, in performing my functions, I may consult with the Arts Council and with such other Ministers, public bodies, or other persons, as I consider appropriate. As the Minister with overall responsibility for the promotion of the arts, I will be empowered to give a direction in writing to the council requiring it to comply with policies of the Minister or of the Government. Such a direction may include a requirement that the council prepare and submit to me a plan specifying strategies or measures that it proposes to adopt in relation to the arts during a specified period.</P>
      <P>These provisions recognise this legitimate role for the Minister of the day, but will not affect the independence of the Arts Council regarding individual funding decisions, and indeed statutory recognition is given in the Bill for the first time in legislation to that independence.</P>
      <P>It is important that the potential impact of local authorities on the arts be optimised, and that these efforts dovetail as far as is practicable with overall Government policy. Section 6 requires local authorities to prepare and implement plans for the development of the arts within their functional areas and in so doing to take account of Government policies on the arts. Local authorities may provide financial or other assistance to stimulate public interest in the arts, promote knowledge of the arts, or improve standards in the arts.</P>
      <P>To ensure overall coherence, the arts activities of other public bodies must also operate within the parameters of Government arts policy and section 7 therefore requires public bodies, in doing anything that relates to the arts, to have regard to such Government policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 broadly restates the functions of the Arts Council, which includes the stimulation of public interest in the arts, the promotion of knowledge, appreciation, and practice of the arts and assisting in the improvement in standards in the arts. The council can make recommendations to the Minister on matters within its remit, and will <Col N="1163" />generally act as an expert resource for other Ministers and public bodies in relation to the arts.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the Arts Council be reduced from 17 to 13 members. It is proposed to introduce a system of rolling membership, whereby half of the ordinary members of the council will change every 30 months, rather than having the possibility of the membership being changed in its entirety every five years. In the course of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil it emerged that there is a technical gap in the text of the Bill, in that it does not specify the length of time for which the chairperson of the council will be appointed. Accordingly, on Committee Stage I will propose an amendment to correct this.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is perhaps the main area of the Bill which requires changes from the original Bill as published. Many in the traditional sector have a strong sense that their sector has been treated less well than it deserves and arguments were advanced for either a new and separate traditional arts council or the ring fencing of a substantial portion of the Arts Council's funds for traditional arts. The Bill as published reflected an effort to strike an acceptable balance by requiring the Arts Council to establish a standing committee on the traditional arts, which would make recommendations to the council in relation to the advance of moneys to those involved in the traditional arts.</P>
    <P>I understand completely what the Bill tried to do in this regard, but I feel the same result can be better achieved with a different approach. I would much prefer not to separate the traditional arts from the mainstream of the arts world, of which I believe it is an important component. I was also uneasy that the proposed structure of permanent standing committees would set the priorities of the council in stone, while in the real world priorities change and issues adjust over time. I therefore proposed a changed section 21 to Dáil Éireann, which will allow for particular consideration to be given to policy priorities as they arise from time to time through the establishment of non-permanent special committees to advise on specified matters relating to the arts. I would intend that the traditional arts be catered for in this way at an early date.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill consists of standard provisions that are normal for any legislation regulating a State body such as the Arts Council. Section 1 contains the Short Title and commencement provisions. Section 2 contains definitions. Section 3 provides for the payment of expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill when enacted. Section 4 provides for the repeal of the Arts Acts 1951 and 1973. Section 5, to which I have already alluded, sets out the Minister's powers and functions. Section 6 provides for the preparation and implementation of local arts plans by local authorities. Section 7 provides that public bodies shall, when doing any<Col N="1164" />thing relating to the arts, have regard to Government policies on the arts.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the continuation of the Arts Council as a body corporate. Section 9 sets out the functions of the Arts Council. Section 10 allows the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and after consultation with the council and any other Minister of the Government as he considers appropriate, by order to confer additional functions on the council.</P>
    <P>Section 11 covers the membership and structure of the Arts Council. Section 12 covers resignation, removal from office, and qualification for office, by members of the Arts Council. Section 13 provides for the filling of casual vacancies on the council.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for the remuneration of the chairperson and members of the Arts Council. Section 15 deals with the appointment and terms of office of the director of the council. Section 16 lays down procedures for the meetings of the Arts Council. Section 17 covers certain restrictions on holding office as a member of the Arts Council or as a member of the council's staff. Section 18 provides for declarations of interest by members of the Arts Council. Section 19 covers declarations of interest by members of the council's staff. Section 20 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information by members of the council or of standing committees, or by members of the council's staff.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides for the appointment by the Arts Council of special committees. Section 22 allows for the appointment of additional committees by the council. Section 23 allows the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to advance moneys to the council from funds provided by the Oireachtas. Section 24 allows the Arts Council, in carrying out its functions, to advance funds to such persons as it considers appropriate and provides that the council shall be independent in the performance of this function. This enshrines in legislation the long-standing understanding in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 25 requires the keeping of proper accounts by the Arts Council and for their submission to the Minister after audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Section 26 requires the submission of an annual report on the council's activities to the Minister, who will lay copies before each House of the Oireachtas. Section 27 allows the council to accept gifts of money, land or other property.</P>
    <P>Section 28 allows the appointment of staff by the Arts Council and deals with the terms and conditions of such staff. Section 29 provides that the rates of pay of council staff shall be in line with Government policy and directions issued by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 30 deals with the remuneration of council staff. Section 31 deals with the superannuation of staff. Section 32 allows the Minister to require the council to furnish specified records or documents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" />The Bill proposes some important changes, while continuing with those elements that have served us well for many years. There will now be a recognised and well-defined role for the Minister responsible for the arts. The Arts Council will continue and although it will now have a more specific obligation to operate within a framework of overall Government arts policy, its independence in individual funding decisions will now have statutory backing.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Since the foundation of the State, only two Arts Acts have been enacted, in 1951 and 1973. In all probability the Bill before us today, the Arts Bill 2002, will be the only opportunity this House will have to assist and to encourage the development of the arts through legislation for a generation.</P>
      <P>Rather than being called an Arts Bill it would be more appropriate to call it an Arts Council Bill because the majority of its contents deal with the functions, membership and staffing of the Arts Council. While these points are very important, the arts community wants continuity and certainty as regards funding and support for its organisations, as opposed to a Bill which seems more tilted towards further bureaucracy than evoking a vision for the future of the arts in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As mentioned by the Minister, the initial contents of the Bill have been watered down considerably. Various recommendations were made towards a new framework and review of arts legislation in the discussion paper first published in 2000 that went out to all interest groups. The large number of recommendations and questions raised therein were certainly not included in this Bill. One questions the need for reports at all, when the majority of them seem to gather dust and their recommendations are forgotten. I speak of the report compiled by Theo Dorgan on submissions received in response to Towards a New Framework for the Arts, a report backed by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Strategic Review of the Arts Plan 1995 to 1998; The Creative Imperative, a report on support of individual artists in Ireland; and a report on the music industry. Most of the recommendations contained in these reports are not contained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill also deals with the Minister's powers and the role of local authorities in so far as they affect the arts. The local authorities have an important role to play in promoting and stimulating public interest in the arts and they should be supported more, especially in terms of funding. How are local authorities to respond to massive cuts in their funding from the Arts Council this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note Part 2 of the Bill states that a local authority may provide financial and other assistance it deems appropriate to stimulate and promote the arts. It would be fitting to insert the word &lsquo;shall' in this section because we all know that <Col N="1166" />when money becomes tight in local authorities, funding for the arts may be the soft option, with cuts in grant aid to local communities and organisations. I ask the Minister to consider inserting the word &lsquo;shall' rather than using the word &lsquo;may' in this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The savage cuts inflicted on the arts community this year were nothing short of disgraceful and the way the council administered these swingeing cuts also left much to be desired. In Waterford, for instance, where funding for arts organisations on average was cut by 25%, the most extraordinary cut was inflicted on our professional theatre company, the wonderful Red Kettle Theatre Company which has done the country proud, both at home and abroad. The company's funding was cut by an extraordinary 47%. How can the Minister reconcile this with the fact that Waterford is designated as the centre of excellence for theatre? Their appeal obviously fell on deaf ears, as they were told it was okay if they did not do a production this year. This is an option which the company could not contemplate and they are fundraising to keep the show on the road.</P>
    <P>This is an example which is mirrored throughout the country and many in the arts community are barely able to keep their heads above water. They are existing in spite of the Minister and the Arts Council. A person said to me recently that appealing to the Arts Council was like going to court with the Devil and the jury coming from Hell. The Arts Council can be a soft target on occasion and the Government can cut their budget at the drop of a hat.</P>
    <P>Last year the Arts Council budget was &euro;48 million and the expectation of everybody involved was that this figure would be increased to &euro;53 million this year. However, funding was slashed to &euro;44 million and people involved in the arts all over the country are hurting as a result, with no prospect of planning for the future. Existing on less than their present levels is all they can hope for. If this uncertainty as regards funding continues, many groups and organisations will be out of business.</P>
    <P>I was chairman of Garter Lane Arts Centre in Waterford for several years and know the effects of cutbacks in funding, and the same applies in regard to arts centres throughout the country. If one considers this in the context of the cutbacks in community employment schemes, it is having a more devastating effect than most people realise.</P>
    <P>The Minister's original proposal was that membership of the council would be reduced from 17 to eight. The present Bill has settled on a membership of 12 and this is a realistic compromise on the original suggestion. With 17 members, the council had difficulties in getting a quorum for certain meetings and I shudder to think what the situation would be if the Minister had persisted with his original suggestion. He has struck a better balance with a membership of 12.</P>
    <P>When I said earlier that the Minister's original proposals were watered down, I understated matters considerably. What about the three proposed <Col N="1167" />standing committees on the traditional arts, arts in local authorities and innovation in the arts? They are obviously gone and lost forever at this stage. The hopes of many people in these areas have been dashed. The Minister broke promises in this regard.</P>
    <P>Recently I read <i>Living Tradition</i>, a magazine promoting the traditional arts of Ireland at home and abroad. It was very complimentary of the Minister's statements, accusing the Arts Council of not giving adequate funding to the native arts and commending his intention to set up a standing committee on the traditional arts with strong powers that would copper-fasten adequate funding. Where does the Minister stand on this issue now? He has dropped the standing committee, dropped the funding and led the people involved in the traditional arts up the garden path. No sops or half measures will suffice at this stage. This is just another U-turn and broken promise, and there are many angry and unsatisfied people out there who feel the Minister betrayed them on this issue. His actions have not matched his words.</P>
    <P>I am sure the traditional arts will be covered in one of the watered down special committees and I hope one of these committees will deal with education in the arts. Owing to the poor provision for the arts in formal and informal education, the opportunities for people to experience and engage in the arts is limited and needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The report, The Arts in our Schools, recommended that the capacity on arts organisation should be expanded to enhance the experience of primary teachers in promoting the arts. This report also stated that we must bring art and the artist into the classroom and if we do not make this an absolute priority, we are moving towards a cultural wasteland. It is for this reason that I feel the whole issue of education in the arts should be the remit of one of these special committees.</P>
    <P>This was supposed to be a radical Bill for the arts. I can see no radical proposals in it. As a matter of fact, the 1973 Act could have been amended to include the changes involved. It will do nothing to support the cash starved organisations around the country and does nothing to instil confidence in the people and organisations involved in the arts. The Bill contains no vision for the future of the arts.</P>

      <P>I would regard this Bill as a road map for artistic Ireland and in so far as the traditional arts are concerned, it is a cross-roads. My hope is that it will be possible for the Minister, in the very near future, to erect the signposts on that cross-roads with very clear directions, and at the same time that the distances indicated on those road signs will not be too great and that it will be possible for us to see results very quickly.</P>
      <P>I have always felt that, when it comes to the arts in this country, there are two Irelands. The first of these is &ldquo;Official Arts Ireland Limited&rdquo; and, in my opinion, it is very limited. As I see it, the Arts Council only represents about 2% or 3% of all the arts activity in the country. The second Ireland to which I refer is &ldquo;Community Arts Ireland&rdquo;. The community is where the arts and the artists are inspired, nourished, cultivated and celebrated. That is where the main arts activity takes place and long may it continue. That is the way I believe it should be.</P>
      <P>Words such as &ldquo;professionalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;professional&rdquo; are bandied about without any definition. My understanding of professional, in terms of the language of the arts, means something related to excellence. However, it has come to mean commercial or commercialism. They are two different things. The Minister has focused on this difference in terms of his recommendations regarding the new committees.</P>
      <P>The debate on this matter has lasted for 30 years. I was particularly pleased that the Minister made two pronouncements on the traditional arts. He stated that, after half a century, there was no coherent policy on the traditional arts within the Arts Council. He also stated that sufficient finance was not directed towards the traditional arts. Less than 1% of the &euro;48 million went to the traditional arts and the Arts Council stated that it believed that this was adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media has played a significant role in this debate. RTE and the <i>Irish Independent</i>, both of which made valuable contributions, deserve special mention. <i>The Irish Times</i> severely dented its claim to be a quality newspaper. Facts became <Col N="1169" />an inconvenience and a distraction from some agenda which that newspaper was pursuing. I will leave it at that because I know that the average observer outside is well aware of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>There were some people &ndash; the Arts Council is very close to them &ndash; who did not crown themselves in glory by the vindictive, vicious and personalised approach &ndash; by which I was directly affected &ndash; they adopted in this debate. Many people were shocked that this type of language was used. Surreptitious e-mails, campaigns and undercurrents have severely damaged the status of the Arts Council. Such behaviour has no place in any debate on the arts.</P>
    <P>I respect everybody's point of view. The House is aware that I have always had a generous and flexible approach to everybody's point of view on all issues. I have always tried to avoid personalisation of politics and issues, but in this debate I was shocked and disappointed. Time will tell who was responsible for that, but I believe that the Arts Council has been damaged in the process.</P>
    <P>The first arts legislation was introduced in 1951, the year in which Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was founded. It was only 30 years after the War of Independence. Many expectations had not been realised and there was a mass exodus from the country. Spiritual matters such as art and culture were not the central issues of the time. That was the environment and the era in which the Arts Council was established. Grafted on to the Arts Council grew an ethos which very often looked at the faraway hills. At the same time, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann was running parallel, experiencing the same challenges and the same difficulties and trying to balance the situation.</P>
    <P>For 30 years we have argued that there was no coherent policy on the traditional arts. We have argued that sufficient funding has not been made available, but nothing has changed. Something tells me that nothing will change, not because of the Minister and not because of the legislation. I have no doubts about the Minister, and I do not say that in a patronising way.</P>
    <P>One cannot come from a particular environment without imbibing the spirit of it. I know from where most of the Members present in the House today came. It would be impossible for us to deny the resonance of a song which our people gave us or a tune played by our ancestors or by current musicians. It would be impossible to deny the aspirations that we heard in colourful conversation in our own communities. One absorbs it and it stays with one, just as it has stayed with the Minister. I am not concerned about the Minister or the legislation; I am worried about the ethos on which the Arts Council has been riding for so long.</P>
    <P>I wish to extend the hand of friendship to the Arts Council. I will not personalise this issue. There is no reason for me to do so. There may be reasons for the misunderstandings that exist. My hope is that in 30 years' time &ndash; some of us will not be here to participate &ndash; if the legislation <Col N="1170" />is being debated, I hope that the young Irish people involved in the traditional arts at that time will not, to borrow a phrase, &ldquo;look back in anger&rdquo;. I hope that those young people will not be disappointed and say that, against all the odds, we embraced our own and were part of those arts and all we want is official Ireland to acknowledge and recognise this.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Bill is workable. I sympathise with the difficult task the Minister was given in regard to this legislation. It was difficult and I know that he has made an effort to create a balance in this regard. It must be borne in mind, however, that during the debate there was much clouding of the issue. Why was that the case? The PricewaterhouseCoopers report was rubbished by the Opposition. The consultative process of submissions was rubbished. Why did that happen? The answer is that in the past there was a policy of apartheid towards our culture and our arts, which were ghettoised. We were not trying to ghettoise it, we were ghettoised out of the framework.</P>
    <P>One hundred organisations and groups came out in support of action on behalf of the traditional arts. They did not have the influence and the power to publicise it, nor would <i>The Irish Times</i> even want to do so. By and large, the cocktail circuit and pompous patronage have numbed art. Art belongs to the people; it does not belong to any statutory body or any particular organisation. It is the organisations which are rooted down among the people that realise this. How many times have we seen deserving groups, whose members were not part of the golden circle and who did not present themselves as elitist, being sidelined? They have gone away and may be sulking, but they feel deeply hurt because the idea which inspired us &ndash; the foundation stone of our nation &ndash; was not acknowledged or recognised when there was an opportunity to do so. The idea to which I refer was the inspiration of the new State &ndash; it was what we were and what made us. I am making these comments with a sense of generosity, but also with a deep sense of hurt. I am not hurt because of the way in which we were maligned or because the issue was clouded throughout the debate, but because potential was not recognised.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Bill will be a success and I wish the Minister well in that respect. I can say that I have the highest esteem for him, without doing so in a patronising fashion, because I know from whence he came.</P>

      <P>I have to say, regardless of whether the Bill is successful, that we have been noted in Ireland for rising to all challenges. Challenge saved our traditional arts in the past when the opposite could have happened. It would be nice to think, however, that there will be acknowledgement and recognition, at long last, of <Col N="1171" />the 10,000 performers who will turn up at the fleadh cheoil and the 250,000 people who will support them. The number of people who will attend the fleadh cheoil is three times larger than the number of people who will attend the pop festival at Slane. I do not speak of the individual professional musician, who has been the focus of the Arts Council over the years, but of the tens of thousands of people who have creativity in their hearts, who have brought excellence to the fore and who are willing to include everybody who wishes to take part.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well. He will have my support and that of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in respect of the Bill. If he is successful, he will be crowned High King of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, and I thank him for bringing forward this important Arts Bill. The Bill is important because the arts play an important role in society at many levels. This legislation is necessary to clarify the roles of the Arts Council and the Minister, the functions of the council and the relationship between the council, the Minister, local authorities and the arts community.</P>
      <P>I have been made aware, through media reports, of the issue about which Senator Ó Murchú spoke so eloquently, but I have not been a close participant or a player as he has been. I have been able to observe the issue from the sidelines. Having listened to the Senator's remarks, I hope that there will not be a conflict between the traditional arts and other art forms, as that is something I would regret. We do not want to achieve such a conflict. It should not be the case that the traditional arts see themselves almost as victims of an official attitude which seems to exclude them or create a situation where they do not feel they are getting a full share of support, financial or otherwise, but this is what I have heard from Senator Ó Murchú. If that is the case, we should work to ensure that differences are overcome and the hurt that exists is healed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the traditional arts in this country has been extraordinarily important, particularly at times when things were not going as well as they are now and when our sense of ourselves and our culture faced a potential threat. I do not refer to the 19th century, but to times in the 20th century when emigration was an horrendously significant feature of many communities. Our culture of traditional arts helped to maintain the bonds of communities in Ireland and abroad. When Irish people are abroad, they are brought together by singing songs and performing the music of the past and the present. The traditional arts, as defined by Senator Ó Murchú, play a hugely important role in retaining and main<Col N="1172" />taining a sense of cohesion, a sense of ourselves and a sense of our culture.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two points. The explosion of the arts, especially as a result of the support given by various Governments in recent times, has made an extraordinary difference, particularly in local communities. We need to be open to diversity, particularly as our society becomes far more cosmopolitan as a result of the influence of people from other countries who have come to live in Ireland. We should listen to people from other cultures and ensure that the richness of such cultures and the richness of our culture support each other.</P>
    <P>The appointment of arts officers by local authorities has been one of the most important measures to be taken in the context of the development of arts in local communities in recent years. Local authorities that appointed arts officers quickly, drew up arts plans and started to develop arts in the community are to be applauded. I assume that every local authority has an arts officer at this point. I certainly hope that is the case. The development of schemes funded from the arts budget, such as musicians and writers in the community, has helped to promote artists and has been a hugely enriching experience for local communities.</P>
    <P>Melanie Scott, as arts officer of North Tipperary County Council, has played a hugely significant role in supporting local arts groups. She has helped the development of small dramatic societies and larger choral societies, integrated art with active retirement groups, brought art in the community to the classroom, arranged visiting exhibitions and supported groups that are trying to develop arts centres. Groups that are putting together applications for Government funding for arts centres have been given major advice. I hope that the capital funds that have been available for arts centres in recent years will continue to be made available in the years to come.</P>
    <P>It is important that we continue to develop arts in the community. The role and location of the arts centre in a town of any size is important in terms of this development. The increase in artistic endeavours in our towns has had a major economic spin-off because it is connected with our tourism product and, therefore, helps to attract visitors and the development of the kind of quality of life that encourages people to live in communities. It is important that we support local groups and encourage visiting exhibitions, theatre companies and musicians. The development of the role of arts officers has been of huge importance in that regard. I urge the Minister to ensure that every possible support is given to local authorities in this regard, as they are providing better than value for money.</P>
    <P>The final point I would like to make relates to the changing situation and is linked to the first point I made about the traditional arts. Senator Ó Murchú might be familiar with a problem I faced when I was much younger, when I was being taught music in Roscrea and Thurles by <Col N="1173" />Kieran McNamara. We could not participate in the fleadhanna cheoil for some years because times were different but, happily, that has changed.</P>
    <P>This signals a move away from the more self-protecting attitude of the traditional arts to one where there is room for the influence of other cultures. Although an outside influence is apparent in the music of Hayes and Cahill, it sounds very much as one would expect, despite the fact that they learned their music in an American context. Traditional dance culture has been considerably enriched by the influence of dance from other cultures, as can been seen in the phenomenon of Riverdance.</P>
    <P>It is evident that an open approach to the music of other cultures enriches ours and ensures its viability in a changing society. It also ensures that music will maintain its central role as a cohesive force in our communities and, ultimately, as a form of pure entertainment.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire inniu.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on the Bill. It is a considerable improvement on the Bill that was originally published. Those improvements are to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>In a debate such as this, we are confronted with the great philosophical questions of our time such as, what is art? The Bill attempts to answer that question in its definition, which brings to mind the phrase &ldquo;what is the stars?&rdquo; from another area of artistic endeavour, namely, the O'Casey play.</P>
      <P>The definition is reasonable. I assume that the term film includes still photography. If not, it certainly should do so. Photography can rightly claim to be an art form in its best manifestations, as exemplified by the work of Cartier-Bresson among others. I am pleased to note the inclusion of both circuses and architecture in the definition. I also note the inclusion of any medium when used for those purposes, which leads me to the realistic thought that a JCB involved in the erection of some architectural edifice could be regarded as an agent of art. Perhaps that should be the case. I can imagine some of the <i>avant garde</i> visual artists using a JCB, or some other mechanical device, as part of their work.</P>
      <P>The point was made in regard to the degree to which the elite are the arbiters of taste. There is a regrettable tendency within the arts for elite persons and groups to claim sole custody of them. In that respect, I fully agree with what Senator Ó Murchú had to say in regard to the cocktail society, the members of which decree what constitutes art to the exclusion of the vernacular and of local community input into art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, the greatest vibrancy in the arts is within local communities. The upsurge in vernacular art is perhaps a measure of our improved prosperity. It is noteworthy, however, that some of the greatest art we produced, in terms of literature, the visual arts and so on, appeared during some extremely tough times. The works of Peig Sayers, Tomás O'Crohan, etc., which are among <Col N="1174" />the high points of the Irish language literature, came from difficult circumstances in the remotest part of the country, but they still shine as a beacon. In many respects, they could be compared to the works of Greek literature from the golden age in that they reflect the same insight into the human psyche and condition.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress the critical role of the arts in society. Without a flourishing artistic community and artistic consciousness, society is diminished. It is important that those values which art represents &ndash; even in their most extreme forms, and in forms of which we might not approve &ndash; should be manifest and able to flourish.</P>
    <P>There is an unfortunate tendency to compartmentalise rather than to see art as a totality. The elitist view of art considers that high art &ndash; whatever that is &ndash; is in some way superior to any other form. The origins of some of the great Russian musical works of Borodin and Tchaikovsky were in the vernacular. They came from Russian folk dances. Some people believe that art has to be remote from the ordinary community, that in some way it has to be elevated into the grand opera house and kept away, behind closed doors, from the general populace, which is totally wrong. This is not how is should be, but, unfortunately, that is sometimes the case.</P>
    <P>There was some recent controversy in regard to an artist portraying a murderer and another case where an artist portrayed a murder scene in west Cork. I would consider it distasteful if the intention is to glorify murder, but I do not think anybody could accuse either artist of doing that in these cases. Art has a responsibility to hold up a mirror to society and let us see ourselves as we really are. The literary works of Synge and O'Casey looked deeply into the human soul and at what it was to be Irish and, in so doing, informed our perception of ourselves.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Arts Council, I agree with the Minister's proposal that it should consist of a chairman and 12 members. I welcome the provisions of section 21 in regard to special committees. I agree that some areas should be treated as special cases because they are different, but, again, I return to the point that the arts should be viewed as a totality. Riverdance is no better or worse than the Clare set. le Brocquy is no better or worse than Trevor Geoghegan or anybody else. I could give many other examples in this regard. I deplore the attitude of the Royal Academy of Art in Britain which regards itself as the high priest and the sole custodian of the visual arts; the vernacular does not get a look in there. I will return to this point as I consider it extremely important that the arts be viewed as a totality. Christy Moore and Donal Lunny are just as much part of the arts as Ó Riada or Riverdance.</P>
    <P>If anybody had any doubts as to the health of the arts in this country, they only had to look at the event in Croke Park on Sunday night.</P>

      <P>We showed that we could compete with the best in the world and not just in terms of our music. The displays from Riverdance and Macnas were stunning and showed the vibrancy of the arts here. Only 20 or 30 years ago it would have been difficult to envisage us putting on a show of that quality. I am not referring to the visual effects, which have to do with technology, but the actual content of what we heard and saw. It was a matter of huge national pride.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a key role to play in regard to the arts. I am pleased that in my local authority area &ndash; that which comes under the remit of Kildare County Council &ndash; there is an active arts officer who has been instrumental in bringing art to the schools and the wider community, which is critical. The millennium project in Kildare was the erection of the Riverbank Arts Centre in Newbridge, which incorporates a theatre, exhibition space and so on. I had the honour of chairing the strategic arts management company in the county, which oversaw the development of the centre and subsequently brought it to the point where performances are taking place.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the funding issue and I take the point in respect of the Arts Council. Dealing with the Arts Council was certainly a matter of frustration for us, in terms of trying to extract moneys, particularly in the context of a new project coming into the system and trying to establish itself. I also acknowledge that, even in the context of financial difficulties this year, the county council found more money to finance that centre.</P>
      <P>We have also been highly successful in obtaining sponsorship for performances, shows, etc., which take place there constantly. A professional company put on a pantomime at Christmas, funded by the local rotary club, which was highly successful. Schools from around the area were involved and it was extremely beneficial. An important consideration is that the arts centre is open on a daily basis and includes a café where people can meet. Such a centre must be part of the community.</P>
      <P>In two centres of the kind to which I refer, the doors close after each performance and do not open until the following night's performance. That reinforces the image that it is somehow an entirely separate operation behind closed doors. There is a huge responsibility, in which local authorities can play a key role, to bring the performance ethos and art out into the community and schools throughout their areas. I note that health boards are among the local authorities mentioned in the Bill and perhaps the Minister should add the words &ldquo;or their inheritors in title&rdquo;. However, that is probably a debate for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the composition of the council, section 11 refers to people &ldquo;each of whom shall, in the opinion of the Minister, have a special interest or knowledge in relation to the arts or matters connected with the functions of the Minister or the Council under this Act&rdquo;. That is quite appropriate &ndash; people should have the relevant <Col N="1176" />knowledge. However, I appeal to the Minister not to choose those who see themselves as sole custodians of any art, be it dance, film, painting or whatever. He should avoid the cocktail circuit to which Senator Ó Murcú referred. Such people should be kept as far away from the council as possible.</P>
    <P>There are people who are extremely well qualified and knowledgeable about art and who should be involved in the council. In my view, however, there is a great deal of special pleading, as I have observed in respect of the body in which I have been involved at local authority level. People plead a special case, to the exclusion of all else, without having an overall vision of the totality of the situation, in terms of involvement of the community, schools and society as a whole.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill, in every respect. I wish the Minister well in the establishment process following its enactment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. As I listened to the contributions from the other side of the House, I wondered if this debate had taken place, for example, ten or 12 years ago, whether the same criticism would come from those benches. Are the Senators now disowning the endeavours of former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, in his work for the arts? Do they view that as just a fleeting episode of history, or are they serious in saying that it is simply the prerogative of those who attend cocktail parties and all that goes with such affairs? </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot have it both ways. I fully recognise the work Senator Ó Murchú has done for traditional Irish music throughout the country, including in my county, Galway. Ordinary people with a love of Irish music recognise the part he has played over the years. However, I do not consider his contribution to this debate, in taking the opportunity to pursue a vendetta against the Arts Council, appropriate.</P>
      <P>With regard to the 12 &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; whom the Minister will identify in the near future as members of the Arts Council, they should be seen as representative of and embracing all who have an interest in the arts. There should not be a situation whereby a finger can be pointed, as has been done, at certain people as being elitist in any way. We must remember that people laboured and gave life commitments in furthering their interests in particular aspects of the arts, without recognition from any Minister or Government. Even when no resources were made available, they persisted in their efforts throughout the years in the relevant discipline or aspect of art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators Ó Murcú and O'Meara stated, interest in traditional Irish music keeps communities alive. If there is any single bond linking communities throughout the country, it is traditional <Col N="1177" />Irish music. Irrespective of whether it was appropriate to lobby for expenditure in that regard &ndash; and for the proposed committee which has been shelved &ndash; I am not sure whether that was a demand on the part of the people themselves or whether they were prompted to provide a lobby group for that area. Leaving that aside, however, if the Bill is to achieve anything, it must take an across the board approach, levelling the playing pitch for all. If the Minister achieves that, it will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>The representation which the Minister brings on board in respect of the Arts Council will be watched carefully. The membership of the council and the interests involved will reflect the Minister's commitment to even-handedness in this issue. Earlier, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I have the overall responsibility for promotion of the arts, both inside and outside, and the Bill provides that, in performing my functions, I may consult with the Arts Council . I will be empowered to give a direction, in writing, to the council .</P>
    <P>I suspect that he is taking on board for himself and, in a sense, perhaps, politicising his power as Minister to influence the work of the council in future. That would be regrettable. I hope that the Minister will confirm in his reply to Second Stage that it would be regrettable that the Arts Council should be politicised in any way, including with regard to its composition.</P>
    <P>In the dungeons of many State buildings, works or items of art are being left to rot and go to ruin. That is regrettable. Successive Ministers with responsibility in this area did not get the resources to make those items available for display, either in some of our public buildings or in other appropriate venues. The arrangements in Collins Barracks are a credit to everybody involved in that regard in terms of utilising a vacated building to full capacity and displaying such a variety of items. There are vast resources lying in the dungeons in this city that could be given to local authorities, which could put them on display to enable people to have access to important items of art from our past. I hope the Minister will take that on board.</P>
    <P>It has been stated on numerous occasions that the arts officers in local authorities do tremendous work to encourage greater interest in the arts at local level. It is not a question of a cocktail circuit. It is a shame to over-emphasise the idea of elitism in the arts. It is a pity that such comments are being made by Government Members when, after 30 years, we are introducing a Bill in respect of this area. Local artists are not elitist and they do not want to be labelled as such. If we continue to label people because of their endeavours and their commitment to the arts, the Bill will fail. I hope that the Minister will rebuke anyone in the House who labels people in such a manner. It is of the utmost importance that we recognise the endeavours and commitment of art<Col N="1178" />ists. Everything does not revolve around Dublin. It is a pity that people have such tunnel vision that they cannot see beyond the Pale. There is artistic life beyond the Pale. It is unfortunate that Members on the Government side make such criticisms.</P>
    <P>As regards the arts in education, earlier today we highlighted the fact that many discretionary teachers will be withdrawn in the coming year by the Minister for Education and Science. One area which will be badly affected by such a cut is the arts, particularly music. Many young students would not have had the opportunity to study music were it not for the commitment of many management boards, principals and parent groups, which collected money to provide part-time music teachers in many second level schools. I ask the Minister to impress upon the Minister for Education and Science the necessity to fund the arts in education. The number taking art as a subject in school is declining because fewer teachers are providing tuition as there are greater opportunities for them to make a living outside the classroom.</P>
    <P>The financial support available to arts officers in local authorities &ndash; particularly in my local authority &ndash; is derisory compared to the work being done. We want to establish an alternative to the drink culture. If we could find another outlet for young people's energies, we could move them away from the pub culture. The Minister must provide funding. However, while the provision of &euro;100 to an artistic group in a community is welcome in the absence of anything else, it is derisory in the overall context.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister has a contribution to make to the arts. It is unfortunate that the arts is part of a wider area of responsibility, including sport and tourism, although perhaps they complement each other. The Minister must focus on this area. The responsibility is on the Minister to move forward. If we do not give adequate resources to the Irish Film Board, we will be in serious trouble. The Minister's predecessor had the imagination and the support to bring something important to this country. The Minister must examine his responsibility to the Irish Film Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on securing funding for the arts sector this year. Senator Cummins mentioned this issue. Funding for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in 1997 was &euro;26 million, but that has increased to &euro;48 million this year. That is an increase of more than 80% in six years. That is a large increase, particularly at a time when there is wrangling within the Government about funding for differ<Col N="1179" />ent areas.

      <P>The Minister has sought to ensure that funding has been retained for the arts during a difficult period. I recognise the Minister's efforts to position the arts in the tourism sector and to promote the concept of cultural tourism. Senator O'Meara referred to that matter. The Minister not only recognises the importance of the arts, but also their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the tourism industry in the future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is the result of much consultation and debate during the past five years. All the stakeholders were involved in that process. They made their contributions and compromises were reached, as is always the case when dealing with diverse groups in any sector. Two Ministers made an input. The current Minister and his predecessor, Deputy de Valera, did tremendous work to ensure the publication of a comprehensive Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to rebuke Senator Ulick Burke because the Minister may not want to do so. Certain members of the art world were taken aback by the Minister's knowledge, understanding and appreciation of the arts and by his willingness to listen. Although there are diverse elements in the Department, arts has always been to the fore and the Minister has played a leading role in that regard. That was recognised by many of the practitioners in the art world who were taken by surprise. However, we in Fianna Fáil know the Minister has been interested in the arts for many years.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important because it clarifies the relationship between the Government and the Arts Council. It puts in place a framework in relation to the broader issues of policy and strategy. It puts the Minister in the driving seat and that is welcome. There was some debate about whether the Bill would work. The new role envisaged for the Government and the Minister in the Bill and the initiatives which will be taken will ensure that it works well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about the Arts Council. I agree with Senator Ó Murchú, although Senator Ulick Burke made little of the concerns he expressed. However, there is a perception abroad that the Arts Council is elitist, non-representative and unaccountable. I agree with this. It is more than a perception, it is a fact for anybody who has been involved in the arts <Col N="1180" />world and who understands what is going on, particularly when it comes to the traditional arts and music and the role the Arts Council has had &ndash; or rather the role it has not had &ndash; in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Arts Council has no publicly agreed evaluation criteria and that is a problem that needs to be addressed, which the Bill does. There is, at present, no democratic accountability to the Minister and the Bill seeks to establish this.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council has been accused of being unresponsive to communication within the sector and the Bill aims to deal with that. The kind of ethos that has evolved within the council will come to an end with the passing of the Bill and this is welcome to many within the arts world. In light of the culture that developed, people within certain areas of the arts were not in a position to speak out because they were concerned about the lack of funding that might result at a later stage. The bias that was mentioned was certainly there. Senator Ó Murchú spoke of a kind of apartheid. That is more than a perception, it is a fact.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recognition of this by the Government and its predecessor, which has resulted in the introduction of this Bill. The Bill seeks to address problem to which I refer and put in place a council that is more accountable to the Government. Senator Ulick Burke will be afforded the opportunity to attack the Minister if anything goes wrong in the future. He already enjoys doing so on regular occasions, so we are making it easier for him to fulfil his Opposition duties.</P>

      <P>Up to now, the Arts Council and the Department may have worked to separate agendas. They certainly did so in the area of capital funding. The introduction of the Bill will change that by creating a legislative framework to generate an overall coherence. All public bodies will be required to follow Government policy on the arts, which is vital, and bringing in the local authorities ensures this.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on reaching a compromise on the issue of special committees. All sides had a very trying time while this was being sorted out due to people's entrenched positions. The debate focused to a large extent on the provision for traditional arts. Much of the debate resulted from the Arts Council's consistently ignoring this sector. There is no doubt that its policies ensured that the traditional arts did not get the recognition they deserved, which is disgraceful when one considers the importance of traditional Irish music, culture and identity. Senator Ó Murchú spoke eloquently of the importance of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in that regard and I agree with him. The Senator has been to the fore in the quest to ensure that the importance of traditional arts and music has been recognised. He has received little recognition for this from the Arts Council. His comments are justified.</P>
      <P>It was recognised that outside experience would be needed in establishing the special committees. The provision which gives the Minister the power to draft in members who are not necessarily on the council is useful because it recognises that, although the specific expertise might not be there, the Minister can draft in people other than those on the board. It is also good to establish a maximum of three committees at any one time because we do not want to lose sight of the overall arts plan. The Minister is going the right way in terms of dealing with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" />I welcome the size of the board. The number of members mentioned was 12. That is a workable figure. The previous number of members was unworkable, whereas a smaller board would probably not have enough expertise. As Senator Dardis said &ndash; I know the Minister is aware of this &ndash; the choice of appointments is critical to ensure the demise of the elitism, lack of accountability and lack of focus, from a Government perspective, that existed in the past. This can be done by ensuring that the people appointed have the capacity to discharge their duties, as recognised in forthcoming Government policy.</P>
    <P>That is the next major hurdle, but I have no doubt the Minister will ensure the matter is dealt with. A balance is required. We need practitioners and managers, but also people with practical knowledge of business, marketing and financial management and people involved in the arts. A good mix is necessary so that the board can fulfil the needs of artists, audiences and communities within a general cultural policy. I welcome these provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The provision that half the membership of the council must change within a 30-month period is crucial because it allows consistency, but also allows innovation over a period. This ensures that these two needs will be adequately balanced.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on the massive efforts he has made in terms of ensuring that all sides will be catered for and that the needs of the different interest groups will be met. I look forward to seeing the make-up of the board and the implementation of the Bill thereafter.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the Minister.</P>
      <P>Article 1 of our Constitution, which deals with the subject of national self-determination, speaks, among other things, about developing a cultural life of our own. The understanding of what that involves may evolve with time, but my perception is that the arts in all their forms are flourishing at present and have a great resonance abroad.</P>
      <P>We were reminded by Senator Ó Murchú that the Arts Council was founded a little over 50 years ago. Like Comhaltas, it was founded in an era when resources were scarce. Senator Cummins alluded to the fact that the first Minister to take a keen interest in the arts was Charles Haughey. Reference was made to patronage, but Mr. Haughey, as the Minister would agree, certainly had a strong relationship with the vernacular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. It was right that a sort of patronage should have developed into structures, including a Minister for the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work Senator Ó Murchú has done, with his wife, as director of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and the immense contribution <Col N="1183" />he has made to the traditional arts. During the past fortnight the Minister and I visited Brú Ború, which is a splendid facility. It is important, in terms of our cultural self-confidence, that the arts should have a solid base. That certainly does come from tradition; but it is tradition which is renewed, updated and modernised. If one reflects on the classical Anglo-Irish literature of the early 20th century, it would probably have been quite vapid without that relationship to the indigenous culture.</P>
    <P>The main reason I wanted to contribute to this debate &ndash; I referred to the magnificent facility in Cashel, which is available to arts groups all the year round &ndash; was to comment on the steady regionalisation of the arts in recent years. Any town of a substantial size wants to have its own performance facilities for local groups, visiting groups, etc. Many of them have to struggle. I am sure that the experience in my county is replicated in every other county. The people of Tipperary town went to immense efforts to build an up-to-date theatre/cinema with the café facilities of the kind that were referred to earlier. People in Carrick-on-Suir want to rebuild the Strand theatre. Every town of a significant size wants to have such facilities. In a time of more limited resources, we could consolidate those facilities and put them on a firm footing because they provide an immense service to communities.</P>
    <P>The job of the Government and the Minister is to provide structures and finance and I hope that the Bill will contribute to a situation where the arts bureaucracy, arts organisations, the Minister and the Department can bridge the gaps between them. In closing those gaps it is important to remember that artistic independence is important. It is a paradox that without both support and independence &ndash; though obviously within very wide limits &ndash; no great art would have been produced in the past. From observing him for many years, I am aware that the Minister is far too sensible and pragmatic to get himself involved in great cultural wars.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the institutions under the Minister's control about which he will have a number of policy decisions to make. The National Gallery and the National Museum are superb. Perhaps extra space could be made available at the National Museum by, as has been suggested, moving items out to different venues throughout the country. In my opinion, the decision to keep the Abbey Theatre in its current location was correct.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that there is more competition in the area of classical music. The advent of the Helix has, if anything, prompted the National Concert Hall to improve its standards. Competition in any sphere is always good. I have some doubts as to whether it is strictly necessary &ndash; particularly in a time of scarce resources &ndash; to move the National Concert Hall. I have to admit <Col N="1184" />that I have a great affection for its current location.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we need an opera house, as such, at this stage of our development, but we do need groups that perform opera and these are now travelling around the country. The Wexford festival is very successful and there is also the Opera Theatre Company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, many of the amateur societies as well.</P>
      <P>I wish to make two final points. With Cork becoming European city of culture in 2005, the Government has to contribute as much as possible towards making it a success. Cork already has a lively cultural life, but some extra support may be needed and should be given.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the collapse of the institutions in Northern Ireland has put something of a dampener on North-South cultural co-operation. The island, as a whole, provides, in many instances, a greater critical mass which makes some ventures possible. The previous Northern Ireland Minister for the Arts was interested in developing that co-operation. I urge the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to bear that dimension in mind.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister success with the Bill. It ought to be said &ndash; I do not believe anyone has yet done so &ndash; that funding for the arts through the Arts Council rose by an enormous amount during the past eight years, both under the previous Government and its immediate predecessor. It is on a far higher plateau than before and, therefore, far more artistic activity is receiving support. In the coming years we may have to, more or less, consolidate on a plateau and perhaps make the same amount of money go further. I hope the Bill will provide instruments for the Minister to do that effectively.</P>

      <P>I also congratulate the Minister on the Arts Bill 2002. He listened well and the consultative process that took place in recent years has worked in the best interests of promoting all sections of the arts.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the involvement of local authorities in the arts. I am sure that the authorities will play a leading role at local level, where arts officers have been appointed and funding has been made available. The Minister has retained sufficient powers in the Bill to ensure that it will work. It is in everyone's interests that all possible funding should be made available to promote the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 21 refers to the performing arts. I congratulate the Minister on the inclusion of this and I congratulate performing artists &ndash; particularly those in the area of traditional music &ndash; who have done tremendous work in tourism promotion in recent years. In my home town, Adare, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has provided numerous <Col N="1185" />shows on a seasonal basis, in a centre provided by Limerick County Council.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the Bill and I wish him well with it. Whatever finance is available should be made to work for the promotion of all sections of the art world.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill. It is crucially important that the arts are supported. The traditional arts have been the poor relation of the Arts Council in recent years, particularly when one considers that they received only 1% of a &euro;48 million budget. This is an indication that something is badly wrong. Were it not for Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann in the past 20 to 30 years, traditional arts would have been dead and buried. It is because of the work done by that organisation that the traditional arts are still alive and well in this country, and we are very lucky they are. I am delighted the Minister is taking the traditional arts into account and that they will have an input into the Arts Council when the Bill is enacted. I sincerely thank the Minister for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to extend my appreciation to all the Senators who have contributed to this informative and lively debate. The Bill is not just about the Arts Council, it is also about the arts generally and their relationship to local authorities. In addition, it is about the powers and functions of the Minister, as well as the functions of the Arts Council and the relationship of those who are involved in the arts with their development. It is not true to say that it should only be called an Arts Council Bill. Obviously the Arts Council is an integral and vital part of the system through which the Government supports the arts and, therefore, any Arts Bill will of necessity have to deal with the Arts Council to a significant extent. I stress, however, that the Arts Council will be independent on a day to day basis. As I have said in the Lower House, there is no democratic accountability if the Minister of the day is not empowered to oblige the Arts Council to implement Government policy. It is of immense importance that the people's representatives have a coherent input into the development of the sector. To do otherwise would be to abdicate our responsibilities, which is something I am not prepared to do.</P>
      <P>It is true that there were cuts of 8% in the Arts Council's budget for 2003 and it would be foolish of me not to acknowledge that these cuts have hurt certain sectors. They have to be seen, however, against the backdrop of an 80% increase in Arts Council funding over a five-year period. Naturally, as Minister for the arts, I will be doing everything to ensure that I obtain the best possible deal for the Arts Council next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of immense importance for the traditional arts to have a coherent policy and receive <Col N="1186" />adequate funding. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir Labhrás Ó Murchú. Is é mo bhun smaoineamh ar na healaíona ná gurb é an traidisiún bunchloch na healaíne agus gur gá é a chothú. In extending my appreciation to Senator Ó Murchú, I believe our tradition is the basis of how we engage with the arts. Artists respond to tradition which, in turn, evolves and clearly enriches our society. I see traditional and contemporary arts working hand in glove, as companions rather than as opposites. The old saying is, &ldquo;Briseann an dúchas tré shúile an chait&rdquo;, and I assure Senator Ó Murchú that this cat resoundingly supports the traditional arts and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>From the outset, I have understood and acknowledged the sense of grievance felt by people working in the traditional arts sector. I made no promises that I am now breaking and neither did the Government. In fact, I have sought to devise &ndash; and I believe that I have succeeded in this respect &ndash; a mechanism that will deliver what the Bill seeks to do, which is to have a properly thought out policy developed and put into effect for the traditional arts sector. Lest anyone has any doubts, let me re-state my belief that the traditional arts are a critical part of what defines us as a nation and as a people. We must cherish and support them.</P>
    <P>In appointing the new Arts Council, I will be seeking people who value and support all art forms, whether contemporary or traditional. The exclusion of any sector on the basis of personal bias or snobbery cannot be beneficial to the arts. Indeed, such people have no place in the development of the arts sector. In that context, we must recall the need for the Arts Council to be representative.</P>
    <P>Recently, when I visited the wonderful Brú Ború cultural centre in Cashel, County Tipperary, I said I was reminded of the statement by Daniel Corkery when he expressed his disappointment at some of the literature being produced by some of the post-colonial Irishmen writing in English. He pointed an accusing finger at the crowd attending the 1934 Munster hurling final and asked the immortal question, &ldquo;Who speaks for these?&rdquo; It would be right and proper for this House, which has played such a significant role in the cultural life of the nation, to acknowledge that the Abbey Theatre certainly did and that, from its inception in 1951, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann most definitely did also. It is important that these things should be acknowledged in a forum such as this, which has had so many distinguished Members representing the cultural strands of our nation.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the Bill prevents the inclusion of any art form. The definition of &ldquo;arts&rdquo; in the legislation is meant to be flexible, as art itself is flexible and variable. Anything creative or interpretative can be included within this definition, <Col N="1187" />although this does not exclude the need for proper value judgments to be made by the Arts Council and others.</P>
    <P>I certainly would not denigrate the efforts of former taoisigh and, in particularly, of Mr. Haughey&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;who made a marvellous contribution to the arts. He gave the arts a profile that they have never really lost. However, I suppose that policy in any sector evolves with time as more is learned from experience and new thinking adds to the mix. Every Minister who, at times, takes the trouble to reflect deeply, will bring something new to the Cabinet table and I hope I am now playing my part in that respect. I have already outlined to this House and to the Lower House the necessity for the Minister to be empowered in respect of Government policy. If such policy is not being implemented, the Minister of the day must have the power to ensure that it is. The Arts Council, however, will be independent in allocating funding and the arm's length principle will be maintained.</P>
      <P>I accept the importance of the Irish Film board and the film sector generally. I have repeatedly said that the board is central to our strategy for delivering in that sector. I read the contributions to this debate not as labelling artists as elitists but as stating that no one group should be excluded, that all arts groups should be encompassed by the broad definition in the legislation and must be not seen as valid but valued also.</P>
      <P>Several Senators recognised the important contribution local authorities could make to the welfare of the arts within their areas. They also stressed that, without funding, little could be done. I recognise full well the importance of funding for arts activities through local authorities. I will do my best during my time in office to strengthen the relative profile of the arts at Government level, particularly in the context of financial allocations. However, we must be realistic and recognise that, in the immediate future, funds will not be as easily obtained as in recent years. However, the strongest case should and will be made for the arts sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing arts legislation dates from 1951 and 1973 and the entire context in which the arts exist and operate has changed enormously since. Thankfully, they are no longer the preserve of a small group of people and there is general acknowledgement throughout society that they are for everyone. It is my fundamental belief that they must be seen as an integral part of life, essential to a healthy society, and a significant part of what makes life more than a drab functional, or perhaps mechanical, exercise at times. Coming from this starting point, I could never <Col N="1188" />accept that a particular vocabulary, accent, address or set of social conventions should be required of those presuming to participate in or enjoy the arts.</P>
    <P>Genius and excellence must be nourished and encouraged because, without the work of the most gifted, immense creativity would be lost. With creativity's loss, inspiration is also lost. It is of immense importance that those who express themselves in a form that leads to the conclusion that one is viewing, hearing or reading the work of a genius should be encouraged and cherished in order that others can follow their path, however far they can travel. The arts must always be inclusive, rather than exclusive, and we must be careful to avoid snobbery, however unconscious, creeping into our view of what should be regarded as art. I agree with Senators who made that acute observation.</P>
    <P>There is a perception in some parts of the country that certain art forms are the preserve of a few. That is a view the Department is tackling with great vigour and we hope to succeed in overcoming it. That is the reason there are arts officers in every local authority area. The delivery of arts policy to the people must be done locally and channelled through people at the coalface. We are beginning to succeed in this regard. For example, during a recent visit to County Mayo, I could not help but be struck by the work being done by the local authority, for which it deserves credit. Arts festivals are springing up all over the place. For example, Clifden and Cavan stage outstanding festivals.</P>
    <P>The definition of the arts is deliberately broad enough to encompass almost all arts forms and anything that derives from the creative side of human nature can be regarded as art. It is not necessary to be particularly or obviously talented to enjoy or appreciate the arts. Anyone who can see beauty in a painting, enjoy a good book or be moved by music has the capacity to enjoy the arts and that includes practically everyone.</P>
    <P>The legislation, therefore, is relevant to all of us. It ushers the framework for Government support of the arts into a new era. Everything moves faster nowadays and priorities and issues change all the time. The public expects us to be more attentive and responsive to its views. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism must have a role in shaping the context of Government support for the arts without infringing on the arm's length principle. Many State bodies and agencies have an impact on the arts and the Bill moves us a long way towards better co-ordination by all public bodies based on compatibility with Government policy on the arts. Local authorities are increasingly important players in this regard.</P>
    <P>Dance and circus are included as art forms for the first time. The Oireachtas is including them because it expects circus and dance to prosper as <Col N="1189" />we all know they can. It is relatively easy to know how this can be done.</P>

      <P>Molaim don Teach na leasaithe a rinne Dáil Éireann don Bille. I commend for the approval of the House the 37 amendments made to the Bill by the Dáil. The primary purposes of the legislation are to enable Ireland to give effect to an important United Nations agreement, protect vulnerable and valuable fish stocks and substantially reform sea fishing boat licensing with the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism. As well as clarifying and strengthening the appeals provisions of the legislation, as passed by the House in December 2002, the Dáil amendments also provide for the full transfer of sea fishing boat licensing functions from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to allow him to concentrate on policy issues and the long overdue filling of a gap in the Fisheries and Foreshore Acts to allow licence applications and other fees to be charged to help meet heavy and growing licensing administration costs. Such costs now exceed &euro;500,000 a year in each case and are growing. The particular fees to be charged and the timing thereof have yet to be decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" />The package of amendments falls into three distinct groups and represents significant additions and improvements to the Bill as passed by this House. Group 1, comprising 12 amendments, deals with the insertion of a new Part 2 in the Bill as passed by Seanad Éireann to fully transfer sea fishing boat licensing functions from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to restate with consequential and updating amendments section 222B of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959, the principal legislative text dealing with sea fishing boat licensing, and to enable fees to be charged for certain sea fishing licence applications, licences etc.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9, respectively, are the main amendments. Amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, 29 to 32, inclusive, 35 and 37 are merely consequential. Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 incorporate improvements suggested by Deputies Broughan, Coveney and Éamon Ryan, which we, on the Government side, were only too glad to accept.</P>
    <P>Group 2 comprises 21 amendments. Amendments Nos. 10 to 28, inclusive, and amendments Nos. 34 and 36 refine what is now Part 3 of the Bill dealing with appeals against sea fishing boat licensing decisions. Amendment No. 10 specifically provides that ministerial directives to any appeals officer may require the sustainability of fishing to be considered in appeals cases. Details of all such directives and the reasons therefor must be laid before the Dáil and Seanad and published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as soon as practicable after the directives are given, as required by amendment No. 12. Amendment No. 11 precludes ministerial involvement in groups of sea fishing boat licensing cases, as well as precluding ministerial involvement in individual such cases.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 ensures that the licence applicant or licence holder is a party to any appeal concerning that licence application or licence. Amendment No. 16 states clearly that licensing decisions may be appealed, namely decisions made one month after this Bill becomes law, and that licensing decisions are suspended while under appeal or until the appeal in question is withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 inserted a new section in the Bill as passed by Seanad Éireann, now numbered sections 13 and 15, to keep appellants and licence applicants and licence holders in the documentary loop, with the right to comment on relevant documentation not originated by them. Amendment No. 23 requires the appeals officer to consider any such comments before determining the appeal in question. The consequential amendments Nos. 27 and 28 to what is now section 17 of the Bill extend the time limit for receipt of such comments by an appeals officer to the next day on which the office of the <Col N="1191" />appeals office is open if the time limit otherwise expired on a day on which that office was closed.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 deleted the age limit for an appeals officer, while amendment No. 36 specifically provided for indemnity in court proceedings for any appeals officer in respect of any acts done in good faith as an appeals officer. Both of these were proposed by Deputy Broughan. The remaining nine amendments, Nos. 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25 and 26, are self-explanatory drafting amendments.</P>
    <P>Group 3, comprising four amendments, inserted a new Part 5 in the Bill as passed by Seanad Éireann, to enable foreshore application and other fees to be charged under the Foreshore Acts and made consequential amendments to other provisions of the Bill. The main amendment is amendment No. 33. Amendment No. 27 to the Long Title and amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which are technical referencing provisions for related Acts and provisions of Acts, are consequential on amendment No. 33. Amendment No. 27 is consequential also on amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9, already referred to. If any Senator requires any further information on any of the 37 amendments made to the Bill by Dáil Éireann, I will be glad to oblige.</P>
    <P>Agreement by this House to the package of amendments just described will result in significant improvements being made by both Houses of the Oireachtas to the key provisions of the Bill relating to the establishmebnt of an overdue independent statutory appeals process for sea fishing boat licensing and to providing greater transparency in sea fishing boat licensing, as promised in the current programme for Government. The sea fishing industry has sought such reforms for some time.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that, in response to concerns raised in both Houses of the Oireachtas, section 4 of the Bill now ensures that the question of the sustainability of exploiting sea fish stocks and other marine aquatic species generally has to be considered before a decision can be made as to whether or not to license a sea fishing boat. Furthermore, sustainability is specifically mentioned as an issue which may be covered by ministerial policy directive to the licensing authority under section 3 of the Bill or to an appeals officer under section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I note too the warm welcome of both Houses of the Oireachtas for Part 4 of the Bill, which will allow Ireland to participate soon in concerted international measures necessary to protect certain vulnerable straddling and highly migratory fish stocks from overfishing. Those provisions will also benefit the responsible sea fishing industry into the future.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and I are determined to ensure that the Bill will be oper<Col N="1192" />ated fully and fairly as soon as it becomes law. I again thank the Senators who contributed last December. Their valuable contributions initiated many changes in the Bill. Numerous useful amendments were also proposed in Dáil Éireann, which the Government was only too happy to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as it comes to its conclusion. It has had a long gestation. It is many years since I raised in the other House with the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Woods, the necessity of having a transparent and independent system for the licensing of vessels. There was concern in the past that some of those licences were given out in dubious circumstances. The industry itself, even up to four years ago, was looking for an independent appeals system which would be taken out of the Minister's hands.</P>
      <P>Much thought has gone into this legislation. I followed with interest its discussion in the Dáil where there was much teasing out of the amendments. I welcome the constructive spirit in which the amendments from the Opposition side were accepted for the enhancement of the Bill. It is timely and I hope it will be implemented as quickly as possible. It will be welcomed by the industry itself.</P>
      <P>The issuing of licences and the sustainability of expiring fish stocks are important considerations. I will not elaborate on the sequence of recent events and the allocation of licences. This is an important factor, not in relation to our own stocks but with regard to what is happening off the African coastline. Are we to exploit the fish in that location and create problems in other locations throughout the world?</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope it will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I welcome the Minister of State to the House for consideration of these amendments. Clearly, significant amendments were made to this Bill in the Dáil. It is a pity we have only a short period of time and only one opportunity to speak here in the Seanad. Nevertheless, I welcome the Minister's and the Department's open attitudes to the proposals put to them in the Dáil. It is clear from the Minister of State's words, and I know from my own colleagues, that a substantial number of reasonable and sensible amendments were accepted. I am very happy to accept them at this level also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues the Minister of State has touched upon in the amendments are all welcome. The only question I would raise concerns charges. Charges are never welcome for an industry. If media reports of the last few days are anything to go by, the industry has been taken by surprise by the level of increase in charges. The Minister says they are necessary to meet the cost of admin<Col N="1193" />istration, which we know has gone up at every level over the last number of years. The extent of charges has not matched the increase in the cost of administration. The other amendments which deal with the issues of sustainability, accountability and openness in the licensing process are to be welcomed. The amendments have improved the Bill and I wish the legislation every success. I hope it will enhance and improve the whole process within the industry.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister of State. This is indicative of the way in which we do our work in the Dáil and Seanad. Discussing items in both Houses means that changes can be made in either House. These issues receive a very good hearing and, by and large, we end up with very good legislation. I would be surprised if either of the Opposition spokespersons had difficulty with this legislation. Given what the Minister of State said, it appears the amendments, by and large, were tabled by members of their parties and accepted by the Government, which is good.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has said amendment No. 11 precludes ministerial involvement in groups of sea fishing boat licensing cases, as well as in individual cases. While I do not have a difficulty with this, from time to time, we seem to put such matters at arm's length and afterwards cry about it. When we are all back in the other House at some stage, we will perhaps want to table parliamentary questions to the Minister about sea fishing boat licences and will be told he has no responsibility in this matter. Members should then remember they were happy to table the amendment in question.</P>
      <P>It is not clear how the registrar general of fishing boats will be appointed. Perhaps the Minister of State will expand on this issue. Apart from this I am happy with the amendments.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators on all sides of the House for their support. We first discussed the Bill in the House last December and a number of amendments were tabled. There was a major debate on Committee Stage when Opposition spokespersons, Deputies Broughan, Ryan and Coveney, tabled a number of amendments which were accepted.</P>
      <P>On the issues raised by Senator Kenneally, we cannot have things every way. There were calls on all sides of the House for an independent body. We now have such a body which will deal with licensing. I am sure parliamentary questions will be tabled to Ministers in the future but if we are to have an independent body, it should be just that. The Minister should have no involvement whatsoever in issuing licences or dealing with the appeals which may follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I thank Senators for their support. We were pleased to accept amendments which would improve the Bill. My officials and I have no mon<Col N="1194" />opoly of wisdom on what is best for the fishing industry. It was important to accept amendments which would improve the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I receive no remuneration. I was appointed on a voluntary basis by Longford County Council.</P>
      <P>Longford swimming pool is probably the oldest in the country. In 1991 renovation work was carried out to the pool which was constructed in the 1960s to extend its life for a period of five to six years. Following an inspection in April 1996, consulting engineers, Malachy, Cullen and Partners, informed the council that it appeared likely the pool could continue to be used for another two to three years. We are truly on borrowed time in relation to the pool.</P>
      <P>In May 1976 Longford County Council commissioned a report from architects on the development of a new 25 metre, six lane indoor swimming pool, overlooked by a public spectator area for 200 people, with a learner-cum-children's pool, adult health suite, sauna rooms and bubble pool, fitness area and snack facilities, to be located at The Mall, Longford, a lovely leisure area, overlooking the River Camlin. All the required submissions and reports are with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for some time.</P>
      <P>Within a 30 mile radius of Longford there is a population of approximately 30,000 people. There is no other public swimming pool or water leisure centre in the area. A figure of 250,000 visits per annum is conservatively estimated for year one of the development. The pool will have a better opportunity to achieve financial viability by comparison with most other pools in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, met the company almost three years ago and gave the development its blessing. The council believed it would be at construction stage within 12 months. The most recent letter I received from Longford County <Col N="1195" />Council on 5 June stated the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation in its letter of June 2002 had approved the appointment of consultants to bring the project to contract document stage and that the status of the project at that point was that the consultants were preparing to enter the public planning process.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will agree there have been many assurances during the years in relation to the pool. It is grossly unfair that following several promises from the Taoiseach to our two local Deputies, we are still waiting. At this stage we need fewer promises and a definite commitment to a commencement date for the project.</P>
    <P>Longford is part of the BMW region and was projected as a disadvantaged area in last year's ADM report. It is now part of the RAPID programme which is supposed to accelerate development in disadvantaged areas. I am requesting the Minister of State to leave no stone unturned to prioritise and progress development of the pool. The people of County Longford have been fed half-truths for too long on this issue. We need this facility now and I hope the Minister of State will announce that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will be in Longford soon to lay the foundation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. J. Browne Mr. J. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Bannon for raising this matter and for affording me the opportunity to outline the current position on the application for funding towards the provision of a new local authority swimming pool in Longford town.</P>
      <P>The aim of the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, is to assist local authorities in the provision of swimming pools. I would like to recall for the Seanad the administrative procedures in force under the programme.</P>
      <P>Following an initial submission and approval of a feasibility study, there are four distinct stages, which a swimming pool project must complete. In order of progress, these are: preliminary report; contract document; tender; and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department.</P>
      <P>Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been received for the project and the grant aid is capped at the time of allocation. Grants of up to a maximum of &euro;3.8 million are available towards the refurbishment of existing pools or the provision of new pools, subject in either case to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1196" />Since 2000, some 55 projects have been or are being dealt with under the programme. Grants were paid to ten swimming pool projects in Arklow, Courtown/Gorey, Dundalk, Ennis, my hometown of Enniscorthy, Monaghan, Navan, Wicklow, Roscommon and the Aquadome in Tralee. These projects are now complete. Four projects are at, or about to go to, construction phase in Finglas, Ballinasloe, Tralee, and Grove Island, Limerick. In addition to the 14 projects mentioned, 41 other applications are at various stages in the process: five have passed contract document stage; 18 have passed preliminary report stage; 13 have passed feasibility study stage; and five applications are under further consideration.</P>
    <P>Turning specifically to Longford, the answer I am giving seems to contradict what Senator Bannon said. I am aware that the existing swimming pool in the town has served the community well over many years. The view locally, however, is that it needs to be replaced. As a result, Longford County Council proposed that a new integrated leisure complex incorporating a swimming pool be constructed at The Mall, Longford. In August 2001, the then Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, approved the preliminary report submitted by Longford County Council for the proposed new pool. This approval allowed Longford County Council to proceed to the next phase, namely, the preparation of the detailed contract documents for the proposed work. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism awaits the submission of the contract documents and will consider the application further, in consultation with Office of Public Works, when all documentation is received.</P>
    <P>On a more general level, I am pleased to say that throughout the country there has been steady improvement in the quality of the facilities now being provided under the programme. There is increased sophistication in the applications being made by local authorities and there is a welcome deeper emphasis on sustainability of projects. I welcome this trend of looking more closely at the life cycle of a swimming pool and on the vital issue of usage rather than just on the capital cost of a project, although this is also a critical factor.</P>
    <P>Swimming is a sport in which most people can participate from a very early age, continuing throughout their entire lives. Among leisure and recreational activities, swimming is still generally considered to be one of the best and most enjoyable forms of physical exercise for developing and maintaining good levels of physical fitness. While I do not have up to date statistics on the numbers of people swimming as a form of physical and recreational activity, the 1996 national survey of involvement in sport and physical activity indicated that swimming was second only to walking as the most popular form of physical and recreational activity.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the promotion of sport generally and the development of facilities, such as swim<Col N="1197" />ming pools, are carried out in a strategic and focused way, which means establishing priorities, avoiding overlaps and ensuring maximum public access to available facilities. I am anxious that the investment of taxpayers' money by the Government provides value for money by ensuring that attractive, viable facilities are built and with the level of funding provided for 2003 by my Department at &euro;61 million, in respect of the sports capital programme, and &euro;9 million, in respect of the local authority swimming pool programme, the commitment to sport by the Government is being sustained. Since 1998 more than &euro;2.3 million has been provided, through the sports capital programme, to various sports clubs in County Longford.</P>
    <P>In formulating future policy on swimming pools, the officials in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism intend to carry out an expenditure review of the local authority swimming pool programme. This review will examine how the programme has worked to date, the benefits which have accrued to the areas where pools have been built through the existing programme and what amendments, if any, are required to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of the programme.</P>
    <P>In August 2001, the then Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, approved the preliminary report by Longford County Council and, two years later, the Department is still awaiting the contract documents. Perhaps the Senator might take the issue up with Longford County Council to find out why there has been such a delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>After Longford, Tipperary is number two on the RAPID list and, although it relates to a different subject, the case I will make is very similar. The Cathaoirleach may be familiar with St. Ailbe's vocational school in Tipperary town. It is a fine school in the sense that the students and teachers do good work. However, they have to contend with what are really deplorable conditions. I am raising this on the Adjournment because it seems to be the most effective way to bring a matter that needs urgent remedial action to the attention of the Minister and his civil servants.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to maintain that nothing has been done. A new fence around the school was provided last year because many people were clambering on the roof and it was not possible to solve the roof problems until the building was properly fenced off. Leakage and damp are affecting several of the schoolrooms and buckets need to be used on wet days. The school would not pass any health and safety inspection test. New buildings are not required, but extensive refurbishment of the building and of some of the elements in it is needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision of an effective dust extraction system is needed in the woodwork rooms. New equip<Col N="1198" />ment such as vices, replacement saw, workbenches and safe power supply sockets are required. I have seen all of these on more than one occasion. There is dampness in the floor, on the walls and on the ceilings, the paint on which can be seen peeling off in certain places. The toilets are in a deplorable condition. The staff room facilities are totally inadequate. A range of problems has been brought to the attention of the Department, in respect of which action is awaited.</P>
    <P>There are three secondary schools in Tipperary town and the other schools have been attended to and have received considerable investment. St. Ailbe's vocational school among others caters for the least advantaged people in the town, which is disadvantaged, under the RAPID criteria. It is time that we put our money where our mouths are. We talk a great deal about disadvantage and I fully respect the Minister's priority in putting disadvantage at the top of his list. This is a prime case for him and his officials to consider. By any test, it is a school catering for disadvantaged people who deserve a chance and deserve the support of the Government.</P>
    <P>Interdepartmental co-operation may be required as the school authorities have submitted a joint application with St. Michael's football club, and with the sports centre, for sports facilities. The excellent sports facility in the town, the Canon Hayes recreation centre, is heavily oversubscribed. Many of the schools are in one particular area and what is really needed is an extra facility which will take the overflow. That facility would be built on land adjacent to St. Ailbe's and could, perhaps, solve some of the problems in terms of toilet facilities, etc.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Department to look closely at the situation in the school because it would be the highest priority to have the work done, if not this year then certainly in the 2004 programme. I fully expect to see it there and will play my part in trying to put it in place.</P>

      <P>St. Ailbe's vocational school is a co-educational school with a current enrolment of 388 pupils. It is one of three post-primary schools operating in Tipperary town, the others being St. Anne's secondary school and the Abbey school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Tipperary South Riding Vocational Educational Committee &ndash; the management authority of St. Ailbe's vocational school &ndash; applied to the Department of Education and Science for both additional accommodation and refurbishment of the existing accommodation at the school. In advance of making any major capital investment at the school, and consistent with standard practice within the Department of Education and Science, the long-term viability of the school must <Col N="1199" />be assessed. This assessment is undertaken by the planning unit within the Department.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the application for additional accommodation and refurbishment of the existing school was referred to the Department's planning unit to assess the school's long-term viability. This assessment is currently underway and until this process is completed, substantial capital investment cannot be made at the school.</P>
    <P>With regard to the improvement works I must point out that these are, in the first instance, a matter for the school authority. I am pleased to inform the House that, during the past five years, the Department of Education and Science has provided a total of &euro;168,845.22 in capital funding for St. Ailbe's vocational school.</P>
