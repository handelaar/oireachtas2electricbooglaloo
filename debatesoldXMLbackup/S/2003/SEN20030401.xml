      <P>I have received notice from Senator Browne that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate when a decision on the granting of temporary accommodation to Bennekerry national school, Bennekerry, Carlow will be made.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Quinn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure budgetary considerations do not lead to the closure of beds by hospitals, as has been reported to be the intention of the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin and others.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposing the Order of Business as we support the programme of work the Government has set out for today. Will the Leader tell us when she will provide time for a debate on Iraq? There have been countless calls from all sides of the House since the debate that took place three weeks ago. Will she make an hour or two available at some stage this week? It is not imperative that a Minister be in the House to hear the debate but there are many issues that need to be discussed. My party has today brought forward in the other House a substantive motion which I hope the Government will support, that Ireland take a leading role in relation to the humanitarian relief now so urgently required in Iraq, given the scale of the conflict taking place. I ask the Leader to make time available this week for a debate on this important issue.</P>
      <P>As the Leader is aware, thousands of our schoolchildren and their parents have protested on the streets today about the crisis in the Government's plans to refurbish and extend school buildings. More than 700 primary schools up and down the country are awaiting important work on their school premises. Will the Leader provide time over the next week or so for a debate on the matter? It is wrong that students, parents, managers, teachers and principals should have to take to the streets in order to get the point across that buildings of Third World standard are not acceptable in this day and age. The Leader will have sympathy towards their cause, as she suffered because of broken promises from the Government in her constituency before the last general election, as I did. Lies were told by candidates during the election campaign and they are now coming home to roost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of anger on the streets. People were promised school buildings and refurbishments. This was guaranteed to them. The general election is over and now, seven months later, it is all up in the air. I ask for a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>I concur with the comments made yesterday by Senator Minihan who quite bravely pointed out that we could not take part in the first deployment of the EU rapid reaction force in Macedonia because of a difficulty that had emerged. I am seeking a debate on neutrality which is long overdue. There are many opinions on the issue but the Seanad is where the debate should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Brian Hayes's comments in support of what my colleague, Senator Norris, has been saying for the last two weeks: we must have a continuing debate <Col N="515" />on the conflict in Iraq. There is an appalling picture in today's world newspapers showing the reburial of 600 of the 10,000 victims of the massacre in Srebrenica. It is only eight years since it happened but it is outstanding as one of the most remarkable incidences of neglect on the part of all of us. We European politicians who were in office at the time stood idly by. What is happening in Iraq is the slaughter of innocent people which we will regret in the near future. We will wonder about how it happened and ask for explanations.</P>
      <P>We need to discuss our role in the context of what is happening in Iraq. I have asked time and again for a debate on neutrality. People were appalled and aghast at the fact that nothing was done in Srebrenica. They were also aghast that nothing was done about Kosovo. Although that is different from the Iraq issue, we need to give a political lead on these issues, if not any other kind of lead. We need to have a thought out position. A debate on Iraq which can focus on what is happening there would be extraordinarily useful, if only to allow Members of this House to articulate their views. It would be appalling to stand by without at least formulating a position.</P>
      <P>The journalists of the world have let us down on this issue &ndash; embedded journalists, biased journalists, and television stations on which we can no longer depend for fair news.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Irish media as being quite superb. RTE and <i>The Irish Times</i> have been particularly outstanding in their unbiased commentary. We need a fair view and it would be very useful if European politicians, including ourselves, decided to go on a delegation to Iraq to see what is happening there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We could report on what we see happening there and tell the truth as we see it, whether we agree or disagree. There are Irish doctors, nurses and religious there and there are Irish troops in that area. There are all sorts of people there and I do not see why we should not be prepared to take a stand, if only to state what we see. We are not getting the truth in the news and it is impossible to know what is going on. I hesitate to make any judgment on the basis of what I see on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for an urgent debate on the war in Iraq. One of the most worrying aspects is whether we really know what is going on and whether we can trust the information coming back to us. In that regard the work of the journalists from RTE and <i>The Irish Times</i> in particular should be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite that, it is very difficult to know what is really going on in Iraq and the extent of the <Col N="516" />humanitarian crisis. It looks increasingly likely that this war could go on for months, if not years. We cannot stand by and pretend we have no role and nothing to say. There is a clear need for political leadership and for us as a sovereign nation to have a view on this. We should be working behind the scenes at the United Nations to ensure it is brought to an end in as speedy a manner as possible. The terrible consequences, which are already evident, must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Connected to that, it is important that we look at the issue of the economy. Yesterday the Small Firms Association expressed its deep concerns about the level of job creation and increasing unemployment. It is not unrelated to the issue of the war in Iraq, because the longer that continues the more unstable will the world economy become.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on why so many schools' boards of management, parents and children were lied to, misled and told untruths in the days before the election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy to read that into the record and will probably do so in the very near future. It is a scandal of huge proportions and will certainly come back to haunt the Government because people are rightly quite angry. They were used, abused, misused and lied to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that all sides of the House agree to keep the situation in Iraq under review and that we discuss it openly. The House has a good tradition of bringing a balanced and informed view to bear on all matters of this nature. Although I made this point last week and it is a cliché, truth is the first casualty of war. This is clear in this case. We have reached the point where we wonder on whom we can rely to give us the truth in the news. From that point of view we are fortunate in having distinguished Irish correspondents out there. It is also unfortunate that the dissenting views of distinguished news-gatherers should cause them to resign or be fired from their jobs because they bring a different perspective to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not to comment on the legitimacy of any perspective, but people have the right to report in the way they think is correct and professional.</P>
      <P>The House should examine the Law Reform Commission's review of the tribunals. They were established by the Oireachtas, so this House has a direct interest. The commission has made proposals as to how the tribunals could be conducted more efficiently and how the legal work on behalf of represented parties could be minimised. There was also a suggestion that certain hearings could be broadcast. There is a pointless nightly charade whereby RTE employs actors to recreate tribunal proceedings from the official record, but it would be easy to install cameras. It is a measure of the law's lack of accountability and transparency that proceedings are not held in full view of the public gaze. I understand the commission also points out that, in certain circumstances, private hearings would lead to more speedy conclusions. The report is a comprehensive document and the House should examine it, given that the Oireachtas establishes tribunals in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised the absence of radiotherapy services in the mid-west region on previous occasions and my colleague, Senator Cummins, has also raised the issue in connection with Waterford. Only 16% of Irish cancer patients receive radiotherapy, while in the EU the average is 66%. A march was held on Saturday at which people expressed their concerns about this issue. I have inquired on many occasions when the expert group on radiotherapy services, which first promised its report in February 2001, will present that report so there can be a definitive cancer strategy for the entire country. It is not good enough for the Minister for Health and Children to say, prior to Saturday's march, that he will extend BreastCheck to the entire country without providing information on the timeframe involved, on the likely cost or on the staff resources that will be allocated. It is time this issue was taken seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the appropriate Minister to come before the House for a debate on insurance? Motor insurance premia for young drivers and small industrial concerns continue to rise. The latter cannot afford to pay their insurance premia in many cases because of the increase in costs. Members have asked for a debate on this matter on previous occasions and I acknowledge that we had a recent Private Members' debate on it, but it must be addressed as a matter of urgency. We cannot allow the current position to continue to obtain because so many people are suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the honourable behaviour of Government Members who, in firm tones, supported calls for a debate on Iraq. Their stance may lead to pressure from within their par<Col N="518" />ties, but I have no doubt that they will be vindicated by history. I join others in calling for such a debate. Will the Leader will give an indication of the particular times at which a series of rolling debates can be taken? I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that a Minister need not be present. On the last occasion the Minister did not come before the House, although the debate was attended by a good Minister of State. We must have such a debate regularly, particularly in view of the issues that have been raised by my colleagues on all sides of the House about journalism.</P>
      <P>We are lucky to have people such as Lara Marlowe and Richard Downey. I salute their enormous courage. Even Rupert Murdoch's <i>The Sunday Times</i> carried an extraordinary headline with regard to a massacre of 12 civilians, in which a US soldier said, &ldquo;Iraqis are sick and we are the chemotherapy.&rdquo; There has been another massacre. Seven women and children were massacred last night and when it was announced, the so-called reporter, dressed in army fatigues, gave his version of what had happened before the investigation had even started. We have seen the sacking of Peter Arnett, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, and the engagement of a convicted liar, Oliver North, to comment for one of the main stations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader try to confirm with the US authorities that they are jamming Al-Jazeera and that American agents are hacking into the Al-Jazeera website in order that people in this country cannot gain access to it? I support Senator O'Toole's remarks about a delegation. I am an SRC, a state registered coward. I do not enjoy danger or the prospect of pain but I will go if this is organised. We should ask members from other European parliaments to go with us. We should make ourselves as safe as possible. I do not wish to be blown up and the more people we have from other parliaments, the safer we will be.</P>
      <P>I propose a change to the Order of Business, that we take No. 22. Not only are we allowing Shannon Airport to be used but also, most shamefully, Casement Aerodrome. Think of the ironies. Casement fought for the Putamayo Indians and the people in the Congo against the exploitation of King Leopold and the genocide that occurred there. He would be turning in his grave. I propose that No. 22 be the first item of business today.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader make time available for a wide ranging discussion on transport in view of the intervention of the Minister for Finance which came to our attention over the weekend? He believes some of the transport projects and proposals coming before Cabinet are unrealistic. There are many projects which require decisions. We are aware of the impending break-up of CIE. Today permission was granted for the construction of pier D but the Minister <Col N="519" />has told Aer Rianta to defer a final decision. The Luas project is overrunning its budget while work is ongoing on the port tunnel and the upgrading of the M50.</P>

      <P>Last week a nuclear expert in Brussels stated Sellafield was Europe's top terrorist target. This is of great concern to Irish people. Several constituents contacted me about the issue over the last ten days or so. It is important to have a debate on security at Sellafield. Since the war started it has become Europe's top target. Dublin would be within a 100 mile radius of any consequential fallout at the plant, a matter of serious concern. I demand a debate and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs tell the House what measures have been taken by the British Government to guarantee security at the plant.</P>

      <P>I join colleagues who have called for a continuing debate on Iraq. It upsets me greatly, as I know it does every Member of the House, to see the television pictures and newspaper photographs of the result of this terror on civilians in Iraq. The pictures show young children and their parents with distraught looks on their faces and terror in their eyes. It upsets me greatly that this war is continuing and no doubt will continue longer.</P>
      <P>I must also mention a domestic issue, although when I think of how those people are suffering, my heart is not in it. The issue concerns the exorbitant cost of keeping a prisoner in custody compared to the costs in Scotland, England and Wales. This matter needs to be addressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. These costs have risen by more than 38% in the five year period to 2001. I am asking the Leader of the House to raise this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Today, the first ever peacekeeping operation led by the European Union commences in Macedonia. Unfortunately, Ireland is not taking part, even though I think 99% of the Irish people would say that we should. The reason we are not involved is the triple-lock mechanism whereby one country, the People's Republic of China, has vetoed a UN mandate, yet we have unanimous EU support for the mission. This poses serious foreign policy questions for us <i>vis-à-vis</i> our EU colleagues. We have become tied up in legal and political loopholes from which we need to extract ourselves. I would urge the Leader to arrange a debate on this serious issue.</P>
      <P>I support the request by previous speakers for a rolling debate on Iraq if for no other reason than to strike a balance in the comments that are being made in the House. Finally, I wish to state that there are no cracks on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I formally second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator <Col N="521" />Norris. While enough has been said about the horror going on in Iraq, we deserve an explanation of the things that are being done in our name. It would be appropriate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to attend the House weekly, not only to explain the Government's position but also to tell us what the Government thinks is happening because nobody else seems to know. It might be enlightening for Members of the House to get an update on what is actually happening on the ground. I presume the Government's sources are better than our own and, indeed, better than most of the journalists' out there who have only a limited perspective.</P>

As we are all aware, the key question to be resolved is the extent to which we would limit the entitlement to constitutional justice of the citizen and be consistent with fair procedures. I am delighted to welcome the document on which it would be useful if the Leader of the House could arrange a debate in this House. Fair views would be expressed. I am delighted that the Law Reform Commission is organising a seminar on the subject and has promised a final report in due course.</P>

It is no wonder that insurance premiums are at the level they are at in the light of what is going on in that practice. A debate on the sector would be useful.</P>
      <P>I also raise the need to have a debate on sport, in particular sports facilities. I am referring to the national stadium. Concerns expressed over the weekend about supporters of rugby not being able to get to the match because of a lack of seating capacity show that there is a need at an early stage to bring forward proposals, on which I am aware the Minister is working. I would like a debate with the Minister on the project in this House in the near future.</P>

      <P>I also suggest to the Leader that we should have a debate on the Gulf War during which she should restate the position she stated previously, that this House is in favour of peace, that divergent views can remain in the search for peace and that Members on this side of the House also seek peace.</P>

I am aware the Leader is a distinguished former Minister with responsibility for this area. A debate on Mr. Michael O'Leary's comments last week to the Joint Committee on Transport and the remarks of Mr. Noel O'Hanlon, chairman of Aer Rianta, would be beneficial. It seems ludicrous to build a pier which may be demolished soon afterwards if the second terminal goes ahead and to proceed without a proper debate on the matter.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes sought a debate on Iraq but said the presence of a Minister was not imperative. However, if we have such a <Col N="524" />debate it would be important to have a Minister present or else we would end up snarling at each other. I tried to organise such a debate last week and will try again this week. There might be an opportunity tomorrow as one of the scheduled debates may not go on as long as anticipated. I will revert to the party leaders before then.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes also wants a debate on school refurbishment, but the Minister for Education and Science has issued a comprehensive book outlining where each school stands in that regard. Harking back to the last election is fine if the Senator wants to make a political point, but that will not help us to help the schools. It is more important to concentrate on what has been laid out by the Minister. Senator Hayes praised Senator Minihan's point on Macedonia and a debate on neutrality might be useful.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also sought a debate on Iraq and suggested an all-party delegation should travel to that country. Many Members put forward their names in an act of great courage. I will make inquiries but it is a war zone and I understand the Department of Foreign Affairs will not issue travel permits.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara also mentioned the war in Iraq and in particular the fact that we cannot get the right story. That is the most appalling aspect of this conflict. If one turns on one station a certain event is highlighted but on another station that event is not even mentioned. If journalists are embedded on one side, to use that daft term, then they are clearly on that side and embedded journalists seem to have forsworn or given up their integrity. Senator O'Meara called for a debate on the economy and referred to what the Small Firms Association said about the need for jobs. That organisation is itself involved in job creation, as we were reminded by another speaker. Such a debate would be helpful.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis mentioned a dissenting journalist in Iraq being removed from centre stage. He also referred to the Law Reform Commission and a review of tribunals. Bearing in mind that the Dáil and Seanad set them up, we should be sufficiently emboldened to seek a debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of radiotherapy services and asked when the report of the expert group on radiotherapy, appointed by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, or his predecessor, would be published. We are all pleased the BreastCheck programme is to be extended countrywide as we all know people, whether in our extended families or in our circle of friends, who are suffering from cancer. I welcome the Minister's decision to extend the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien called for a debate on insurance. The House recently debated the punitive costs of insurance. At the request of Senator Leyden, the debate was taken on an all-party basis. People, particularly young drivers who may need a car to travel to their first job, are still receiving huge car insurance bills, while home and business insurance costs are also significant. <Col N="525" />As the Tánaiste has instituted a process which, we hope, will lead to a reduction in insurance costs, I will request that she comes before the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on Iraq and tabled a motion to that effect, seconded by Senator Ross, which appears on the Order Paper. Senator Morrissey called for a debate on transport to discuss a number of issues which have arisen recently, including the upbraiding of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. I smiled when I read the newspaper reports on the matter as I could paper a wall with the letters I received from the Minister for Finance when I was Minister for Public Enterprise. It is the job of the Department of Finance to constrain spending by Ministers and ensure &ndash; Senators should pardon my awful pun &ndash; they do not go off the rails.</P>

There should be no surprise about the actions of the Department of Finance, whose job has always been to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Ministers whose job is to say &ldquo;Please&rdquo;. Although wires often get crossed in the process, both Ministers in question know the score.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon raised Sellafield, an issue on which several of his constituents have approached him, and noted it is the top target of terrorists. I am sure he is correct. Senator Leyden called for a motion on Israel and Palestine. It would be useful if he were to circulate the text of a motion and place it on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry raised the war in Iraq, in particular the suffering of the children there. She also raised the cost of keeping prisoners in custody. This issue could be addressed when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, comes to the House on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan raised the absurdity of the triple-lock mechanism which hinders us from taking part in the European Union mission in Macedonia and stated most people here favour participation in peacekeeping missions of this kind.</P>

    <P>Senator Dooley also called for a debate on insurance. The recent television programme on fraud to which he referred was astonishing, particularly its depiction of supposedly seriously injured people dancing the tango. I hope this important programme will feature in the debate. The Senator also asked for a debate on sporting venues. I understand the IRFU and the FAI will make submissions on this issue to the Government in the coming weeks, which should be interesting. A debate on sport would be useful.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on Iraq to be linked to the wider issue of peace. He also called for a debate on tribunals. I am unable to refer to the matter raised by Senator White.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt expressed a willingness to go to Iraq, which he has visited previously. I will inquire about that matter. Senator Kitt also said that when the names of those who were prosecuted for not disclosing bogus non-resident accounts were published, the banks that encouraged them to do so were not mentioned.

    <Title>Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2003: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>The origins of this Bill were established with the passing in the Dáil on 12 December last of a financial resolution which essentially amended the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 and the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992 in respect of rates of motor taxation and trade plate licences. However, the resolution has only a limited life and to continue its effect, it needs to be replaced by a Bill which provides a permanent legal base.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give that permanent legislative basis to the new motor tax rates set out in the resolution. These rates apply to tax discs taken out for periods commencing on and after 1 January 2003. A standard, across the board increase of 12% is provided. The Bill also contains two technical amendments to motor tax law and an enabling power to the Minister to facilitate the processing of on-line motor tax applications. The technical changes relate to extending the national vehicle file records to include vehicles prior to first taxing or vehicles never taxed and to remove an Irish punt amount, the euro equivalent of which is already in place.</P>
      <P>Why is the Government proposing to increase motor tax? To set a context for our discussion, it is important to make it clear that motor tax is not paid into the Exchequer. In this regard, it is very different from other taxes. Motor tax is paid directly into the local government fund established under the Local Government Act of 1998. All the money in the fund is ring-fenced specifically for local government. This means it can only be spent on local government and cannot be dipped into and used by the Exchequer for any other purposes. To underline the independence of the fund from the Exchequer, we maintain its account in a local bank close to the Custom House. In addition to motor taxation, the fund is augmented by an annual contribution from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The fund is used primarily for two purposes &ndash; to enhance non-national road grants to local authorities and to finance the general purpose block grants allocated to authorities each year to assist them in their day-to-day current expenditure. With the increases in motor tax provided for in this Bill, we have been able to increase the amounts available in general purpose grants to local authorities in 2003 and maintain the provision for the non-national roads at the record levels set in 2002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the local government fund, motor tax was paid into the local government equalisation fund that was used to finance local authority general purpose grants. The fund did not, however, provide any money for roads. The channelling of motor tax receipts <Col N="528" />into the local government fund and the use of the fund for non-national road grants have created a link between the amount of tax paid by motorists and the service they get for that tax in terms of better roads.</P>
    <P>The motorist is seeing the benefits of significant and efficient spending on non-national roads. The national development plan provides for the investment of &euro;2.43 billion in the non-national road network between 2000 and 2006, significant by any standards, and it is important that this money is well spent. As I indicated in the debate on the Bill in the Dáil, last year's independent evaluation of investment in the road network, carried out by Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, concluded that the non-national roads programme was being operated on a reasonable and efficient basis. The non-national roads measure is one of the best performing in both the south-eastern and BMW regional operational programmes.</P>
    <P>Continuation of this good work by local authorities depends on their having adequate resources at their disposal. That is the reason we are increasing the rate of motor tax and trade plate licences. For this year, &euro;434 million is being allocated to local authorities for non-national roads.</P>
    <P>Along with funding roads, adequate finance must also be provided for local authorities to perform all of their functions and continue to provide good quality services for the public. Local authorities now face increased costs across a spectrum of services. If they are to continue their good work and improve the quality and level of service they provide for the public, they need extra resources. That is the reason we are increasing motor tax rates &ndash; the increases have allowed the Government to increase general purpose baseline allocations to local authorities by 6% over and above the 2002 grant levels.</P>
    <P>The new rates of motor tax set out in the Bill are the same as those provided for in the financial resolution and apply to tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after January 2003. Standard increases of 12% have been applied to the old rates. Increases of this level must be viewed against a background of inflation increasing by 33% in the last ten years in comparison with a 12% increase in motor tax rates.</P>
    <P>The new rates for all vehicles are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. Rather than taking up the House's valuable time listing every new tax rate, I would make better use of our time highlighting some details of the proposed changes for private cars and goods vehicles that make up 91% of the national fleet. For private cars, the following are some examples of the levels of increase. For the lowest engine car size of under 1,000 cc, the annual rate increase is &euro;15. This represents an increase of 29 cent a week. For cars in the 1,001 cc to 1300 cc bracket, the annual increase is between &euro;23 and &euro;28. For cars in the 1,301 cc to 1,400 cc range, the additional annual increase is &euro;30.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" />A total of 60% of the national car fleet is made up of cars under 1,400 cc. Therefore, the annual extra costs for most motorists will be between &euro;15 and &euro;30, that is, between 29 cent and 58 cent weekly, or, to put it another way, between 4.1 cent and 8.2 cent a day. For the remaining cars, the increases will range from &euro;32 for cars not exceeding 1,500 cc up to &euro;137 for cars over 3,001 cc. Less than 0.5% of the cars are in the 3,001 cc plus category.</P>
    <P>As with private cars, the effect of the 12% increase in the rates for goods vehicles will vary depending on the size of the vehicle. While the rates for private cars depend on the cubic capacity of the vehicle, the rates for goods vehicles are based on the unladen weight of the vehicle. Some four fifths of goods vehicles qualify for the lowest level of charge, meaning that they will pay an annual increase of &euro;26, or 50 cent per week.</P>
    <P>A 12% increase also applies to trade licences, or trade plates. As the House may be aware, these are the green registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles temporarily in their possession, in lieu of taxing such vehicles. While there are strict restrictions on the use of the plates, they are transferable between vehicles. The increase for a pair of trade plates will be &euro;27.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas there was an Adjournment debate in this House on funding local government. During the debate Senators expressed concern about the increasing costs which local authorities were facing in 2003 and underlined that local government must have adequate funding to perform the functions entrusted to it. The Bill before the House is about local government, ensuring it has the funding it needs and ensuring it is in a position to adequately perform its functions and provide good local public services across a range of areas contributing to national, local and community development. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="530" />As a politician, citizen and car owner, I object in the strongest possible terms to yet another stealth tax imposed by the Government on me and the people, in particular those I represent. Once again, citizens are being asked to make up the financial shortfall, the direct result of the ineptitude of the Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. This new assault on our pockets follows numerous other charges imposed by the Government since the general election. For what purpose? </P>
    <P>Is it not logical to assume that such a tax, while unwelcome, would be used for road maintenance programmes? Logically, the answer is, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but we are now faced with another Government deception. Despite indications when the increase was announced after the budget that the revenue would be used for such a purpose, we now find that it will be used to replace Exchequer funding. In other words, we are once again being asked to prop up the Government.</P>
    <P>With the increase in hospital and local authority charges to name but two, we are yet again spending considerable time debating tax increases and broken Government promises. The tax may have been passed by the Dáil on 12 December 2002 but it was passed with the support of the Government parties, not the Opposition. It angers and galls me to see two Deputies from my constituency, one from Fianna Fáil and the other from the Progressive Democrats, claim that they had had no act or part in the increase in motor vehicle tax.</P>
    <P>Since the general election we have suffered increases in tax, ESB charges, bus and rail fares, VHI premiums, college registration fees, hospital charges, and charges for local authority services such as water, refuse, parking and planning, while cutbacks across the board have left us with decreased services.</P>
    <P>The health service has seen an increase of 5% in the face of a 10% inflation rate, which means even worse services. The situation is hopeless in my area of Longford-Westmeath &ndash; the Midlands Health Board area. In Longford-Westmeath Hospital patients, including those insured with the VHI, are on trolleys as we speak, waiting for beds despite the fact that fully equipped units are in place &ndash; two in Mullingar &ndash; which could accommodate 12 patients but we are waiting for &euro;1.3 million in Government funding to staff and operate them. Even to maintain pre-budget services, hospital managers' budgets would have had to rise by &euro;350 million. The actual increase was in the region of &euro;26 million. Drugs refund and long-term illness schemes have been cut by 10% in real terms.</P>
    <P>There has been a cut of 4.5% in real terms in the roads budget. Soon we will be returning to the pothole era on county roads. Rail services have seen an 8.5% cut in service development budgets. I have received numerous representations from those who use the Dublin-Sligo rail line about the conditions which they must <Col N="531" />encounter. I see no evidence of anything happening to improve rail facilities.</P>
    <P>The Department of Rural, Community and Gaeltacht Affairs has had its development budget cut by 20%. There has been a 68% cut in the western development fund and a cut of 25% in CLÁR programmes.</P>
    <P>Cuts and levies have come one after another in agriculture, totalling around &euro;200 million in the last budget, something which affects farmers nationwide. There have been cuts in community employment schemes which support the community in every parish. There was a huge cut last November and we are promised a further 20% cut in the schemes this fall. Teachers and students across the country are walking out of schools today to protest at cuts in the schools building programme announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>With those cuts came new increases. The non-indexation of tax bands in budget 2003 meant an effective increase in the tax burden of around &euro;300 million. The average family will pay an extra &euro;400 per annum. Hospital charges are up 26% to &euro;40 a visit. VHI charges are up over 13% for domestic users, over 8% for small businesses and over 4% for industrial users. College registration fees have risen by 69%, from &euro;396 to &euro;670. Effectively, free third level education has been scrapped by the Government. Bank and card charges are up 108% while the television licence fee is up by 40% to &euro;150.</P>
    <P>All this flies in the face of repeated pre-election promises by Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats candidates that there would be no cutbacks or increases. Does the Government think it is dealing with a very gullible nation? Let me assure the Minister of State that this is not the case. The Government is dealing with a nation sick to the core of political mismanagement and carrying the can for the Minister for Finance's ineptitude. No biblical story could rival the situation in which we now find ourselves. The rewards of years of plenty have been dissipated or destroyed by the Minister for Finance, and years of famine now follow naturally, despite the Taoiseach assuring us before the general election that the public finances were in good shape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the increase in motor tax being an extension of the Government's &ldquo;we screw up, and you pay&rdquo; policy, where is the logic? Given environmental considerations and attempts to promote public transport, surely it would have made more sense for the increase to <Col N="532" />have been put on motor fuel. A fuel tax would ensure the more people drive, the more they would pay. Such an equitable arrangement would have had an offshoot benefit to the environment and provided a strong encouragement to leave the car at home. Why not reward those who try to minimise their annual mileage? As it stands, drivers who will be paying through the nose to tax their cars will certainly not take kindly to being asked to leave them at home and look for a bus.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State where is breaking point. Through the charges that the Government is levying, it is the largest single contributor to increased inflation. An increase of 12% at a time when inflation is running at 5% is totally unacceptable. How long can the nation's tolerance, allied to its ability to pay, or lack thereof, maintain the current deficits? Is the motorist easy prey &ndash; a pawn in the hands of a Government intent on hitting those least able to react? The 2 million licence holders carry a burden equal to 20% of entire tax income because, in most cases, they have no alternative.</P>
      <P>Many motorists have opted for private transport because they are caught in the trap of necessity. For those outside the immediate environs of the city, cars are a necessity, not a luxury. The motorist, who is essentially making up for the lack of adequate public transport, is being penalised because of his or her need. The motorist is not only at the mercy of Government tax. Insurance companies continue to charge exorbitant premiums while petrol companies maximise profits by setting prices regionally.</P>
      <P>Budget 2003 saw yet more increases in the tax burden on motorists, already amounting to approximately &euro;4.4 billion. This is now being followed by a 12% increase in motor tax. How much more will motorists accept before the burden becomes a very serious political issue, which, allied with other increases and broken election promises, will soon see them call the Government to account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I also join in the welcome to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher. I very much welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to the debate on this Bill. I was just looking at some of the information leaflets available in the inquiry office for those who visit the Houses of the Oireachtas. They indicate that legislation in a democratic society should be fair and make Ireland a safe place. Looking through the schedule of charges for motor tax, in particular, I notice that the rate of duty for a small car not exceeding 1000 cc is &euro;144. It goes up to &euro;278 for cars under 1400 cc, &euro;298 for cars under 1500 cc and &euro;372 for cars under 1600 cc. As the Minister of State said, these rates cover most cars in the country. However, the rate of duty on cars exceeding 3,000 cc is &euro;1,279 or approximately £1,000. It is useful that the legislation includes this schedule, which gives us an <Col N="533" />opportunity to discuss the roads and how we conduct the business of charging motor tax and trade plate licences.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated that there are two technical amendments on motor tax law in the Bill and that there is also an enabling power for the Minister to facilitate the processing of on-line motor tax applications. This is an interesting development. People often forget that information technology is available in every town and parish. Last night I attended the opening by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, of an information technology unit which uses an old school at Clan Doyle near Glenamaddy in County Galway. Glenamaddy is famous for the song about the four roads. I am sure there are four roads to every town, but there are four particular roads to Glenamaddy.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The building in question is used for training, mostly for elderly people who want to learn about on-line technology. They want to learn simple applications such as how to send e-mails to members of their family who live abroad and access replies. When this course was discussed some time ago, certain people objected to it on the basis that the money might be better spent on public health nurses, carers or providing an ambulance in north Galway. However, it is useful that on-line facilities such as e-mail and computer training are available and obviously these will be useful following the inclusion in the Bill of the provision to which I refer.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the receipts for motor tax, including driver licence payments and trade plate licences, will go into the local government fund, which is ring-fenced for local authority purposes. Obviously that fund is used for discretionary grants for day-to-day expenditure and in respect of non-national roads. I could speak at length about the non-national roads. Galway is the second largest county and has many non-national roads, in respect of which we do need a great deal of funding. A considerable amount of road tax is collected in the county and this goes into the local government fund.</P>
      <P>It is not the only fund concerned. There is Exchequer funding, funding from commercial rates and charges and fees for services. There are also specific Government grants available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>County Galway contributed over &euro;5 million in 2003 and, therefore, there is a huge contribution to road tax receipts from the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues to which I wish to refer is the CLÁR programme. A sum of &euro;2 million has been made available for the programme in 2003. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, recently announced that <Col N="534" />a number of additional areas will come under the CLÁR programme. That is good news. Sometimes we think of the programme as providing extra money for water and sewerage schemes, towards sports capital grants or through the Leader programmes. However, it is important to point out that it provides funding for roads. Specific improvement works can be included&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>A sum of &euro;2 million is being provided this year and, as already stated, there is extra funding coming into County Galway which should give us a good non-national roads network.</P>
      <P>I also wish to refer to the local improvement schemes because they can make a good contribution to roads. I am concerned here with roads on which there may be no houses which lead into lands or bogs. A total of &euro;800,000 is being provided for 2003 in our area and that is certainly a scheme which should be supported. The Minister has provided funding and in recent years we have seen that increase. I am glad that with CLÁR and the local improvement scheme, we are making progress in that regard.</P>
      <P>The other import issue I wanted to raise is the link between motor tax and the local government fund. The Minister of State made that link clear in his contribution. We have seen the improvements in roads and local government services as a result of the fund and, from 1 January, these particular increases will be coming into effect to be ring-fenced for the local government road programme.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that 60% of the national private car fleet is made up of cars under 1,400 cc. The owners of such vehicles should have to pay the lowest increase and the Minister has gone about providing for that in a real way, particularly when one considers the example I gave of what one must pay for a car over 3,000 cc.</P>
      <P>It is also clear that there is not a bottomless pit of money for the Government and that the motorist must be considered. One of the real issues for people driving cars is not so much the payment of road tax but the question of insurance. That is an issue which we could find time to debate on another occasion. It is not particularly the Minister of State's area, but it is an issue which I hope we will discuss shortly in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The huge insurance increases &ndash; not only in the motor insurance area, but right across the board in the area of public liability &ndash; were mentioned on the Order of Business earlier. Motor insurance is an issue about which we are all concerned. I hope that, with the advent of the penalty points system and the success of that scheme, the Tánaiste will follow-up on this matter and that <Col N="535" />there will be a reduction in motor insurance premia.</P>
    <P>One insurance company, Hibernian, stated that joining its scheme would lead to a 20% reduction in premium. I welcome that development and I know people who have benefited from the scheme. On the other hand, I read a letter in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last week about a person who joined the Hibernian insurance scheme and who subsequently found that the &euro;4,000 premium he was originally quoted remained the same. That is extremely disappointing. There are a number of questions we need to ask about the scheme if that is the case. The motorist concerned stated that he was now selling his car, which is disappointing.</P>
    <P>A sum of &euro;434 million has been allocated for non-national roads this year, which is much the same as the amount provided last year. I hope we will use this money efficiently. When I say efficiently, I mean, for example, that over the years small, patchy repairs have been made to roads. Such repairs do not really last more than a day or a week. When we tackle the surface dressing or resurfacing of roads, it is important that we do so properly. It is good that the local authorities have their three-year or five-year programmes, but it is also important to get around to these roads and repair them properly.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of road markings because they seem to differ from county to county. One need only travel from Galway, where I live, to Dublin to see major changes in road markings as one passes into different local authority areas. For example, cats' eyes are used in some counties and not in others. There are inconsistencies and we should be able to devise a plan which will ensure that these markings are better. Some markings which would be easy to provide &ndash; even the white line in the middle of the road in some cases &ndash; are not in place on some smaller non-national roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has mentioned that more than &euro;5 million is to be provided this year for signposting. Many road signs throughout the country have been interfered with. The result of this vandalism can be very confusing for everyone, especially for tourists who are trying to find their way.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;fingerposting&rdquo; of which the Minister has spoken has been very successful. I hope the money he is now providing will be used in the provision of more of these signs, which are not usually interfered with, as the smaller signs unfortunately are. A sum of &euro;25 million is being provided over five years, which is a very good amount to be dedicated to signposts. Let us make sure that money is used well.</P>
    <P>I did not say much about trade licences. The increases proposed in this area are small. Our main interest in this debate, however, is the private car. Car owners have been tormented by the cost of insurance more than anything else, although this might change with the success of the penalty points system. Perhaps the Minister of <Col N="536" />State could pass this on to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is to be hoped that the committee being chaired by Deputy Cassidy will be able to come up with proposals to ensure we have a reduction in these costs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am glad that the money to which this Bill refers is being ring-fenced for the road fund, which is very important, and I hope it will be used efficiently by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</P>
      <P>In the 1950s, my father ran a ballroom in Skerries. This was during the time of the showbands and the big ballrooms. At the time, there was a tax on each dancer. The ballroom owners of Ireland held a big meeting to call on the Government to tax ballrooms by size instead of taxing each dancer. This would be of considerable benefit to the ballroom owners. There was a big campaign, but when they were ready to take action, my father stood up and said he did not know whether it was a good idea. He said that back in the earlier part of the twentieth century, there was a tax on cars. The case was made for taxing the petrol instead of the cars because this was a better indicator of road use. The Government of the time thought that was a great idea and put a tax on petrol as well as on cars. My father said he did not think one should ever propose a new tax to a Government because it would impose it and leave the other one there as well. The campaign fell apart.</P>
      <P>I will make a proposal rather like this today. We have a problem with traffic in Ireland and we do not always use our laws and our taxes in the general interest. We usually use taxes just to get money. We have not thought this through. If we have a serious problem with traffic and do not use public transport enough, maybe we should consider ways of encouraging its use. I want to use this debate to highlight a basic mistake in the way we tax cars and other vehicles. Front-loading the costs gives people a vested interest in using their vehicles as much as they can. What we should do is make it more expensive to use one's vehicle. We need to move towards a system in which people pay the cost of using their vehicles as they go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do we tax vehicles at the moment? First, we impose a massive registration tax, which adds to the cost of buying a car in the first place. Then we tax people on a yearly basis, as set out in the Bill before us. Finally, we tax them through their use of petrol. The effect of the present balance of costs is that before a person actually drives a single mile in a vehicle, he or she has already incurred quite a significant cost. This is added to by the flat-rate charge of insuring the vehicle, which is the same irrespective of how much the vehicle is used. The upshot of this is that because of the way people pay the costs of motoring, they have a built-in incentive to use their cars as much <Col N="537" />as possible. This is because the more they drive, the cheaper it becomes on a per-mile basis.</P>
    <P>This skewing of cost becomes more important when public transport is brought into the equation. In most cases, the choice a person makes is not between driving somewhere and staying at home, but between using private transport and using public transport. If a person has already paid a large amount for his car he will use it. The way we arrange motoring costs means that public transport never gets a look-in. This is because for any given trip, the traveller has already paid a very large part of the cost of going by car in the up-front costs of buying, registering and insuring the vehicle. If he goes by public transport, the fixed cost of his private transport stays the same &ndash; he has already paid for it, except for the petrol, which is only a small cost &ndash; but he must pay for public transport. He has an incentive to travel privately rather than by public transport. This is not in the interest of the State.</P>
    <P>I am saying all this in the context of a declared national transport policy of encouraging people to use public transport. Making that a reality will depend on the availability of high-quality public transport, which we do not have. We will have to invest much more in public transport if we want to succeed in this aim. However, even if we provide high-quality public transport to meet people's needs, there will remain a cost question in every travel decision they make.</P>
    <P>We have two choices: we can either make public transport cheaper by subsiding it even further, or we can rearrange the costs of private motoring so that we pay as we go rather than paying up front. As a long-term policy, we should seek to shift the costs of motoring away from fixed costs and towards individual journey costs. As I said earlier, I am always loath to propose any form of additional tax, because a Government may decide to leave the current one there and add the other, but I suggest that we lower the registration charges or do away with them altogether and lower the yearly charges, while at the same time encouraging insurance companies, however we can, to charge on the basis of how much and how often people travel. To compensate for these lower charges, we should increase the tax on petrol and consider introducing an element of road charging, as we have seen in the UK recently, to be implemented during rush hour in our busiest cities and towns.</P>
    <P>We do not currently take the longer-term objective into account. We simply add on to the cost of buying and registering a car as well as the cost of petrol. Taking a long-term view would mean reducing the basic cost of the car and increasing the cost of running it, so that we encourage people to use it less and use public transport more. If that means introducing road charges during busy times in cities, well and good. If we reorganise the cost of motoring to reflect properly our long-term policies on national public transport, we will find it easier and faster to bring about the realisation of these policies. I recom<Col N="538" />mend such an approach by the Government. While I know it will not happen in this Bill, the Minister should consider it as it takes the broad longer-term picture into account.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt talked about the responsibility on local government for road marking. I see around the country exactly what he described &ndash; different standards in different counties. Responsibility for the carnage on the roads is not just in the hands of the drivers alone. On occasions there is very bad signage and we can do something about that. The answer lies in the hands of local government and we should find some way of encouraging it to raise its standards in that area and thereby reduce the number of deaths on the road. I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and give those thoughts to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Nobody relishes the thought of having to pay more for what used to be a luxury but in many cases is now a necessity &ndash; a private car. However, the fact that the resources generated by these measures and the local government fund in general are ring-fenced and used specifically to improve the roads, among other things, justifies the increases to a certain extent. There are similar examples in local authority areas. The parking charges in Dublin city have been very successful and those moneys have been invested in improving facilities for motorists.</P>
      <P>The dramatic improvements in the quality of the roads throughout the country bears testament to the commitment of the Government to the enhancement of our infrastructure. In ways we are victims of our success. The increase in employment and the standard of living in recent years have obviously led to an increase in the number of cars on the roads, a phenomenon we have all experienced. The expenditure of &euro;1.71 billion on non-national roads between 2000 and 2002 has borne results.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt mentioned road markings and signage. Although there is a certain discrepancy when moving from county to county, these have dramatically improved. While this improvement has prevented a number of accidents, more needs to be done on this area.</P>
      <P>If possible motorist education should be seriously considered, particularly in secondary schools and colleges. If some of the revenues raised were targeted at this area, it would complement the points system, which has proved particularly successful in recent times. The Traffic Education School at Clontarf has been a huge attraction for schools throughout the city. For years it has been used to educate youngsters about the rules of the road. These issues have to be tackled at a young age. People are driving at a younger age and in many cases it is impossible for them to get insurance, but that is another day's discussion. Incentives for people to improve their driving skills should also be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" />The footpaths in Dublin city have always been a significant issue, particularly in residential areas. In recent years there have been huge improvements. Dublin City Council has undertaken a comprehensive programme of footpath improvements, which has greatly enhanced a number of estates and streets throughout the city. This came about as a result of the local government fund. It has also reduced the opportunity for often spurious claims for damages against the council and has saved significant money over the years.</P>
    <P>Other allocations under the fund include traffic management as well as safety improvement works. I recently visited the Dublin City Council traffic management centre, a multi-million pound state of the art facility that has improved traffic flow. Traffic problems would be ten times worse if they were not managed properly. The resources generated by the increases proposed in the Bill can be put towards specific training of staff and officials in local authorities to give them the expertise to manage the problems we are experiencing. These resources are crucial to improving safety on our roads.</P>
    <P>People do not mind contributing if they can see improvements in the services which are used on a daily basis. A number of groups and individuals have objected to bin charges. However, my experience from visiting residential areas, particularly in the inner city areas, is that the introduction of the wheeled bins has improved the environment on housing estates and in complexes throughout the city and in the suburbs. Once people see an improvement in the service being provided, in many cases they do not object to contributing towards it. There have been examples of estate management cleansing, which has improved significantly over the years. There have also been improvements in footpaths and road surfaces.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section in the Bill allowing for on-line processing of motor tax applications. For years people used to spend three or four hours queuing up to tax a car at the office in Chancery Street. The service has improved with increased staff levels and better use of technology. People are now guaranteed that it will take less than an hour to tax a car. This is a huge improvement considering the number of cars in Dublin. While the decentralisation of some of these services to the suburbs was costly and entailed negotiation with staff and unions, it has proved extremely successful.</P>
    <P>Anybody driving around the country can see the physical improvements. The signs and road surfaces are better. Ten years ago the biggest joke on television related to the number and size of potholes. We do not hear that anymore.</P>

      <P>I can assure Senator Brady that potholes are back with a vengeance, which is clearly a reflection of under investment, particularly in non-national roads. Senator Brady spoke about the supposed level of improvement in roads, but for a country as wealthy as ours &ndash; despite what we have recently been told &ndash; that should be reflected in the state of our roads. It is not. Instead billions of euro have been spent on roads which show no signs of being built. There have been massive overruns on projects, management mistakes in planning, a roads authority incapable of managing projects this size and general mayhem in delivering a national roads infrastructure.</P>
      <P>On top of this comes a 12% increase in motor tax, suggested in such a way that we could expect a 12% increase in investment on roads or even a 12% improvement in non-national roads in particular. Of course we know the reality is very different. This is yet another attempt at a con job by the Government. When the 12% increase was announced in December one would have expected it to be matched by an increase in the local government fund or in the allocation to the local authorities for non-national roads. However, that is not the case. As members of local authorities know, the local government fund has been frozen at last year's level which, when inflation is taken into consideration, represents an actual decrease.</P>
      <P>In January 2003, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government announced an allocation of &euro;433.98 million to local authorities for non-national roads compared to the 2002 allocation of &euro;438.46 million. This represents an actual decrease of almost &euro;5 million, even before one takes account of inflation. In 2002, some &euro;221 million was allocated for restoration grants but, in 2003, this figure declined to &euro;216 million. This is part of the Government's trimming at the edges and constant undermining of public services in a culture of stealth taxes, which are intended to make up for the shortfall in revenue. It also underlines the Government's ideological position whereby, on one hand, it has reduced personal taxation and promoted itself as a low tax Administration, while, on the other, it increased indirect and stealth taxes at an extraordinary level, particularly since the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list of increases in taxes and charges since the election is phenomenal. In the health area, a visit to a hospital casualty department &ndash; where one may have to wait hours before being seen &ndash; now costs &euro;40. In 2001, VHI charges were increased by 9% followed by a larger 18% increase which was announced, unsurprisingly and following the general election, in September 2002. The failure to increase the thresholds for medical cards has meant that a swathe of people, including pensioners under the age of 70 years, <Col N="541" />does not qualify for medical cards. The threshold for the drugs payment scheme has risen to &euro;70, which means that people have to pay more for essential drugs. There has been 13% of charges on domestic ESB bills. College registration fees have increased by 69%, effectively abolishing free fees. Bin charges have also increased throughout the country at a much higher rate than inflation. The TV licence fee has risen to &euro;150, which is a substantial increase. Bank card charges have increased by 108%, one of the most obvious stealth taxes introduced in the last budget.</P>
    <P>It is against this backdrop that the legislation comes before the House, masked by some technical changes such as putting water taxation on-line. This is yet another stealth tax and it is a burden on an already oppressed section of the population, namely, drivers and car owners who rely on their vehicles to travel to work, school or their place of business.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn's comments on public transport were interesting. The level of investment by the Government in national motorway projects is extraordinary, particularly in light of the under-investment in public transport. The strategic rail review has still not been published and I am beginning to understand why, particularly when one considers the recently published correspondence between the Ministers for Transport and Finance. It is clear that a major tussle is going on at Cabinet regarding the cost of investment in rail infrastructure and the commitments made to it and already made public by the Minister for Transport. With every week that passes and the failure to publish the strategic rail review, it becomes clearer that a battle is being lost by the Department of Transport. I will be curious to see the final publication of that review, how it differs from the leaks and what will be the bottom line, namely, whether funding will be provided to upgrade rail infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The massive over-dependence on cars means that motorists feel strongly about where their motor taxation revenue goes. Most of them are of the view that 100% goes towards the upkeep of county roads, although we know that is not the case. County roads are extremely under-funded. The latter is also increasingly the case with local authorities. Motorists will become increasingly angry when the increased motor taxation they are paying out will not be matched by any great improvement in the roads on which they travel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised in the Dáil the issue of tertiary roads, on which I commend him. These roads in estates or rural areas are those about which people feel most strongly. If Senator Brady wants to see some potholes, he is welcome to visit north Tipperary and I will show him potholes and roads in a state of virtual collapse.</P>

      <P>I will show the Senator what it means to live on a tertiary road and find it <Col N="542" />impossible, however badly it is needed, to obtain funding from a local authority to repair it. The fact that using such roads regularly reduces the life of a car adds to the costs incurred by motorists. In that context, the legislation is unwelcome because it is yet another attempt by the Government to con people. The level of investment in non-national roads is down this year and the increase in motor taxation by the Government is another example in a long list of stealth taxes that have been imposed since the dishonest general election we endured last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and thank him for his contribution.</P>
      <P>The income from motor taxation, which has paid directly into the local government fund since its establishment in 1998, is used for non-national roads and the general purposes of local authorities. In 2002, local authorities' current expenditure on the non-national roads programme was &euro;3.2 billion and, in that year, the local government fund contributed &euro;987 million, or 31%, of the financing of local authorities' spending on non-national roads.</P>
      <P>The viability of local government is dependent on these funds to carry out its functions in an effective and efficient manner. To continue this work, the local government system will need extra resources this year. The national development plan provides an investment of &euro;2.43 billion in the 2000-06 period, which would pay for some 90,500 kilometres of county roads. If we are serious about regional development, we must improve funding for non-national roads.</P>
      <P>We have achieved a great deal since 1995. Many Opposition speakers referred to the state of the roads at that time, but anyone who was then a member of a local authority knows that the state of non-national roads was raised at every meeting. The non-national roads programme can stand alone in terms of what has been achieved in that six year period. In 1996 there were 47,000 kilometres of non-national roads in a bad state of repair. This has been reduced to 29,000 kilometres. In other words, 62% of those roads have been restored. That is a good achievement in that period of time. The new rates for motor tax and driving licences, an increase of 12%, will ensure local government is adequately financed to performs its functions and build on the great progress made in the last six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of safety measures on non-national roads has been raised. As roads have been improved, it is important that sufficient funds are made available for safety measures. The signpost programme is also important, particularly for the tourism industry. As non-national roads offer <Col N="543" />access to many scenic areas, it is important that finance is made available for signposting. National speed limits will be reviewed in the near future. I ask the Minister of State to consider reducing the speed limit on national roads in some areas for safety reasons. I wish him well with these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>Although it is not relevant to this Bill, I envy the Minister of State the magnificent road which goes through his constituency from Sligo. I wish a similar road would materialise some day between Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir. I welcome the Bill, despite the fact that I will be adversely affected by it. It will provide a 16% increase in own resources for local government. Better funded local government, where there is a degree of independence in its funding, is important.</P>
      <P>I am surprised to hear the Labour Party acting as the party of the angry motorist. Its view, if I correctly understand its finance spokesman, has been that tax levels in general are too low. If one is seeking a progressive tax system, there is nothing unprogressive about motor taxation. In general, the poorest sections of the community do not drive cars. <i>In abstracto</i>, to be competitive with other countries we should be in a position to reduce various forms of taxation, including motor taxes. At present, however, given the big increase in the number of cars, the high degree of congestion and with the Kyoto Protocol hanging over us, it is difficult to make the argument for reducing taxes in that regard.</P>
      <P>The upkeep of non-national roads is an issue. Part of a road near my home was re-tarred last year and is already showing signs of fraying. The Department should use some type of quality control to ensure that when work is done on a road, most of it will not be eroded within less than 12 months. Otherwise such work is almost tokenism. Cats' eyes have greatly improved safety on twisting roads in some parts of the country. The local authority in County Tipperary has a good programme in this area.</P>
      <P>All Senators will be well aware of the deficiencies in the signposting system after trying to find different councillors during the recent election campaign. I support the review of speed limits suggested by Senator Brennan. I hope we will change the system to kilometres and adjust speed limits, both up and down according to the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investment in public transport has been mentioned. In 1997 the budget introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, contained zero Exchequer funding for public transport. Any moneys provided came from the European Union. That situation has been transformed. There is a large amount of work to be done but it is a bit rich to be attacked when the Government is spending hundreds of millions of euro in taxpayer's money on public transport. That provision did not exist until five years ago. However, that does not mean we should throw money at <Col N="544" />the problem. I said as much when we were debating the Finance Bill. We must spend wisely and not over-extend or bankrupt the country. We must spend on investments that will make the greatest difference.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure local government is adequately funded, both for non-national roads expenditure and other purposes. A large programme of work stretches ahead of us with regard to regional and other county roads, the roads between important towns such as the road between Tipperary and Thurles. One could give dozens, if not hundreds, of other examples. The standard of these roads has deteriorated which means that they are slow to travel on and, in many places, dangerous. We are concentrating most of the resources on putting a motorway and upgraded dual carriageway network in place but there is a big programme facing us for regional roads. If we increase funding for local authorities, they might be able to make a decent start on the programme without waiting until all the national road improvements are finished. That would be important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill should be put in context. It provides for an increase of 12%, an increase introduced by stealth after the Budget Statement had been made and Members had gone home for the Christmas recess. Suddenly there was an announcement in the newspapers that motor tax was to be increased by 12% across the board.</P>
      <P>I often wonder if the Government, in imposing increases, ever takes account of the consumer price index and inflation. Inflation was running at 4.6% but look at the range of increases that have occurred since the Government was re-elected. In all cases the increases have been in excess of the rate of inflation. College registration fees were increased by 69%. The same occurred with VHI and ESB charges. Take any example one wishes. At the end of the day, purchasing power has been reduced.</P>
      <P>During the period of the Celtic tiger a survey was carried out, prior to the general election, which found that seven out of ten people believed their quality of life had improved over the previous five years and that they had more money. However, that is not reflecting the current reality. The Government pats itself on the back for matching the funding for non-national roads allocated for 2002. As there was a general election in May 2002, there was an excessive increase. At Estimates meetings members of the Government parties could feel good because they were announcing a big increase in funding for roads. The time to get such funding was prior to May 2002. Now, however, reality is dawning and a different situation prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get real. The Bill represents a 12% increase. Since 1998 motor tax revenue has gone directly to the local government fund. However, what about the motorist and the haulage industry? The 12% increase in motor tax and the sub<Col N="545" />sequent rise in diesel costs mean that hauliers will go out of business because they operate in a competitive market.</P>
    <P>In talking about non-national roads Senator Brady is very fortunate to be a Taoiseach's nominee because if he had had to travel the 26 counties during the Seanad campaign, as I had to do after the general election campaign, he would have seen the condition of many such roads throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be honest about them. I could take the Senator on a tour of west Limerick along roads which are in poor condition. Some have been improved but we must remember the sale of the century in 1977 when road tax was abolished and a nominal registration fee introduced. That is what happened and the people bought it; the person with a Honda 50 motorcycle went out to vote for Fianna Fáil at the time on the basis of that promise. The reality, however, is that motor tax has increased excessively during the years since.</P>
      <P>What happened to the emission targets under the Kyoto Protocol to which we signed up? This is a serious issue for the Department of the Environment and Local Government to grapple with. What has happened to the projections for 2007? It is projected that we will take 2 million tonnes of fossil fuels out of the equation and in doing so increase wind energy consumption from the current level of 145 kw to 475 kw. While I am in favour of wind energy and other such developments, I am predicting that those targets will not be achieved because the Department has not delivered a coherent policy for local authorities to promote wind energy.</P>
      <P>A deputation is meeting the Department tomorrow to discuss its concerns about areas designated by Dúchas to protect hen harriers. If those areas are designated special areas of conservation because of the EU natural habitats directive, the more meaningful locations for wind turbines will be taken out of the equation. If a wind turbine was located on top of Carrantuohil, one might get away with it but in most cases objections will be raised to wind turbines in other locations. That is the reason the Department, in conjunction with local authorities' development plans, should be earmarking various locations in each county which would be suitable for wind energy projects. In that way we could do away with the culture whereby most projects are objected to that impinge on residential amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not examining the Kyoto Protocol seriously. If one studies its climate strategy and the relevant industrial projections, high energy industries will close down because they will not be able to conform to the emission targets set. If they have to trade with companies in other countries with different emission policies, it will place an excessive burden upon them. In addition, Australia and America stayed out of the protocol <Col N="546" />because they believed their industries would be at risk. One might say that is an irresponsible attitude but has the Government targeted Irish companies which may be at risk due to their current emission standards? If so, is it aware of the financial cost to them of remaining in business? It might be surprised to learn of the potential risk to jobs from now until 2007. Despite the fact that the protocol dates back several years, this situation is only now dawning on some companies. Under the terms of the protocol, Ireland stated emission standards would rise by 13% above 1990 levels but they are now running at 20% above them.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, we are trying to take action while, on the other, there are certain deterrents to achieving those objectives. I am extremely concerned that, given the difficulties facing businesses in the current downturn, more companies will be driven out of business. Departmental officials should analyse the implications of the Kyoto Protocol's climate strategy as well as examining the businesses which will be vulnerable as a result. There will be no point in complaining afterwards if some businesses decide it is no longer viable for them to remain in the economy because of the costs involved in adhering to the emission standards laid down by the protocol. We had better face up to that reality soon.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss a matter concerning Foynes Harbour, about which I am very disappointed. As my colleague, Senator Brennan, is aware, we had a plan for an access road bypassing the harbour. Over many years the harbour board campaigned to get this access road finished and local people were elated when the project was completed because it would stop trucks parking in the village. In many cases such trucks had spread dust and other material in the village over many years during which local people had to put up with this traffic burden. While the road was finished last October, it is blocked because CIE has taken an inordinately long time to deal with the legal complexities of installing a level crossing. While the rail service is vital for the port, in the past year no railway engine has traversed it on business related to the port. I cannot understand the delay over the level crossing, which is not the fault of the local council.</P>
    <P>According to my information, CIE is projecting that it could be next May before this matter is sorted out. I cannot understand how bureaucracy and legal implications can cause such a delay. The project was completed seven months ago, yet members of the local community are asking what has happened to the access road. They cannot understand the delay in opening it. I do not expect the Minister of State to do much on the basis of what I said, apart from agreeing with me about the future implications for industry of target emission levels but he should try to bang heads together to see if the access road can be opened. As a native of Foynes, I would be only too delighted to carry out the official opening.</P>

      <P>As the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, could deliver value for money based on this motor taxation increase, he should get that message across by improving sign-posting, which is generally dismal. Recently I drove 200 miles across England and even in foggy and misty conditions we were able to get from Penzance to Bristol due to good road signs. We need major signposts here to indicate the general direction, with other signs to show local roads.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago, I left a transport conference in Clonmel at 11 p.m. and ended up driving in circles around the town. I could not get out of Clonmel that night because the signposting for Dublin was appalling. As a person who worked in a local authority organisation for 14 years, I believe there is not sufficient transparency for what the engineers deliver. There are people who are not accountable for their work.</P>
      <P>Road markings throughout the country are generally appalling. As Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher should demand of county managers that they deliver road signs and markings of a standard quality. As Senator Quinn said, there is no doubt that the road markings on the side of roads are so dangerous that they lend themselves to accidents happening, particularly in the glare from the lights of oncoming traffic.</P>
      <P>In the area of Dundrum in which I live, a bypass, which was on the drawing board for the past 30 years, has been built, but it is disastrous. In the construction of the Wickham bypass, account was not taken of the growth in traffic. The laneways on the bypass are too narrow and the slip-roads for access to the M50 are badly designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I was the Minister of State introducing an increase in tax and trying to let the public know <Col N="548" />they are getting value for money, I would demand to know why county managers have such low standards in terms of signposting and road markings. I do not understand it. If it was a private organisation, it would be out of business with the low standards it exhibits in those areas.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to this important debate. As in the Dáil, the contributions were lively and wide-ranging. While many of them were outside my remit in this regard, I will try to deal with them as best I can.</P>
      <P>The contributions are a fair reflection of the Bill. Some Members who are opposed to the legislation strayed quite a bit away from it. I am not infringing on the Chair's right to advise them of that, but their contributions strayed into the area of health and other taxes. We are discussing only non-national roads. I believe that everybody is relatively happy with the allocations.</P>
      <P>This debate brings back memories of the past and the allocations made in those times. Given the ultimate use to which motor tax will be put by local authorities, it is inevitable that the debate would range across a wide spectrum. It is worth repeating that the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that local authorities have the necessary resources to continue to provide good quality services to the public across a range of areas and to retain the same record level of investment in non-national roads. Perhaps we have been the victims of our own success.</P>
      <P>The allocation by the Department in 1997 &ndash; Members will realise why I take that as the base year &ndash; for non-national roads of £214 million is in sharp contrast to the allocation last year and this year's record allocation of &euro;434 million. If we were to link that to the 1998 Act, which introduced the local government fund and the necessity to increase our contribution towards it for non-national roads due to inflation, we have exceeded the 1997 allocation by &euro;204 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals for the Bill were drawn up only after detailed consideration of all the options open to us. We did not take a decision to increase motor taxes lightly. The increases in motor tax <Col N="549" />rates provided for in the Bill were drawn up because we believe it is the right thing to do in terms of supporting our local government system and enabling us to build on the work already undertaken on developing our non-national road network.</P>
    <P>In 2003, despite difficult economic conditions, the local government fund has continued to provide a buoyant source of funding for local government authorities. This year, a total of &euro;626 million has been allocated in general purpose grants for local authorities. This represents a 6% increase on the 2002 allocation and is some 85% higher than the corresponding allocation in 1997, to which I referred as the base year. Such increases would not have been possible without the extra revenue generated by increases in motor tax rates. The increases in these rates have also enabled us to maintain the provision for non-national roads just short of the record levels for 2002.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill, it is important that there is an understanding of where the non-national roads programme stands in 2003. I wish to highlight some key points which should be of interest to a number of Members. In 2003, non-national road allocations will amount to just short of &euro;434 million. That represents &euro;4,346 for every kilometre of non-national road in every county. The 2003 programme includes measures for appropriate road markings on 11,000 kilometres of regional road network and a new regional road signposting programme, both of which are issues to which Senators referred. That provision is part of the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The Government gave a commitment that, over a five year period, it would provide &euro;25 million for regional road signposting. We have taken the initial step in that regard this year. We are providing &euro;5.1 million for signposting in a number of counties and we will develop on that in the future. It is hoped that by the end of our five-year term in office we will have fulfilled our obligation to provide the necessary regional road signposts, details of which I announced earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Some &euro;75.5 million has been allocated to non-national roads for employment and economic activity. Under the EU co-financed specific improvement scheme, expenditure of over &euro;47 million will be incurred this year on non-national roads schemes to facilitate housing development. This is an ambitious and progressive programme. Non-national roads expenditure is already 13% ahead of the national development plan profile. Our track record on non-national roads is second to none. For example, in the period 1996 to 2002 almost 30,000 kilometres of non-national roads were improved under the restoration programme and more roads will be restored in 2003. That represents real progress and we can stand on our record. The Government is determined that we will have a non-national roads system of which we can be proud and which will support the social and economic needs of a peripheral country. That is why we have increased motor tax rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" />Reference was made to the potholes. Irrespective of whoever will be here in 100 years, there will still be some potholes. Many Members were here a number of years ago. My county could be more than a microcosm of the rest of the country. Members will recall who was in office in 1985-86, when there was a proposal to abandon half of the roads in the country and to try to maintain the rest of them because so little was being provided for them by the Government at that time. In 1997, only &euro;214 million was provided for them. While funding arrangements introduced through the local government fund in 1999 have served local authorities well, we cannot stand still. A lot has been done and a lot more will be done.</P>
    <P>With a view to further reform and improvement in the system, the Minister has outlined his intention to commission a major independent review of local government funding in order to meet the challenges facing local government in the future. This review will be broad-ranging and will examine all practical options for financing local government. In the meantime the Government is committed to ensuring local authorities continue to have sufficient funding to provide good quality services to the public and to maintain progress on the development of our non-national road network. It is because of that commitment that this Bill is before the House.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government makes a major contribution to non-national roads but there is also an onus on the various local authorities. I will communicate with a number of local authorities because I am disappointed that some have decided to reduce their own resource contributions this year. I realise they are under severe pressure but it is only right and proper that they should raise these funds. A number of counties have decided that if there is a shortfall it should come out of their own resources but we will deal with this issue and write to the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt referred to the local improvement schemes. If we were to be totally parochial and say all politics is local, possibly the most important roads of all are those leading out of farms to regional and county roads. We have provided a record allocation of &euro;11 million to the local improvement scheme. We were criticised for being top heavy in allocations to the BMW region. This was due to the large number of applications from that area and because we are trying to help it catch up.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn may not want to be associated with a proposal which might be an add-on, though he made it clear that his proposal is intended to be a substitute scheme. Every proposal should be looked at but Senator Quinn's proposal is not a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, rather the Minister for Finance. It could be considered generally in the context of green taxation but there are some obvious difficulties when it comes to putting an extra tax on petrol. Increases in petrol would have a significant impact on inflation and <Col N="551" />petrol and diesel increases would also impact hugely on those in transportation and the taxi industry, for example, who depend on driving for their jobs. Those in rural areas would also be significantly affected, as by and large they have no other mode of transport apart from their cars. Senator Quinn referred to public transport and pay-as-you-go schemes but unfortunately in the real world of rural Ireland we do not have the public transport systems which operate in urban areas.</P>
    <P>We are considering the introduction of a more environmentally friendly system based on CO2 use and not necessarily based on cubic capacity. In a review of CO2 we are looking particularly at the effect on the environment, safeguarding revenue and equity.</P>
    <P>In general terms the national development plan provides for the investment of some &euro;2.43 billion in the non-national road network in the 2002-2006 period. Expenditure to the end of 2002 is ahead of that profiled for the period, while &euro;165.29 million has been allocated to restoration and improvement in 2003. This will enable all county councils to complete all their 2003 schemes as part of the 2002-2005 multiannual restoration programme. They may dip into 2004 on one or more of those schemes so we are slightly ahead of our targets.</P>
    <P>Detailed proposals on the design and implementation of a green tax have already been advanced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the lead-up to the 2002 and 2003 budgets. Among the key points in the proposal presented in the plans for budget 2003 was the recommendation of a tax of &euro;20 per ton of CO2 applied to all fossil fuels, to be phased in over a three to four year period. It was also proposed that a rate of &euro;7.50 be applied in 2003, which would cut projected emissions by 0.64Mt by 2003 and by at least 2Mt per annum by 2010. We realise we have obligations to reduce the emissions and we will pursue this in coming years.</P>
    <P>Some suggestions were made about the quality of the work in this regard and I take Senator Mansergh's comments on board. However, the Fitzpatrick value for money study was quite complimentary to local authorities. The road restoration programme tackles roads on a long-term basis rather than a temporary or<i> ad hoc</i> basis. That is how it should be. We will carry out a study of road pavements later this year and we hope to have definite recommendations early next year, if not by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane suggested that after the budget we decided to introduce this tax. Motor tax is not a budgetary tax, therefore it was a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to announce. He did so in December but not when everyone had gone home for Christmas. Senators will appreciate the necessity of bringing a resolution before the House. That was done on 12 December last, when there was a full and frank debate which made it <Col N="552" />abundantly clear that the contribution and allocation this year would be the same as last year.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are victims of our own success because there has been a 100% plus increase over the period from 1997 to date. That is an indication of the Government's commitment to the development of our non-national roads up and down the country. We will continue that in years to come so that we have a non-national road system we can be proud of.</P>
    <P>The Opposition can criticise us for the sake of criticising but they will state quietly that the development in recent years could not have been foreseen in 1997. We are committed to this programme and we will continue, through the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the local government fund, to provide record funding for non-national roads. I am anxious that local authorities increase their resource contributions, which is not something they all did this year. We will pursue that with the relevant local authorities to ensure they make a realistic contribution to the fund.</P>
    <P>I hope the House is convinced we are totally committed to the development of non-national roads. Those roads are important to all of us but particularly those in rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 34, after &ldquo;2000&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided that an environmental impact statement for the purposes of this Act shall be carried out by a person who does not benefit financially from the approval of the project to which it relates&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the amendment was discussed on Committee Stage, I do not propose to delay the House. Its <Col N="553" />purpose is to make clear that environmental impact statements will only be valid for the purposes of the Bill when carried out by an independent person. An environmental impact statement carried out by a person who stands to gain from a project is of considerably less value than an independent study.</P>
    <P>Considering that environmental impact statements have been an important feature of the planning process for a number of years, it is extremely important that they be held in good standing. The amendment is specifically designed to meet this requirement. I have encountered cases &ndash; echoed by my colleagues &ndash; in which people believe the environmental impact statement is of insufficient standing. The object of the amendment is to ensure they are carried out by independent persons and are accepted by everyone involved in the process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. It is important we protect the independence of environmental impact statements. They are requested by ordinary individuals and frequently address issues which affect human health. I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment seeks to ensure that a person or company carrying out an environmental impact statement which is associated with a planning application for which an IPPC licence is required has no financial interest in the project in question. Senator Ryan spoke on the amendment on Committee Stage and highlighted what he regards as the way in which an environmental impact statement may be nuanced in favour of the applicant, given that it is the responsibility of the applicant to submit an EIS. Notwithstanding his arguments and those made today by Senator O'Meara, I remain of my original view and, therefore, decline to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 dealing with environmental impact statements are based on the requirement in European Union Directive 85/337/EEC, as amended. The directive is clear on the point that the developer should supply the relevant information to the consent authority. If the amendment were to be accepted, we could find ourselves in a position where a company with the in-house technical expertise required to prepare a satisfactory EIS would find itself forced to employ outside consultants, as it could be argued the in-house team, as with all employees, would benefit financially if approval were granted. This appears unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remain of the view that testing the adequacy of the environmental impact statement and taking the appropriate action should remain the responsibility of the relevant local authority, An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, the decision-making process will be open to public scrutiny. The substantive <Col N="554" />legislative provisions on environmental impact statements are found in the Planning and Development Act 2000.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan's proposal would not apply exclusively to the environmental impact statement requirements with regard to the IPPC licence applications, but would have general application. If the matter is to be pursued, it should be done in the context of planning legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 4, after &ldquo;section&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;3B or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 would have a similar effect. As it stands, section 3B would allow the Minister to amend the Act in certain circumstances. The language used in the section confers considerable power on the Minister. The amendment proposes that the approval of the Oireachtas be required before he or she exerts such power. All that is currently required is that the Oireachtas be informed. Given the wide-ranging nature of the Bill, this provision is not sufficient and needs to be strengthened.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The new section 3B reflects the direct link between the Schedule and the IPPC directive. It is impossible to anticipate the changes, if any, the European Union may make in the licensing annex of the directive. What is certain, however, is that if the EU imposes more strict controls than those set out in the Schedule, Ireland must follow suit. Section 3B will give the Minister the flexibility to amend the Schedule by way of regulation should the Community require this to be done. It also allows for the making of purely technical amendments to the Schedule. Otherwise, the Oireachtas retains its current rights as set out in section 7 of the 1992 Act, which would mean that any other amendment in the Schedule would require a positive resolution of both Houses.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the point I made on Committee Stage that an Act adopted by the European Union requiring changes in the Schedule under section 3B would be subject to the new Oireachtas scrutiny arrangements. Also, I am advised by the Attorney General's office that the proposed section does not involve an unauthorised delegation of power to a Minister but gives a reasonable level of flexibility. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 34, lines 42 and 43, to delete &ldquo;shall have an absolute discretion to&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. The section confers considerable powers on the Minister. It is not suitable to use the words &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; in that regard, nor is it suitable in terms of the Environmental Protection Agency. Putting the concept of absolute discretion into legislation does not appear to be a good precedent or practice.</P>
      <P>We would have sympathy for the EPA's position in this part of the legislation, and that was set out on Committee Stage by my colleagues, but the principle that it should not have absolute discretion in that regard is an important one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Senator, this amendment achieves nothing in a legal sense. It seeks to change a permissive power for the EPA to hold an oral hearing, &ldquo;shall have&rdquo;, to another permissive power, &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I maintain the view expressed on Committee Stage that using the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; makes no material difference.</P>
      <P>I also repeat my view about maintaining consistency, which is an even more important point, between the IPPC and the waste codes. The absolute discretion construction in the Bill mirrors exactly the provision in section 42(11) of the Waste Management Act 1996 in respect of a decision on the holding of an oral hearing on a waste licence. I want to maintain that consistency. The legal advice is that the amendment does not make any difference and, therefore, I do not accept it.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage we discussed <Col N="556" />the question of including the words &ldquo;or affirmation&rdquo; after &ldquo;oath&rdquo; in the relevant parts of the new section 88 dealing with the EPA oral hearings. The advice to me at the time from the Attorney General's office was that this was not necessary as a reference to an oath includes an affirmation, and that remains legally the case. However, in the light of comments made by Senators on Committee Stage, and in keeping with my approach of trying to encompass as many views as possible in the legislation, and precedents already established in this regard and in other legislation, I propose that we formally provide for affirmation in the Bill, something on which Senator O'Meara was keen.</P>

It is almost a standard amendment on our part and I cannot think of any Minister who has not accepted the principle of it. I ask the Minister to say to his colleagues that this principle should be adopted on a broad level. Perhaps the Attorney General should take it on board because it is a non-contentious issue at this stage. It has been accepted by all the Minister's colleagues and it would save us all some time if it were taken on board at the correct level. I thank the Minister and appreciate his response.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to consider the implications of proposals to extend the provisions of section 99(<i>h</i>) to give <Col N="557" />jurisdiction to the Circuit Court as well as the High Court in relation to matters set out in the section. As a result, I am now bringing forward amendments for consideration by the House.</P>
      <P>Apart from including references to the Circuit Court in a number of places, the main change proposed is to include a new subsection (3), which details the role of the Circuit Court in relation to applications under the section. It provides as follows: first, the applications are to be made to the judge of the Circuit Court in which the relevant activity is being carried on; second, the Circuit Court may hear cases appropriate to its jurisdiction and on considering this the factors it will take into account will include the nature and extent of any environmental pollution being caused and the estimated cost of complying with the court order sought; and, third, the Circuit Court may transfer the more serious cases to the High Court. These amendments introduce additional flexibility to the proposed section and to the enforcement provisions available under the IPPC licensing regime. The amendments respond well to the constructive comments made by the Senators on Committee Stage, which I welcome.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response to what he called genuine concerns raised on Committee Stage. The object of our amendments was to keep legal costs down by giving the Circuit Court a jurisdiction in cases of unlicensed activity. From the point of view of groups which would take it upon themselves to go to court in the event of unlicensed activity or in the event of concerns they might have about something that has happened in their community, it would be important that they be of the view that the courts are accessible to them, particularly in terms of costs. Given the Circuit Court jurisdiction in that regard, this amendment is extremely important and broadens the accessibility of the legislation. I commend the Minister on his response to the points raised on Committee Stage in that regard, which enhances the legislation considerably.</P>

      <P>This amendment returns to the thorny issue of bin charges and the refusal by councils to collect refuse from people whose charges are overdue. The response to that problem in the Bill borders on the draconian. The council should be limited. We are not saying it should not have power to take action against someone who refuses to pay the charges but giving the councils power to refuse to collect household waste is going too far.

The polluter pays principle underpins this legislation and it is wrong to say to people that there is a way around this when there is not. Would we tell people not to pay their gas or electricity bills or their television licence? It is the same category and we must see this issue in the context of the examples I gave because waste charges belong in that category. They are a legitimate component of the costs for the services we receive and that is how it should be seen. The public is prepared to accept this and we should move on from this issue.</P>

    <P>This deals with the waivers. Section 35(3) of the Bill allows the local authority, if it is satisfied it is <Col N="560" />appropriate on the grounds of personal hardship, to waive all or a portion of a charge made by it. That is fine where the local authority is the waste collection agency, but there might not be a power of waiver if collection has been tendered out to a private contractor. There are increasing numbers of hardship cases where people cannot afford to maintain a wheeled bin or pay the costs of waste collection because of the escalating costs of collection and landfill. There is a relationship between that and illegal dumping.</P>
    <P>In my own area there has been an increase in the number of wheeled bins being given back to waste collection companies. Despite the fact that competition has lowered costs, the increases this year have been so high that they have caused problems for the elderly and single parent households. Waivers are very important.</P>
    <P>The amendment would replace &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because local authorities would then have to put a waiver scheme in place for hardship cases. Otherwise any waiver scheme is at the discretion of the county manager.</P>

      <P>We discussed this at some length on Committee Stage and I do not propose to accept an amendment that would compel any local authority to provide a mandatory system of waivers in respect of all or part of waste charges. I am maintaining the <i>status quo </i>that works extremely well across the State. The local authorities are not currently under an obligation to provide for waivers in respect of waste charges and it will remain a matter, as it is currently, for each manager in the local authority to determine whether to provide for a waiver of waste charges and to decide the parameters of such a scheme. In practice, I would expect local authority managers, when they exercise the proposed new power, to continue to address the need for waivers for low income householders in a sensitive and sympathetic manner.</P>
      <P>I see no merit in a mandatory requirement regarding waivers where the letter of any such legal requirement could be fulfilled without providing meaningful relief to the waiver recipients. From what I have heard from colleagues in all parties and councillors from across the State, this works in a harmonious way. If it is not broken I am not going to fix it.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Meara might be right about people giving back wheeled bins but there are smaller bins and special bags that can be bought. People are putting out less refuse because there is more concern about recycling. In Galway there was a debate on this.

      <P>I was referring to people telling me they were returning their wheeled bins because they could not afford them. At the same time, many people are genuinely attempting to reduce the amount of household waste generated, not only because of the costs involved, but also for environmental reasons. I prefer to see a positive incentive towards reducing household waste and one which does not encourage illegal dumping. I believe the Minister wants to achieve this, but I do not agree with his approach. We all want to achieve a positive environment for reducing and recycling household waste, composting and reducing packaging. When shopping, I have noted the large amounts of packaging with purchases and it is something we can do without.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that if it is not broken, why fix it. That is fine in the current context, but this legislation will change that context considerably by increasing the powers of the manager regarding the setting of charges and so on. I am of the view that this amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>I am a strong advocate of local democracy and there is a role for the local authority in this area. This is a planning issue and there are provisions in all county development plans concerning planning matters, waste disposal and fly-postering. As a director of elections in the past, I know how quickly local authorities take action regarding the removal of election posters after elections. We should incorporate the local authorities in this area because they are at the forefront in implementing policy. Local government is being undermined. There are local issues that a local authority might be more aware of and it is important to include them.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the fact that people may be forced to return their wheeled bins because of inability to pay. Can we get the Minister's viewpoint on this? We do not want to see the countryside, the highways and byways covered in litter. Some scheme should be available for people who cannot afford to pay for waste collection services. These people must be facilitated to ensure the environment is not damaged by illegal dumping.</P>

      <P>The exhibition of advertisements and articles is already subject to development and control under section 3 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. They already require planning permission. The amendment, as drafted, <Col N="562" />would have the effect of removing planning controls from advertisements as these would now be subject to the exemption in section 19 of the 1997 Act, in respect of articles and advertisements authorised in advance by property owners or occupiers. Like other categories of development there are certain exemptions, in particular certain advertisements are exempt if they fall within the cases of exempted developments set out in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 and comply with the conditions and limitations described therein.</P>
      <P>These regulations, as the Senator knows, were recently considered by both Houses and were approved by way of positive resolutions in December 2001. Accordingly, both Houses have had the opportunity to consider the content of these regulations, including the different classes provided for exempted advertising developments. I have no proposals to change these regulations.</P>
      <P>Turning to controls on advertisements in the litter code, under section 19 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997, an exhibition on property of articles or advertisements that are not exempted development under planning law requires the prior written authority of the owner, occupier or person in charge of the property. We are tightening these controls in the proposed new section 19(1) by requiring that advertisements or articles carry the name and address of the person on whose behalf they are being exhibited. This was welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have broad powers under section 20 of the Litter Pollution Act 1997 to require the removal of any article or advertisement and that other specified steps be taken regarding the advertisement or article. This power applies irrespective of whether the article or advertisement is exempted development under the planning system. Local authorities may exercise these powers in the interest of an amenity or the local government.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that adequate legal provision exists to enable local authorities effectively to control litter arising from the exhibition of articles and advertisements. Notwithstanding the good intentions of Senator Bannon, we have covered all the different areas by agreed position of both Houses. I welcome the fact that the amendment was put down to make that clear in the House.</P>

      <P>In page 82, line 20, to delete &ldquo;650&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;750&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The scale threshold in the integrated pollution prevention and control directive states that 750 pig rearing units should be allowed, while the Minister has made provision for 650 places for sows in breeding units. One could get the impression that the only farmers affected by the Environmental Protection Agency Act are those engaged in licensable activities. Section 6.2 of the EU directive chart allows for 750 to 2000 places in respect of pig rearing activities, but the Minister has come inside those guidelines in terms of what he proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the agricultural community, particularly those involved in intensive production, are very concerned and believe this is a considerable clawback. The countryside is designated for agriculture and agricultural activities should be allowed to continue in the manner in which they have done heretofore. In many cases one is deal<Col N="564" />ing with ordinary farm manure, which has been used on the land for generations and contains nothing that would create a problem. These rules are limiting agricultural production. I hope the Minister will consider increasing the number from 650 to 750, as allowed under the EU directive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Senator O'Meara's seconding the amendment. I do not believe that it follows the Labour Party approach. The Senator's colleague, Deputy Gilmore, might be aghast. I will take it that the Senator has seconded the amendment on a purely technical basis to get the discussion going as it is not primary Labour Party policy.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon's amendment touches on issues that have been raised by farming interests and have been the subject of extensive discussions with them. Those discussions have been productive and resulted in a number of positive outcomes. For example, in the Schedule we are clarifying interpretation issues that arose from the 1992 Act. We are bringing into Irish law the concession in the directive which allows practical considerations to be taken into account in the licensing of intensive agriculture. This is done in section 86(2) and we have also changed the definition of sow in paragraph 6.62 of the Schedule. That paragraph includes the directive's limit of 2000 places for production pigs. There are, however, two other types of pig producers: breeding only, for which the limit in the directive is 750 places; and integrated breeding and production, for which no limit or provision is specified in the directive. We must be fair to all types of producers, taking account of their impact on the environment.</P>
      <P>Our experience in relation to licensing pig numbers indicates that the directive limit of 750 breeding sows is too high and would result in breeding units being treated more leniently than production units. The technical advice available to me is that the phosphorus loading from slurry produced by 650 breeding sows is similar to that produced by 2000 production pigs. The Bill provides accordingly in order to ensure that licensing takes effect at a similar point in terms of the environmental impact, whatever the type of intensive pig rearing operation. This is the most equitable approach for everyone involved in that business.</P>
      <P>On the Senator's proposal to delete the reference in line 21 to 270 sows in an integrated unit, the House should note that most intensive pig rearing in Ireland is carried on in integrated units. The Senator's proposal would ensure that there would effectively be no reference in the Bill to integrated operations &ndash; the major feature of intensive pig rearing. This would not be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1992 Act requires licensing of integrated units with 300 or more breeding sows. Due to the fact that 2000 production pigs would be equiv<Col N="565" />alent to approximately 400 sows in an integrated unit, the amendment would represent a major retreat on the requirements of the 1992 Act. I do not believe that we want to take a backward step, a view that is generally accepted by farming representatives. The provision in the Bill that an integrated unit with 275 places for sows be licensed maintains broad consistency with those requirements and ensures equity between integrated pig farmers and those who concentrate on either fattening or breeding. In light of the statistics I outlined in respect of phosphorous loadings from 2,000 production pigs, breeding operations with 650 sows and integrated units with 275 places for sows, I believe the proposal is equitable and balanced.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was first presented there was a great deal of public disquiet in the agricultural community. Farmers claimed that when they seek licences, a great deal of information is sought about their activities, the quantity and quality of farm land they possess, etc. They believed that their freedom to farm their land was threatened and undermined by the amount of red tape, etc., involved in getting an enterprise off the ground. Macra na Feirme and young farmer organisations have expressed this opinion forcibly. There is a disincentive for young farmers to take over the family farm and develop another enterprise. Those involved feel that the amount of red tape is pushing them off their farms.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Third Schedule to the Waste Management Act 1996 is to transpose the provisions of Annex IIA of Council Directive 75/442/EEC &ndash; the framework waste directive &ndash; which specifies waste disposal activities for the purposes of the directive. Similarly, the Fourth Schedule to the 1996 Act is intended to reflect waste recovery activities specified in Annex IIB of the directive. Minor changes to these annexes were made by Commission Decision 96/350/EC of 24 May 1996. These amendments were carried into the 1996 Act by means of the European Communities (Amendment of Waste Management Act 1996) Regulations 1998. The opportunity is now being taken to confirm the amendments to the two Schedules by means of a statutory provision. As these annexes are fundamental to the application of the directive, it is essential to ensure their precise transposition into national legislation. The European Commission could consider a departure from its substance a breach of the directive which no doubt would lead to legal proceedings. For the reason outlined, I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

Perhaps the Minister will clarify this. Fertilisation and intensive farming have been reduced somewhat with CAP reform changes and targets, etc. There is an element built into the REPS to reduce intensive farming.</P>

The restrictions are impinging on areas designated for agricultural development. There are those who want to build a nice house in a rural area and then object to farming practices. A person who lives in an area designated for agricultural development does so by choice and should not come in and disrupt the nature of activities in the area. Sadly, in many cases there has been such disruption, not always by Irish people but by foreigners. While they are very welcome &ndash; we are all citizens of the European Union &ndash; they can have an effect on farming activities in an area by objecting to a development and spending considerable amounts of cash in getting their objections through. As a result, farmers are inhibited from farming in the manner in which they have done for several generations. I want to ensure they are not inhibited from farming. Up until a few years ago, it was the main industry in Ireland and a much respected one.</P>

      <P>Farmers are not major polluters, despite what has been said. They are sometimes blamed unfairly. I am a farmer. Any farming activity I see shows respect for the rural community and the rural way of life. It is those involved in farming who are the greatest advocates of preserving rural life. I hope they will always be facilitated by Government. They are an important asset to the maintenance of rural life and long may it be so.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, matters progress. As we have become part of a greater European Union, it has become common to adopt many European practices. Perhaps that is not in our best interests. It is important that we maintain our heritage and culture and what is best of rural life. No matter where one travels in Europe or the world one meets people who have visited Ireland who like the Irish set-up, the way we manage our affairs, the rural environment, the by-roads, etc. There is something unique about our country which should be preserved.

      <P>This section provides that a non-national may not take up or be in employment in the State in the absence of a permit issued by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It creates offences for non-compliance by an employer or an employee and provides for penalties where such an offence occurs. It also sets out the categories for non-nationals to which the requirement for an employment permit does not apply.</P>
      <P>It provides a legal basis for the operation of Community preference should a requirement for employment permits for nationals of new member states be re-imposed under section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Fahey, and his officials to the House. I have certain concerns about the Bill. I feel we should look at the realities as they pertain to the country now as opposed to what pertained during the campaign for the second Nice treaty referendum leading to the decision by the Irish people on the expansion of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill proposes to grant immediate access to the Irish labour market from 4 May 2004 without any restrictions on the applicant states. This does <Col N="570" />not apply to many of our partners in Europe. Germany will grant no freedom of access after enlargement, with an initial review after the first two years of transition. Austria will offer no immediate freedom of access. Belgium and Finland will provide freedom of access after a transition period of two years. Portugal will use the transition period to negotiate bilaterally with accession countries. Italy will negotiate bilaterally with accession states. France will give freedom of access following enlargement with some restrictions in specific sectors. Ireland, Denmark, Greece, Sweden, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Luxembourg are providing full freedom of access to labour markets immediately after enlargement.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind that there is a new world order. A war is raging in Iraq, the outcome of which nobody can predict. The effects on the world market may be catastrophic and the world will never be the same again after this war, whenever it finishes &ndash; if ever.</P>
    <P>Anybody raising any issue with people applying for employment permits is in danger of being accused of being racist or of not wishing to expand the European Union. I make no apologies for speaking on behalf of the Irish people looking for employment in their own country. For far too long we had to go abroad and seek permits in the United States of America. We had free access to the United Kingdom, which was very welcome, and its citizens had freedom to work here.</P>
    <P>The number of applicants should meet the number of vacancies in any particular area. That is the advantage of the permits system that pertains today. As it stands, many citizens from applicant countries are in the State under the permits system. That will continue to be the case prior to 4 May 2004. Bulgaria has approximately 1,000 citizens here. Last year work permits were issued to 518 people, most of whom are employed in service industries and there are some railway workers. In 2001, ten work authorisations were issued for ICT professionals and two for engineers. There is a relatively small number of people here from Cyprus. There are approximately 2,000 people here from the Czech Republic, 1,700 from Estonia, 700 from Hungary and 5,500 from Latvia.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In 2001, some 4,365 work permits issued, many to people in the service and agri-business sectors. In 2001 the highest number of immigrants came from Latvia. In 2001, the number of work permits issued to people from Lithuania was 2,909. Many of these are employed in the hotel and catering industries. There is a relatively small number of people here from Malta and approximately 3,500 from Poland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 20,000 people have come here from Romania. While many of these have work <Col N="571" />permits, some are here illegally. Last year 1,776 work permits were issued. Included in the figure of 20,000 are approximately 2,000 from the Roma community. While other Romanians here are employed in the service sectors, last year 51 working visas were issued to ICT professionals, nine to architects and ten to construction engineers.</P>
    <P>I fully welcome the proposal to expand the European market from the point of view of our exports and the imports from the applicant countries into the Republic of Ireland. That will work extremely well and our exports will have access to a larger market.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill provides that the Minister may trip a safety mechanism affecting people from accession countries within the two-year transition period, this should be activated from the very start. We have a liberal administration as far as permits are concerned. People have the right to apply and there needs to be a very good reason for them to be refused. The only reason for refusal should be the lack of employment opportunity. If we allow for the opening of the market on 4 May 2004 it is likely there will not be vacancies at that time.</P>
    <P>There are major concerns currently. The Small Firms Association, a very reputable organisation, issued a statement yesterday that there would be a slow down in the creation of jobs in 2004. Many of its members have availed of the permits system, which has been extremely beneficial to our exports drive. In areas like my county, Roscommon, there are many people from South America engaged in the food processing industry, particularly the poultry industry. They are filling jobs which are not being filled by the native population who are not interested in them. That skilled labour comes from outside the European Union and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is rightly issuing permits. The employers are getting tremendous workers and are maintaining and increasing exports. They are making a major contribution to our economy. However, we cannot predict what the future will bring.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister of State and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the Bill gives them an opportunity to provide a set of regulations governing the 4 May 2004 deadline in order that there would not be open and free access into Ireland from the applicant countries but rather a transitional period from that date because we need to evaluate the effects of the numbers coming. During the Nice treaty referendum campaign some said the country would be flooded with immigrants from the 15 applicant countries while others said that was untrue and that there would be no substantial number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on the use of the words &ldquo;grant&rdquo; and &ldquo;granting&rdquo; which are important. The former alone is the key to the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is generally worthy and satisfactory in its restrictions on businesses employing people without permits. However, if amendments are not made on Report Stage to provide for a mechanism to restrict numbers from the 15 applicant countries, boatloads will arrive in Dublin Port within two days of 4 May 2004. It is well known throughout Europe that we have the most welcoming, beneficial and hospitable environment for people from abroad &ndash; rightly so &ndash; but at what cost? We must bear in mind that the people concerned will be entitled to all the services, facilities and social welfare benefits available in the State.</P>
      <P>I do not want to sound reactionary because I am not. I have welcomed those who have come to my area and played an important role. We are talking about the expansion of the European Union and opportunities in the marketplace. From 2004 we should only admit as many as are needed to fill the vacancies unfilled by Irish people. We cannot have a situation where 2,000 extra are required in the construction industry and 10,000 non-nationals come to Ireland to take up those jobs. In that case some 8,000 would be left in the State, relying on the system which would have to support them. I am not being a prophet of doom but with a war raging in Iraq we do not know what the world order or the price of oil will be and there may be a crisis if the war is prolonged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Senator Leyden's points and his proposal. I welcomed this Bill on Second Stage when I said it should go further rather than have a safety clause in section 3, subsections (3) and (4), which I will seek to delete on Report Stage. The Senator's suggestions are absurd. There will not be a flood of people into Ireland from accession countries in 2004. He is contradicting everything the Minister said on Second Stage as well as the Government's view that the economy is still healthy despite the slow-down. There are no signs we will need to use the safety clause or be cautious in the manner suggested by the Senator. The Minister said that previous experience had not shown that there would be a flood of people into Ireland from applicant countries when the 2004 provisions took effect. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats need to decide what their story is on the economy &ndash; it is either healthy or it is not. On the one hand, we are told community employment schemes are no longer necessary and, on the other, the Government is being cautious and worried about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator says he is worried about people flooding in from the accession countries in 2004 but I am more worried that we ensure our econ<Col N="573" />omy remains healthy by investing in education, research and development and indigenous industry while retaining foreign investment. If we do not do so, we are more likely to experience the situation the Senator outlined. It is on that we should be concentrating. Our fears should focus on the possibility that the accession countries will be more competitive than us because they, too, have educated workforces and will attract inward investment.</P>
    <P>The people voted for the Treaty of Nice because they wanted to be more open towards the accession countries. If we are to be open, we must be so in every sense &ndash; interacting with people socially, in employment and culturally. Ireland should have a green card system similar to that in operation in the United States to deal with immigration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will speak on the issue to which Senator Leyden referred, the use of the word &ldquo;grant&rdquo;. Far be it from me to have a disagreement with my dear friend but that is what I will have because I do not agree with the points he made. It is highly improbable that huge numbers will be waiting to come to Ireland on 4 May 2004. All of those living in the accession countries will be seeking to make their own countries profitable and develop exports in order that they can flourish in their own right. All things being equal, who would want to travel to another land all of a sudden? It is a highly improbable tale.</P>
      <P>We are either for the European Union or we are not. While we have succeeded in adopting the Nice treaty, we cannot be pro-European Union in one part of our public life and anti in another because it does not make sense to hold such a view. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in her Second Stage speech and a recent radio interview, affirmed that the Government would watch the labour market. It is understandable that we would not wish available jobs to be taken up but the Department and the Minister will keep a watch on the market and if there is a disturbance or it becomes lop-sided or skewed, the necessary measures will be taken &ndash; this is common sense. A watching brief will be held between now and May 2004 to see how our markets and those of the accession countries are performing in order that reasonable estimates may be made about how many might wish to come to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European project is a noble one, whereby people from different cultures come together to mix and work freely and adapt to one another. Irish people emigrated to the United States, Australia and other countries where they did the hard physical work. They worked because they were able to and wanted to gain a foothold. The accession countries are proud of the fact that they have progressed so far that they are eligible for admission to the European Union. When I can<Col N="574" />vassed for the Nice treaty, I made the point that it was an open and generous way to respond to the demands of Europe. In years to come our society will greatly benefit from the cultures it will have absorbed. They will add to our culture and modern history.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden means well and we are lucky to have people with such determined views. However, I have an equally determined view that these measures are reasonable. They will facilitate access. The legislation includes a mechanism whereby the Minister and the Department can monitor market forces in this country and whether unemployment is rising.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the number coming to this country; I know many of them. Senator Leyden said there were 5,000 Latvians here. Without them there would not be a mushroom industry. That industry is a huge element in our agricultural exports. I know one of those involved quite well. The industry could not survive without the Latvians who have made it their niche. They work hard and send money home. It is the same story again, history repeating itself. They are sending money home and helping their people. They work hard and the industry, in turn, contributes to Ireland's economic well being. While I respect Senator Leyden's right to say what he wishes, I do not agree with him.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (3), lines 13 to 16, to delete paragraph (<i>b</i>).</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to delete the penalty on indictment in relation to the offence of employing a non-national without a work permit. We discussed this issue in the context of the Immigration Bill. This provision is heavy-handed. I do not agree with the imposition of a penalty. It is necessary to prohibit the employment of non-nationals without work permits but this penalty is heavy-handed. There are situations where employers would and have employed non-nationals without necessarily setting out to exploit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" />Before imposing such heavy-handed penalties, we need to do far more in terms of having an overall framework for immigration. I previously suggested the introduction of a green card system, along the lines proposed by the Labour Party. If there was a proper system, there would be fewer cases of people trying to abuse it. One could be heavy-handed then. At present, however, many could get into this situation without necessarily setting out to abuse the system and without being exploitative. The provision is heavy-handed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Senator means well, I do not agree with the amendment. Part of a proper structure is the imposition of fines on those who do not obey the law. We cannot, on the one hand, welcome people from the accession countries by establishing a proper framework and then not fine those who seek to exploit them. That is what would happen. If people are brought to this country without going through proper procedures, they will be exploited. They will not be paid proper wages or given proper conditions of employment. Their rights will not be safeguarded. The fine is a safety bolthole, as it were, to deal with those who would be exploitative. That is the reason I heartily approve of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed because its effect would be to treat as only a minor offence every instance where an employer engaged the services of a non-national in breach of employment permit regulations or requirements. The purpose behind the provision penalising employers is to correct the legal imbalance that currently exists between the employer and the employee when it comes to the law on employment of non-nationals. At present, the employee is liable to prosecution but the employer escapes without any sanction. The culpability of the employer in many of these cases is likely to be greater, given that the employer who takes on the person to work illegally holds most of the advantages over the employee in this relationship.</P>
      <P>If the person works off the books, as it were, he or she can remain invisible to the authorities. The unscrupulous employer can take advantage of the non-national's legal status to, for example, literally save on costs such as wages and insurance and ignore the law of the land in respect of employment conditions and health and safety in the workplace. The illegal employee, on the other hand, can live under a regime of virtual servitude, with the constant threat of being uncovered by the authorities or revealed to those authorities by an employer who no longer needs his or her services or as a punishment for some perceived wrong.</P>
      <P>One should not underestimate the negative influence for the individual in society posed by those who knowingly exploit their workforce in this way. Such exploitation is well organised and run by criminal gangs which earn much more of their profits on the backs of their illegal workforce. There are also negative economic effects on the domestic labour force, members of which may be denied the prospect of competing for certain jobs because of the illegal employment of foreign workers. We, therefore, deem the level of fines to be necessary.</P>

      <P>These amendments are opposed. The Bill has been drafted based on the conditions of the treaty of accession, which has not yet been signed, and the powers it confers on member states to implement their own national measures and legislation to deal with labour market access once accession takes place. When it has been ratified by all of the relevant countries, this State will <Col N="579" />have to pass an Act in order to transpose the treaty into domestic law. Until such time, the treaty shall not be referred to as an Act. The Bill before us cannot be based on an Act that does not yet exist. Accordingly, I would ask the Senator to withdraw both amendments.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow any state to enjoy the advantages of the provisions of this Bill, which, after the passing of this Act, becomes party to an instrument whereby it accedes to membership of the European Union.

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is opposed. The treaty of accession negotiated between the current EU member states and the ten countries that are due to accede to the European Union in 2004 provides that member states shall apply their own national measures regarding labour market access for at least the first two years following accession in respect of the nationals of eight of these countries, namely, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The treaty of accession provides that the nationals of Malta and Cyprus shall be accorded full labour market access from the date of accession. Ireland's national measures consist of granting labour market access to the nationals of the eight aforementioned states once accession takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of section 3 is to give legislative effect to those measures by providing for an exemption from the requirement for an employment permit for the nationals of these states, should they wish to take up employment in the State. The section has regard to the parties of the treaty of accession. The acceptance of the proposed amendment would not only mean including states that are not covered by the treaty of accession, but it would also make reference to instruments that do not yet exist and the pro<Col N="580" />visions of which may be entirely different to those contained in the current accession treaty.</P>
    <P>To accept the amendment would be to tie down the Government's future policy in the area of labour market access following accession. While full labour market access is being granted to the eight accession states in question in this instance, this may not always be the case for future EU enlargements depending on a number of unforeseeable facts which include, but are not limited to, the prevailing labour market situation at the time of accession. If the amendment were accepted, we would be obliged to grant full labour market access after accession in future instances regardless of the factors that may need to be taken into account. Accordingly, I ask the Senator to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State and the Government are being overly cautious in rejecting my amendment. Our concern should be that people from the accession countries may not come here to work. This problem could face employers in the future. The Government should listen more intently to what employers say on the issue of work permits.</P>
      <P>I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage which will propose the deletion of subsections (3), (4) and (5) because there should not be a safety clause in the Bill. Having regard to the nationals of countries we will allow to work here without work permits in 2004, we should not insert such a safety clause. Such a provision is one for consideration in the future. We should not insert a provision to provide for a position which could be reversed in a few years' time.</P>

      <P>We are speaking at cross purposes. The Bill strikes a good balance. I do not like using the work &ldquo;generous&rdquo; in this sense because it sounds patronising but the Bill is generous in its welcoming approach to nationals from the accession countries. In the same vein, it is cautious in its punitive provision whereby employers must pay a fair fine if they are found to be in breach of the law, with which I fully agree. I also agree with the point that we cannot make plans now for a country which in the interim may decide to push its case for accession and be successful. We will amend the Bill at that point if it needs amending. It is far too anticipatory to seek to insert a provision covering circumstances when we do not know what that they will be or what countries will seek accession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am familiar with legislation and this Bill is a good mix of what is possible, what we should be doing in terms of our European duties and provides for keeping a watch on employers and employees.

      <P>This is an important section. I note Senator Tuffy is saying that there should be no safeguard in place and that the Department and the Minister should have no way of checking the position to ascertain the numbers coming here. From day one there should be a careful assessment of the numbers applying for permits. That is all I am saying. Perhaps I am wrong but time will tell. Nobody can predict what will happen in the future. The war is ongoing in Iraq and we do not know what will happen in world markets in 2004. It is right for the Minister to have a facility in place whereby he or she can assess the number of applicants applying for permits and match them with the number of vacancies. Does that not sound logical? If we need a certain number of employees to maintain our development, expansion, exports and the development of service industries, people can come here to fill those vacancies but we should not have an excess. The permit system, the triple mechanism, is a good way of ensuring we get the numbers to fill the vacancies.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the war in Iraq has to do with this. It is a red herring. While it is an important issue, it is not relevant to the Bill. Having regard to what the Senator said, I wonder if we are afraid of the accession countries. I met two Latvian parliamentarians at an event I attended yesterday and they would model themselves on Ireland. Latvia is ambitious and wants to be confident about its position. It will be the same as any other EU country but why are we <Col N="582" />treating such countries differently or why do we have a fear about them? If we were to follow the logic of what Senator Leyden said, perhaps we should be bring back restrictions in relation to other EU countries. Perhaps we should be concerned about the French, Germans and so on. The mantra of the Government is that the economy is healthy and that we need people to come here.</P>

      <P>This amendment is opposed. Subsection (6) provides that &ldquo;disturbance&rdquo; shall be construed in accordance with the treaty of accession. Annex 6 of the treaty of accession provides for the possibility, up to the end of the seventh year following accession, of labour market access being suspended when a member state undergoes or foresees disturbances in its labour market which could seriously threaten the standard of living or level of employment in a given region or occupation.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;significant&rdquo; contained in this amendment is not clarified, nor is it referred to anywhere in the treaty of accession in respect of a labour market disturbance. To introduce it here would not only be unnecessary it would also mean straying from the provisions of the accession treaty in which section 3 of the Bill is grounded. The Senators who tabled this amendment are perhaps concerned that an order reintroducing the need for employment permits should be made only under subsection (3) of this section where the threat to the labour market was a significant and real one. The above should reassure them that this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator Leyden's comments, the ethos of the European Union is geared towards the free movement of goods, services and people. I do not subscribe to the argument that <Col N="583" />we should set the number of work permits at the number of job opportunities. With a liberal regime in place in respect of work permits in recent years, a total of only 13,754 nationals from the accession countries were granted work permits and, of those, the vast majority came from Latvia and Lithuania &ndash; 3,958 and 3,816, respectively. Therefore, there is no reason to believe large numbers will come here.</P>

      <P>The provisions in section 3 exempt people from the eight accession states referred to from the need, as laid down by the treaty of accession, to obtain employment permits in order to enter into or be in employment in the State during the transition period. Under subsection (3), the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may, by order, reinstate the requirement for employment permits in the event of disturbances in the domestic labour market.</P>
      <P>This is, in effect, a safeguard clause which allows access to the labour market to be regulated during the transitional period. If the labour market suffers an unexpected or severe shock, subsection (5) would give the Minister the power to revoke or amend such an order made within the timeframe of the transitional period. The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that in a case where the reintroduction of a requirement for employment permits was later to be reversed, this reversal would also need to be based on an order made by the Minister.</P>

It is interesting that Germany and Austria, two very strong economies, have concerns that are not shared by any other Members of the Seanad. I may be in good company with <Col N="584" />Germany and Austria, two excellent countries and great trading partners. They want no freedom of access after enlargement, with an initial review after the first two years of the transitional period. Is that not a lovely provision? Germany and Austria are two powerful countries. One would feel Germany wants to expand and create jobs, as it is the primary funding country of the European Union.

      <P>This amendment deletes the penalty on indictment of up to ten years' imprisonment or a &euro;250,000 fine for an employer employing a non-national without a work permit. I agree with the Government move to make it illegal to employ a non-national without a work permit and to bring in a penalty, but this penalty is heavy-handed. The Government should put a proper green card system in place before introducing such heavy-handed penalties. These penalties are unfair because an employer could be caught by this provision, despite the fact that such an employer might not have set out to exploit a non-national.</P>
      <P>We know from newspaper reports that those who are exploited have often been employed under the work permit system. Huge improvements need to be made to our immigration system. We need an overall framework which allows people in according to our labour market needs but which allows them to apply for different jobs rather than being indentured to one employer. There should not be restrictions on moving from one job to another. Other situations need to be improved, such as the length of time it takes to get a work permit and our treatment of illegal residents, because people would then not abuse the system out of need. It would be at that point that we could be heavy-handed in terms of the penalties involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Senator Quinn made a good point. If an employer unknowingly employed a person on the basis of a good quality hoax permit, he would have a good defence. The Government and the Department are not seeking to trap employers. The section amounts to a stark warning to employers not to employ people without proper permits. It is vital these restrictions are <Col N="587" />enforced. Otherwise we can throw out the Bill and abandon efforts to enforce legislation on permits. While I accept the maximum fine of &euro;250,000 is high, I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only issuing authority for a permit is the Department which issues a permit in the name of the employer. It is unlikely an employer will inadvertently receive a hoax permit. Hoax permits are black and white copies of the original green, stamped form. I have seen them and it is obvious they are photocopies of doctored permits. An employer can only receive a permit if he or she has applied to the Department for one.</P>
      <P>The Minister could take steps to remove much of the fraud in this area. I fail to understand, for example, the reason it takes six weeks to get a permit. The application form is a four page document which requires limited information on matters such as the name of the company and the employee. The six weeks required to process applications has generated an industry in hoax documents.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Refugee Bill in the House the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spoke on the issue of asylum. Asylum applications are now processed in less than six weeks, yet much more information must be supplied, linguists are required to interpret and so forth. The Department's resources should be focused on reducing the time required to process an application. This would ensure employers would no longer seek ways to circumvent the regulations when they urgently require employees. Many employers cannot afford to wait for six weeks, not to speak of the four weeks they must wait once they have advertised a position with FÁS, to fill a vacancy, especially if the position is unskilled or for a short period, for instance, 12 months. I ask the Minister to address this issue.</P>
      <P>There is only one issuing authority. Employers do not receive permits in the post from bodies or individuals other than the Department. Persons in possession of a permit not issued by the Department will be breaking the law once this Bill which proposes to eliminate the industry in fraudulent permits once and for all is enacted.</P>

      <P>Employers found to have false permits will have recourse to the law. If there was subterfuge which had led an employer to inadvertently employ a person without a permit, it would become apparent and the person in question would have a firm claim in law which would be upheld by the courts. I fully support these punitive measures which are being introduced to safeguard workers against employers who seek to exploit them by failing to comply with the provisions of the legislation. That is the least we can do.</P>

      <P>I am responding to the points Senators made. There is a criminal industry in which, as I stated, well organised criminal gangs knowingly exploit the workforce. These gangs earn much of their profits on the backs of illegal workers. The level of fine in the Bill is required as a deterrent and will be imposed on indictment in the Circuit Court. The penalty must be sufficient to deter individuals in the business of exploiting illegal workers.</P>
      <P>Genuine employers who make mistakes, are careless or commit a first offence will have recourse to the defence mechanism set out in section 2(4). We have been careful to ensure a proper balance, part of which is the deterrent effect of the significant fines.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 14, after &ldquo;Slovak Republic&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and any other state which, after the passing of this Act, becomes party to an instrument whereby it accedes to membership of the European Union&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have reintroduced the amendment because I still believe it would be better to have a framework under which citizens of future accession countries would be allowed to work here without a work permit and without the need for new legislation to be introduced beforehand. It would be much better if we had an overall framework and comprehensive legislation on this issue. Our approach in the Bill and on the wider issue of immigration is too reliant on crisis management. We need a much more comprehensive framework for our immigration and work permit laws. We also need to be much more confident and less ambiguous about what we want in this regard. The refusal of the Government to accept the amendment shows it has mixed feelings about accession and the Nice treaty it promoted.</P>

Many steps have to be taken before we increase the number of countries involved and there will be ample opportunity to bring forward amending legislation to allow for that expansion. There will also be an opportunity for the Department to review the operation of the Bill at that stage. There is merit in not accepting Senator Tuffy's amendment, although I understand the point she <Col N="589" />is trying to make. She appears to be anticipating that her party will be in Government at some future time and acceptance of the amendment will avoid the necessity of it having to bring a Bill before the House.</P>

      <P>As Senator Leyden said, it would be foolhardy to tie the hands of any Government in the context of what may or may not happen in the future. The acceptance of the amendment would not only mean including the states not covered by the treaty of accession, but it would also make reference to instruments that do not yet exist. This would not make any sense. The provisions of those instruments may be entirely different from those contained in the accession treaty. We would be providing for a situation, therefore, which could be quite different in the future, which would not be in the best interests of the State.</P>

      <P>I agree that we have to be cautious about our economy and monitor it, but we also need continued growth and additional employees. Our concern should be that we will not be sufficiently competitive. To be competitive, however, we need employees from other countries. Employees here would confirm that and I am sure they believe the Government is being overly cautious as regards this legislation. If our economy experiences a significant downturn, it will be because we lost an opportunity. It will not be the fault of the people from the new EU countries if our economy fails. We can deal with problems in our economy by ensuring that we increase our competitiveness, allow employees to come here to work for employers, invest in research, development and education, train our employees, study our labour market needs and put a proper green card system in place. That is the way we should approach this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are sending out conflicting signals to the people from the applicant countries. On one <Col N="590" />hand, we are welcoming them but, on the other, we are being overly cautious and reactionary. The Minister of State said on Second Stage that our fears are unfounded. It would be wrong to welcome these people and then ask them to leave if the economy experiences a downturn. We cannot treat people in that fashion and it is in contradiction to the policy the Government adopted in respect of the Nice referendum.</P>

It is a good Bill because it is balanced and opens up the labour market in the State to the applicant countries and that is the image we want to portray in those countries. It also provides a safeguard in the event of a significant economic downturn.</P>
      <P>The enlargement of the EU provides significant opportunities for the State. We are on the periphery of Europe and we have yet to realise the opportunities for economic development that exist through the expansion of Irish business influence, particularly in the small and medium enterprise sector, in eastern Europe. The Bill provides the ability to develop a multinational structure similar to that developed here by the United States since the 1960s and it is vital that we display a good European image to the applicant countries where we would like to build such a structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the situation in Bennekerry national school. This school expected to be included in this year's round of schools building projects and there was dismay to find out it is not. That dismay was compounded when it discovered it is not even being considered for temporary accommodation although, since that discovery, the Department of Education and Science has climbed down to an extent and is issuing approval for some emergency accommodation.</P>
      <P>This school will appoint a ninth classroom assistant on 1 September. It is already using two cloakrooms for resource teachers, which is a disgrace. When it was refused the school extension it was hoping for, it was also refused a temporary prefab structure.</P>
      <P>When the Minister announced building projects in January, the school management was told by an official from the Department that the school should use its PE hall for a classroom. That is a disgraceful answer. Sport is either a part of the curriculum or it is not. A school PE hall is not a suitable structure for use as a classroom. This hall is also used for dancing, drama and related activities.</P>
      <P>The least the school and the 30 children who will join it in September deserve is a prefab so they can carry on with their education. Two cloakrooms and a medical room are being used for other purposes. I appeal to the Minister to explain to the school when it will get the emergency temporary accommodation. It is now only five months to September and the principal of the school needs to know when a decision will be made.</P>
      <P>I telephoned the Department of Education and Science to inquire about the situation but it was a waste of a call. The person who answered could not tell me when a decision would be made or who would make it. When I asked how many other schools in County Carlow would be affected by the decision, she still could not tell me. She was the official in charge of schools in Carlow. If that is the standard of official in the Department, we are doomed.</P>
      <P>I apologise for having to drag the Minister into the House to hear this matter but I had no choice. I have been assured for four weeks that a decision is due and I have been fobbed off every week. I hope the Minister of State will provide specific details in his reply.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline <Col N="593" />the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the allocation of funding for school building projects.</P>
      <P>The 2003 capital programme has now been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time.</P>
      <P>This year's building programme amounts to &euro;342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver over 140 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary level. In addition, over 400 schools will benefit from the capital programme and all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has already informed the board of management of Bennekerry national school that the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progress on projects, including applications in hand for funding, that could not be included in this year's programme. The management authorities at individual schools should continue to use funds from their devolved grant to deal with any urgent health and safety matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure this is the first time the Minister of State has heard two Fergals in this House in the one night.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to enlighten us about the state of the health service. We have heard about hospitals that plan to close down beds because of the lack of resources in their current budgets, the Mater Hospital being one example. I visited the hospital when I heard that 115 out of 500 beds are due to be closed. We have heard the same story from other hospitals, and there is a widespread feeling that this is just the tip of an iceberg.</P>
      <P>We are hearing denials from the Department of Health and Children that budgets have been cut. The Minister for Health and Children mentioned last week that the Mater Hospital's budget had been increased by 9% this year, and at the same time we have the bizarre situation that patients are being sent abroad for treatment they cannot get in this country &ndash; while the numbers of hospital beds is being reduced for lack of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" />I heard last week of a number of cases involving consultants for public patients standing around with nothing to do, because the hospital beds have been closed off, yet the State is paying for some urgent cases to go to private hospitals abroad, and the same consultants are being asked to go over and be paid for working in private hospitals. This situation is very hard for an outsider to understand as it must surely be cheaper to treat people in this country rather than send them abroad. I even heard a radio advertisement recently inviting patients to apply for treatment abroad.</P>
    <P>The present confusion about health service spending epitomises the fact that something is very wrong in the management of the considerable public resources devoted to health. The more money we have put in, the less we have seemed to get out of it, over a number of years. Somewhere, somehow, the money is swallowed up by an increasingly bloated system producing few visible results.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned at the situation whereby a hospital such as the Mater considers that the only way it can cope is by closing off one fifth of its beds. Everything the hospital continues to do thus becomes more expensive, because a large part of the hospital overheads continues to apply, and a smaller number of patients is being served by a slimmed-down system.</P>
    <P>Apart from the denial of services to people in need, closing down beds is not cost-effective. It may make sense from the point of view of individual hospitals, but from the national viewpoint it is a disaster. In recent times we have seen an increasing awareness that there is something fundamentally wrong in the health service management, with the situation getting worse. I will welcome an explanation from the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD" hpid="Mr. T. O'Malley Mr. T. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Quinn is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.</P>
      <P>The approved level of spending nationally for health services in 2003 is in excess of &euro;9 billion. Of this, over &euro;500 million relates to capital spending, with the remaining &euro;8.5 billion available for revenue spending. This level of expenditure represents an increase of almost 9% on the figure for 2002, which allowed the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to allocate funding for the ERHA and the health boards that is approximately 9% higher than that provided for in the 2002 letters of determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this level of funding is significant, it is recognised that the ERHA and the health boards have had to take difficult decisions in the current year on their service provision and priorities. Nevertheless, it must also be recognised that even in the prevailing economic climate the health services have again received the highest increase in <Col N="595" />funding across all Government Departments, a clear indication of this Government's commitment to maintaining the quantum and quality of services in difficult economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Regional Health Authority has a total of &euro;1.154 billion available to purchase acute hospital services in 2003. This figure includes additional funding of &euro;9.45 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services agreed and funded in recent years. This is the basis upon which the ERHA developed and agreed its own 2003 service plan with the Department of Health and Children. Additional funding has also been provided to meet the costs associated with the recruitment of additional consultants in emergency medicine and consultant anaesthetists, and for cancer, cardiology and renal dialysis services.</P>
    <P>The ERHA accepts that 2003 will be a difficult year for the acute hospitals sector, as increases in funding over last year will be limited. There is a clear need for tight management of cost and activity. The ERHA has emphasised that, at a minimum, the same total level of services which it approved for the Dublin academic teaching hospitals last year will be provided by the hospitals this year.</P>
    <P>The Mater Hospital expenditure last year was more than that approved. The Mater has identified a range of cost-saving measures, many of which will not impact on activity levels. However, the hospital's plan for the year does envisage scaling back activity by 8%. The hospital is confident that the planned level of activity is deliverable within the reconfiguration of the bed capacity proposed. All opportunities to maintain activity levels will continue to be explored by the hospital and the ERHA, including substituting less expensive day-case work for in-patient activity and funding elective procedures from waiting list funding.</P>
    <P>Significant developments are proceeding at the Mater Hospital this year. Additional funding of &euro;4.5 million has been provided to meet the cost in 2003 of developing the new national lung transplant programme. This Government made a specific commitment to support the establishment of <Col N="596" />such a facility in Ireland. The commitment arose out of concern about the small number of Irish patients who were receiving lung transplants in the United Kingdom. The Mater Hospital was chosen as the surgical site for the programme, given its status as the national centre for heart transplantation, in conjunction with St. Vincent's Hospital, which is the designated national centre for the treatment of adults with cystic fibrosis.</P>
    <P>We have delivered on this commitment despite the financial difficulties that prevail. The additional funding of &euro;4.5 million allocated this year for the lung transplant programme brings the total revenue funding available for this programme to &euro;7.9 million. Considerable preparatory work has been completed at the Mater Hospital, including the provision of appropriate assessment facilities and the appointment of key transplant personnel. It is expected that the first lung transplant will be carried out at the Mater Hospital later this year.</P>
    <P>Last October, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, announced approval for a &euro;1.3 million extension and refurbishment programme for the accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital. This project, which includes the provision of additional resuscitation cubicles, the development of a chest pain assessment unit and the establishment of a minor injury unit, will significantly improve facilities in the emergency department and will also have knock-on benefits in relieving bed capacity pressure.</P>
    <P>Additional funding was made available to the ERHA this year for cancer, cardiology and renal services, and it has indicated that these essential services will be protected at the 2002 approved levels. The ERHA and the major Dublin hospitals will continue to work closely together to ensure that the availability and standard of patient care is accorded the highest priority.</P>
