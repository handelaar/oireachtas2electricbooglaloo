      <P>I have received notice from Senator Morrissey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to verify the length of time it takes to issue a floor area certificate in order that first-time buyers can claim the first-time buyer's grant in view of the concerns raised by new home buyers in Ongar Park, Clonsilla, Dublin 15.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to make a statement on the industrial action at the Department of Agriculture and Food office at Michael Davitt House, Castlebar and other locations throughout the country which has led to devastating consequences for those involved in the livestock, retail and export trade; and the need for the Minister to initiate a meaningful dialogue with a view to having the matter resolved as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to explain the reason children with multiple handicaps are unable to avail of emergency and specialist dental care in their own county as is their right, especially in this year of the disabled.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to intervene personally in the current clerical dispute which is causing hardship to the personnel involved and to the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" />I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Morrissey, Higgins and Feighan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. As Senator Burke's matter is similar to that of Senator Ulick Higgins, I am sure Senator Higgins will be generous and will facilitate him.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, a sessional order as agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion whereby the subject matter of motion No. 15 on today's Order Paper is referred to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, concerning the revocation of three regulations which have been incorporated into sections 4 and 23 of the recently enacted Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003, thereby rendering the regulations superfluous, to be taken without debate; No. 3, Licensing of Indoor Events Bill 2001 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude at 6 p.m. or earlier.

      <P>I welcome back to the House Senator Cummins who, unfortunately, has been absent for some months. I can assure the House he is fighting fit and ready to throw a number of scuds in the direction of the Government in the coming weeks. He is welcome back to the House following his illness.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Order of Business. I agreed reluctantly to No. 1. I am sure the Leader will agree that there is no intent on the part of the Government to muzzle any Member.</P>

      <P>The embattled Minister is doing his best to come out of the storms. We need a statement from him in the next week or so about what is happening in Dublin hospitals. We are going to lose 250 beds in five acute hospitals in the city of Dublin this year for which there has to be some political accountability.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss his new found strategy to prevent SARS from coming into the country. He was found wanting over the Easter period when pressure was applied from Opposition Senators and Deputies. There is an urgent need for him to make a statement. I can assure him of the support of many on this side, unlike the support he receives from the Minister for Finance and others.</P>
      <P>I encourage the Leader to organise statements on Northern Ireland, tomorrow if possible. She was in the House before the Easter recess when a very useful debate took place and Members bit their tongues to make sure they did not say things which were controversial or unhelpful to the talks. However, now is a time to be reflective as the talks have clearly broken down. There is a need for the Government to set out its stall and for Members on both sides of the House to reply to the Government's statement.</P>
      <P>The IRA has no future. All it has is a past, and a very ugly past at that. It is important for this House to reiterate its support for both Governments and their stance in the talks and to say clearly to paramilitary organisations that they have no future, that they are not part of Ireland's future, that their past is something we do not relish and that as soon as they get off the scene the better in order that we can have a peace agreement which works to all our benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first week of February I raised the importance of having a debate on the health service and at least one of the reports on the service which were then due to arrive. There are now three full reports sitting on someone's desk or locked in someone's drawer. They have not been seen, apart from the selective leaks to the media. At the time I asked that the House look at and respond to one of the reports from a neutral political position but we have gone past that now. I do not know the reason the Government is hiding these reports or what people are afraid of. Are members of the Government afraid of each other? Is the Government afraid of the Department of Health and Children? Is the Department of Health and Children afraid of the Department of Finance or is the Department of Finance afraid of the Minister for Health and Children? God only knows what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three substantial reports which would help us to reach an understanding at a time when ordinary people are worried sick about beds being closed and cutbacks in the service. Whether that is the case is not the issue. Ordinary <Col N="1244" />people do not understand what the problem is or what is the future of the health service. It is disgraceful that we do not have an open and clear debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>There is no support in the Cabinet for the Minister for Health and Children. He has been swinging in the breeze for the last two weeks and no Cabinet Minister has come to help him. What kind of image does it give to the rest of the country if the Minister does not have the support of the Government? What is the Government's policy and where are we going? I agree with Senator Brian Hayes. We should let the Minister have his say. While I do not know the rights and wrongs of the situation, I believe we are being kept in the dark. Ignorance is the worst thing we could have. A mushroom policy is not acceptable at a time like this. We need openness, honesty, information and solid judgment. I ask for an immediate debate on the issue, as I have been doing for the last two months. </P>

      <P>I was on strike last Thursday as a member of the staff of CIT. I did this not to benefit myself but because the Government has betrayed the Cork School of Music. It told staff and students to vacate a building to facilitate contractors and that they would have new premises. It then negotiated a contractor into being the sole contractor and is now attempting to back out. If that happened in the private sector there would be a major court action for breach of contract by the major contracting party with all other participants. My colleagues in CIT are working in hotel bedrooms trying to teach young people in Cork how to play musical instruments because the Government promised them that if they made that sacrifice they would get a new building. This disgraceful breach of promise is worthy of debate, given that Dublin Institute of Technology also seems to be determined to eliminate the teaching of music from its curriculum. </P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to allow us to debate music education in the two biggest cities in the State in Government time. Both cities are in danger of losing publicly provided music education. That is as close to cultural vandalism as I can imagine a Government can get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senators Brian Hayes and O'Toole about the need for a debate on the health services. I heard the Minister say this morning that there is no crisis. This is the familiar refrain, &ldquo;What crisis? There is no crisis,&rdquo; that has been in existence for most of my active political career. There is a crisis in the health service. It is very simple: either there is enough money to fund the health services, in which case the Minister should sack the management because it is not using resources properly, or there is not enough money, in which case the Minister should resign. It is as simple as that. Either there is enough money or <Col N="1245" />there is not. It is up to the Minister to take responsibility and to get away from the weasel words. In the five major Dublin hospitals, 6% of all procedures are now being cancelled &ndash; 14,000 out of a total of 250,000. That is a significant number and it is less than honest to pretend otherwise. There should be a serious, open-ended debate on the health service.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow afternoon we will be debating Report Stage of Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. It is now 2.50 p.m. on Wednesday and we have not received any Report Stage amendments from the Government. I do not know why we must have Report Stage tomorrow. The Opposition is happy to facilitate the Government in this matter but we did not expect to be in a position less than 24 hours before the debate where no Government amendments have been tabled, even though we were led to believe there is a considerable number of amendments. It is not the way to deal with this House and I suggest that the Leader should postpone Report Stage until the Department is in a position to produce amendments at reasonable notice to the Members of the House. I invite the Cathaoirleach to take the appropriate action with the Department.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader tell us when or if the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill will be taken? Will she assure us that we will get at least two weeks notice before Committee Stage of the Bill? It is extremely complex and the Opposition is entitled to know when it will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Easter recess, I asked the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to come into the House. At that time the transport situation was serious but it has now reached an even more alarming stage in that the Director of Traffic recently told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport that the figures forecast for traffic in Dublin in 2016 have already been realised. If that is the position, the Minister is operating a strategy in respect of which there are insufficient resources.</P>
      <P>We must realise that we are only tinkering at the edges of this problem. I want the Minister to come before the House to explain what he proposes to do regarding the future of Dublin Bus and the situation at Dublin Airport and Dublin Port. He must also explain his proposals with regard to the national road network. For example, will cars be allowed to use hard shoulders on national routes? Of the 27 agencies that deal with traffic in Dublin, which is the primary agency? This issue not only affects the economy of Dublin, it affects the entire national economy and I request a debate on it.</P>

      <P>Last week, one of the most successful radio stations in the country lost its franchise. On the surface, this appears to be a bizarre decision. The station was in existence for 13 years and was commercially successful. On the day it was announced that the franchise was to be removed, the JNLR disclosed that the station had a listenership rating of 68%.</P>
      <P>We are supposed to be living in an era of openness, transparency and accountability. In view of the fact that the ODTR, energy regulator and aviation regulator can be held accountable, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland should also be accountable. Two problems exist in this area: first, the legislation contains a manifest defect in that there is no provision for an appeal process and this must be addressed; and, second, the BCI must issue a report on the criteria used to make what appears to be a bizarre and wrong decision.</P>

      <P>Having experienced difficulties of a somewhat analogous nature in Tipperary, I support the call made by Senator Higgins.</P>
      <P>There are three other matters on which there ought to be early debates. The first is Sustaining Progress, in which all the social partners are now involved and participating. The second involves the one mode of transport to which Senator Morrissey did not refer, namely, the fact that a substantial report has been made in respect of the strategic rail review. Given that railways will have to take most of the strain in terms of extra commuting, it is important that we should debate this issue. There is great expertise among Members on the subject in question. I endorse Senator Brian Hayes's call for a debate on the situation in Northern Ireland, including the Stevens report.</P>

      <P>I am sure Senators would wish to congratulate the European Union Commissioner, David Byrne, on his initiative yesterday in bringing together in Brussels the Health Ministers from EU member states and applicant countries to discuss a pan-European policy on preventative health care. However, it is unfortunate that Ireland's Minister had to attend &ndash; I am sure he made a valuable contribution to the debate &ndash; at a time when the doctors involved in preventative medicine here remain on strike after four weeks. I ask the Leader to request that the Minister come before the House to explain how he proposes to deal with this serious situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not referring to SARS or anything quite as exotic. There has been a major outbreak of measles which has caused national schools to be closed in some areas. This is the sort of crisis which the public health doctors would be dealing with if they were not on strike. It is terrible that children are losing time at school because of the current situation. Nine years ago, public health doctors were promised improvements in conditions but these have not been implemented. <Col N="1247" />The Minister must take a direct interest in the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Brian Hayes in calling for a debate on Northern Ireland. It is timely that there should be statements on the matter. It would be remiss of the House not to highlight the attack on our democracy that occurred yesterday, when a terrorist device &ndash; a pipe bomb &ndash; was planted not 100 yards from the House. We should congratulate the Defence Forces on their professionalism in dealing with that device and send out an unequivocal statement that acts of this nature will not be tolerated in this State. To have the stories relating to this matter carried on pages seven and 13 of the national newspapers, sends a message that we are ready to tolerate being held to ransom by the Real IRA, the Provisional IRA or whoever. They are consigned to the history books, which is where they should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A clear message must go out from this House that we will not tolerate attacks on our democracy such as we witnessed in this city yesterday.</P>
      <P>I also wish to call for a debate on the Cork School of Music. My views on the matter are well known and while I may not share the sentiments expressed by my colleague, I would welcome discussion of the issue.</P>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on the health service. It is time to make the political decisions which have to be made in light of the reports which are pending publication. We have had a number of debates on the health service and it would be interesting to see if the Opposition have anything to offer during the forthcoming debate, given that they had nothing to offer previously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Health seems to be the focus today. Many Members received literature about the national treatment purchase fund. Those of us with constituents who wished to undergo surgical procedures discovered that it was possible to have them carried out in Northern Ireland and the UK provided that certain criteria were complied with. It is difficult for people to accept what is happening when 250 beds in Dublin hospitals are to close and it is projected that 14,000 procedures will be postponed as a result. How can one explain to the electorate what is happening with the health system here when procedures can be carried out in the United Kingdom? It is timely, therefore, to invite the Minister to come before the House. Most people request a debate in the presence of the Minister, but it is about time we provided for a question and answer session with him. It would be far more enriching to put the pertinent questions to the Minister and invite his direct response, rather than having a large num<Col N="1248" />ber of Members expressing their opinions in speeches.</P>
      <P>This matter was brought home to me forcefully when I was in Dublin on Sunday. While I am not completely aware of the state of the health service in Dublin, a taxi driver remarked to me that one of his parents was on a trolley in hospital for six days. The driver told me that he lives in Cabra and that when the Taoiseach came knocking at his door he told him about the problem. He stated that the Taoiseach only realised the full extent of the problem when something happened to a person in his family.</P>

      <P>I would also welcome a debate on Northern Ireland, particularly if it was held in the spirit of previous debates. There is always a temptation when there is a hiccup in the peace process, no matter how large, to revert to issuing recriminations. The success of the peace process to date is that its architects have been able to involve all interested parties in Northern Ireland. That is why we were on the verge of a total breakthrough.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to underestimate the contribution made by republicans. They and the Nationalist community were on the receiving end on Bloody Sunday of the police collusion outlined in the Stevens report on the shoot-to-kill policy and the various manipulations that have no part in democracy in any state on this island. I suggest that we keep our cool and remain patient. We have one more mile to go and we should not feel we are incapable of travelling it. This House, like everyone who is interested in peace and justice, has a role to play in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that we need an urgent debate on what is no less than a crisis in the health service. That crisis is growing by the day. At the heart of the debate must be the question of who is accountable and answerable to the public for the growing crisis. To pick up the point Senator Finucane made regarding the national treatment fund, will all those who cannot undergo procedures due to bed closures, particularly in Dublin hospitals, be able to avail of the fund to have those procedures carried out abroad or in Northern Ireland? Does not this matter illustrate the farcical nature of the Government's management of the health service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume the Taoiseach is responsible for brining forward the new code of ethics for office holders in Government, as suggested by media reports. Will the Leader ask him if the new code will cover the situation that emerged over the Easter break, in which the Minister for the Environment and <Col N="1249" />Local Government is getting very large donations from the largest building companies in the country at the same time as he is bringing forward legislation that specifically affects those companies? The code should cover this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland, which is timely. There is never a good time to do it but there is no point in putting it off. We did have a truncated debate just before the adjournment and the peace process is in rather worse condition that it was then and than we had hoped and anticipated. Like other Senators, I hope we can have a debate that avoids recrimination. The parties are recriminating each other too much already. A mutual trend among them is that one sees the other as offering too little too late and itself as offering too much too early. Although the Easter break was a disappointing period and some silly things were said, we recognise that some useful things were said also. It is important to try find our way out or help the parties to find their way out of the impasse.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ó Murchú in saying we should not bring emotion into the debate. One cannot begin to talk about Bloody Sunday and the Stevens report without also talking about bloody Friday, bloody Wednesday and every bloody day of the week during the years through which we all had to live. Equally, while we deplore yesterday's attack on democracy, we must recognise that any bomb anywhere is an attack on democracy and we should not be more self-important about the fact that it takes place outside the back door of Leinster House than other instances.</P>
      <P>It is important for the Government to try to tell us where it sees the process going, what people can sensibly do and whether it is time to batten down the hatches and make complaints. A quiet, reasoned, sensible debate which seeks answers, recognises that we are where we are and progresses without recrimination would be helpful and should be expedited.</P>

      <P>There is an insurance crisis throughout the country and nowhere is it more evident than in the Leader's town of Athlone, where a public meeting was held recently on the issue. I call for a debate on the issue because a number of hackney drivers, small businesses and hauliers are being put out of business. The small family business is collapsing because of the astronomical and spiralling costs of insurance. I know of several instances in the past 12 months in which insurance premiums have increased by 400%. This is very serious and people are frustrated about it. It is important that we have a serious debate because we cannot afford to lose the small businesses and hackney services because the public depends on them, as do hospitals and health boards. We should clamp <Col N="1250" />down on the spiralling increase in the cost of insurance premiums.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support, for different reasons, the sentiments of Senator Higgins on the granting of a new licence to a new consortium for the north-west region. I know that the station has been very well run over the past 13 years and has been very successful. It has been one of the top local radio stations in the country. We know that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is an independent body and that it is its job to decide who gets new licences. It was wrong, however, that a decision was taken and that the reasons for it were not given for up to three to four weeks. I say this because 15 people are employed by the radio station in question. It is also wrong that the recipients of the new licence will not take over until December of next year. That is wrong because the 15 people employed by the station at present must continue to work there for 14 or 15 months while being aware that they will probably lose their jobs at the end of that period. I wish to express support for the raising of this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to briefly endorse the calls for a debate on the health service. There is little doubt that the crisis affecting the service is financial in nature. It would not be right, however, to have a debate in the House without recognising that, if this can be resolved or alleviated by injecting money into the health service, we cannot ignore the fact that there is a source of this money, from which some Members are benefiting. I refer to the fact that a massive payout of benchmarking money will be made this month to all public servants, including Members.</P>
      <P>People may feel strongly about the underfunding of the health service, but I have yet to hear Members speaking out against this exorbitant payment, which is a luxury for people who are paid out of the public purse and which most people can afford not to take. If Members wish to express these heart-rending views about what is happening in hospitals, let us hear what they have to say about where the money should be saved and let us hear them say that this 10%, 12% or 13% increase should not be paid and should go to the health service instead.</P>

It must be remembered that public servants have permanent pensionable jobs and, in many instances, have longer holidays than people in the private sector.</P>

      <P>I call for a debate on Northern Ireland and for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to kindly come before the House to discuss the status of the proposed public inquiry into the Stevens report. On 26 April, <i>The Economist</i> referred to this matter as Britain's &ldquo;dirty war&rdquo; and argued that a public inquiry is needed into army and police collusion in murders in Northern Ireland. In the <i>Financial Times</i> of 3 May, the chairman of the Bar Council of England and Wales called for a public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane and noted that the Stevens report found that members of the RUC and the army colluded with loyalist paramilitaries to murder Catholics. Two British publications are calling for public inquiry so I would like to know when one will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister made a statement when the report came out. I have read a great deal about Sir John Stevens who stated that when he showed his report to people, they said one would not read about such collusion in a book. What we really need to know is how far up the line this collusion went, who knew about it and who spoke out. We all know about the Member of Parliament, Mr. Hogg, who spoke out and that three weeks later Pat Finucane was killed. The bottom line in what Sir John Stevens said is that people knew.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we were last here the Government announced the disbandment of Duchás, a decision with which I heartily concur. Embodied in that decision was the important transfer to the Office of Public Works of responsibility for the built heritage. Reading the Government statement, one would assume &ndash; I would like to think <Col N="1252" />it was the Government's intention &ndash; that responsibility for the entire built heritage would transfer to the Office of Public Works. It would be invidious if that was not the case &ndash; in fact, it would be crazy if there was a division in the presentation to the public of our built heritage. I say this because of something which I think is a little more than a rumour and on which the House might unite. An important heritage property in my county and another in County Donegal are, for some inexplicable reason, to be excluded.</P>

      <P>I am sure Members will agree with me in asking the Leader to convey the concerns of this House to the Minister for Agriculture and Food about the refusal of the Turf Club of Ireland to renew the licence of Kilbeggan racecourse to the race committee there. This facility contributes significantly to the economy of mid-Westmeath. I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food take an interest in the matter.

      <P>The back-to-education allowance scheme was introduced to tackle disadvantage in education and give a second chance to those in receipt of a number of social welfare allowances. It has now been abolished for postgraduate students and cut by 25% for remaining recipients. This is having a devastating effect on those in receipt of the allowance. Will the Minister for Social and Family Affairs come into the House with a view to reviewing this situation? The Union of Students in Ireland has made a strong and coherent statement in relation to the <Col N="1253" />allowance and the cutback which was not heralded or advertised in the newspapers. People only found out about it in due course which is totally unacceptable. Will the Minister come to the House to explain the reason this cut was not publicised and there was no consultation?

      <P>I join in the calls for a debate on Northern Ireland. Many Senators mentioned different aspects and injustices done during the many years of the troubles. There is no doubt that the Good Friday Agreement has been the answer and that we are now on the final furlong. I would like to see mention in the debate of something missed in many places because of the focus on final acts of completion from one side: there seems to be a train of thought in some quarters in the North of Ireland that the Good Friday Agreement &ndash; or agreement in general &ndash; is up for renegotiation. I would like to see it restated, not only by people outside this House but inside it too, that the Agreement is the only cross-party agreement with the support of the majority and the world community which sees the justice that it brings.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the question raised by Senator O'Meara about the code of ethics for officeholders. We must remember that the vast majority of officeholders in the State have never needed such a code. However, it is to be welcomed. We always like to see people upholding the highest standards, as very many have done during the years.</P>

According to this story, it is possible that the Minister for the Environment might receive extra funding from the Minister for Finance for the local government fund. I would appreciate if the Leader would clarify whether there is any truth in the article, for if so, some local authorities, as is the situation in Cork, will no longer be proposing to the trade unions, as at present, that they lay off some temporary workers.</P>

      <P>I join Senators Higgins and Scanlon in asking the Leader whether we might get a report from the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland on what happened with North West Radio. The BCI is an independent up-front body chaired by an eminent senior counsel, and I believe there is nothing untoward in its dealings. However, such a report would help alleviate the shock, sadness and upset to which counties such as Mayo and Sligo were subjected last Thursday. I was inundated with calls from people in Sligo who were terribly saddened and shocked at the NWR licence not being renewed. It is fair competition but perhaps, since there is no appeal system, there should be a mechanism whereby a report could be issued to the present incumbent <Col N="1254" />outlining where it might have slipped up or what went wrong.</P>

This morning we learned that SARS had a 20% mortality rate and that it was increasing every day. Will the Leader ask the Minister to confirm that the long-term effects of SARS are still unknown? It is unhelpful to dismiss it as if it will not affect us when it is doing so every day of our lives. We still do not know its full mortality rate or long-term effects. What steps does the Minister plan to take at airports and other entry points regarding those travelling from affected countries?</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, wants a debate with the Minister for Health and Children, with particular reference to the Dublin teaching hospitals and SARS, something taken up by many others. There was also a call for a Northern Ireland debate which I hope we will have next week. We have submitted a request. I agree that it is very important that we have one.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly reports. While the Hanly report has not been produced, I have been told that the Prospectus and Brennan reports are in draft and final form, respectively, and will be out very soon, perhaps next week. As soon as they are issued, we should have the Minister here to discuss them.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the delay regarding the Cork School of Music and the reasons behind it. That matter was given a good airing in the Seanad by another Senator from Cork. I am sure the Senator was joined in it by Senator Minihan and other interested people. I do not how we can push this matter forward. It seems to have reached an impasse of amazing proportions. I do agree, however, that a debate is needed. There were calls for a general debate on music education. Bearing in mind the difficulties at the Dublin school of music, it would be proper to couch the debate in that way. I will seek to have the relevant Minister from the Department of Education and Children to come to the House to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to be clear on the amendments for the Official Languages (Equality) Bill and put it on the record of the House. On Tuesday last, I was contacted by telephone by the office of the Minister who will be taking the Bill and asked if it could be put down on today's Order of Business. I asked if the amendments would be sent on and was informed they would. Today has come, but <Col N="1255" />there are still no amendments. My office telephoned again this morning. I want to say it here quite clearly as there is no point in trying to hide behind something. The request for the Bill to be taken was made, directly to me, eight days ago. I said that it could, if the amendments were received. I intimated that fact to Senator Ryan when we met earlier in the day. I do not know what has happened to the amendments. There is no likely excuse, apart from the fact that someone may have fallen ill &ndash; a matter about which we would be sympathetic. However, responsibility surely does not rest with one person. It is not correct that we should be asked to debate a Bill with no amendments having been received.</P>

      <P>Senator Morrissey asked for a debate on transport. He went through all the modes of transport for which the Minister for Transport has responsibility. The Senator asked which of the 27 agencies was the primary one in dealing with transport problems and inquired when can we have a debate on the matter. I want the various transport reports debated and, in particular, the Booz-Allen report. I have made several requests for this and we hope we will get a debate soon.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins raised the issue of local radio franchises. Clearly, a situation where a commission that does not have group regulator and does not allow an appeal is incorrect. If one cannot pay water rates, one can make an appeal to the local county council. If there is a stipulation and it cannot be fulfilled, there should be a way of appealing. I do not know the ins-and-outs of the North West Radio's licence but I was amazed to hear from another Senator that the current radio group will remain in place until September of next year. It is extraordinary that the group will be required to enthusiastically provide a full service when it has been informed that its licence will not be renewed. I will write to the chairman of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland inquiring about the situation. I cannot dispute the decision, but I will ask why there is no appeal process.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh referred to Sustaining Progress, in respect of which we have requested a debate for next week. The Senator also asked for a debate on the strategic rail review and I hope we will have it soon. He also asked for a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of the public health doctors' dispute. I agree with the Senator <Col N="1256" />that it is not so much the issue of SARS &ndash; dreadful as that prospect might be &ndash; but the daily epidemics, particularly those to which young people are exposed. I understand that the parties involved have gone before the Labour Relations Commission and have been requested to return to it. If that is the case, we should let them resolve the problem by that avenue.</P>
    <P>Like other Members, Senator Minihan requested debates on Northern Ireland and the health service. Senator Michael Finucane raised the issue of the national treatment purchase fund. I was also struck by the incongruity relating to the fund, about which we received smart looking notifications at the same time that beds are being closed in our hospitals. I know they are different procedures &ndash; clearly, one is elective, where one needs treatment for a particular ailment and it can be customised and provided through this procedure. However, an incongruity definitely exists. When we get the three reports and the Minister comes before the House, we will discuss those issues.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú reminded us that in any debate there are two sides to the argument. We all pay tribute to those who took so many steps forward, particularly in recent weeks. I am sure that hefty debates took place in all parties and that much was given up in terms of various rights. We need a balanced debate on Northern Ireland. If we do not receive the amendments to the Official Languages (Equality) Bill, we could have a debate on Northern Ireland tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara asked for a debate on health issues and wondered about the code of ethics which I understand is an amplification of a code we already have, in respect of which Ministers and all involved in public debate will declare personal interests and say they are working <i>pro bono publico</i> rather than from any self-interest or involvement.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the debate on Northern Ireland. I agree with him when he says there should be no recriminations as to who said what, to whom and when. That is now behind us. We have come a long way and the problem now is to take the last step.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon raised the question of the insurance crisis, on which we have asked for a debate. We have five items to discuss, of which that is one. I hope to bring them forward in the House as quickly as possible. The Tánaiste has made considerable strides in this area. This term she will bring forward the legislation which is to be addressed immediately. We look forward to the debate.</P>
    <P>Senator Scanlon mentioned North West Radio. It was he who told us that the deadline was September 12 months.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross raised the health debate and benchmarking and who was going to give up their <Col N="1257" />money to contribute to the health service. That would be an option for his good self also.</P>

      <P>I mean it. He asked who would do it. Benchmarking is based on individual productivity. Senator White also brought this up and wondered how the productivity of public servants would be monitored and measured. If one signs up for it, one signs up to deliver. Clearly, we all have a responsibilty to say how we see ourselves conforming to benchmarking. The Senator also wanted a debate on Northern Ireland, as did Senator Coghlan who also raised the disbandment of Dúchas, with which he agreed, which is very interesting.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy brought up the matter of the report he read in <i>The Sunday Tribune </i>on 27 April to the effect that extra money would be given to the local authorities and wondered whether it was true. I will endeavour to find out because clearly it would have an effect on his county council.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn referred to Northern Ireland and brought up the matter of Kilbeggan racecourse which is under the remit of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy John O'Donoghue, not the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh. I have spoken to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and his office about the matter. All politics are local at the end of the day. It is a very fine racecourse. While it seems extraordinary, safety is at the root of the decision. However, I think it can be completed, not circumvented.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins mentioned the back-to-education allowance which was included in the Book of Estimates. If he does not mind me saying so, it would be a very good matter for debate on the Adjournment because we want clear answers on the matter. While I understood it was going to be settled in some way, there has not been movement on it.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin mentioned Northern Ireland and welcomed the code of ethics. Senator Browne referred to SARS and the airport. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, said there would be no screening of people here but that they would have to give an account of how they were screened in the countries from whence they came.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), line 11, after &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to insert &rdquo;, through its Chief Fire officer or Inspection Officer,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is about responsibility and the devolution of powers to different personnel within a local authority. An officer has to take ultimate responsibility within a particular area and it is too broad to leave to an authority. Ultimate responsibility should rest with one person, who issues the instructions or orders to close down. An authority <Col N="1259" />is a very broad-based structure, and with the words &ldquo;chief fire officer or inspection officer&rdquo;, one pins down an activity to a particular area and an authorised officer. That is very important.</P>
    <P>It is all about safety, particularly with regard to persons attending events. We have seen catastrophes in the past and we never want to see similar situations anywhere. I see a Senator present who was at one of those fiascos. We want to remove the possibility of such disasters from society. As legislators we have a duty of care to our community, and safety procedures for the protection of people are of paramount importance. They should be left in the hands of particular officers, and it would copperfasten rather than alter the legislation to insert the amendment. Perhaps the Minister of State, whom I know for some time, would take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. In relation to the amendment proposed by Senator Bannon, I understand there was coverage of this issue in the media recently. There was also a debate held in Westport among fire officers on the question of fire fatalities and the level of expenditure. The Minister of State when replying might comment on that. Senator Brady gave us the example of the Stardust fire in 1981. There might be a case for putting emphasis on a chief fire officer or an inspection officer, but the question of expenditure is certainly important. In my county, Galway, the chief fire officer and the county manager always talk about the need for extra funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with the coupled amendments Nos. 1 and 10, tabled by Senator Bannon. I cannot disagree with anything he has said about the importance of fire safety. The feeling is unanimous in both Houses that we have a duty and obligation in relation to fire safety. Regarding the proposal to insert &ldquo;chief fire officer or inspection officer&rdquo; in the Bill, the person authorised by the fire authority would include the chief fire officer and other senior officers. There would be a number of assistant chief fire officers, and other senior officers could be authorised and appointed by the fire authority, by the county manager. As I pointed out in the Dáil, there is no need to single out one particular officer. The fire officer would nominate officers and one would naturally be the chief fire officer, so there is no necessity to specify the chief fire officer or indeed the inspection officer as Senator Bannon has suggested. For that reason I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were to improve the Bill, I would be the first to accept it, but it does not. It would be wrong to single out any one officer when the matter is to be dealt with by the fire officer and the <Col N="1260" />county manager. This power is already covered under section 29(<i>c</i>) which inserts a new subsection (5) in section 18 of the Fire Services Act 1981. It is considered that the recommendations given in writing by the authorised person concerning fire safety measures, together with the additional strengthened powers available to the authorised person under the Act, enable him to do the equivalent to an improvement notice. The approach we have taken in the Bill is considered to be a more efficient and effective method of dealing with these matters than the more formal improvement notices.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive consultation has taken place with chief fire officers and fire advisers in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and this Bill is seen as a vast improvement. This is not just in the best interests of the Department, the fire authorities or the chief fire officers, it is also in the interests of the owners or those in control of the various establishments. This Bill gives a broad range of options to the fire officers and to those inspecting on the day or night. Senators will know that the 1981 legislation provided for a fire safety notice which could never be withdrawn &ndash; the premises could be re-opened but the fire safety office could never be withdrawn. It took some time to close down. Even going to the High Court could take some time.</P>
    <P>In the best interests of those attending indoor events and ensuring their lives are not in danger, the fire officer, or authorised officer, can give advice orally or in writing or serve a closure notice. This means the premises could be closed immediately. This has improved the quality of the Bill and is in the best interests of all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>As we all know, this legislation came about as a result of the Hamilton report. It relates to the independence of positions and accountability within a local authority. The chief fire officer is professionally trained for the specific purpose of his or her job and nobody should be in a position to overrule him as his decision relating to the safety of people is paramount. He should have sufficient power and should not have to go back to the manager or other officials within the structure. If he sees that there is a risk to the safety of people at an event he should be able to close the premises on the spot. It is important that we strengthen the legislation to ensure the catastrophes we have seen in the past never happen again. I tabled this amendment to strengthen the legislation and perhaps the Minister of State will consider including it.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate that Senator Bannon is trying to strengthen the legislation, we have already done this by incorporating section 29(<i>c</i>) which inserts a new subsection (5) in section 18 of the Fire Service Act. We have now given authority to the authorised officer &ndash; who could <Col N="1261" />be the chief fire officer, assistant fire officer or senior officer &ndash; to issue a closure notice. Depending on the circumstances, the officer can issue an oral or written warning or, in extreme cases, issue a closure notice and if conditions are such, extreme action must be taken. We have incorporated this into the Bill and have strengthened it. To do anything other than this would weaken the Bill somewhat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the chief fire officer ultimate control over the manager so that the manager cannot intervene in any case? The Minister of State mentioned oral warnings. The spoken word can be misinterpreted and I fear what would happen if it went to court. In court, there can be a different interpretation taken of the written word and the spoken word. If a person cannot produce a document stating the specific reasons for closure, local authorities could be in trouble in the courts.</P>
      <P>The decision should ultimately rest with the chief fire officer. While it is a managerial function to appoint staff, the position of chief fire officer should be paramount and no other official should be allowed to intervene in such matters. Only the courts should have jurisdiction over a fire officer if a case is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Each fire authority has one chief fire officer. This chief fire officer, unlike a politician, cannot be on call 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. It would be extremely serious if this power were vested in the chief fire officer alone or in the the county manager. We are vesting this power in the authorised officer, appointed by the fire authority. While it is likely to be the chief fire officer, it may not be necessarily so as it could be the assistant fire officer, senior officers or someone authorised by the manager to issue a closure notice. It could be so serious that to stop and put the notice in writing would be irresponsible. This can be done orally or in writing. Those who contributed on Second Stage referred to some of the extreme cases we have witnessed in the past. If extreme circumstances exist this must be done immediately.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what Senator Bannon has said. If a case goes to the courts, the question of what he or she said will be debated. It is extremely important the responsibilities are not transferred from the owner, or person in control on the night, to the authorised officer. All the officer can do is give advice and this is sensible. The only other power available to the authorised officer was the fire safety notice. Its implementation could take some time as it could be appealed to the courts. This Bill is as precise as practical. The chief fire officers and advisers to the Department requested this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of premises that are good and well run will have no difficulty with this and will welcome any help that can be given to ensure that <Col N="1262" />we take all precautions to ensure patrons attending a function are safe. Everyone that goes out for a night wants to ensure that they are in a safe premises and, as legislators, we have a responsibility to do this.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that we should insert section 29, with the new subsection (5) in section 18 of the Fire Services Act 1981 at this time. We have taken the opportunity to use this Bill as a vehicle to amend the Fire Services Act. While I am not saying Senator Bannon is being irresponsible &ndash; I appreciate the principle of what he is saying in trying to improve the Bill &ndash; it would be irresponsible of me to accept this amendment.</P>

The authorised officers, to be appointed by a fire authority county manager, will definitely be chief fire officers, senior fire officer or assistant fire officers.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), line 19, after &ldquo;both,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;fine to be index linked,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the Environment Protection Bill, I moved similar amendments with regard to penalties and I have already expressed my views on that legislation. The fine needs to be index-linked in order to discourage people from breaking the law. In the case of pollution of the environment, the penalty fines on posters throughout the country are in existence for the past nine, ten and 11 <Col N="1263" />years and the countryside continues to be littered. The maximum fine in place, which is less than &euro;800, is indicated on billboards throughout the country. That fine is not relevant today, particularly in light of the problem being created on some of our county roads by people dumping their garbage, etc. If the fine is not index-linked it will appear very minimal in a few years and will not be a serious deterrent. I ask the Minister to consider index-linking the penalty to the crime. If a person is guilty of an offence, the punishment must fit the crime. The penalty proposed in the Bill may appear minimal in five, ten or 15 years. It is important to keep it in line with inflation and the cost of living. The purpose of these amendments, which are reasonable, is to have the fine updated on an annual basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle of the amendment and the need to look at the actual amount being levied in fines. If the fines are not index-linked, we will probably have to return with further Bills to increase them as the years go by. Will the Minister of State indicate if this will happen or if some other Minister will bring in legislation? On a number of occasions in the Dáil I raised the issue of paying fines by instalment and I was informed by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he would have to bring in new legislation or the Constitution might have to be changed.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of difficult cases. I may be straying from the point made by Senator Bannon, but there are difficulties for people in paying fines. It appears to be the only area where one cannot pay by instalment. Perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should bring in a Bill to deal with the question of indexing fines and paying fines by instalment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the principle behind the amendments, which are similar to the amendments tabled in the in Dáil prior to Easter. Of course, a number of years down the road whether the fine is &euro;3,000 or &euro;1.3 million on indictment, it may need to be increased. That is a problem that has always existed. This matter will be resolved and responsibility for the indexation of fines is not a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government but for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. That Department has indicated that it is at an advanced stage of drafting a new fines Bill which will include the issue of indexation of fines. I understand the Department is aiming to have the Bill published by the end of the year. The Department's advice, which is supported by the parliamentary counsel, is that we should await the enactment of the proposed fines Bill which will deal with the issue of indexation across all Acts of the Oireachtas. The Bill before House includes the current &euro;3,000 fine, which is the maximum for <Col N="1264" />a summary fine under the District Court fines, and &euro;1.3 million for conviction on indictment. While these are substantial fines, by 2020 they may not be that substantial but indexation will take care of that.</P>
      <P>Senators will note that section 25 updates the fines of the Fire Services Act 1981. We are in a position to do that and we wanted to avail of the opportunity of using this Bill as a vehicle to do so. We are anxious to bring them into line with current court fines and we have done so in section 25. Indexation of the fines in this Bill would not be appropriate having regard to the forthcoming fines Bill, which is expected to be published by the end of the year and enacted next year. That will, once and for all, take care of fines and ensure indexation of fines across the spectrum of Acts of the Oireachtas. While I do not disagree with the principle as stated by Senators Bannon and Kitt, I hope my explanation and the publication and enactment of a fines Bill will take care of their concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State indicating that he is considering index-linking by 2020? He said index-linking would take care of the situation by 2020. I accept that there is a glimmer of hope. I appreciate that he mentioned another Department being involved. Why complicate the matter by bringing extra bureaucracy into the system? Why can it not be done in the context of the Bill? It has been done in other Bills and, perhaps, it should be considered.</P>
      <P>Another issue is the high cost of insurance for events where large crowds congregate. We are aware of the astronomical costs. Will the relevant Department introduce legislation to reduce the cost of insurance? When the legislation is improved, insurance costs should be taken into account immediately by the insurance company. For any of us who are involved in organising events, there is always the question of whether they can proceed because of the high cost of insurance. The Licensing of Indoor Events Bill will greatly improve the position because of what it is doing to protect the health and safety of people.</P>
      <P>I hope the issue of insuring events will be dealt with quickly. St. Patrick's Day parades, as well as various football, swimming, angling and other events, were under threat this year. We have all had the experience of events which came to a close call. This evening we could be racing at Kilbeggan were it not for a safety issue with regard to an ambulance track around the course. While insurance costs for that particular event are extremely high, I understand the committee had paid the insurance costs. While the right decision was taken in the interests of safety, we would like to see such matters cleared up in order that there would not be a loss to the local economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the close of a racing season, inspections should take place so that the organisers of an <Col N="1265" />event can be cautioned well in advance about the actions they need to take prior to the event taking place. It is regrettable for the midlands and for tourism in the area that Kilbeggan races will not take place this evening. However, that is a different issue. Advance warning should have been given to the organisers of that event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify what I said earlier. I do not want any ambiguity whatsoever. This has to be totally black and white. I said that if it was not to be index-linked, &euro;3,000, on summary, or &euro;1.3 million, on indictment, in the year 2020, for example, would not be a great deal. I was merely making the point that index-linking would overcome all difficulties. There is no question of inserting anything in the Bill about 2020 or 2030. I was merely providing an example. Fines which were set in legislation in 1981 are not appropriate in 2003. It would be much more sensible if they had been index-linked.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of transgressing into the responsibilities of other Ministers. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has general responsibility in that field. However, with regard to insurance, the Licensing of Indoor Events Bill provides for insurance cover, not only for the event but also for the full duration of same. I appreciate that every type of insurance must be dealt with. It is a fixed charge which makes it almost prohibitive for some businesses to survive. All public representatives have experience of this problem. The Government appreciates the seriousness of the matter and the Minister hopes to be able to do something about it. We must remember that it is the private sector which is offering the service. The Tánaiste made it clear that she intends to do something about it. I hope it will be index-linked by next year. That should overcome the concerns of Senators Bannon and Kitt.</P>

      <P>Section 25 replaces section 5 of the Fire Services Act 1981 with a new section 5, which updates the penalty provisions of the 1981 Act and brings them into line with current practice. Indexation will then take over. It also removes the complicated procedures for dealing with offences under sections 18(2), 20 and 37 as set out in the old section 5(3) of the Fire Services Act 1981. This procedure, which involved the DPP and the defendant's right to trial by jury and the Criminal Procedure Act 1967, was a complex and lengthy process and hindered the effective enforcement of the penalty provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>The proposed amendment will make provision for the inclusion of a new section 20A, which is inserted in the Fire Services Act 1981 by section 30 of the Bill. That is the closure notice in section 5 of the Fire Services Act which deals with the penalty provisions of that Act. This amendment is required to provide that an offence under the new section 20A, closure notice of the Fire Services Act 1981, may be prosecuted either as a summary or as an indictable offence. Under the amendment the new section 20A is included with the other sections of the Fire Services Act, namely, sections 18(2) and 20 and regulations made under section 37, which may be prosecuted as either summary or indictable offences.</P>
      <P>The amendment aims to include the new section 20A in the Fire Services Act 1981. This new provision ensures that non-compliance with the closure notice may be prosecuted as a summary or indictable offence. This amendment will strengthen the 1981 Act by including these sections.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who participated in the debate on Second and Committee Stages. Amendments tabled by the Government were important and I thank the House for accepting them unanimously. The amendments which have been approved here will be considered by the Dáil as soon as possible and the Bill will hopefully be enacted at an early date.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to an issue which is in the public domain today and which was raised during the debate by Senator Kitt. The Senator highlighted the fact that while Ireland is reported to suffer one of the highest international levels of fatality resulting from fire, it has one of the lowest levels of expenditure on fire services. I thank the Chair for its indulgence and I am glad of the opportunity to urge caution, as does the report in question, in making international comparisons.</P>
      <P>It is not easy to compare like with like. The source of the statistics in the report on Irish fatality figures added an arbitrary 24% for cases which may not have been reported. This was also done in the cases of some other countries while the comparative expenditure figures outlined are similarly fraught given the different tasks undertaken by fire services in different countries. Like is not being compared with like necessarily. It is interesting that the report shows that the four highest <i>per capita</i> spending countries have, nevertheless, relatively high levels of fire fatalities. However, one life lost is one too many and we must do whatever it takes, including spending more money, to reduce fatalities.</P>
      <P>The greatest benefit is to be gained through targeting preventative measures at households. In the period 1980 to 2002, inclusive, there was a capital investment of &euro;177 million in fire services. Over 130 new or refurbished fire stations were provided, over 400 fire appliances and other fire fighting emergency and rescue equipment was purchased and the computer aided mobilisation projects, CAMP, were put in place. This year has seen a record allocation of &euro;18.838 million in funding. While there have been some adjustments in the various Estimates, I am happy to confirm that the fire services have maintained the record level of investment of last year. Local fire authorities spend approximately &euro;136 million annually to provide fire and emergency services. I hope that I have provided some clarification to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank and congratulate all of the professionals in the fire service who are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year to provide a public service. I wit<Col N="1271" />nessed that service at first hand over Easter as gorse fires were tackled between Good Friday and Easter Sunday in various parts of the country. In my own county, every single fire unit was called out to prevent the burning of any more houses than that which was lost. A number of vehicles were also burned.</P>
    <P>I also take this opportunity to call on those who were inadvertently responsible by lighting these gorse fires to be more careful. The damage to wildlife and the general area cannot be undone, no matter what funding the State provides. I thank the members of the fire service for their dedication, commitment and professionalism in the job they do very well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House to deal, in such an efficient manner, with the Bill. I am glad he has responded to the issues of fatalities from fires and the level of investment in fire services, which I raised earlier. He has outlined the amount of money which has been provided for fire services. The county managers and chief fire officers in every county will rightly seek more money and we will all support them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred also to the great work of the fire authorities and the fire services over Easter in fighting the many gorse and furze fires in Galway and other western counties. The fire brigades had to be called out quickly right through the Easter period to deal with those fires. There was much damage done to the environment though there were, thankfully, no injuries in County Galway. We must emphasise the need to prevent fires of this type.</P>
      <P>While the debate dealt with the licensing of indoor events, I hope we can return to a discussion of issues relating to the fire service. Senator Bannon's amendments suggest that we will examine the questions of fines and indexation when another Minister attends the House. We have had a fine debate on many issues surrounding the fire service, particularly as they relate to the licensing of indoor events.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Kitt in complimenting the Minister of State on the manner in which he shepherded the Bill through the Seanad. He came before the House for all Stages, which is much appreciated. I join the Minister in complimenting the fire services on the wonderful work they do. It is usual for politicians to have complaints about different areas of action within their local authority, but in my 18 years as a public representative I have never had a complaint about the fire services. I record their commitment to the health and safety of people in my county. The same could be said for every county because we seldom hear complaints about the fire service. It is important that local authorities recognise retiring members of the service more than they do in <Col N="1272" />some counties. It should be recognised that members work partly in a voluntary capacity and are on call 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The heroism of the firemen in America brought it home to us that we have an equally good service in Ireland. I compliment all those involved.</P>
      <P>The Licensing of Indoor Events Bill is important in terms of improving safety standards. It all started in 1990 with the Hamilton report and recommendations were made in 1998. The Bill is now being passed in the Seanad and is very welcome. I hope it will be effective for a long time to come.</P>

As we know, the fire service provides an absolutely vital emergency service and those involved risk life and limb to ensure there is a better and far safer society. Society deserves and demands no less from us than the speedy passage of this legislation for which I thank the Minister of State.</P>

There is no doubt that it has an enormous amount of work to do. The Minister of State mentioned the figure of &euro;136 million spent last year &ndash; money very well spent. We all appreciate the great strides the fire service has made at local authority level. I would like to see adequate finances made available to local authorities and the fire service in future years to implement this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, noting that the use of tobacco and the abuse of alcohol represent the two biggest threats to public health in this country; recognising the right of people to work and socialise in a healthy smoke free atmosphere; demands that the Minister for Health and Children implement an immediate ban on smoking in licensed premises; con<Col N="1273" />demns the efforts of lobbyists and some politicians to prevent the introduction of such a ban; calls for the immediate introduction of a ban on direct or indirect alcohol advertising in any communication medium which has a significant audience of people under 18 years of age and calls for appropriate changes in the law to ensure that the Garda have all the powers they need to detect the sale of alcohol to minors, to prosecute persons who are responsible for such sales and to seek the immediate and, where appropriate, permanent closure of premises where such sales take place.</P>
    <P>I am an instinctive libertarian, even though libertarianism is associated more with the extreme right than with the position on the left that I may claim to occupy. I know many Members on the other side of the House enjoy suggesting that I have no real entitlement to claim to be of the left since I do not have holes in the soles of my shoes or some such nonsense. Nevertheless I am of the left and am an instinctive libertarian and very reluctant to restrict people's freedoms to do much as they wish. Indeed, without betraying any secrets, at our parliamentary party meeting today we had a letter from Barnardos about taking a pledge not be seen having an alcoholic drink on our hands in public. I took great exception to this. It was an extraordinary demand to make.</P>
    <P>There are two things involved in our motion. I actually assumed that the motion would be agreed by the Government and I am astonished that an amendment arrived as late as about one o'clock today. Given that we mere members of the Opposition come under considerable pressure if we cannot produce a motion by Thursday evening, one would expect greater speed of response from the Government.</P>
    <P>Nothing will fill a parish hall or school hall quicker than a talk about drugs. Tell parents at a school that there is to be a talk about drugs and they will be hanging out of the rafters. Tell them there is to be a talk about tobacco and they will not turn up. Tell them there is a talk about alcohol and they will probably turn up in reasonable numbers. Drugs can produce a response like no other issue. I want to talk about the drugs of choice of the people of Ireland and the ones that are killing significant numbers of people, the first because of its inherently insidious nature and the second because of the extent to which we have become a society of abusers.</P>
    <P>It is actually difficult for a member of the Roman Catholic Church to say this but tobacco is inherently harmful. It may serve a purpose in nature but it is, of its nature, inherently harmful. I do not know any smokers who really believe that smoking does them any good. Many of them would maintain that continuing to smoke is the lesser of two evils, but that is not the same as doing them any good. This is a fundamental difference between tobacco and alcohol which I will come back to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" />It is hardly worth taking up the time of the House with the statistics but the most horrendous statistic I came across in preparing for this debate is from a European study available on the Internet which provides a country profiles database for Ireland. It suggests that the total number of deaths which could be attributed to smoking in this country between 1950 and 2000 was about 250,000. That is the sort of figure that should make anybody think carefully. It is probably a conservative figure because nowadays we quote a figure of around 6,000 deaths per year.</P>
    <P>If all smokers retreated into a little room on their own and smoked themselves and other smokers to death I might very much regret that fact and might want to do as much as possible to prevent it, but it would not be an intrusion upon the health of the rest of us. The truth is that the exposure on a regular basis to other people's smoke can increase the risk of a variety of tobacco-related ailments by a factor of between 30% and 40%. Research is probably beginning to show that the figure is higher than that. It is hard to believe now that in theatres 30 or 40 years ago the entire audience would feel perfectly free to blow smoke in the direction of the unfortunate actors. It is so unthinkable nowadays. Having to breathe in smoke in cinemas was a regular feature until perhaps ten years ago. I used to have to inhale smoke in a restaurant until quite recently. When I still have to breathe in smoke in a pub it puts me at risk, first of all.</P>
    <P>The same logic that prohibited smoking in theatres, cinemas, a good part of restaurants, the place where I work and many other areas of activity demands that people who insist on smoking cannot be allowed to do so anywhere that people want to socialise or, in particular, any place where others have to work. The first part of our motion, which is about tobacco and the extraordinary damage it does to public health, recognises no more than what the Government amendment does, that people have a right to work and socialise in a clean, healthy, smoke-free atmosphere. We wanted to encourage the Government because rumours and newspapers stories have it that there is an increasing lobby both from the vintners and within one of the Government parties that seeks to dilute the Minister for Health and Children's commitment to ban smoking in licensed premises. All the organisations concerned about tobacco-related public health, whether the groups concerned about cancer or heart disease, have been in touch with all Members of the Oireachtas demanding that we ensure this ban is carried through in full and on time.</P>
    <P>It is an outrage to pretend that it is somehow an imposition. The argument I have heard is that it is unenforceable in licensed premises. I was in New York comparatively recently and ended up in a bar which was probably more of a student bar than somebody of my age should have been <Col N="1275" />in &ndash; it was an accident. It was a noisy, crowded, young persons' bar. One after another, people got up from their places, went outside the door, smoked a cigarette and came back in. It was an extraordinary experience to end up in a pub in which there was no smoke and suddenly to discover that it is the smell, the taste and the feel of smoke which affronts, not confronts, one the minute one walks inside the door of a pub. In that most libertarian of societies, they have succeeded in banning smoking in public houses, licensed premises and in bars. There is no reason we should not do so here. I, and my party, fully support the Minister for Health and Children in his determination to do so. I cannot understand why parties which support the Minister find it impossible to carry through the logic and to identify the wrongdoing of lobbyists and some politicians who would attempt to prevent the introduction of such a ban. That is inherently wrong.</P>
    <P>In regard to enforcement, if publicans say they could not enforce a ban on smoking in their premises &ndash; such an obvious and visible thing &ndash; how in God's name can I believe that they can enforce rules about under age drinking, which are far more difficult to enforce given the difficulty establishing and proving people's age? If they do not have the will, the organisation or the ability to enforce a ban on smoking, then, manifestly, they will not have the will, the organisation or the ability to enforce a ban on under age drinking.</P>
    <P>That leads me to the second of our drugs of choice &ndash; alcohol. The tragedy of tobacco, and particularly alcohol, is that while it took us perhaps 50 years to recognise what is now so obviously true, that is, that tobacco smoke is inherently unhealthy, we have known for many a long year that the abuse of alcohol is a social harm. Let us remember that alcohol is a good thing which makes people convivial, sociable and agreeable but 25% of all admissions to accident and emergency departments are alcohol related. Some 13% of people who attend accident and emergency departments are clinically intoxicated.</P>
    <P>There is manifest evidence that this country has a huge problem of under age drinking, yet the section of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 which required that suppliers of alcohol for consumption off the premises had to be identified on the container has not been implemented three years later. Gardaí cannot sit in a pub unidentified and sort out whether under age people are being served. Every parent in every town and city knows where their under age children can be served. I say this with respect to the Garda Síochána but the only people in towns and cities who do not know the names of the pubs where people under age can get served seem to be the Garda Síochána &ndash; everybody else knows. I know the names of such pubs in Cork. The last time I said this I got a phone call from a senior official of the Garda Síochána who said he did not know. When <Col N="1276" />I told him they were all raided on Saturday night, he did not need me to tell him that.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of political will on the issues of tobacco and alcohol. The Minister for Health and Children has the political will but I am beginning to wonder whether his Government colleagues have a similar political will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I note with interest the Government amendment to our motion because it appears there is little difference between them. I hope that before the end of the two hour debate, we may be able to come to some agreement. I am glad to note that we are, in effect, singing from the same hymn sheet. That is important because, as legislators, we have a major role to play not only in terms of statutory controls in relation to alcohol and tobacco but also in regard to the lead we give. Connected to that, it is important that there is consensus and unanimity among all Members of this and the Lower House in relation to the core issue of cigarettes and the need to protect and, in particular, improve public health when it comes to tobacco smoke.</P>
      <P>I am indebted to the report produced in December 2002 by the Health and Safety Authority and the Office of Tobacco Control on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke, ETS, in the workplace. If anybody is in any doubt about the effect of environmental tobacco smoke, I suggest they read this report because it sets out clearly the hazards generated by the inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke &ndash; in other words, somebody else's smoke. ETS is carcinogenic. Only last year, the World Health Organisation's international agency for research on cancer said that exposure to ETS is carcinogenic to humans. That is the position of the scientific community and it is a fact of which we must take cognisance and on which we must act. The questions are how and when we act.</P>
      <P>We are looking for a commitment by the Government to act as soon as possible on this issue. This motion is designed to help the Government, and the Minister for Health and Children in particular. We have major differences with the Minister on other health matters but this is one area in which we should not have a difference. This motion is designed to provide as much support as possible to the Minister's proposed legislation in regard to banning smoking in the workplace and in public houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Member of the previous Seanad, I was a member of the sub-committee on smoking of the Joint Oireachtas Committee Health and Children. In one of the public submissions made to the sub-committee when it was drawing up a report on this matter, Professor Luke Clancy said that 50% of the admissions to St. James's Hospital in Dublin were tobacco related. Other hospitals obviously have in their beds &ndash; which are becoming scarce &ndash; a considerable number of patients who are there because of smoking <Col N="1277" />related illnesses. The cost of smoking to the public purse is enormous and, if only on that basis, we need to tackle it. Happily, we are becoming increasingly intolerant of smoking in the workplace and in public places.</P>
    <P>When my eldest child was born in 1984, the hospital that I attended allowed smoking in the wards so that, following visiting time, one could occasionally see&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. I know that the Minister and the Leader of the House are trying to resolve the issues regarding this motion.</P>
      <P>Wards containing new-born infants could often be filled with cigarette smoke &ndash; obviously ETS &ndash; following public visiting hours. I should have declared earlier that I am a former smoker, and one of the presents I received as a newly delivered mother was 200 cigarettes. Although they are very useful for getting through the night, I have happily given up the habit since.</P>
      <P>People who have not smoked perhaps do not appreciate that when one is a smoker one regards cigarettes as one's best friends. They are a great crutch. Obviously they are a drug, and they are difficult to give up. The vast majority of people want to give up smoking. In that regard, the legislation we have put in place so far, as well as that which we want to put in place, is very important in encouraging and supporting people who wish to give up. That important point must also be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>I have one more point before I turn to the issue of alcohol. When smoking was banned in bingo halls, we were told that it would be the end of public bingo sessions, but it was not. Banning smoking has not ruined cinemas or theatres. All it has done is improve the quality of life for those who attend those public places. It has provided a major encouragement for people who want to give up.</P>
      <P>My message to the Minister is that he should keep going and not allow himself to be distracted from his objective. A ban will not adversely affect business in pubs either. I rarely go into pubs because of the cigarette smoke, for as a non-smoker I find the atmosphere intolerable, and that does not encourage me. It is also notable that in this country the incidence of smoking is higher among lower-income groups, and how we tackle smoking as a public health issue must be examined in public education programmes. Smoking is undoubtedly linked to poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That I have only one minute left leaves me very little time to say what I wanted about alcohol. I will make two brief points, the first being that, although I hope it is changing now, we in this country have an extraordinarily high level, not only of alcohol consumption, but of alcoholism. It is time that we confronted the fact that we are <Col N="1278" />bordering on being an alcoholic nation. I recently had a 24-year-old in my office in Nenagh who, following two stints in Aiséirí, is now, happily, a recovering alcoholic. He is trying to ensure there is somewhere to go for young emerging alcoholics. He would say that he was an alcoholic by 15, and he is not alone. Anyone will tell you that, in leaving certificate classes and younger age groups, there are emerging alcoholics, and we simply do not do enough about it. From a public health perspective, we must face up to our community responsibilities to intervene at a much younger stage and confront people individually about drink.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, many people now talk about the amount that young women drink, something that confronts our sense of their role and status in the community. It is notable that a survey carried out by the Rape Crisis Centre among clinic attendees seeking the morning-after pill showed that, while the incidence of rohypnol was extremely low, there was a high incidence of binge drinking, the rate of which has become extremely high. We must confront that, not only among young women, but also among young men.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the need for an advertising ban. We have allowed alcohol to be glamorised by the drinks industry's advertising. We must replace that with public advertising, essentially showing the down side of alcohol and the dangers of alcoholism.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes that the consumption of tobacco products and the abuse of alcohol pose a huge burden on the public health of this country, recognises the right of people to work and socialise in a clean, healthy, smoke-free atmosphere, supports the ban on smoking in places of work announced by the Minister for Health and Children on 30 January 2003, which will come into operation from 1 January 2004, notes the intention of the Minister for Health and Children to bring forward legislation to reduce the exposure of young people to alcohol advertising, and recognises the Government's commitment to implementing the recommendations contained in the interim report of the strategic task-force on alcohol.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tobacco and alcohol are two socially acceptable drugs. It is for that reason that they are so dangerous. To a large extent, they lull us into a false sense of security. I thank the Labour Party for bringing the motion before the House and giving me the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his outstanding commitment to date regarding tobacco and alcohol addiction. This and the pre<Col N="1279" />vious Fianna Fáil Government have done more than any others to highlight the use of tobacco and alcohol as serious threats to public health. I would like&mdash;</P>

      <P>What about pubs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be easy to tell the Senator what his party had done in Government. We will not embarrass him just yet, but we will get to it.</P>
      <P>Regarding tobacco, I commend the activities of organisations such as Action on Smoking and Health and the Office of Tobacco Control. As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I was very surprised &ndash; but on reflection, not so much &ndash; to hear from an expert that tobacco is more addictive than heroin. The statistic was damning by any standards.</P>
      <P>Alcohol is a drug that we all consume from time to time. The issue is not so much use as abuse. Very often the Vintners' Federation of Ireland is demonised. We are not saying that its members are all great, but they are all bad either. They are not a baby-sitting service, in which role some members of society would cast them. When some Johnny or Mary comes home locked to the gills with alcohol at the age of 15 or 16, the first question asked is what pub gave him or her the alcohol. That is very pertinent, but the question of where the mammy and the daddy were is never asked.</P>
      <P>It is only fitting and correct that I list what this Government and its predecessor have done. The Fianna Fáil-led Government raised the age limit for buying tobacco from 16 to 18, stopped advertising in newspapers and magazines and ended sponsorship by the tobacco industry. It took positive action by providing for the free availability of a full range of nicotine replacement therapy products to people who cannot afford them, namely, those with medical cards. It initiated sustained media advertising campaigns directed at preventing young people from taking up smoking. It allocated several million euro extra to the health boards to help them improve compliance with the tobacco laws.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children established that very important organ, the Office of Tobacco Control. That office, with the Health and Safety Authority, commissioned the report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace. In fairness to Senator Ryan, Senator O'Meara and other Members, they have quite rightly mentioned working in a safe atmosphere. If ever there was a reason for the creation of the Health and Safety Authority, it was the problem of environmental tobacco smoke and its ill-effects, not only on the people who generate it but also on those who are obliged to inhale it, even though they were not responsible for the origination of that particular atmospheric pollutant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" />It is ironic that a party, when in Government did nothing to protect the public against the dangers of tobacco use, should attempt to lecture the current Government&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;to protect the public from this killer drug. Truth can be shamed but it can never be blamed.</P>
      <P>It was the current Administration that, for the first time in the history of the State, seriously highlighted the right of people to work and socialise in a healthy, smoke-free atmosphere. It is good of the Labour Party to also recognise this right. I thank the Labour Senators for doing so and I am not patronising them by saying that. It is good that we have a Government which recognised the issue and took concerted action on it.</P>
      <P>It is important to note some important statistics in respect of alcohol. In 2001, Ireland ranked second after Luxembourg for alcohol consumption with a rate of 11.4 litres of pure alcohol <i>per capita</i>. The EU average is approximately 9.1 litres <i>per capita</i>. Due to the seriousness of the problem, the Minister for Health and Children established a strategic task force on alcohol early in 2001. The remit of this task force was to provide advice to the Government and public bodies on the measures to prevent and reduce alcohol harm.</P>
      <P>We can trot out statistics <i>ad nauseam</i>, but there are two matters that remain to be resolved. The Minister for Health and Children is determined to ensure that smoking in public places and in areas where people gather for social reasons will be outlawed. This will happen and the Government's proposals on it will be supported in both Houses.</P>

I delighted to be informed at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children that the Vintners Federation and the IVF have advised their members not to stock alcopops. While this advice has found favour with many of their members, I reiterate that some of them have not complied with it. The vast majority of people who sell tobacco products and alcohol are responsible individuals; it is the exceptions to the rule we have to root out.</P>

As a representative of publicans, I must state that we do not condone the abuse of alcohol. I estimate <Col N="1281" />that 99% of people go out to enjoy a drink and do not cause trouble. It is disturbing when one sees reports about alcohol consumption on programmes such as &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;, but we are discussing perhaps only 1% of the population. No one would have time for publicans or anyone else who serves alcohol to serve people who have had too much to drink.</P>
      <P>With regard to smoking, publicans are concerned about the health of our patrons and staff. However, it will be very difficult to enforce this legislation. There will have to be a compromise somewhere along the line. There are areas in Dublin &ndash; such as Dardale, Coolock, Tallaght, Ballymun and Finglas &ndash; where there are large pubs of a kind that do not exist in other parts&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not be allowed to have small establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another issue. I do not know how these proposals could be enforced without major difficulties &ndash; verging on riot situations &ndash; arising in these pubs.</P>
      <P>An individual in New York was stabbed to death when he interfered with somebody who was smoking. I hope that will never happen here. It will be difficult to police the no smoking ban in pubs with 600 or 700 customers where eight or ten individuals who are sitting together drinking decide to smoke. I hate to think of what might happen if a barman tried to enforce the no smoking rule in such circumstances. This is one area about which I am concerned. I hope that, in all pubs &ndash; but particularly large establishments &ndash; small areas will be designated for committed or chain smokers to allow them to smoke away from the presence of the remainder of the patrons and the bar staff.</P>
      <P>We carried out a survey recently in which it was found that 70% of staff in public houses in Dublin smoke. At present, the owners of some establishments are being obliged change work rosters in order to ensure that staff who do not smoke do not have to work with those who do.</P>
      <P>There are the small, country pubs where, for generations, people have gone after working on the farm all day and lit a pipe or smoked a cigarette. I do not know how a publican in such an establishment will approach someone he has known for 30 or 40 years and inform them they are no longer entitled to smoke there. That will create major problems. Most of those pubs would be able to set aside space to allow the people to whom I refer to smoke and not bother anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other area I wish to address is ventilation. There are ventilation systems available which facilitate a complete change of air every three minutes. There are several pubs in Dublin that have already installed this system. I cannot understand how, if the air in a pub is changed every three minutes, smoking could endanger the <Col N="1282" />patrons' health. One would be safer there than on O'Connell Street with the exhaust fumes from buses, cars and other vehicles.</P>
    <P>These proposals will have a major effect on tourism. Ireland will be the only country in Europe that will have a total ban on smoking. It should be remembered that between 30% to 35% of the population in every country smokes. I recently returned from Portugal where people are permitted to smoke in bars, restaurants and cafes. The same applies in Spain. Until now, when booking a hotel in Ireland, one could ask for a smoking or non-smoking room. Soon we will have a situation where there will be no smoking. One will not be able to smoke in a hotel lobby, restaurant, bar or bedroom. I cannot see why anybody who smokes would decide to come to Ireland for a holiday. This is an area that should be examined.</P>
    <P>Regarding the mortality rate of bar staff, my association and an independent organisation conducted a survey on this matter. We have a large number of pensioners who worked in the bar trade all their lives. The mortality rate among these people is, if anything, no greater than that of people who are not involved in the pub trade. I cannot see how people can argue that smoking is major danger to bar staff.</P>
    <P>There is a total ban on smoking in New York. I recently spoke to a friend who owns seven pubs in Manhattan and other areas of New York. Trade is down 25% to 30% since the total ban on smoking was introduced. If that were to happen here, I would hate to think what would happen to 80% or 90% of publicans. Again, I say to the Minister of State there should be a compromise somewhere along the line to look after the welfare of the public and staff, and that of publicans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I apologise for Senator Feighan's absence. He wanted to lead on this issue tonight as it falls within his brief. I congratulate the Labour Party on bringing forward this motion.</P>
      <P>On smoking, there is no distinction between the types of substances smoked. I was in England a week ago where the major trend seems to be in the direction of smoking cannabis. Perhaps it has not hit here to the same extent, or perhaps it has. I am not aware of it because I am not a smoker. However, I would like to indicate my viewpoint briefly. At the weekend I was in a quaint bar in my area. There is a small light that comes down over the bar counter. At one stage towards the end of the night as I watched the smoke rise above it there was an old guy drinking his bottle of stout and a half one and smoking a pipe. I do not think my vison was blurred but it would have made the most romantic photograph &ndash; if that is the right word &ndash; or snapshot. It was idyllic and romantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>Romantic, Donegal style.</P>

    <Col N="1283" />
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to look at the major reports and the push being made by the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation and be realistic, not romantic, in our notion of smoking in bars. I say this without being in any way self-righteous about the matter because I do not smoke. While smokers should have choice &ndash; I do not want this to sound like a cliché &ndash; they do impinge on others if they are in a closed environment without proper ventilation. Research has proved that passive smokers suffer as a result of inhalation. I am, therefore, definitely in favour of the legislation to come through in January 2004 and commend the Minister for State on bringing it forward. I hope he keeps the momentum going because I have taken soundings from bar staff in my area and those who do not smoke find that their physical well-being suffers as a result of being behind the bar when there are smokers present. There is a percentage of those who go to discos who do not smoke but when they have a few drinks, they make a habit of taking cigarettes from smokers. I include myself in that group. I do not smoke but when I get to a disco, I might occasionally have a cigarette. The new legislation might curtail this habit.</P>
      <P>I would like to expand a little on drinking because there are two large issues before us today and time does not afford us an opportunity to go into both of them now. I notice that the two Labour Party speakers spoke mainly about the smoking issue but in the time remaining to me I would like to make a few comments on drinking. We have to start with the premise that Irish people love to drink. At times we seem to take pride in this fact. I recall that during the World Cup match in Orlando in which we were competing with the Dutch we were proud of the fact that we could drink more than them, party longer and wake up earlier to start drinking again. I say this without being self-righteous because I take a drink and enjoy a pint, perhaps too much at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last weekend when I spent time with my two younger brothers, one aged 24 years and the other 26, I was introduced to their world of drinking. It is a very disciplined lifestyle. They do not drink from Sunday to Thursday. They only drink on Friday and Saturday. As last weekend was a bank holiday weekend, they drank on Saturday and Sunday. The general trend among the younger age group &ndash; this is not a generalisation because it is evident from talking to parents &ndash; is that there is a drinking indulgence which is expressed in jargon like, &ldquo;to go flat out for the weekend&rdquo;. On Saturday when I asked one young man whether he was going out on Sunday again, he said, in jest, &ldquo;I am going to go at it tomorrow like a day's work.&rdquo; I found that remark quite funny but humour apart, he was honest about his drinking. He was going to get his burger and chips at 4 a.m., have a good rest and be up and at it again at 11 a.m. or 12 noon the next day. I, therefore, agree with the part of the motion which <Col N="1284" />relates to advertising. Whatever we can do we must do. As legislators, we have to try everything to tackle the drinking crisis because comments such as these are the language used in peer groups of young men. It is probably not dissimilar in groups of young women but I am reflecting what a young male in his early 20s said to me.</P>
    <P>The social trend has to be examined. We have to look at it in a very critical light and be proactive. We have to be creative in our thinking and while it may sound contradictory, if imposing regulations is creative thinking, let us do it. Let us be self-righteous about it. My party colleague, Deputy Deasy, has taken a lot of criticism but he has done his homework and researched the issue as it affects young men, in respect of whom there is a trend, an association between suicide and drink. If necessary, as legislators, we will have to make hard decisions. I am in total agreement with the motion.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we have to look at the issue in a holistic way. Every time I mention mental health I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who has been proactive in his movements. Many young men are coming into the psychiatric unit at the hospital in Letterkenny and the language being used is that they are cracking up or depressed but much of the problem relates to drink. The onus is on us, as legislators. We have a massive task ahead of us. A cultural change is required. I am fully behind the Labour Party in relation to the motion. It marks a start on the mountain we have to climb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State once again. I suppose it is unusual to be delighted to speak to the motion and the amendment. I am smiling because when I saw Senator McCarthy come in, I was going to quote what he said on the Order of Business on 18 April but I will not embarass him. I am too fond of him to do so. I will leave it for another day.</P>
      <P>Other speakers have talked about three groups which communicated with us over the Easter recess: the Irish Cancer Society, ASH and the Irish Heart Foundation. For the first time ever I have seen forceful communication from each of them asking us to support the Minister for Health and Children in the proposed legislation to ban smoking in public places. If all three are writing to us, there must be something terribly wrong. This is the most important health initiative to come our way in a long time. As one of the groups pointed out, we, as legislators, have a responsibility to legislate and to do so in the right way on this issue, on which we should be leading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 70% of the population do not smoke. I heard my colleague Senator Bohan say that 70% of bar workers smoke, but surely the 30% of them who do not smoke have a right to clean air. I do not feel that is too much to ask for that 30% of non-smokers. I have no difficulty with a per<Col N="1285" />son's right to smoke, but I have a huge difficulty with the fact that so many non-smokers are harmed by passive smoking. There is well-established evidence regarding the very harmful effects of passive smoking on non-smokers. Passive smoking is the single biggest indoor air pollutant to which workers are exposed in the workplace.</P>
    <P>I was really touched by the ASH letter from Dr. Fenton Howell which said that 7,000 of our citizens die annually from smoking-related diseases. This is a scandal. If the same figure applied to our roads, building sites or waterways, we would search high and low for effective solutions. At the bottom of the ASH notepaper, in red print, it was stated that smoking kills six times more people in Ireland each year than road accidents, work accidents, drugs, murder, suicides and AIDS combined.</P>
    <P>With regard to road accidents in the last few months, we have all slowed down in our driving because the points system has been introduced. It is being enforced and accepted. I do not think there will be any great difficulty in imposing a system that will save so many more lives.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read an article entitled, &ldquo;What is passive smoking?&rdquo; It gave the breakdown of the cocktail of drugs that one gets from smoking a cigarette and from passive smoking. I cannot tell what passive smoking really involves because I got depressed and very scared for myself as I started to read the article.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let that go. I know what Senator McHugh was alluding to. He and I often meet in an establishment on Baggot Street and we come out with sore eyes, runny noses, itchy throats and coughs, and we complain about these in this House the following day. They are some of the effects that we notice while we are in that environment, but what about the effects that are causing the cancer, the chest problems, the heart disease and the strokes? They are building up, and we do not realise they are happening to us until it is far too late. It was put to me that when the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, introduced the levy on plastic bags, people were outraged and said it would never work. The introduction of the levy is history today. Who do we ever see carrying a plastic bag? None of us wants to have anything to do with plastic. If we introduce a smoking ban, it will be accepted in this way.</P>
      <P>When we fly to the other side of the world and find ourselves on a plane for more than 15 hours, no one is smoking on those planes. We have to get on with it. Nobody would wish smoking to be allowed on planes ever again, not alone because of the harmful health effects involved, but for other obvious reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Minister for State and the Government in this legislation. We should use the <Col N="1286" />run-in time to educate society about the positive effects that the legislation will have and to reach out to smokers. I really feel for them. I have brothers in the pub trade, and they are roaring at me and eating my ears off, asking me to do something about this legislation. I say no, that I agree with the legislation, and the sooner it is implemented the better.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention the terrible effects of alcohol, especially on our younger population. As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I have listened to consultants from the accident and emergency units around our country, and particularly Dublin city. I have also listened to the vintners' representatives. It is outrageous that we have so many under age as well as over age young people drinking and causing the social havoc they do every weekend on our streets. It is true, as Senator McHugh pointed out, that they abstain from drink for five nights of the week, and then go on binges at weekends. It is scary. The most horrifying statistic to come from the Rotunda Hospital relating to girls who were raped is the fact that rohypnol was not found in the toxicology. Alcohol is probably the rape drug of today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister or State to the House. Like Senator Feeney, I could really support both the motion and the amendment. It is a pity the Government felt it had to put down an amendment, because we all realise we have a very serious problem with both alcohol and tobacco. It is not just our problem but a problem in many countries, and it is important that we look at the international aspect and the all-island aspect. Like Senator Feeney again, I am on the Joint Committee on Health and Children, and we had the good fortune to have very useful inputs regarding alcohol and tobacco from people in the Department of Health and Children, the consultants from the hospital casualty departments and representatives from the sexual assault treatment unit in the Rotunda, which Senator Feeney talked about. They all came before us with very useful contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Order of Business today, I went to the Dáil to listen to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, taking questions and abuse, as it could be called, regarding the current state of the health services, which definitely face problems. I was sad to see that only his Ministers of State were there to support him. There were no other members of the Government present, nor indeed were there any backbenchers while I was there. The man deserves support because he has a very difficult portfolio, and it has not been made any better by the serious problems associated with the use of tobacco and the misuse of alcohol. Suppose the Minister had stood up today and said he intended to save 20% in casualty departments by saying that anyone who arrived <Col N="1287" />there drunk would be slung out, and similarly anyone who arrived with tobacco-related diseases. Let us remember the way the grasshopper and the ant spoke to each other. The grasshopper danced all summer, and when he had no food in the winter, the ant said: &ldquo;You danced in the summer, now sing.&rdquo; The Minister could try saying something like that to those with tobacco-related diseases, because they are costing us a fortune.</P>
    <P>While there has been some decrease in the use of tobacco, we have to look very seriously at tobacco advertising. Senator McHugh talked about young men and drink, and I would like to talk about advertising and young women. We had a very good presentation from the Department of Health and Children officials, Mr. Eamon Corcoran, Ms McEvoy and Mr. Ó Dufaigh regarding the new directive from the European Union on tobacco advertising, which is to come in within a couple of months.</P>
    <P>As we know, the previous directive was brought down by the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it covered forms of advertising which had no trans-national implications and therefore exceeded its legal basis under Article 95 of the European Union Treaty. The present directive is being brought forward to take account of the Court's decision, and it is narrower in scope, but it is hoped that it strikes a balance between complying with internal market rules and the need for a high level of public health protection. On a national basis we can be even more determined than the directive is.</P>
    <P>I very much support what the Minister for Health and Children intends doing about banning tobacco in public places. I have been to Ottawa and Halifax, and the pubs there are still open and doing very good business as far as I could see, despite the fact that tobacco had been banned there only a few months previously. People who were working in these establishments told me that it was a godsend to them. They said the bar trade decreased for a while but that the table trade had increased. They said there had not been a decline in their fortunes and I would expect the same to happen here.</P>
    <P>Despite what Senator McCarthy said, New York has not fallen apart since the ban was introduced. The Minister of State has not heard Senator McCarthy's concerns about the introduction of this ban, which I am sure he will allude to when he speaks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It shook us when we thought of what might happen in pubs here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officials of the Department of Health and Children raised the matter of indirect advertising and this worried me. The new directive does not deal with indirect advertising, namely, the use of tobacco brand names and logos on non-tobacco products. They expanded on this by saying that <Col N="1288" />more countries were going to impose partial and total bans on indirect tobacco advertising as the industry had been found to be adept at finding creative new ways to publicise brands, particularly among young people. This is known as &ldquo;brand stretching&rdquo;. The tobacco industry, like the drinks industry, invests heavily in this. Logos are put on clothes, boots, travel bags, fashion accessories, coffee, alcohol, etc., and these are then heavily marketed. This maintains brand recognition without appearing to advertise the products.</P>
    <P>I wondered if this happened much. When exiting the gates of Leinster House on the day in question, I met one man wearing a T-shirt with the brand &ldquo;Camel&rdquo; on it and a young woman wearing a T-shirt that had &ldquo;Campbell's Grouse Whisky&rdquo; written across her bosom. These are not things I would associate with wearing T-shirts and I was quite surprised to see them. They obviously exist, however, and until they are pointed out, one may not notice them.</P>
    <P>I strongly feel that the advertising of both alcohol and tobacco is directed at young women. I say this because I have seen advertisements for alcohol in places that only women frequent. For example, in the women's lavatories in the arts block in Trinity College, there is an advertisement for a pub on the door announcing a special offer of three vodkas for &euro;10. While Senator Bohan will probably tell me that this is quite expensive, I am not currently in the vodka buying business and it seems to be quite a good deal. That was definitely encouraging binge drinking or, as Dr. Anne Hope from the alcohol unit of the Department describes it, &ldquo;crash drinking&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Members saw the three young women in Belfast &ndash; I have no reason to think things would be different in Dublin &ndash; on television some nights ago being asked about how much they would drink on a regular night out. One said she drank three cocktails, one shot and five vodkas, another drank three cocktails, two shots and six vodkas and the final one drank something similar. That is an incredible amount of drink for girls of 19 and 20. At the end of the interview, all the drinks were lined up on a table and an expert on alcohol problems was asked for his opinion on it. He said it would have been more than enough to drink in a week. These young women did not consider this to be an enormous amount to drink on a night out.</P>
    <P>This crash drinking is the kind of thing Dr. Anne Hope told us about. Young people drink not to enjoy themselves, rather to get drunk in the same way as taking drugs. I support what Senator Feeney said about the reports of rohypnol being put in people's drinks &ndash; alcohol, not rohypnol, is the rape drug.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned the directive adopted by the Council of Ministers late last year. I had the honour of <Col N="1289" />representing Ireland at the meeting where the directive was adopted. As the Senator pointed out, it does not apply to indirect advertising, it only contains a ban on direct advertising. In my discussions with Ministers from other member states, I discovered that Ireland was far ahead in the progress it has made on restricting advertising of tobacco products. There was considerable resistance from the Federal German Republic to the adoption of any directive and the British Government also refused to support the directive. The qualified majority voting procedures had to be invoked to carry the directive through at the meeting. The Irish vote was decisive, given that Ireland was the final country called to speak before the objecting states.</P>
      <P>Our reservations on the directive related to the matter raised by Senator Henry about whether it would restrict our competence to deal with this by proscribing an EU minimum that would somehow become a maximum. I stated the Government's position that Ireland wants to retain national power in this matter so that we could take further measures, such as those being discussed here, to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the motion tabled by Senators Ryan and O'Meara, I am not sure that there is a great difference in the substance between it and that tabled by the Government. The Government was anxious that its position be set out with clarity. Our motion clearly reflects the Government's position. When Senators hear me outline this position, they will understand the precise reasons for the wording of the Government motion.</P>
      <P>The adverse impact of tobacco consumption has been canvassed in this debate. I repeat the core issue: tobacco smoke can kill and cause illness &ndash; including lung cancer and other forms of cancer, heart disease, strokes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and other respiratory diseases &ndash; in many ways. Over 7,000 deaths in Ireland each year are attributable to tobacco-related illness. Smoking tobacco products is a singularly unhealthy act. Inhalation of second-hand tobacco smoke by non-smokers, commonly referred to as passive smoking, also poses a substantial health risk. There is an international scientific consensus that second-hand smoke can kill and cause disease. One does not have to be a smoker to acquire cancer caused by cigarette smoker.</P>
      <P>This addresses an issue raised by Senator Ryan. He said that while, as a libertarian, he could not instinctively agree with prohibitions on tobacco, that we must have it. This is not a libertarian issue. If one's conduct harms others, legislators are entitled to restrict such conduct. The issue of passive smoking is important in this debate. We are not simply restricting the liberty of the individual; we are restricting the liberty of the individual in order to protect others. Classical liberal theorists from John Stewart Mill onward have always realised that society is entitled to restrict liberty to protect others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" />Senators should not underestimate the huge battle we will have with public opinion on this issue and Senator Bohan adverted to this. From visits I have made to schools, there is no doubt that there is huge public resistance to the idea of a smoking ban. In visiting schools in my constituency, I was concerned to see the depth of opposition, particularly from younger females, to the idea of a total ban on cigarette smoking at licensed premises. There will be a huge battle to win public opinion. Successive Governments have conducted this battle and we are proposing to carry it a stage further in putting the ban in place.</P>
    <P>Senators should be aware that the primary legislation is on the Statute Book in the form of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002. The ban announced by the Minister is intended to come into force on 1 January 2004 and can proceed by way of ministerial regulations. These will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The practical concerns of those that will have to administer the law can be looked at and examined by the Minister, but the wider cultural issue is very important. We have to convince public opinion that this is essential for all the good reasons outlined by Senators in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>On 30 January 2003, at the launch of the report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke in the workplace, the Minister for Health and Children announced that a prohibition on smoking in all places of work, including licensed premises, would be introduced from 1 January 2004. The primary purpose of the prohibition is to protect the health and safety of workers and the public from toxic environmental tobacco smoke. Draft regulations were published which have been notified to the European Commission in accordance with the transparency directive. The ban will mean a massive cultural change right around the country. The period allowed before its full introduction will give people the time needed to adjust and change.</P>
    <P>There is widespread public support for this measure. Many do not smoke and many who do regret starting and want to quit. Many are trying. The primary reasons for quitting are health concerns. Smoking bans, with other measures, are an encouragement and support to smokers trying to break their addiction. I was delighted to hear Senator Glynn mention parental responsibility. We speak of so many measures that we have to adopt as a State in many areas where there are social problems, yet in this area, as in the areas of alcohol and juvenile offending, the role of parents is also fundamental. The example and direction parents give are very important.</P>
    <P>Since his announcement the Minister for Health and Children has carried out a consultation process with interested parties regarding implementation. There has been a positive response to the measure from a wide range of groups, including the trade unions and the hotel and restaurant industry. In addition to the health <Col N="1291" />benefits, there are other advantages from workplace smoking bans, including less absenteeism from smoking related illnesses, reduced fire hazards and reductions in maintenance and decoration costs.</P>
    <P>The Office of Tobacco Control which the Minister for Health and Children set up to oversee implementation of the national tobacco control programme is consulting representatives of the hospitality industry, the trade unions and the enforcement agencies. It is working to develop a code of practice for the hospitality sector to assist with the introduction of the new measure.</P>
    <P>The ban on smoking in the workplace is one of a number of measures being taken in the area of tobacco control. A number of other positive steps to reduce tobacco consumption have already been taken. The age limit for sale of cigarettes to persons has been raised from 16 to 18 years. Advertising of tobacco products in newspapers and magazines has been ended. Sponsorship of events by the tobacco industry has also been ended. Nicotine replacement therapy was made available to all medical card holders who smoke. The national break the habit campaign was developed in partnership with the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards. Additional smoking cessation officers have been recruited by health boards and there have been sustained media advertising campaigns directed at preventing young people, especially younger women, from taking up smoking.</P>
    <P>Recent figures published as part of the SLAN national health and lifestyle surveys show a significant drop in smoking prevalence in the population from 31% in 1998 to 27% in 2002. This figure represents about 100,000 fewer smokers. The measures taken have contributed to this welcome reduction in smoking prevalence. I am confident that the ban on workplace smoking will contribute further to reductions in smoking.</P>
    <P>Tobacco is a significant burden on individuals, families and society through death, illness and medical costs. In Ireland the State assumes most of the costs of health care. Measures such as workplace bans on smoking are vital if we are to continue to reduce this burden. Even a modest reduction in the huge burden of disease caused by tobacco consumption would result in significant health gains.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children has made the threat to public health from tobacco one of his priorities. The Government's tobacco free initiative will continue to include strong legislative measures which are important public health instruments in tackling tobacco consumption. I salute also the work done by many voluntary organisations in this area. Senator Feeney highlighted many of the contributions they have made to raising the issue and putting it high in the public consciousness.</P>

      <Col N="1292" />The Minister for Health and Children has also expressed his concerns about the misuse of alcohol on many occasions. It is an issue which continues to impact on the lives of many. It is an issue which the Minister and I, with the Department of Health and Children, are committed to tackling.</P>
    <P>In the last decade Ireland has had the highest increase in alcohol consumption among European Union countries. Between 1989 and 2001 alcohol consumption <i>per capita</i> in Ireland increased by 49% while ten European Union member states showed a decrease and three others showed a modest increase during the same period. In 2001 Ireland ranked second highest after Luxembourg for alcohol consumption with a rate of 11.4 litres of pure alcohol <i>per capita.</i> The EU average is approximately 9.1 litres<i> per capita.</i>While the quantity of alcohol consumed is of concern, so too is the pattern of consumption. Drinking patterns have been influenced by changing lifestyles and expectations, more disposable income and a strong focus on consumerism. This has ensured a dynamic relationship between the marketplace and the consumer. Young adults between 18 and 25 years of age are more likely to engage in binge drinking but drink less frequently than older age groups. The pattern of drinking is also significant in that acute problems such as trips and falls, alcohol poisoning, incidents of unintentional sexual behaviour, public order offences tend to occur when individuals drink to excess on a single occasion.</P>
    <P>The adverse effects of alcohol extend beyond physical health issues to mental, social and financial problems. There is a continuum of problems which can affect everyone across the community. These problems range from a once off problem such as falls, accidents, fights, unprotected sex and violence, to a recurring problem such as poor school work performance, financial hardship, difficulties in relationships, chronic illness such as cancer, liver damage and a sustained dependence on alcohol. Some of these problems, especially those which can be described as acute, arise where the light or moderate drinker drinks to excess on a single drinking occasion, while others result from regular heavy drinking over a longer period. Therefore, drinking patterns can have an important influence on the level and extent of alcohol related harm in young people and across the whole population.</P>
    <P>The national alcohol policy was published in 1996 with the overall aim of reducing the level of alcohol related problems and promoting moderation for those who wished to drink. Since the publication of the policy, several important initiatives have taken place, utilising the health promotion settings approach such as schools, informal youth sector and colleges. New research, training programmes and greater enforcement of regulations have been implemented.</P>
    <P>An important development has been the estab<Col N="1293" />lishment of a strategic task force on alcohol which published a report in May 2002 which recommended measures in six key areas for immediate action. The main thrust was to protect health and enhance public safety as well as creating an environment that helped persons make healthy choices. A memorandum relating to the recommendations of the task force has been discussed and agreed by Government. The interdepartmental group has now been established to progress the recommendations and co-ordinate responses to them. There was no disagreement on policy between different members of the Government on this question. As Minister of State with responsibility for children, I arranged a meeting with the relevant Ministers and there was a consensus of opinion in the Government in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the task force concerns limiting the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol marketing. This includes limiting where alcohol advertisements can be placed and regulating their content to ensure they do not appeal to children. Officials from the Department of Health and Children have begun preliminary work on legislation in relation to this recommendation and the heads of a Bill should be available shortly. The primary aims of this measure will be to protect children and reduce the pressure on adolescents to drink. Other initiatives of the health promotion unit aimed at tackling alcohol misuse have involved the college setting, the informal youth setting, schools and the drinks trade.</P>
    <P>In response to a growing concern about alcohol promotion practices on campus, high risk drinking among students and its impact on student academic performance and student attrition, the health promotion unit produced a document entitled, A Framework for the Development of a College Alcohol Policy, which has been prepared in association with the heads of the colleges and the Union of Students in Ireland. The framework provides guidelines for a comprehensive approach which include measures on controlling promotion, sponsorship and marketing. The aim of the guidelines is to limit harm in the drinking environment, increase awareness and education, encourage alternatives and choices and provide campus support services. Each third level institution can adopt the guidelines to reflect the needs and aspirations of its campus environment.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Council of Ireland, with support from the health promotion unit, initiated a national project which provided opportunities for young people between 14 and 16 years of age to explore their relationship with alcohol. The process culminated in the development of resource materials for youth leaders working with young persons in the non-formal sector. The project, Its your Choice, illustrates creative ways of working with young people on alcohol awareness using arts and media based techniques. Training <Col N="1294" />is provided for youth leaders to ensure the implementation of this initiative.</P>
    <P>The settings approach, as outlined in the health promotion strategy, means combining healthy policies in a healthy environment with complementary education programmes and initiatives. The development of the national curriculum in health education &ndash; social, personal and health education &ndash; the promotion of policies on alcohol and drugs, the greater involvement of parents and communities under the health promoting school concept ensure a comprehensive and effective long-term approach in education. Training and resource development continue to be integral parts of policy. The Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science and the regional health boards are key players in these initiatives. By September 2003, all schools must make provision for this social, personal and health initiative on the school curriculum.</P>
    <P>The responsible serving of alcohol &ndash; RSA &ndash; programme is a training initiative which was developed specifically for those who work in the bar trade and hospitality sector. It was devised and developed by the health promotion unit in partnership with the drinks industry group, vintners associations and CERT. The aim of the programme is to limit harm in the drinking environment by not serving to intoxicated customers, encouraging the use of age cards to prevent under age people from being served and promoting alternative strategies to reduce drink driving.</P>
    <P>The health promotion unit is also currently running an alcohol awareness campaign entitled Think Before You Drink &ndash; Less is More. The initial aim of the campaign was to raise awareness of alcohol-related issues and problems as a public health issue, highlight results of research findings which demonstrated the scale of the problem and raise these issues for public debate. The first phase of the campaign emphasised that alcohol involved choices for the individual and that there were benefits in not depending on alcohol for a good time. Phase two of the campaign targeted those who buy, supply or sell alcohol to under age drinkers. It consisted of radio advertisements and posters which were displayed in approximately 12,000 pubs, off-licences and retail outlets where alcohol is sold. The emphasis was that everyone should play their part by not making alcohol accessible to young people.</P>
    <P>Another initiative involved the printing of sensible drinking advice on airline ticket wallets which were circulated by the health promotion unit to holidaymakers via travel agents. These coincided with the summer holiday season and examination results and reinforced the message of having a great time, rather than being too out of it to really experience the moment. The latest phase of the campaign specifically targets the 18-29 year old binge drinker in the settings of colleges, communities and the workplace. A national advertising campaign on television and radio <Col N="1295" />highlights the concept of excess. The health promotion unit has also developed information materials to help spread the key messages of the campaign.</P>
    <P>As C. Northcote Parkinson famously said, &ldquo;Propaganda begins and ends at home.&rdquo; I pay tribute to the work of the media in raising awareness of this issue in recent months.</P>

      <P>In particular, the programme shown by the national broadcaster before Christmas did much to raise awareness of the extent and scale of this problem. A vigilant public press and commentary in the broadcast media can do far more than tonnes of propaganda in this area. In saying this, I do not decry the valuable work done in the health promotion unit. It is important work and it is important that these programmes are established and their messages targeted at particular individuals. However, in the type of communications world in which we live, it is tremendous to see that journalists, commentators and broadcasters are playing their part in highlighting the problem.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit has commissioned a number of research projects on alcohol related matters. These include research in accident and emergency departments, research into the impact of alcohol advertising on teenagers, public attitudes to policy change and alcohol research in the general practitioner setting.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Liquor Licensing has recommended in its final report that enforcement powers under the licensing laws be extended to include non-uniformed members of the Garda. At present, it appears that the activities of non-uniformed offers are confined to drugs related offences. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has welcomed the commission's recommendation and is prepared to act on it in future intoxicating liquor legislation.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the temporary closure of licensed premises is that this penalty is currently applied to premises convicted of under age drinking offences. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has announced that the licensing laws will be amended to provide that this penalty will also apply to convictions for allowing drunkenness or disorderly conduct on licensed premises, or supplying alcohol to a drunken person. Future legislation will also prohibit promotional practices that are likely to result in excessive consumption of alcohol and it is intended that the temporary closure penalty will also apply to convictions in this area.</P>
      <P>While the barriers to reducing tobacco and alcohol-related harm are significant, the measures I have outlined this evening will make significant inroads in tackling these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and thank him for his contribution.</P>
      <P>On 16 April last I informed the House about an incident in a New York nightclub where a patron who was asked by a bouncer to extinguish his cigarette was stabbed and subsequently died after six or seven hours in hospital. I conditioned my comments on the Order of Business that day by saying that I supported and endorsed what the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is attempting to do in introducing a ban on smoking.</P>
      <P>I am a smoker and I recognise the dangers associated with the habit. The implementation of this ban will be cumbersome and troublesome and will lead to massive opposition in some quarters, but I believe such opposition is not merited. As legislators, we are trusted to make decisions which are difficult and may hurt some people. There are those will be hurt more than others and some will be hurt in their pockets. Nevertheless, I hope the ban will be introduced and given widescale support.</P>
      <P>There is much evidence to show that the level of alcohol consumption is related to the harm being visited on young people. The problem is growing. The level of violence associated with alcohol consumption is there for all to see. Seldom does a weekend go by when we do not hear about an innocent person being set upon by a drunken thug. This has led to situations such as that which arose in Cork last year when an innocent person was beaten by a mindless, drunken lout. That is the result of the abuse of alcohol. The recent incident in Grafton Street is another illustration of how far this problem has gone.</P>
      <P>Of course, it is a sad indictment of our society that young people who are drinking more than moderate levels have had very good teachers. Much needs to be done by older and more mature adults so that young people can follow good example.</P>
      <P>There is evidence to suggest that the long-term health of young people is associated with their level of alcohol consumption. This worrying trend is, unfortunately, a facet of our society. Another recent trend is that while young males drink more than young females, the gender gap is narrowing and some experts tell us that girls are starting to drink at a younger age than boys and are drinking more than them. Senator Henry referred to the worrying phenomenon of drug rape. Regarding rohypnol as the sole cause of date rape may be a blinkered approach. Excessive use of alcohol may be the worst form of drug rape.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was heartened recently by the decision of some people in the GAA to review the association's contract with Guinness, which sponsors the hurling championship. The GAA is locked into a ten year agreement by which Guinness sponsors this competition. While it is not suggested that the GAA will pull out of the deal it <Col N="1297" />will review it when the contract comes to an end in two years' time. That is a welcome development. Leadership is required from all of us, but particularly from the large sporting organisations. I am convinced that much of their sponsorship revenue could be accrued from other sources. Sponsorship from drinks companies casts sports associations in a light which is not helpful in curbing the amount of under age drinking. Massive amounts of money have been spent on attempting to glamorise alcohol. They are trying to make their product look sexy and glamorous and, therefore, appeal to a young audience.</P>
    <P>The advent of alcopops makes the transition from soft drinks to alcoholic drinks that bit easier, which is dangerous. I was in a pub recently and noticed a girl going to the crowded bar, where people knew they would have to queue for drinks, and ordering a quadruple vodka with a Red Bull. She drank that not in the time it would take the average person to drink a spirit and a mixer but as quickly as it took her friends to drink a pint. That is worrying because it could lead to dangerous scenarios. Red Bull advertisements on the national broadcaster state, &ldquo;It gives you wings.&rdquo; They make this product look like something that makes the consumer feels better but we know the reality of the situation.</P>
    <P>Guidelines were recently launched on the management of alcohol related problems in hospitals that advised doctors admitting patients to take a detailed history of the patient's alcohol consumption over the previous month and to follow up with information on where he or she could get help for the addiction. They are also advised to refer the patient to psychiatric services and alcohol counselling. Doctors are worried that they could be swamped by this but we need professional organisations to offer help and support to those addicted to alcohol. We all know about the good work done in private treatment centres but there is not the same level of success in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Professor David Schaffer, head of child and adolescent psychiatry at Columbia University, New York, recently spoke at a conference in the Mater Hospital. He said that raising the age at which alcohol could be bought in the United States from 18 to 21 years had a significant effect on suicide rates among adolescents, with a 12% decrease in the number of young males committing suicide.</P>
    <P>This whole complex area jumps off the screens at us week after week. I urge the Minister for Health and Children to put in place tougher guidelines that would monitor and restrict advertising that promotes alcohol in a way that makes it look glamorous to young people. I also call on the Minister to look at a ban on the promotion of major sports events by alcohol companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him and his colleague, the Minister <Col N="1298" />for Health and Children, on the huge strides that have been made in both alcohol and tobacco consumption.</P>
      <P>Alcohol itself is not a problem &ndash; as a nation, we enjoy a drink &ndash; but irresponsible and abusive consumption is. We have examined alcohol related problems and carried out myriad studies of the topic. A recent European study contained the shocking estimate that alcohol abuse cost Irish society &euro;2.4 billion per year.</P>
      <P>Senator McCarthy mentioned alcohol advertising and young people. There are huge pressures on teenagers today because of advertising. Changes have been made in the tobacco industry and the same should be done in the alcohol industry; there is already discussion of sponsorship of rugby and GAA games and a raging debate in Formula One motor racing about the advertising of tobacco products on cars &ndash; some countries allow it while others do not but the sport still continues in those countries where it is prohibited.</P>
      <P>Personal choice is an issue. Consumption of alcohol and tobacco are personal choices. Certain sections of society, however, have a huge part to play in this area, particularly general practitioners. I welcome the Minister's announcement that the Irish College of General Practitioners is involved in the development of alcohol awareness projects which will prove effective in treating some of the consequences of alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>Schools and teachers have a role to play. The SPHE programme will be in place in schools by September and is a major step forward. Senator Glynn referred to parental responsibility. It is up to us to set an example. Under age drinking is not a new phenomenon, it has been with us for a long time but young people now have much greater access to alcohol. The rise in consumption is directly linked to the rise in disposable income. Young people like to experiment, a further element in the equation. Patterns can be identified at an early age. This is where education can target young people. Colleges and secondary schools have done a great deal but primary schools should be included. Young people are aware of alcohol at 11 or 12 years of age. They see it on the street, on television and hear it on the radio and should be educated about it.</P>
      <P>There is a direct link between the abuse of alcohol and the suicide rate. Other problems include unwanted pregnancies and injuries to the person arising from the abuse of alcohol, of which people must be made aware.</P>
      <P>As a smoker, I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children for his efforts to reduce tobacco consumption. I have no problem with the suggested ban on smoking in pubs. I remember when smoking was banned on aeroplanes, a friend told me he would die on the seven hour journey to New York without a cigarette but he made it &ndash; it is that simple, it is a personal choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made huge strides in health and safety at work. This is a related issue <Col N="1299" />that can be tackled effectively. I congratulate the Minister for the progress that has already been made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>It is significant that this debate is taking place. Recently there have been more debates in the Oireachtas and the media about alcohol abuse. It is strange that this problem has been with us for so long but it took RTE's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme to expose anti-social behaviour throughout the State as a result of alcohol abuse by young people. When parents saw young females being brought to emergency rooms in hospitals stoned out of their minds, some of whom were close to death because of alcohol consumption, they sat up and realised that it was time to focus on this serious problem and do something about it.</P>
      <P>The good thing is that the media have responded well. They have responded positively in editorials and feature articles and on follow-up programmes to &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo;. This indicates a change to the blind eye culture which hitherto existed. It was not long ago that film stars used cigarettes or pipes as a prop to their acting. They became role models and people copied them, but there was a culture change in this area. It is important that this should have happened, although with alcohol the opposite is happening. Most of the television soap stories, such as those on &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; or &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; are situated in pubs. Constant viewers tend to internalise these images and subconsciously emulate them.</P>
      <P>A partnership approach is required. The emphasis on legislation is vital because legislators have the right and the responsibility to protect others. If there was any other dangerous activity we would have to intervene. Why should smoking or alcohol abuse be any different? Regardless of how much legislation is enacted, however, unless we can create a partnership across society to address this problem we will not make a breakthrough. This is apparent in what the Minster and others have said.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned that, like everything else, the effects of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme will fade as something else takes centre stage. If we strike now while the iron is hot, when concern is evident and when people are focused on wanting to do something, we can create a partnership that will bring about results. It is not a matter of engaging in ceremonial debate in the Seanad every couple of months. We must tackle the problem at a much deeper level.</P>
      <P>This is not a question of being anti-liberal or preventing people from having choices. We owe it to the young generation to allow them to be young and to have the opportunities we had. Debates such as this are taking place because of public demand and the public will be grateful to any Government that responds to the concerns that have been expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a non-smoker. I have never enjoyed smoking and could be categorised as an anti-smoker. However, even I realise that smokers have rights. My concern with the proposed smoking ban centres on the question of enforcement. The penalty points system was introduced before Christmas and is encountering problems with regard to enforcement.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister outline how the proposed smoking ban will be enforced? Like many other Senators, perhaps, I worked in a pub when I was a student and I am sure they will share my concerns. I am particularly concerned with what will happen in super-pubs, where there could be a few hundred customers and many of them could be unknown to the management. Theory is all very well, but reality is a different matter.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the use of sweeping generalisations and the categorisation of smoking as an unhealthy act. There are many other unhealthy acts. For example, it could be argued, perhaps incorrectly, that engaging in politics is unhealthy. I was surprised to learn that MANDATE, which is in favour of the smoking ban in pubs, represents only a tiny percentage of the number of workers involved in pubs.</P>
      <P>I have discussed the proposed ban with many people, including those working in pubs, smokers and anti-smokers. One person made a valid point by highlighting the fact that if there was a need for non-smoking pubs, they would surely already be in existence. In the past, non-smoking pubs have failed miserably because the public did not frequent them. That is not to say that they will not work on this occasion, but I am concerned about how the ban will be imposed.</P>
      <P>I question the idea of segregation. In some pubs it would be physically possible to have a separate lounge or bar which would allow for smoking in one area. However, this would not be possible in open-plan pubs. The Minister of State is to be commended for acknowledging that it would be a farce to allow for smoking and non-smoking areas without some kind of barrier. However, this approach could be considered in certain types of pub.</P>
      <P>The question of ventilation must also be reconsidered. I have been informed today that a new ventilation system can completely re-circulate air in a pub in less than three minutes. That option should considered. I am posing questions rather than solutions and I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</P>
      <P>How will the new regulations be implemented from 1 January 2004? Will it be similar to the changeover to the euro, where both currencies could be used side by side for an initial period? Is the 1 January a suitable date for implementation? Will those who smoke on 31 December be expected to stop at midnight?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the imposition of the ban mean that smokers will drink more? Many of my friends who gave up smoking drank more. This might create <Col N="1301" />an even bigger alcohol problem. Perhaps Senator Brady can answer that concern.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that the adverse impact of tobacco consumption on human health, globally and locally, is well documented. My grandmother died from lung cancer although she never smoked and I know of a lady in Carlow who was a heavy smoker but who lived to be 99 years of age. It has been suggested that smokers will be subjected to increased stress levels when they will be unable to smoke a cigarette with their drink. I do not believe this will happen because, if anything, smoking enhances stress.</P>
    <P>Cigarette vending machines in pubs will be badly affected by the smoking ban. Will pubs be allowed to sell cigarettes, and, if so, is it not farcical to have something for sale in pubs that cannot be used there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Cigarette vending machines in pubs could become redundant, which is a cause of concern to those who have invested heavily in them. The Irish Taxi Drivers Federation made a recent submission regarding the hardship imposed on its members following deregulation. Similar hardship could be imposed on those involved in the supply of cigarette vending machines. The Minister of State should consider this aspect.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the consequences in terms of lost revenue from the fall in cigarette sales? While it is agreed that cigarettes are bad for us, I am sure the Minister for Finance welcomes the revenue generated. That will be reduced because of the smoking ban in pubs.</P>
      <P>Some workers involved in pubs have expressed serious concern about the proposed supervision process. If the owner of a pub is not present when a premises is raided, it is possible the staff on duty will be fined personally. That would leave many bar staff severely out of pocket as they do not earn much money in some cases. The benefit of the smoking ban will be clear in 20 or 30 years in terms of health savings. While I welcome the ban as an ordinary consumer, I have posed to the Minister of State questions which have been posed to me. I would appreciate clarification by him of the issues for all concerned.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Labour Party motion. It is useful to have a pre-legislative <Col N="1302" />debate on matters such as this as the introduction of measures sometimes has undesirable effects. The extension of licensing hours has, for example, led to many public order problems. At the same time we must avoid showing too much puritanical zeal as there is a balance to be struck between the freedom to do things and freedom from harmful activities.</P>
      <P>There has been much progress, which I welcome, in the 20 years since the first tobacco control legislation was introduced by Charles Haughey. The second Act was introduced by Barry Desmond in 1985 and other measures have been enacted since. I agree with Senator O'Meara that a crowded, smoky pub is a deterrent to many and it is not necessarily the case that the bar trade will suffer. Equally, the ideas brought forward by Senator Bohan and a Deputy from my constituency may be valid. If there is a means of providing segregated and confined areas for smokers, I will defend the right of people to bring that idea forward and have it considered and debated. It may be that it would not work, however. I have written to the Minister. Smoking is banned on buses and aircraft and there is a strong case to be made for banning it on trains. A train is a very confined space and if one sits in a smoking carriage due to the unavailability of a seat elsewhere, one will emerge reeking of smoke.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State omitted that in the armoury of Government is the ability to introduce regular and large tax increases. As a member of the tax strategy group, I was fully behind this. The level of alcohol consumption is a danger to health and I fear to think what problems will emerge, particularly among the younger generation, in ten or 20 years. Health education would do much if it were pursued more actively. I gather that in America pubs employ bouncers who check identity cards. There is something to be said for introducing such a measure in some of the more busy pubs here.</P>

We have seen the Government climb down in the face of pressure groups, particularly in the building trade, and I do not blame it for this. It was overwhelmed by the building lobby and, appallingly, had to pull back on the question of planning permissions. More and more of that sort of pressure is being brought to bear and is currently a major issue. The Government should be aware that it has widespread support with regard to tobacco restrictions.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister of State said he saw very little difference between the motion of the Labour Party and the Government's amendment, it is a pity he did not demonstrate a sense of solidarity by supporting the original motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is particularly good to have had a full two hour debate. I thought at one stage that we would not but it has been shown that Members take this issue very seriously.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote from the executive summary of the Health and Safety Authority on tobacco control. It concludes that environmental tobacco smoke is carcinogenic and causes lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory problems in adults. It finds that current ventilation technology is ineffective in removing the risks of environmental tobacco smoke to health. In the body of its review the HSA states that even with reductions from ventilation, exposure levels remain between 1,500 and 2,500 times what is safe. That statistic should answer people's questions about ventilation. It cannot work. When people's health is manifestly at risk, cost cannot be a concern. It is the health of those who work in pubs and those who frequent them that is of concern, which is the reason there can be no rolling back on this issue. The conclusion of the HSA and every other authority I have read is that it is impossible to create a healthy social or work environment in the presence of incessant tobacco smoking. The only arguments against this point of view come from vested interests and lobby groups and should be rejected.</P>
      <P>It is a tragedy that in four minutes there will be a division about something on which we all agree. The only objection the Government could possibly have to our motion is our request for an &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; ban on smoking in licensed premises. I would withdraw the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; from the motion with the permission of the Chair as there is a technical question in terms of the possibility of introducing a ban without further legislation. I would be happy to do so to establish consensus.</P>
      <P>I will address some of the arguments which have been made. Regarding the &ldquo;subordinate clause&rdquo;, a good lawyer like the Minister of State should see that it is not a requirement for any immediate action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourism is New York's second largest industry and surviving a ban which will in the short term give rise to a problem. Somebody said the Luxembourgers drink more than we do. They may but one will not find the scenes of appalling disorder on the streets of Luxembourg on a Saturday night that one finds here. It is our form of drinking that is becoming a problem. We will have to deal with this.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the wonderful progress made in terms of students. While there has been progress, I have an anecdote which demonstrates that we have a long way to go. There is a pub in Cork located quite close to one of the third level institutions. A friend of mine and his partner entered the pub and the man ordered a pint and his wife asked for a non-alcoholic beer. The response of the barman was to explain that as it was a student pub, nothing like that was sold there. While it does not prove anything, that is as good an anecdote as is needed to illustrate the problems we have with alcohol.</P>
      <P>I am intrigued by the fact that only in County Mayo are there significant numbers of publicans who serve people who are under age. Only in that county have there been a significant number of closures of licensed premises for selling drink to those under age. The alternative explanation that the Garda is not enforcing the law elsewhere cannot really be offered. According to the Minister's statistics, only in County Mayo has there been a significant number of pub closures. It is a very formidable and serious sanction which should be in use in all our cities and towns to make the point we need to make over and over again.</P>
      <P>I am always intrigued by the way in which we are far more inclined to be prescriptive and puritanical about alcohol than about tobacco. Tobacco has killed 250,000 people in this country in the past 50 years, which is an incredible number. We are all prepared to be really puritanical about alcohol because there is a little bit of pleasure involved, but tobacco is seen as self-torture or something similar and, therefore, less worthy of attention. Tobacco kills people to no purpose. Alcohol, used in reasonable quantities, not only does not kill people but it enhances life. This is a fundamental difference, but we are far more willing to be prescriptive about alcohol than tobacco. This fundamental issue has to be addressed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>People are entitled to smoke, but it escapes me why they should be more entitled to do so than to consume cannabis. However, that is the law of the land. People are entitled to smoke but not entitled to impose their smoke on anybody who works with them or who shares, involuntarily, any space with them. That is the fundamental issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of suggestions. People who are picked up on the street and brought to a hospital <Col N="1305" />accident and emergency unit because they are drunk should pay the full cost of the ambulance and hospital services provided to them. The money should be taken from their wages or whatever other source of income they possess. If they are students, let them pay the bill after they leave college. We have a duty to protect people from doing harm to themselves, not to pay for that protection, and, therefore, they should be required to pay.</P>
    <P>At the risk of incurring the wrath of Niall Crowley, I suggest that we reconsider the equality legislation and the age limit of 18 years. As Senator McCarthy said, there is a good case to be made for restricting alcohol to people between 18 and 21 years of age. There is a particularly good case to allow publicans to choose to have an age limit above 18. We should look at whether that is the intention of the Oireachtas when we pass the legislation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Chair to accept our motion, as amended, with the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; deleted, before we go to an unnecessary vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that I raise this issue on the Adjournment, given that, some months ago, the House debated the issue of the first-time buyer's grant, the level of house building taking place and the exorbitant prices involved. As a councillor, I was involved in the rezoning of land for housing ten years ago. These lands have now become an area of high density housing. Residents are now living in the houses built on the site but six months after moving in, they have not received the first-time buyer's grant because a certificate of floor area has not been furnished by the builder to the Department. These people have spoken to the Department and the builder concerned but both are blaming each other.</P>
      <P>I learned today that the builder is going to pay the first-time buyer's grant to these people next week and that they will give an undertaking in writing to their solicitors that they will hand over their grants to the builder when they receive them following the inspector's report and the issuing of the certificates of floor area. It is extraordinary that this type of situation should obtain. I do not know if it is happening in other areas of the country, but it is not satisfactory. I understand that in some areas of Dublin, people receive their grant within four or five weeks. These people have been living in their houses for six months.</P>
      <P>We all know how stretched are people's finances when they buy their first house and that they have made commitments to financial institutions in respect of household furnishings or as part of a loan for the house. For those reasons, I ask the Minister of State to look into this case to see if there is any irregularity in this instance. Why should it take so long for a certificate of floor area to be handed over to these first-time buyers and why are they facing such stress during their first major purchase? I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>A floor area certificate, which is required for the purpose of stamp duty exemption by the Revenue Commissioners, is issued where the floor area of a newly built house or apartment is not less than 38 sq. m. and not more than 125 sq. m. New house grant approval, where sought, can also issue where the house or apartment meets <Col N="1307" /><Col N="1308" />the conditions and standards specified by my Department and which are set out in explanatory memorandum HA1 of housing grants section. Floor area certificates are usually issued within two months of the receipt of fully documented applications. Provisional approval of a new house grant, where applicable, can also issue on satisfactory compliance with the conditions particular to the first-time purchaser's new house grant scheme.</P>
      <P>These standards require compliance with the building regulations, as well as a number of further requirements which relate primarily to design quality. In particular, where unconventional materials, products or methods of construction are used, certification by a competent body as to their suitability and compliance with the building regulations is required as is design life in the order of 60 years subject to normal maintenance for the key elements of construction, including, for example, external walling and roofing.</P>
      <P>It is policy to seek to encourage the adoption of innovative approaches to the design and construction of houses. In this context, innovation is to be welcomed subject to the achievement of sufficient standards of quality. The building regulations under the Building Control Act 1990 aim to ensure that dwellings conform to appropriate standards. It is important, in this context, that builders comply with these requirements, ultimately for the benefit of house purchasers.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectors monitor compliance with standards and design quality through assessment of house plans and on-site inspections. Where unconventional materials, products or methods of construction are encountered, the issue of a floor area certificate and approval of a grant is withheld until the necessary appropriate certification is provided. As already stated, we encourage innovation but it must meet certain standards. Some new products have certification for a shorter lifespan than we would like.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, applications for floor area certificates were received in respect of 326 dwellings. Floor area certificates have issued in respect of 274 dwellings following examination of the plans, site inspections by inspectors of my Department and extensive consultations with the builder. The time taken to issue floor area certificates in this case arose from the need for the builder to provide the necessary information to demonstrate that the construction meets the required standards.</P>
      <P>Issues regarding the certification of innovative construction methods and products remain to be resolved in respect of 52 dwellings. Discussions and correspondence with the builder are ongoing with a view to resolving these outstanding issues and further information has been requested from the builder. The issue of the remainder of the certificates outstanding will be considered on receipt of the information requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" />Prior to the termination of the new house grant scheme on 14 November last, 234 grant applications were received in my Department in respect of this development. Of these, 41 grants have been paid and provisional approval of a new house grant has issued in respect of a further 103 applications. On receipt of claims for payment, arrangements will be made to have the houses inspected and the grants paid, if in order. The grant applications in respect of the remaining 90 applications are currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>It is a process which must be undergone with these new, innovative procedures and methods which are encouraged by the Department but which need to be checked to ensure that they reach acceptable standards. In some cases, they have certifications from countries which perhaps do not include the lifespan we expect of different products used in houses here. I am not suggesting that any of the materials or designs used in the estate in question are not up to standard, but it is a process which must be gone through to ensure that the certification meets the standards. Materials can be approved by different international bodies here and abroad. A fair amount of paperwork and processing must be gone through in respect of some of these innovative products. It appears that a number of people in the estate have been paid the first-time buyer's grant and I believe that most of them will work out their difficulties.</P>

      <P>The ongoing dispute at Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, County Mayo, as well as in Galway, Limerick and Kerry, is an unmitigated disaster. It is now in its sixth week, and there is absolutely no sign of a solution or resolution. There are no talks taking place. Without meaningful dialogue, the dispute will go on and on. The consequences are horrendous and causing enormous hardship.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that, at all times of the year but particularly now, farmers need money. They cannot have it, however, as they cannot sell their cattle because the only testing taking place is for brucellosis. No testing is taking place for tuberculosis. Today a young widow whose husband died nine months ago was literally crying because she could not get suckler and other agricultural grants owing to the situation, and she is but one of many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point concerns farmers presenting <Col N="1310" />for annual tests, particularly if the results for their herds prove inconclusive. They cannot get the cards back. There are now six weeks worth of cards stacked up in Davitt House, Castlebar, as well as in Galway, Limerick and Kerry. The pile is getting bigger all the time.</P>
    <P>My third point concerns the national interest regarding cattle exports, which have been frozen. Jobbers, dealers and exporters are walking away from marts. The reason is fairly fundamental and understandable: lack of promotional opportunities. There is a huge disparity between the promotional opportunities available to those in the Department of Agriculture and Food next door to this building and those available in Castlebar, Galway, Limerick and Kerry. Within the offices there also are huge anomalies regarding such opportunities. In Castlebar, staff upstairs are on a ratio of one staff officer to seven. Downstairs it is one staff officer to 14.</P>
    <P>Essentially I am saying to the Minister that this cannot go on, for it will escalate. Now staff in Clonakilty are out with the result that the number on strike has grown from 80 to 100 to 150 to 200, and it will become nationwide. The Minister says he is available. Being available is one thing &ndash; everyone is available &ndash; but unless we have meaningful dialogue and people sit down with something to offer, the problem will not be resolved. Meanwhile the strike continues. The pickets are in place and there is total stalemate. I remind the Minister that every dispute has a resolution, and the sooner people start talking, the better for everybody involved. The more disentrenched people become, the nearer we will be to a solution. The hardship, strike and industrial action simply cannot go on. That is the reason that I ask the Minister of State to ensure meaningful dialogue takes place straight away in order that the stand-off and stalemate will end once and for all for the betterment of all involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Higgins for sharing his time with me. As we speak, 260 Department of Agriculture and Food personnel are on picket lines outside the various offices that Senator Higgins mentioned. This is unfair. The initial action of the Department was provocative in the extreme in the way in which personnel were told &ndash; by email at 4.20 p.m. &ndash; they would be taken off the payroll on 1 April 2003. It is a classic example of the provocation of personnel within the Department towards the farming community and the Department's staff. At the time of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak those who sought their entitlement to fair promotional opportunities were guaranteed, albeit verbally, that immediately that crisis, which they helped to prevent, was over, their cases would be resolved. There have been many reports since. The personnel survey of local offices was complete in June 2002, yet we are still waiting. Those concerned <Col N="1311" />have reached the end of their tether regarding commitments and undertakings from the Department. Now they have no alternative but to demand their rights. The Department's response has been to tell them that they are no longer on the payroll.</P>
      <P>In Loughrea, in the Minister of State's constituency, personnel have been on the street for the last six weeks. What has he done to resolve the situation? Is he concerned about the personnel involved and their families, for they have had no pay during that time? How does he respond to this? How can any Department treat its personnel in such a cavalier fashion? The other side of the coin is the hardship of the farming community to which Senator Higgins referred. Farmers have no access to their cars or veterinary certification. They cannot have all their other entitlements dealt with. REPS applications and those regarding farm buildings are not being processed. The Department has stated they have been available since last Thursday to it and the Minister. We have heard nothing but a deafening silence in the interim.</P>
      <P>In 2003 that is no way to treat personnel of high standing who have been doing a good job in the interests of the farming community and the Department, yet nobody seems to care about the situation in which they find themselves. Like my colleague, I ask the Minister of State to intervene as a matter of urgency to resolve the dispute. There is no justification for its continuing as the Minister of State and the Department have allowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the action being taken by the Civil and Public Services Union in the Department's local offices. In February CPSU members in those offices voted in favour of industrial action to secure what they considered improved promotion structures.</P>
      <P>The industrial action commenced in the local offices with effect from Tuesday, 18 March 2003. Union members decided not to perform normal duties arising from telephone calls and faxes. In addition, they refused to perform duties at reception desks. The services provided from our local offices are essential to the farming community in the context of cattle movements to factories and marts, as well as the various direct payments to farmers which are critical to their income position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials from the Department met CPSU representatives on 2 April but unfortunately no basis for a settlement emerged. Initially the CPSU had advised the Department that it would regionalise the dispute into four regions but following the meeting on 2 April it advised that the officers removed from the payroll in Galway, Limerick, <Col N="1312" />Mayo and Kerry would not be returning to work until the dispute was resolved. It also indicated that it would be picketing the offices involved from 3 April. Non CPSU members in the Castlebar office have also refused to pass the picket since that date.</P>
    <P>Since 28 April the CPSU extended its industrial action to the Department's Clonakilty office. It is also engaged in a limited industrial action on a random basis in other local offices in Sligo, Navan, Portlaoise and Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The Department's decision to remove staff from the payroll was not taken lightly. However, given that the CPSU staff members involved refused to perform core duties, arrangements were made to remove them from the payroll with effect from 2 April. Details of the staff numbers removed from the payroll are as follows: Galway, 75; Kerry, 45; Mayo local office, 51; Mayo headquarters office, 37; Limerick, 31; and Clonakilty, 23. I emphasise that normal duties are being carried out by CPSU members in offices other than those in Kerry, Limerick, Mayo, Galway and Clonakilty, County Cork.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say that the union's action is contrary to the existing Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the new Sustaining Progress agreements and cannot be condoned by anybody. These agreements specifically exclude cost-increasing claims over and above the increases provided for under the agreements which have been agreed by the social partners and the Government. The CPSU claim is for more promotional posts, which would obviously involve higher costs for the Department. Moreover, all unions undertook in these agreements not to engage in industrial action in pursuit of claims.</P>
    <P>The Department is examining the staffing of its local offices. However, any reorganisation involving upgradings would have to be dealt with against the background of the continuing need to control public finances. In any event, as I have said, the industrial action is contrary to the social partnership agreements. I am personally and publicly appealing to the union to instruct their members to resume duty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the actions being taken by the CPSU members are causing unnecessary hardship to the farming community We regret that the staff in the Department of Agriculture and Food are involved in such actions and we have requested <Col N="1313" />them to return to work immediately. We are also aware that many members of the CPSU have no wish to prolong this situation.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State for Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, why people with multiple handicaps in County Roscommon cannot avail of a senior orthodontist. I believe this is their right, particularly in the year of the disabled. The non-availability of a senior orthodontist in the county has gone on far too long.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to inform the House of the developments that have taken place in the dental services, which are aimed at providing services to those children with special needs. The House should be aware that the provision of dental treatment to patients with special needs is the responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the level of dental care has declined in all socio-economic groups. However, children from socially disadvantaged groups and those with disabilities suffer disproportionately from the effects of oral disease. Important steps have already been taken to focus greater attention on developing dental services for people with special needs.</P>
      <P>A mark of a civilised society is the extent to which it caters for the needs of those with disabilities. Frequently, their voice is not heard to the same extent as that of other groups. Significant research is underway regarding the oral health needs of persons with disabilities. This research is part of the National Survey of Adult and Children's Dental Health being carried out by health boards, University College Cork and the Department of Health and Children. The outcome of this research will be used in the formulation of a new strategy for the dental services. Ultimately it will have a major impact on the evolution of dental services in the future.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the dental health action plan was agreed which allowed for the reorientation of the dental services towards the provision of structured care for special needs patients. In this regard, health boards have restructured their dental services to give greater recognition to those involved in delivering dental services to persons with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A grade of senior dental surgeon in special needs duties has been created. The remit of the senior dental surgeon in special needs includes the identification of specific target groups in the community who may have difficulty in gaining <Col N="1314" />access to, accepting oral health care, or who may be at greater risk from dental disease or oral dysfunction than the majority of the population. Such target groups include the medically compromised and those with physical and intellectual disabilities. In addition, the senior dental surgeon in special needs is responsible for the prioritisation of the oral health needs of these groups and the supervision of the on-going training needs of dental staff working with people with special needs.</P>
    <P>My Department recognises the importance that leadership in the area of special needs dentistry can bring to the future direction and development of this area. I am pleased to advise the House that the Department has funded the appointment of a professor of special care dentistry at the Dublin Dental School and Trinity College, Dublin. A professor for this post has been appointed and is playing a very important role in developing education, training and research in the arena of special care dentistry.</P>
    <P>A number of boards refer patients who are medically compromised and who need complex care to specialist dental units in Cork University Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. In this way, the health boards ensure the welfare and safety of these patients. Equally, the Dublin Dental School and Hospital acts as a national resource for health board and general practice dentists for the referral of patients who require specialist treatments that dentists cannot provide. The Dublin Dental School and Hospital has service agreements with a range of agencies to provide specialist care services and these play an important role in specialist and consultant training programmes, as well as delivering specialist care for patients. A paediatric dental service is provided at Tallaght and Temple Street Children's Hospitals by the Dublin Dental Hospital. Discussions are taking place regarding the provision of a more comprehensive service at Temple Street Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition, the hospital provides an emergency service to which general hospitals and general dental practitioners can refer patients for whom they cannot provide a service. Emergency out-of-hours services are also provided by the hospital. Likewise, at the Cork Dental School and Hospital, senior staff including specialists in paediatric dentistry provide an important consultant service within their area of specialisation.</P>
    <P>The health strategy envisages a health system that is accessible, fair and empowers the community to achieve their full oral health potential. Embracing this vision means participating in a system that is equitable, people-centred and responsive to the needs of the individual. These equity and people-centred visions foster a culture of removing barriers to health care for people with disabilities. The strategy declares, &ldquo;A special needs based approach will be taken to developing <Col N="1315" />dental services over the next five to seven years.&rdquo; Consequently, greater attention will be focused on developing dental services for people with special needs at national and regional level over the next five to seven years. Ultimately, building <Col N="1316" />on steps already taken in this important area will be a priority.</P>
