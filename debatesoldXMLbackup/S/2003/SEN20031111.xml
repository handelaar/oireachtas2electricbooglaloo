      <P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to make a statement on investment in the arts following cutbacks amounting to &euro;4 million overall in the last budget, in the light of the continuing negative impact of such cuts on performing companies and the communities they serve.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to annul the order before the Oireachtas authorising the partial demolition of Carrickmines Castle.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to outline the measures and procedures that are in place to ensure that all landlords in receipt of rent allowances are tax compliant.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on the urgent need for additional school places in Lucan to meet the needs of its current and future population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Bannon, Henry and Morrissey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Tuffy <Col N="810" />may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion under which the subject matter of motion No. 15 on today's Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, concerning the establishment between member states of a means of establishing mutual support and assistance in implementing return and re-admission measures for the removal of illegally resident third country nationals in cases of transit by land, to be taken without debate; No. 2, a referral motion under which the subject matter of motion No. 16 on today's Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, concerning the improvement of operational co-operation between member states in implementing measures for the removal and return of illegally resident third country nationals, to be taken without debate; No. 3, a motion which was referred to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which has completed its deliberations, to be taken without debate; No. 4, statements on the full decoupling of direct payments, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 12 minutes and those of all other Senators eight minutes, Members may share their time and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 5, the Broadcasting (Funding) Bill 2003 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken at 5 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7 p.m.</P>

      <P>I propose an amendment that, following the Order of Business, statements on the current crisis in accident and emergency facilities in all Dublin acute hospitals take place. It would be wrong for the House not to debate that crucial matter. Two years ago, the Government set out a health strategy and gave a firm commitment that it would solve the ongoing crisis in the accident and emergency departments of all the Dublin acute hospitals. Two years later, that has not happened. At least the Minister for Health and Children had the good grace to admit last weekend that the promise in the national development plan to end all waiting lists by 2004 would not be fulfilled and that it should not have been made in the first place. We face a frightening situation as we go into the worst part of the winter, with the possibility of a flu epidemic. Every accident and emergency facility in this city is crowded with people who have to wait for up to five days. Last night a woman in my constituency said that people were being treated like animals not by our doctors or nurses, but by the Government. It is a disgrace. I ask that the House have a full debate on this issue as a matter of urgency. The Minister for Health and Children <Col N="811" />and the Government have produced countless reports. We are not seeing any net change or improvement for ordinary PAYE workers. It is a disgrace. The House urgently needs a debate on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bring to the attention of the House the fact that the freedom of information regulations that will be before it after the Order of Business will extend the application of the Freedom of Information Acts to the various bodies that are charged with the implementation of the commitments given in the benchmarking agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I point this out because the matter will be taken without debate. I know some people, certainly on the Fine Gael side, would have liked a debate on the matter, which was discussed at some length by a committee.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the Minister for Education and Science's recent statement on Sustaining Progress. We have had long debates in this House on the commitments given in respect of school buildings. I would like to make absolutely clear that Sustaining Progress does not deal with the question of school buildings. This is because the Government of the day refused to include a reference to them. It refused to negotiate on that basis because it wanted to deal with school buildings outside the partnership process. The actions taken by various groups in pursuit of objectives which are not included in Sustaining Progress are not, therefore, constrained in any way by the industrial peace commitments in that agreement. If the Government wanted to restrict the opportunity to take action in respect of school buildings, it should have made commitments about school buildings in Sustaining Progress. Such commitments do not exist. If the Minister for Education and Science chooses to refer the issue to the conciliation and arbitration body or to any of the interpretation bodies, the point I have made will be made absolutely clear. People cannot have it both ways. I have spent a great deal of time arguing for Sustaining Progress and its provisions. We cannot use the agreement to argue for things that are not contained in it. The Government made certain commitments, which were discussed in this House, and it has to deal with the fall-out if they are not met.</P>
      <P>I would like to address the proposal made by the Leader of the Opposition. I am happy to support a debate on health at this stage. I understand the Leader gave a commitment that there would be a debate on the various health reports at an appropriate time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that we should monitor issues such as implementation of the reports. That <Col N="812" />is perfectly in line with what we have discussed previously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak about a decision taken by the Government this morning. I refer to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's announcement that he intends to close two prisons, to place the management of two other prisons in a body outside the prisons service and, in effect, to privatise the prisons escort service. I am not convinced that a case can be made for this proposal from an economic or a rehabilitation point of view. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, is engaging in a dereliction of his duty. His proposals do not indicate who will run the two prisons that will be managed outside the Prison Service. Despite the fact that he has been in office for 18 months, there have been no real reforms in respect of the Garda Síochána or the Prisons Service. There is a real threat of industrial action in the Prisons Service as a result of this announcement. I wonder if the Leader can give us her views on this matter. Can she organise a debate? The Minister should come to the House to spell out quite clearly his proposals and how he intends to follow them through.</P>
      <P>Comments made last week by two Ministers went largely unnoticed in some quarters. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, informed us that there is no need for an extra 2,000 gardaí. This statement contrasts with his party's election manifesto of last year. The Minister for Health and Children said the proposal in the programme for Government to cut waiting lists by the middle of next year is no longer achievable.</P>

      <P>What was the second point made by the Senator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the Minister for Health and Children's comment that cutting waiting lists by the middle of next year is not an achievable target. I ask the Leader to respond to the issues I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to speak about the health system or the Prison Service, despite the serious nature of those issues. I would like to discuss something that affects businesses and those who use personal computers. I am sure the House will agree that an initiative announced by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in recent days is to be welcomed. The Minister has initiated a project at European level to ensure that &ldquo;spam&rdquo;&ndash; an awful term to describe unsolicited e-mails that are sent to practically everybody's PC &ndash; will be outlawed in Europe. If I understand his statement correctly, the Minister will, under the EU Presidency, extend that project to the rest of the world. Very few people who use a PC will be unaware of the deeply offensive and gratuitous nature of much of the unsolicited pornography one receives. I am receiving, on average, more than 100 unsolicited <Col N="813" />e-mails per day on my personal computer. People should note that if they attempt to un-subscribe by clicking on an un-subscribe box, as they are constantly being encouraged to do, this will ensure they will receive even more unsolicited e-mails. This is because, technically, there is nothing in existence to un-subscribe from unsolicited spam. I am sure the Leader will have a comment on this and I would welcome the Minister's attendance in the House at some point to make a statement on how he intends to enforce his proposal. The absence of information on how he will enforce it is the one flaw in his otherwise welcome statement.</P>
      <P>I returned to my office after having been away for four days and I had over 500 unsolicited e-mails, most of which are so bad, deeply offensive and pornographic in nature that I cannot allow my children to access my PC at home because I am afraid of what they might see. I have been around the course, no more than the Cathaoirleach, and yet I find the subject matter of some of this spam, which comes almost exclusively from the United States, so deeply gratuitous and offensive that it is past time that something was done about it. I welcome the Minister's initiative in this regard and I am sure the House will join me in applauding it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Brian Hayes's proposal. When the Hanly report was announced originally, at least Senator Leyden said it should be binned. It is interesting to note that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, announced last night in reference to local hospitals that he supported the Hanly report's recommendations <i>vis-à-vis </i>Nenagh hospital. Therefore, Senator Leyden's comments may have been opportune and correct.</P>
      <P>I support Senator McCarthy's point on the Irish Prison Service. In light of our discussions in the House on what has been taking place among the criminal fraternity in recent times, the statement of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on reducing the number of prisons came as a total surprise to many. It is very difficult to visualise the type of backdrop against which he made it. I know there is an ongoing battle between him and the Prison Service on overtime. The Minister is using excessive zeal in this instance &ndash; it is a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Given what is happening in Limerick and other locations, the sooner we have the Minister in the House to respond to specific questions, rather than having statements, the better. This would allow us to try to understand the mindset of the gentleman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>With the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach, I remind the House that today is the 85th anniversary of the armistice that ended the Great War, in which so many Irish people of all traditions, North and South, died. We should remember the Irish people who died in all wars and conflicts, ponder the futility of conflict and <Col N="814" />commit ourselves to peace. Will the Leader inform us if it is possible to have a debate on the wider peacekeeping activities of the Irish security forces? We are entitled to be proud of them and celebrate their achievements.</P>
      <P>On hospitals, I have immediate sympathy with the concern of Senator Brian Hayes. I wonder if it is particularly wise to take accident and emergency services out of the broader perspective. It is a question of stanching the inward flow and making more space rather than providing additional capacity.</P>
      <P>We have enough appalling Euro jargon on the Order Paper, such as &ldquo;full decoupling&rdquo;, and it is absolutely barbaric to see it translated into the first national language as &ldquo;díchúpláil iomlán&rdquo;. Will the Leader ask the translation department whether it is possible to find an existing, sensible Irish word which fulfils the meaning without translating European neologisms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider holding an urgent debate on the pensions crisis not only here, but also in Europe? One of the proposed solutions, the extension of the retirement age to 75 years, has recently received publicity. The matter was brought to my attention by a direction emanating from the European Union this week &ndash; it is political correctness gone over board &ndash; that recognition should not be given to the fact that women live longer than men and that equal funding for pensions should be allocated for the sexes. I expect the women of Europe will immediately rise in protest against the suggestion that their pensions should be equal to those of men despite the fact that they live much longer. This would be most unfair. A debate is required on the pensions crisis facing every country in Europe and the House should draw attention to the issue.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Mooney in congratulating the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his initiative on spam mail. I raised this issue at a recent meeting of the Committee on European Affairs and I am delighted action will be taken on it. I gather, however, that the proposed initiative will not be sufficient if it only applies to Europe and it will have to extend much further. I agree completely with Senator Mooney's comments on the issue.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes's proposal to amend the Order of Business regarding a debate on the deteriorating health services not only in Dublin, but throughout the country. <Col N="816" />As a serving member of a health board, I see the impact major shortfalls in funding are having on the health service, particularly in the hospitals in my region.</P>
      <P>We need to debate the important issue of security in our banking system. Bank fraud takes place at automatic teller machines. A radio programme this morning heard from several people who had encountered it on their bank cards. As a result of the Minister for Finance's budget last year, the public is paying significant charges for banking services. He should come to the House and account for security in the banking system.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General made critical remarks regarding the procedures for the drawing down of up to &euro;15 million for the events centre in Punchestown. Community development associations and sports clubs throughout the country are up in arms at the fast tracking of this proposal when they are obliged to complete sheaves of forms to draw down departmental funding. It is a shame and a disgrace. Allowing this to happen is a blight on the system. The Minister must come clean and make a statement on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request of Senator Brian Hayes for a debate on the health services. If this House is to be politically relevant, we must discuss matters that are relevant to the public. Over the past few months the Minister for Health and Children has used the smoking debate as a smokescreen to cover up the shocking deterioration in the health service. The issue must be debated as a matter of grave urgency. I appreciate that time is limited but we must put at the top of the queue of subjects for debate the matters on which the public would expect us to concentrate. In almost every hospital in the country there are queues for beds and even for trolleys. We would be remiss in our political duty if we did not debate the matter at the earliest date.</P>

      <P>I support the concerns expressed by a number of Senators about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's proposal to close two prisons and other reforms. It is urgent that he comes to the Seanad to outline his proposals and the knock-on effect they will have. It is not long since we had the revolving door system in the prisons, which was abhorred by many people. An additional prison had to be opened to deal with it. Now there is a proposal from the Minister to close two prisons. The Minister must come to the House to discuss it.</P>
      <P>The other issue I wish to raise is the promotion of alcoholic drinks, a matter we have discussed many times. Indeed, legislation was introduced to deal with this. Drinks companies are still promoting their drinks in pubs by giving them to patrons free of charge. That practice is outlawed under the legislation. My son, after playing football last Saturday, came home to tell me that he was going to the local pub, where Guinness was giving out free drink. He is over age but he is still a student. It is wrong that these companies are encouraging young people, after participating in their sports, to go to the local pub where they will be given free drink. The Minister needs to crack down on this practice. He must know it is happening.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Maurice Hayes's call for a debate on neutrality. It is poignant that today is the 85th anniversary of the end of the First World War. Armistice Day in 1918 was a wonderful occasion, especially in Ireland because this country had sent many of its young men to fight German imperialism in Europe while at home, and against one of the largest empires the world had ever seen, the will of the people was to seek freedom from imperialism. It was a unique situation.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile noting that the human heart calls for freedom. A debate on our role and how we can assist in maintaining freedom and peace in the world, given our neutrality, should be applauded.</P>

      <Col N="818" />I have raised the issue of decentralisation on numerous occasions and I regret I must raise it again today. Four years ago the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced that 10,000 jobs would be decentralised to areas which had not already benefited from decentralisation. We had a heated debate on it and the Taoiseach said an announcement about decentralisation would be made before Christmas. Senator Bradford said the smoking ban was announced to cover up the problems in the health service. I heard recently from a member of the Government that the Taoiseach mentioned decentralisation to cover up the problems with the smoking ban. I would like the Taoiseach to come into the House to clarify if an announcement will be made about decentralisation before Christmas.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Mooney's remarks about spam. I am delighted the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has more or less adopted the Fine Gael position as outlined by our spokesperson, Deputy Coveney, who published a Private Members' Bill on this issue during the summer.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon mentioned the recent development at Punchestown racecourse. I raised that issue a year ago on the Order of Business, but, like many issues, it did not receive the attention it should have at the time. Will the Leader ask the local Deputy, who is also the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, to come into the House to answer questions on how procedures were abandoned and how &euro;15 million was spent on redeveloping Punchestown? It appears, as Senator Finucane said, that the Government cares more for horses than for people.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the current situation in accident and emergency departments. He said he heard the debate on it in the House. I also heard it when I was travelling here and I heard the person of whom he spoke. His amendment was seconded by several people.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole said the extended application of the Freedom of Information Acts relates to the discussions on benchmarking, the verification bodies and the material they received. I thank him for elaborating on that issue. I meant to refer to it when I was speaking. He then said that given that funding for school buildings was not included in Sustaining Progress, members of any trade union were entitled to raise the issue and to speak about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McCarthy mentioned the proposal to close two prisons and to remove two more from prison service control. I expect we will know in the afternoon what will happen to those two prisons. He also referred to the privatisation of the prison escort service and the fear of industrial <Col N="819" />action. I tried to get more information on the matter this morning, but the Minister was at a Cabinet meeting and I did not see him when he left it. I expect a formal statement will be made. I understand the Senator comes from a constituency where there is great interest in this issue. However, we must await clarification from the Minister. The Senator also wanted to know what had happened to the proposed extra 2,000 gardaí. The Minister said in this House that the extra gardaí would be brought in before the end of the Government's five-year term. Senator Brian Hayes also commented on the election commitment by the Minister for Health and Children to reduce waiting lists although he acknowledged the Minister regretted saying this.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the new initiative of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to have unsolicited e-mail outlawed. I do not receive 500 e-mails in the period of time the Senator mentioned but I receive many, not all of which are pleasant.</P>

      <P>There were requests for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to talk about prisons. As mentioned by Senator Maurice Hayes, it is indeed the 11th day of the 11th month, Armistice Day. Dr. Garret FitzGerald, when he was Taoiseach, inaugurated the remembrance day held in Dublin once a year for all who have died fighting. The Senator is right to remind us, however, as many people have relatives who fought in the Great War. There was an interesting programme last night about a young Wexford man, who had not even reached his 14th birthday, who fought in the war.</P>

      <P>Senator Bradford seconded Senator Brian Hayes's motion in favour of a debate on the health services, as did several others. We will have the Estimates this week, so we will see what moneys are going to the health services, although I understand this does not solve the immediate difficulties with accident and emergency facilities. Senator Coghlan supported Senator Hayes and also supported Senator O'Toole's point about freedom of information. Senator Terry referred to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the revolving door prison system. It was thought that the revolving door had been closed and she wondered whether it was now to reopen. I was interested in what <Col N="821" />Senator Terry had to say about her son receiving notification of a Guinness promotion in the local pub. That matter should be reported to the local Garda as promotions are now outlawed. Although she said her son was over age, the idea that pubs are still involved in the promotion business struck her as incorrect and any parent would be of the same opinion.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin referred to the process of neutrality and called for a debate on how we can assist in maintaining freedom and peace.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan referred to the Connacht Rangers in Boyle and when he spoke I remembered clearly what had been written about that. In 1986, the then Taoiseach and leader of the Senator's party was the first person to raise that issue. A ceremony was held that year and it has continued every year since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" />The Senator referred also to decentralisation, on which he has spoken frequently in the past. I do not know the position on decentralisation but I will endeavour to find out because the Senator has certainly been pushing for it.</P>
    <P>Senator John Phelan talked about spam and Deputy Coveney's Private Members' Bill, which I was interested to read about some time ago. The Senator also raised the issue surrounding Punchestown racecourse. We made inquiries on that this morning because I knew the matter would arise and I was told it is a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Food. All of us could comment on the issue.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to open this debate on full decoupling of payments under the Agenda 2000 mid-term review agreement that was reached by the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 26 June last.</P>
      <P>The proposals presented by the European Commission comprised the most radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy since its foundation. The agreement reached in the Agriculture Council in Luxembourg was the culmination of a long negotiating process. My objective in the negotiations was to safeguard the benefits to Irish agriculture and our rural communities which were achieved under Agenda 2000 and to ensure the best possible level of support and protection of our farming production base into the future.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the negotiations contained substantial modifications to the Commission's proposals and represented a successful outcome from Ireland's point of view. The new agreement will reshape the Common Agricultural Policy and secure its future by making it more relevant to modern society and to consumer demands. We now have the opportunity to exploit the new situation to our advantage.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the details of the agreement are well known at this stage, but I will outline the main issues briefly. First, the Agriculture Council agreed to amend the proposal for full decoupling of direct payments by giving member states options which would allow them to implement decoupling in a manner best suited to their requirements, thus fulfilling Europe's long held principle of democratic subsidiarity.</P>
      <P>On 19 October last, having given careful consideration to the 200 or so submissions which were received under the public consultative process I initiated last July and to the outcome of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>independent research I had commissioned from <Col N="824" />FAPRI-Ireland, I decided that all direct payments for cattle, sheep and arable crops will be fully decoupled from production as and from 1 January 2005. I had already decided that the new dairy premium, to be introduced in 2004, should also be decoupled from production with effect from 2005. The overwhelming weight of opinion in the farming organisations was in favour of full decoupling and this was also reflected at the 40 or so information seminars held by my Department throughout the country. I believe that full decoupling is in the best interests of Irish agriculture and the development of a sustainable, market orientated agri-food sector.</P>
    <P>Decoupling will allow farmers to respond to market demands, without the need to engage in production solely to qualify for direct payments. This will put the control of production back into the farmer's own hands for individual decision.</P>
    <P>This view is backed up by independent analysis. In October, FAPRI-Ireland, a group of economists from Teagasc, the University of Missouri and certain Irish universities, published its analysis of the Luxembourg agreement and its effects on Irish agriculture. Out of the many options available, the study focused on three scenarios including partial decoupling of certain premia across all member states, full decoupling across all member states and full decoupling across the EU, with Ireland opting to couple the slaughter premium and decouple all other premia.</P>
    <P>The analysis shows that full decoupling of all beef payments from production is the best option in terms of aggregate farm incomes. Full decoupling of beef premia would lead to a decline of around 18% in suckler cows and a consequent drop of 7% in the amount of beef produced. However, following an initial price decline, prices would subsequently increase and when combined with reduced input costs would result in an improvement in farm incomes by an aggregate 10%. The analysis showed that if the link between the slaughter premium and production was maintained, it would not be sufficient to halt the decline in suckler cow numbers. While there could be a small improvement in incomes for most beef producers, there would be a greater overall loss to the sector.</P>
    <P>On the milk side, the analysis showed that the decision to decouple dairy compensation payments from production from 2005 will lead to a more gradual restructuring of milk quota and more dairy farmers in the long term. Less efficient dairy farmers will have the option to exit the sector while retaining their payments and this will leave a larger pool of milk quota for dairy farmers with the means and the initiative to expand. The analysis shows milk prices falling by a further 5% on top of the cuts agreed in the institutional prices as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement. Increased efficiency and scale should result in the incomes of dairy farmers keeping ahead of inflation in the period to 2012. The analysis also shows that while the national sheep flock was set to decline substantially under existing policies, <Col N="825" />the introduction of decoupling will accelerate the decline. However, this decline will be offset by increased prices, leading to a slight increase in the value of sheep output by 2012.</P>
    <P>For the agriculture sector as a whole, FAPRI-Ireland finds that there would be a reduction in output value but this would be offset by a reduction in input costs brought about by lower animal numbers and more extensive production. There would also be environmental benefits to full decoupling with the reduction in livestock numbers bringing about a substantial drop in greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector to approximately 14% below 1990 levels. In conclusion, the FAPRI-Ireland results showed that full decoupling would result in aggregate farm income being higher than would be the case if there were no policy change or if partial decoupling were implemented.</P>
    <P>A second significant outcome for Ireland was the changes I negotiated in the areas of degression and modulation. The Commission's proposals for degression and modulation represented a serious threat to the level of direct payments in Ireland, which are of such crucial importance to farm incomes. On the issue of degression, I strenuously opposed the proposal to reduce direct payments by up to 13% to meet future financing needs. The compromise agreed requires the Council to review from 2007 onwards the annual financial circumstances and, if budget deficits arise, to take necessary action at that stage. This is a much more reasonable and acceptable approach.</P>
    <P>As regards modulation, the rate has been reduced from 6% to 5% when fully operational. The &euro;5,000 franchise or exemption will ensure that almost half of Irish farmers will not be affected by modulation. My objective in ensuring that modulated funds are retained in Ireland for agriculture-based rural development measures has also largely been achieved. Up to 85% of funds modulated in Ireland will stay in the agriculture sector here and will be distributed by my Department. The outcome was a major improvement on the original proposal, where the combined effect of modulation and degression, would have resulted in &euro;464 million being siphoned off direct payments over the period 2006-12.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the decision of the Agriculture Council regarding the milk sector. I do not believe the level of criticism of the agreement, which was concentrated on this element only, is justified. The decision taken in Luxembourg on 26 June provides for a reduction of approximately 4% beyond the level already agreed in Agenda 2000. This is in contrast to the original proposals where an additional 10% reduction was provided for. In addition, I secured compensation of approximately 80% for the additional intervention price reduction of 4% which was agreed by the Council. Therefore, the potential losses to the dairy sector from the net effect of the 4% intervention price reduction and the value of the dairy cow premium, amount to <Col N="826" />less than &euro;14 million annually, or 1% of the farm gate value of milk output. It is important to bear in mind that this reduction is an intervention price reduction and not a market price one. Farmers who concentrate on the market where the product should be sold will experience no loss if the industry concentrates on the marketplace. Depending on market prices, there could even be substantial gains. The agreement demonstrates emphatically that the dairy industry must realise that selling to intervention is not the way to build a viable industry capable of adequately remunerating its farmer suppliers for its raw material.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the objective of reducing dependence on commodity products and on intervention purchases, I insisted that a reasonable period of time should be provided for the dairy industry to re-orientate itself to a lower level of intervention availability. The original Commission proposal was for a ceiling of 30,000 tonnes per annum on intervention intake of butter and this would have been disruptive in the short term in that it would not have given the industry sufficient time to remodel its production base and have a larger product mix. Against enormous opposition, I managed to have the annual intervention ceiling significantly increased to 70,000 tonnes initially, reducing over five years to 30,000 tonnes. Overall, the agreement on milk is most satisfactory given that the milk quota regime has been extended to 2014-15. While many farmers were anxious about the future of the milk quota regime, they now know that it will be in place for the next ten years and can plan accordingly. A small price was paid in terms of intervention price reductions for that major objective which will play a key role in supporting the milk price until 2014-15.</P>
    <P>By way of compensation for the intervention price cuts, a new dairy premium will be introduced in 2004. The premium will be coupled to milk production in the first year and will be decoupled from production with effect from 2005. The original proposal was that the dairy premium would remain coupled to production until 2007. Following negotiations with the Commission on 29 September last, I secured agreement to have the dairy premium decoupled from production with effect from 2005. This was an important development in that it will allow dairy farmers to make important decisions in the period ahead about the sale and acquisition of quota and land and associated investment decisions. In taking the decision to decouple the dairy premium from 2005, I took into account the view expressed to me by representatives of dairy producers.</P>
    <P>We also argued successfully against the proposal for a reduction of 5% in the intervention price for cereals. The original proposal for a ten year obligatory non-rotational set-aside was also dropped. This would not have been suitable in the Irish context. The new arrangements on set-aside are more workable in Ireland and allow for further set-aside obligations as market needs arise in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" />The strengthening of support available to young farmers, by way of a special new incentive under the rural development measures is another positive outcome. The maximum support for young farmers undertaking investments within five years of setting up has been increased from 55% to 60% in less favoured areas and from 45% to 50% in other areas. Other changes in the proposals negotiated for young farmers include a more equitable calculation of single payment entitlements for those who entered farming during the reference period 2000 to 2002. For example, young farmers who came into the industry in those years would have found their entitlements being divided by three for the three years. Depending on what year the young farmer joined the industry, they will now be either divided by two or one. This was a significant achievement in the negotiations. There will be flexibility to create a national reserve of up to 3% of established entitlements that will be used in particular to provide single payment entitlements for young farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002. Young farmers who inherit farms will also inherit any entitlements established by the retiring farmer.</P>
    <P>As I have said, my objective was to preserve the benefits of the Agenda 2000 agreement for Ireland and I firmly believe that I have been successful in this. Full decoupling of payments also has huge potential benefits in terms of reducing substantially the administrative and bureaucratic burden for farmers and my Department alike, while allowing farmers the freedom to farm and to respond to market demands. I assume Members' clinics will be quiet in the future, as no one will be seeking headage premia or other allowances. Under the single farm payment there will be one application and one payment. This will allow Members to leave their clinics early on Saturday mornings in future.</P>

      <P>That is right. The new policy framework will ensure a more market-oriented and sustainable agriculture and food industry, which will benefit farmers and consumers alike. Agriculture continues to make a major contribution to the Irish economy and society and we are highly dependent on a strong and viable CAP. Irish agriculture contributes 200,000 jobs, &euro;7 billion in exports and large net foreign earnings that are mainly redistributed within Ireland. In the longer term, I believe that the Luxembourg agreement and the full decoupling of payments from production will be seen as safeguarding its future and creating the conditions for farmers to prosper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan" hpid="Mr. Coonan Mr. Coonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The decoupling proposal has received widespread support and approval from the farm<Col N="828" />ing community, primarily as it will do away with the scourge of bureaucracy. It will also allow farmers to farm as they wish and to produce quality products for the marketplace without further restrictions. However, a number of issues need to be clarified. Is there a 100% requirement to farm land to be eligible to draw down entitlements secured in the reference years? If so, this will be a major stumbling block which will add to the price of rented land.</P>
      <P>I know farmers who leased land during the reference years. The land is no longer available because the owner has planted it and is drawing a forestry premium on it. If that requirement remains, it will be difficult for farmers to secure land in their locality and land prices will increase. How will farmers who lost quota rights as a result of disease eradication, depopulation and so on during those years be treated? How will farmers who, as a result of errors or bureaucracy, were fined and lost premium rights be treated? What entitlements does the Minister propose to grant to farmers who leased their lands under the early retirement scheme because of ill health or in an effort to survive in farming until such time as their sons or daughters were ready to take over?</P>
      <P>A study commissioned by the Irish Meat Association found that decoupling of direct payments from production would lead to a 40% to 60% drop in suckler herds with beef product subsequently falling from 656,000 tonnes to 457,000 tones, a 31% decline. The drop in value would be approximately &euro;445 million, a significant sum. The study suggests that such a drop would lead to a loss of some 2,000 jobs at processing level, a matter of grave concern. The introduction of full decoupling would allow farmers to concentrate on improving the quality of their livestock. The resources from the modulation fund for livestock should, therefore, be used to improve beef quality in breeding and to restructure the suckler cow herd. Focus must be on quality production. This will require an increase in Irish beef for export to Britain and continental Europe. The Department and Minister must focus on ensuring the live export trade operates unhindered and is built upon and expanded to markets in Libya and Egypt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the single farm payment is based on historical reference years, it is clear the new system will suit farmers who were well established during that time. It will, however, create barriers for those who commenced or attempted to upscale at that time and also for those who bought land since then. Glanbia chief executive, John Moloney, recently said the average milk producer would require a quota of 138,000 gallons by 2007 to equal the average industrial wage. Currently the average milk quota size in Ireland is 40,000 gallons. That compares badly to other areas such as Northern Ireland, where the quota is 70,000 gallons, Denmark, where the quota is 100,000 gallons, and New Zealand, where the quota is 190,000 gallons. Clearly, therefore, there is enormous pressure on those who remain in dairy <Col N="829" />farming to upscale their level of production significantly in a short period. Undoubtedly, this will require a thorough restructuring of the dairy industry. The Minister has not, as yet, given an indication of how he envisages the milk quota system being restructured and how it will operate to enable quantities of scale to increase.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Department of Agriculture and Food must take the lead in restructuring the dairy industry. We have heard suggestions of the type of model Ireland should adopt. In particular, reference has been made to the German and Danish models. Given the need for urgent action, the Department must examine this issue and set its proposals on what is best for the Irish producer. It is predicted that there will be a decline in dairy farmer numbers from 26,000 to 18,000 by 2012. Figures released last week further highlighted the increasing number of people leaving farming. This must be a source of concern for all of us. If that is so, the question the Minister must address is what support structures will be put in place in terms of rural development to ensure those who opt out of farming will have a viable economic alternative in place to allow them to live in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister must set out what he intends to do to assist young farmers who commenced farming during the reference period. Does he envisage giving them extra assistance through the national reserve fund? What does he intend to do for farmers who bought land since the reference period? They should be eligible for assistance from the national reserve fund. Fine Gael opposed the abolition of roll-over relief in budget 2003. Given the need for farmers to increase their holdings and to upscale as a result of Mr. Fischler's proposals, does the Minister support the view that the Government should reinstate roll-over relief in the coming budget? That relief was of tremendous benefit to young farmers wishing to restructure or consolidate their holdings. Without it, it will be difficult for them to establish themselves in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Farm organisations such as Macra na Feirme &ndash; it attended the joint committee this afternoon &ndash; and the IFA support an amendment to current tax relief arrangements for the leasing of land. In 1996, the Government introduced a tax relief on income from long-term land leasing. Under this scheme, farmers over 55 years of age or those incapacitated and under 55 years of age are entitled to earn &euro;5,080 per annum, tax free, if they lease their land for between five and seven years. If they lease the land for more than seven years they are entitled to earn &euro;7,620. Would the Minister support the idea of amending the current scheme to include farmers under 35 years of age &ndash; I am referring to trained farmers? This would provide an option for farmers who wish to expand production and increase scale, but who cannot afford to buy additional land at current prices. More secure long-term land leases which would provide safeguards for the landowner and the lessee are required. Longer term leasing also <Col N="830" />provides young farmers with the ability to plan ahead, something they need. They also need assurances that this scheme will run until 2013 and not be radically overhauled within that period.</P>
    <P>The income levels for claiming relief have not been increased since 1996. Will the Minister consider increases in that area to take account of inflation? What proposals does he have to ensure that in future there will be free transfer of land between those who opt out and those wishing to expand their enterprise? The Government, in last year's budget, imposed cuts of more than &euro;70 million on the farm sector. The Minister should not pursue a similar policy of cutbacks in the agricultural sector in 2004 as it would be disastrous for the future viability of farm families. Instead, he should create farm friendly policies, such as farm business incentives and tax incentives, to allow farmers to increase their scale of production, particularly in terms of milk quota purchase. Of particular importance is the need to address the difficulties surrounding land transfer. A crucial line in creating a vibrant and sustainable farming community is a change in the income tax code to encourage land leasing on a medium to long-term basis. This is what the Minister should be pushing for at the Cabinet table.</P>
    <P>Suggestions made to assist the farming sector, which the Minister should examine, include reducing or removing the age restriction on existing relief on rental income, the re-instatement of capital gains tax roll-over relief and a reduction in stamp duty on land swaps to aid the building up of farms by young farmers in particular. The land transfer process must become more efficient and cost-effective to all concerned if we are to induce those wishing to remain in farming to do so. Speeding up that process will also assist those wishing to leave farming. We must encourage farmers to upscale their operations and to increase their quality of production. We must create viable conditions which will allow them to pass on their businesses to their sons and daughters as is traditional in the farming enterprise sector.</P>
    <P>Given that the Prospectus report on the future of the Irish dairy industry noted the important role which the farm advisory body, Teagasc, plays in supporting young farmers in increasing production, does the Minister intend to significantly increase funding for that body in budget 2004? In 2003, the Minister cut funding for Teagasc by &euro;8.5 million, forcing it to close offices and advisory centres all over the country. That is not good for farming and should be corrected immediately. That 45% of farmers are over 55 years of age and 37% have no direct or natural heir clearly demonstrates the potential crisis for farming in this country. As we speak, farming is in an extremely serious state, and it is important that we get everything right this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, <Col N="831" />Deputy Aylward, to the House, and thank the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, who has had to leave. We last spoke on agriculture on 2 July when we had a very constructive debate on the outcome of the mid-term review negotiations. There was all-round general consensus that the outcome was good under the circumstances. Both our Ministers and our officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food were congratulated on the fine job done at that stage.</P>
      <P>There was, of course, one outstanding issue concerning the flexibility allowed to national governments to engage in full or partial decoupling or continue as previously. I welcome the fine decision taken by the Minister and the Department. I recall saying during the debate that I felt it was necessary for the Minister and the Department to engage with the various organisations and other parties around the country. They have done so, and departmental officials visited many areas, attending some 40 meetings altogether. The overwhelming result of those visits throughout the country to explain what was happening was a positive approach to decoupling. The outcome of the negotiations on the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy has enabled the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, to introduce a simplified single payment system that will profoundly reshape the CAP.</P>
      <P>We cannot overstate the Minister's success at the negotiations, and that contrasts sharply with his Fine Gael predecessor, whose only significant negotiation in Brussels resulted in a cut in our special beef premium quota, which gave rise to a cost overshoot in 2002.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>We discuss matters and are still on talking terms. I am delighted to see that the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, has also secured a favourable outcome for the special beef premium overshoot, which will be worth some &euro;8 million to our farmers annually. The Minister has brought forward a package of measures that will safeguard the whole Irish agriculture industry in future, making it more relevant to the rest of modern society. The Commission's proposals were for the most radical reform of the CAP since its foundation and have been the subject of detailed analysis and intense public debate, both here and throughout Europe. The issues and concerns of farmers, consumers and taxpayers have <Col N="832" />been identified and have been well known for some time.</P>
      <P>The decoupling of direct payments from production is a fundamental change to the CAP. It will have two major beneficial effects on farmers. First, Irish farmers will now be free to provide a product for the market and the consumer. They will get a single EU income support payment, irrespective of the farm enterprise that they pursue. That will give them the opportunity to produce quality cattle that in turn will enable the meat industry to market the highest-quality Irish beef at home and abroad. Of course, the meat factories have a role to play in this new approach by starting to pay farmers to produce quality cattle. It is time that the factories came on board, stopped their negativity and met their obligations.</P>
      <P>Second, the major advantage of the new single income support payment arrangements is that we now have the opportunity to dismantle the dreaded mountain of bureaucratic paperwork that is part and parcel of the array of schemes currently operated. The paperwork attracted a great deal of criticism from farmers, farming organisations and everyone else. Those schemes brought large amounts of money to farmers under their various headings. As they have all been grouped together into the single payment, it will make life easier and overcome the difficulty many farmers felt existed. They were pleased when the schemes were there, but the difficulty of form-filling was one hell of an issue.</P>
      <P>Designing and implementing the new payment system will provide the Minister with a major challenge. I have no doubt that he has chosen the model best suited to Irish requirements from the point of view of maximising efficiency and competitiveness and protecting the rural economy. I also have no doubt that the new arrangements he will put in place for 2005 onwards will minimise the bureaucracy that has plagued farmers in recent years. Senator Coonan referred to the anomalies that will exist in a totally changed situation. I am absolutely certain that the Minister and the Department will take cognisance of those and try to ameliorate them as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister's complete rejection of the Commission's original degression proposals was a major success, as was the reduction in the proposed rate of modulation from 6% to 5% when fully operational. The retention of the &euro;5,000 exemption will ensure that more than half the farmers in this country will not have modulation applied to them at all. I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, and the departmental representatives that almost all the modulated funds retained in Ireland for rural development measures should stay in Agriculture House. It is important that the fund be retained there for certain measures where assistance is required. I will ask the Minister either to enhance the existing REPS scheme or introduce a similar scheme that would further benefit farmers. I emphasise that because it has been, and could be, of major benefit to at least 50% of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" />When the agreed system is fully implemented, the Minister will retain over &euro;34 million per annum of the &euro;40 million raised through modulation. That is a major improvement on the original proposal, where the combined effect of modulation and degression would have resulted in &euro;464 million being siphoned from direct payments in the period from 2006 to 2012. Other concessions secured during the negotiations include a member state's right to use up to 10% of its direct payments in one sector to encourage specific types of farming which are important for the environment or to improve quality and marketing. The farm advisory system is to be voluntary for all farmers. The national reserve may be used for certain early retirement cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to changes concerning young farmers and the benefits that accrued to them. Without listing them all, I will pick what to my mind is the most important, namely, allowing young farmers who inherit farms also to inherit any entitlements established by the retiring farmer. That is an absolutely essential criterion, and I am particularly pleased the Minister included it in his presentation. There will also be special payment entitlements for dairy and other farmers that can be traded in the same way as single payment entitlements.</P>
    <P>The overall outcome is that the Minister has preserved the benefits of the Agenda 2000 agreement for Ireland. The agreement also has huge potential benefits in substantially reducing the administrative and bureaucratic burden on farmers by allowing them freedom to farm and respond to market demands. The new support arrangements will therefore ensure a more market-orientated and sustainable agriculture and food industry that will benefit farmers and consumers alike. It is important to include the word &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;. There are times, when we speak of farming issues, that we forget to mention that farming is about producing food. We need consumers to purchase it. The package, as agreed, has a balance within it which repositions the CAP in the modern world. The options for decoupling direct payments will allow such payments to be made secure from challenge in the World Trade Organisation negotiations, which will recommence soon. As a consequence, the contribution of direct payments to farm incomes and, therefore, to the rural economy will be safeguarded in the future.</P>

      <P>It would be an awful shame if young farmers were discouraged by the words of those who should know better. I ask farming leaders, in particular, as well as people in public life, to recognise that there is a role in rural areas for young people who are considering farming as a career. They can be well-prepared by the courses offered by the agricultural colleges, which have a legacy of success as a result of past generations. The colleges have met the challenges posed by the changes in this country since 1920. There is a future for young farmers. Rather than using the béal bocht, we should accept the reality that we are doing remarkably well. Our priority should be to manage the transition from the old to the new regime, to ensure a smooth transfer and to enable Irish farmers and our high-quality food industry to exploit the new opportunities to the full.</P>
      <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has been in place for approximately 30 years. The policy's purpose when it was designed after the Second World War, under the Treaty of Rome, was to ensure that Europe would have food. The CAP has a certain legacy. Changes are being made at this point because circumstances are changing. Can I suggest that we re-examine the issue of land utilisation? There should be a new energy policy designed to meet the use of land. We could have a debate on the value of an energy policy based on land usage. We are talking about biomass and biofuels. People in this country have a role to play in the development of rural Ireland. There is a place for a sound and solid rural-based population for many generations to come. Such a population has served this country well in the past generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy" hpid="Mr. McCarthy Mr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best to follow Senator Callanan, whose contribution was as eloquent as usual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of Irish farming has reached a crossroads in recent years in many ways. The requirement to revisit the manner in which we make decisions on support mechanisms has dovetailed with the reform of the CAP. If one recalls the initiation of the negotiations, one will recall that their objectives were the preservation, by and large, of the financial benefits that were achieved in the context of Agenda 2000 and the establishment of a policy framework to give farmers and those involved in the agri-food sector the <Col N="835" />flexibility to adapt to an evolving consumer market and demands for international developments.</P>
    <P>The concept of decoupling relates, by and large, to the principle of separating payments from the requirement that farmers produce specified programme crops and/or divert land from production. The removal of an inherently contradictory traditional policy &ndash; asking farmers to reduce production while implicitly encouraging more output by tying their needs to each unit of production &ndash; is a chief goal of decoupling. The simplification of payment arrangements is one of the main reasons for the Commission's proposal. Decoupling is also being proposed to encourage greater market orientation, to reduce pressure on the environment and to improve efficiency and income transfer to farmers. It will make the extension of the CAP to accession countries easier.</P>
    <P>Another issue that may be linked to the rationale behind decoupling is a serious reduction in the amount of red tape. I would welcome such a development, because the amount of red tape has been one of the major causes of criticism of the EU's conduct in respect of farming in recent years. I hope the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, is correct to state that &ldquo;Members' clinics will be quiet in the future&rdquo; as a result of these measures, We will remind the Minister of that statement if it is not true.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the fact that payments will be made irrespective of production. They will be subject to the requirement that land will be maintained in good agricultural condition. Certain problems are linked to establishing the reference year. Some farmers will find that they are not eligible for direct payments because they did not collect payments in the reference year. Other farmers will have invested in quota or land because they expected to receive premium payments in the future. The quota or land will remain the property of the person who sold it to them in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss the effects of decoupling on output. By how much will production fall? It is important that we acquire information about that point. What will be the knock-on effects on agri-industry and agri-services? Do we have a response to that? Do we have a clear path in relation to those two issues? I know some of the proposals are rather unclear at this stage, but some clarification would be helpful. I would like to know the environmental effects of more extensive production.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the heading of eco-conditionality, which was already introduced in the context of Agenda 2000. Suspicions remain about the commitment of EU member states to enforcing conditionality. Do we have concrete proposals about how this aspect of the deal will be pursued? Do we have definite commitments that member states will adhere to this part of decoupling or of the Common Agricultural Policy? The proposals relate to the standards covering environmental <Col N="836" />safety, food safety, animal health and welfare, occupational safety and the level of standards, meeting mandatory standards or applying good farming practice.</P>
    <P>Much was made in the House earlier of Senator Maurice Hayes's comments about the need for a better Irish translation of the word &ldquo;decoupling&rdquo;. The Irish translation of the word is &ldquo;díchúpláil&rdquo;. It is important that I divulge some information in light of the fact that certain phrases spoken in this House have been changed in &ldquo;the blacks&rdquo; recently. When I returned to my office after the Order of Business, I typed the question &ldquo;What is decoupling?&rdquo; into the Google search engine. The definition I found&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is suitable for a post-lunchtime audience, which is just as sensitive. When I searched the Internet, I found a definition of &ldquo;decoupling&rdquo; which said that it cuts the link between subsidies and production and allows farmers to move away from unprofitable production and to respond faster to market changes. The document I found gives about five more explanations. I will be happy to give a copy of it to Senator Maurice Hayes if he is still puzzled about decoupling. I agree there could be a better linguistic approach to the Irish version.</P>
      <P>It was stated in the House last year, during the debate on the Nice treaty, that it was very important that it be ratified by Ireland. I am thankful we did so on the second occasion. One of the arguments made in the House at the time concerned the fact that the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, was negotiating the deal in Europe. It was of benefit to him at the conclusion of the Luxembourg talks that we ratified the treaty. Had we not done so, we would have sent him to Brussels, or Luxembourg, as was eventually the case, with one arm tied behind his back. He could not have told potential candidates for accession to the Union that they were not allowed to join and, in the same breath, expect to negotiate a deal that would be of benefit to the farmers and the economy as a whole. Ratification was positive and created a good platform from which he was able to negotiate the CAP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the talks had finished in Luxembourg, there was considerable debate in Ireland on the part of many sectors, vested interests, etc. I have stated in the House before that, irrespective of the political affiliation of the Minister of the day, it is unhelpful that comments would be made about him or his officials of the kind made on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on the morning the talks concluded. They referred to officials as being tired and to the Minister as being up all night and <Col N="837" />unclear. Such comments are not constructive when examining this issue in its entirety and do not portray in a positive way the people who are representing thousands of farmers in Ireland. They are absolutely unhelpful, personal and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Although such comments have been bandied about since the conclusion of the talks, it is important that we have clear and definitive accounts from Europe as to how the plan will be implemented. There is general frustration on the part of officials, the Minister and perhaps some of his negotiating team and some of the farmers who will be at the receiving end of the deal. There is a lack of clear guidance &ndash; for want of a better phrase &ndash; on how the plan can be implemented.</P>

      <P>The mid-term review of the CAP, which concluded in June, represents the background to today's debate. The Minister for Agriculture and Food deserves to be congratulated on another excellent negotiating performance in Brussels. The outcome of the talks generated some criticism in certain quarters, but it would be a very unreasonable evaluation of that outcome to suggest the Minister had done anything other than meet his previously stated objectives.</P>
      <P>The level of criticism the agreement generated was in no way justified. The reaction of some Fine Gael Members in the Dáil was hysterical. They spoke of a sell-out and bemoaned the absence of young people in farming while, at the same time, talking the industry down. It has to be said the reaction of farmers to the mid-term review has illustrated a clear desire to plan for the future in an informed manner.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 farmers turned out to hear Commissioner Fischler when he addressed a conference on the reform proposals organised by the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>. It has been encouraging that this constructive spirit dominated over any talks of sell-out. One of the achievements of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the mid-term review was to get the European Council to agree to amend the proposals for full decoupling of direct payments to provide member states with a number of options to implement decoupling in a manner best suited to their requirements. In other words, we had to choose. As a result of this, a major question since the conclusion of the CAP reform talks was whether we should opt for full or partial decoupling. This was an acute question that needed to be settled quickly to secure as much clarity and certainty as is possible in the world of farming. Clearly, whatever option was chosen would have a huge effect on Irish agriculture. Consultation was necessary and the Minister made a commitment to consult with all interested parties. He has clearly delivered on this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister approached reform in his usual steady and reliable manner and, as before, directed that an information-based campaign be started. Consequently, the Department of Agriculture and Food proceeded to update and <Col N="838" />inform farmers on the CAP agreement. This was a real case of the Government being in touch with the people. It is interesting, although hardly surprising, to see again how contact and consultation have prevented a panic reaction to change. It seems that farmers have been constructive and, while change is always a challenge, it has been very reassuring to see that they are willing to adapt and see the opportunities not the downsides.</P>
    <P>The Minister received some 200 submissions on foot of his process of consultation, and he also commissioned an independent report by FAPRI-Ireland. Overall, there seems to be no doubt that the vast majority of farmers were in favour of full decoupling. In the wake of the consultation and research, the Minister has opted for full decoupling and we can all agree that, on the basis of the evidence in front of us, this was the correct decision to make. Furthermore, given the claims of sell-out last June, I was glad to see the Fine Gael Party welcoming the announcement of the Minister on pushing ahead with full decoupling.</P>
    <P>Full decoupling is obviously a radical change in the manner Irish agriculture and Irish farmers are supported under the CAP. It will bring the reality of the market home to us all. However, it must be emphasised that the changes also present an opportunity and a renewed sense of focus on the marketplace and providing what the customer wants will be essential in making the most of these opportunities.</P>
    <P>Full decoupling of direct EU payments to farmers from production will greatly benefit the majority of farmers. By opting for this approach we can expect a rise in aggregate income of 10% before 2012. The option of partial decoupling sought by commercial producers and processors would have allowed for an increase in income of just 4%. The worst policy option would have been to stand still because farmers' income would have fallen. I congratulate the Minister, the Ministers of State and all the officials of the Department on another job well done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak in this important debate and I welcome the Minister back to the House. I was disappointed by some of the off-the-cuff remarks about the Minister's predecessors made by a number of Fianna Fáil Party speakers. As Senators from all sides of the House have stated in various debates on agriculture during the past 12 months to two years, since our entry into the European Economic Community in 1973, stretching back to the first Minister for Agriculture to negotiate at EEC level, the late Mark Clinton, our farmers and agricultural sector have been superbly represented in Brussels and every Minister for Agriculture has obtained every possible pound, shilling and penny from Community funds. The current Minister, too, has always done his best, including in the current reform project. It is petty to accuse previous Ministers of failing to do certain things. Agriculture, alone among the <Col N="839" />various sectors of industry, has been superbly well served during the past 30 years in Brussels.</P>
      <P>This debate should be the first phase of a wider debate on the future of agriculture and farming. The question we need to pose is whether agriculture is an industry or a way of life. When one talks about agriculture being a way of life, one can be accused of being a hopeless romantic in that one is talking about what has been and gone. Things can never be the same as they were 40 or 50 years ago. If we continue to choose to regard agriculture as no more than an industry and no longer a way of life in rural areas, we will, unfortunately, arrive at a position in which our townlands will have a single farmer instead of being home to a number of farmers.</P>
      <P>Although we are debating the detail of the European Union proposals and trying to set in stone a policy which will attract money to agriculture in the coming years, we will also need to debate the future of farming. We have not had an in-depth debate on agriculture for almost a generation. Politicians, particularly those who represent rural constituencies, must ask how many farmers we want to have in ten to 20 years. We must set a figure and try to gear our domestic agricultural policies towards ensuring that this number of farming families can be sustained in our rural areas. While I accept this will be a major challenge for the Minister and his officials, it must be done. Unless we can set out a route map, the trends of the past 20 years will continue with the number of farming families continuing to decline sharply until we are left with one farmer, rather than several farmers, in each townland, which would be a sad development.</P>
      <P>One of the interesting aspects of the debate on decoupling was that our farmers were well ahead of the farming organisations and, I concede, the politicians. We wondered how the ball would roll and what way we should hop, whereas farmers quickly made up their minds. From day one, the vast bulk of farmers with whom I spoke favoured any change that would eliminate bureaucracy and red tape and try to simplify a complicated system. It was surprising that it took some of the farming organisations some time to catch up. We are, I hope, now singing from the same hymn sheet and the general policies contained in the Minister's proposals are broadly welcomed.</P>
      <P>A number of fundamental questions still need to be answered. The Minister informed the House that Senators' clinics will be slack on Saturdays from now on. During the next 12 months, however, we will receive a large number of queries from farmers who are retiring or who have leased their land, all of which will need to be answered. The booklet we received from the Department two or three weeks ago was helpful and while I accept that it is not yet in a position to answer all questions because they have not been answered in Brussels, I look forward to the loose ends being tied up in order that we will be able to provide specific answers to specific queries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" />As with all negotiations some people will probably draw the short straw. We must try to make provision for those who through various circumstances are set to become the biggest losers from this process. I trust we will return to this issue in future debates and hope these questions will be answered in the near future.</P>
    <P>I also hope the national debate I have called for will act as a counter-balance to the negativity in the debate on agriculture in recent years, to which Senator Callanan referred. We express surprise about the large number of young people drifting away from agriculture and regret that so few people proclaim farming as their chosen profession. Why should we be surprised? If every doctor were to tell his or her sons or daughters that medicine had no future, nobody would do medicine in Cork or Dublin. If every carpenter told his or her sons or daughters the trade was a disastrous way of life, who would want to become a carpenter? If every computer scientist put out the word that there was no future in computers, companies would not expect recruits. For too long, the debate on agriculture has focused on saying there is no future in the sector. We should not be surprised that young people have not flocked to the farming fold. We must try to be positive about the sector and paint a clear and optimistic route map for it. If we do not succeed in attracting young people to return to farming while, at the same time, retaining others in the sector, it will be a great failure on our part.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan also referred to land policy, which also needs to be debated extensively. As with all of these issues, it will be controversial because the question of land use and policy has been contentious, harking back to the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s when there was a socialist tinge to the issue and eastern Europe countries conducted failed experiments in this area. If we want to indicate to farmers that we are serious about keeping them in farming and retaining their sons and daughters in the sector, we have to show there is a way ahead.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan stated that land policy should take energy policy into account, which is somewhat similar to previous debates in which it was suggested that people get involved in deer farming and other alternative farming methods. Many people got in at the deep end and we suddenly realised it was not sustainable to have 50,000 people involved in deer farming or producing wind energy, alternative crops and so forth. Nevertheless, the market has room for alternative energy crops, wind farming and so forth. While these are not a complete solution, they form part of the overall jigsaw of solutions and should be examined in greater detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned further aids for young farmers, all of which I welcome. Will he outline the position on installation aid grants, which the Houses have debated on a number of occasions? Is it correct that we still do not pay the maximum level of grant available under EU regulations? If that is the case, we must ensure that maximum <Col N="841" />installation aid grants are paid at the earliest stage possible. Reference was made to REPS payments by other contributors. The rural environment protection scheme has a major role to play both economically and environmentally. Perhaps the Minister would let us know if he has plans for the scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome this as a first step in building a degree of certainty about the future of agriculture. This lays down the parameters and the ground rules but, from a policy perspective, the Oireachtas needs to decide how Irish agriculture should develop and how many people should remain in agriculture. If we set targets, they can be achieved but they will require courageous and often controversial decisions. The alternative is to let the big farmers become bigger and the small farmers disappear. That is already happening and rural Ireland is beginning to pay an enormous social cost for our neglect in that regard. I look forward to a vigorous debate on how to reverse the tide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon" hpid="Mr. Scanlon Mr. Scanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's positive speech. It is now over four months since the conclusion of the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy. This time has afforded us an opportunity to reflect and deliberate on what is best for Irish farmers and, indeed, Irish consumers. It is obvious that not only will the reforms work to the financial advantage of most Irish farmers but consumers can expect to be supplied with produce of superior quality. In addition, the CAP reforms will have a beneficial environmental impact in terms of lower levels of air and water pollution.</P>
      <P>The process has yet again shown that we have an adept and reassuring Minister for Agriculture and Food. He is one of the longest serving Ministers in Europe and one of the most experienced. We were fortunate to have a Minister of his calibre on this occasion. In the course of the review he behaved in a calm and collected fashion, refused to indulge in alarms and secured important concessions from the original proposals tabled by Commissioner Fischler. The farming organisations, as Senator Bradford pointed out, did not know which way to jump but the Minister had a decision to make. He made that decision and I believe Irish farmers, recognising the work the Minister did, are happy with his decision. The Minister also faced up to the concerns expressed by those who were most anxious about the prospect of reform. He and his Department have sought to explain the changes in a reasonable and reassuring manner.</P>
      <P>At all times, the Minister has stressed that while change will be challenging, there will be benefits. The prognosis for Irish agriculture is positive but only if we learn to adapt to change. As in any other area of life, we must remain open to new opportunities as they arise. The Commissioner, Franz Fischler, played his part in briefing Irish farmers by meeting 1,000 of them at a function organised by the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" />The case for full decoupling is clear. It will allow the country maintain the existing level of financial support for agriculture, regardless of farm output level. With regard to the important cattle sector, it is understood that cattle exported live to other EU countries will be entitled to the slaughter premium in those member states which have chosen partial decoupling. This is most welcome and will provide a shot in the arm for the live export trade. It should dispel any anxiety and apprehension that may exist among farmers about opting for full decoupling. With full decoupling, farmers keep the value of slaughter premia in their decoupled single farm payment while, at the same time, cattle exported live can collect a coupled slaughter premium. With full decoupling, all payments, including the slaughter premium, will be used to calculate the single farm payment.</P>
    <P>Not everybody will benefit of course. The larger commercial producers of beef will suffer some setbacks. There is no doubt the numbers of cattle and sheep will fall. However, the analysis and research undertaken by Teagasc has demonstrated that the great majority of farmers will benefit from full decoupling of farm production from direct payments. It is likely that aggregate income will increase by 10% before 2012. The alternative option of partial decoupling that many commercial producers and processors wanted would only provide for a 4% increase in income. A no change approach was unrealistic as an option because it would see farm incomes fall by 9% in the long run.</P>
    <P>A critical factor in the future of Irish agriculture is going to be the attention producers pay to the demands of the consumer. As the Minister said in a recent newspaper interview: &ldquo;the decoupling of support from production will help create a market environment which will be more orientated towards consumers' needs and should allow clear market signals on pricing and quality issues&rdquo;. Decoupling could prove to be a liberating experience for farmers as it may well enable them to diversify and participate in opportunities that might offer the best margins from production.</P>
    <P>Our top dairy, beef, sheep and tillage farmers are among the finest in Europe and the world. We now have the chance to adapt production systems to real need rather than premia payments. This redirection of farmers' efforts will have a positive impact on quality and will help food processors in developing and supplying quality markets. We also should not forget the positive impact on the environment that full decoupling will bring about by reducing the negative contribution to greenhouse gas emissions by agriculture.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister has made his decision we must look to the future with a renewed sense of optimism. It is good that the Minister has opted to make the change as early as possible. To use a term often used by another Cabinet Minister, the sooner we adapt to the &ldquo;new reality&rdquo;, the better. The Government was explicit through<Col N="843" />out the summer that whatever decision was made, we would not have to wait until 2007 to implement it. We can now go forward knowing this Government has listened to the industry, taken opinions on board and made it decision accordingly. The majority of farmers favour the option taken by the Minister. The positive and constructive attitude exhibited by farmers and the industry means we can go forward with confidence.</P>
    <P>Earlier today, the committee on agriculture heard a presentation from Macra na Feirme. Members of Macra na Feirme are optimistic about the future of agriculture. They gave a fine presentation to the committee. I do not have time to deal with every issue they raised but a number of positive measures were proposed. One of them, which the Minister might examine, is the issue of rollover relief for young trained farmers who, as a result of compulsory purchase orders, have land taken from them for the provision of roads. Perhaps the Minister would allow them to benefit from rollover relief in such cases.</P>
    <P>Another request was that young trained farmers who qualify for entitlements would have their entitlements spread over their existing holding rather than force them out into the market to buy more land. Other issues were raised but I am sure they, too, will be brought to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope much of the bureaucracy will be taken out of farming. As we speak, there are tribunals taking place in various parts of the country where farmers are brought before a court of officials to account for why an animal died and the reason they were unable to replace it. Farmers are losing up to 16% of their benefits as a result of non-replacement of an animal that dies.</P>
      <P>Only last week I was made aware of a case where an animal died last July. The herdowner was a small farmer and he was told there would be a reduction in his payment as he would lose rights on two animals in his herd. I know the man well. He has many commitments and he has a young family he is trying to send to school. He told them honestly that the animal died and that he could not afford to replace it. However, he was not allowed to claim a premium. Is that fair in farming circles or in society? Perhaps the Minister could consider such cases in any review which takes place. Perhaps he would consider having a discussion with some of the inspectors about being more lenient in cases where accidents have occurred. Anything can happen to a farmer's animal and it may not be possible to replace it at that time because of cost factors, etc. I ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What will the full decoupling of agricultural payments, due to be introduced from 2005, mean to Irish farmers? Weeks after its announcement by the Minister, most farmers can only guess what it will mean to them. This issue must be clarified. The big question for every farmer is whether the <Col N="844" />introduction of decoupling will signal the end of their farming careers or an enhancement of their current position. Full decoupling of all EU farm payments is undoubtedly the best policy option for our agricultural industry. The analysis by the economists who have completed research points to the fact that the highest level of farm incomes will be achieved by full decoupling or the complete removal of the links between farm production and payments. We are promised a considerable aggregate increase in incomes by 2012 compared to the income level under current policies.</P>
    <P>Nothing stands still, therefore, change is important. There is an old saying that nothing is permanent, except change. Change must take place. Perhaps the Minister could explain in detail the proposed changes which will take place in the agricultural trade policies under the World Trade Organisation. I understand there will be a shift of emphasis in the policies. I hope the market floodgates are not opened. It is important to get clarification in that regard.</P>
    <P>From January 2005 the link between EU subsidy payments and production will be broken. Farmers will receive annual payments based on the amount of subsidies claimed in the 2000 to 2002 reference period. Consideration should be given to people who had outbreaks of TB or brucellosis during that period and to those who were affected by a catastrophe outside their control. To qualify for his or her full payments, which will be payable in December of each year, the farmer must manage the same area as that farmed during the reference years. Perhaps the Minister could clarify if that must be exactly the same area or if it can be a reduced area. If a group wants to use some land for recreational purposes, a farmer should be allowed to let it without affecting his or her payments. That should be considered, particularly if we want to become more environmentally friendly. Given that payments depend on whether a farmer collected payments during the reference years, some farmers will lose out heavily and some will be short-changed by such a blanket agreement.</P>
    <P>Sheep and beef quotas will disappear which will allow a farmer to enter or expand these enterprises without the current entry costs. Phrases, such as slaughter premiums, special beef premiums, retention period and suckler cow and sheep quotas, should disappear from farming vocabulary for good. While full decoupling of all beef payments from production is the best option for incomes, we will probably see a reduction of almost 20% in suckler cows, which will lead to a reduction of approximately 8% in the amount of beef production. However, price increases of approximately 10% and reduced farm costs will result in the least income prospects.</P>
    <P>The new arrangement for dairy farmers will result in a huge decline in the number of dairy farmers from the current figure of 27,000 to under 18,000 by 2012, with an average quota of approximately 65,000 gallons. Early decoupling gives <Col N="845" />dairy farmers the option to get out of milk, while retaining their payments. The farmers to whom I have spoken want the Minister to clarify that point. Beef producers will be better off as a result of full decoupling, while the big losers will be the factory or commercial farmers. There are not many such farmers because we are a country of small farmers compared to other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>The number of sheep will decline by approximately 20% of current numbers. However, the experts say this decline will be offset by increased prices, which will lead to a slight increase in the value of sheep output by 2012. When we joined the EU, we were told that anyone who became involved in the sheep industry would not do well. However, sheep have given farmers considerable profits over the years and that must be recognised.</P>
    <P>Ireland has become the first EU state to completely break the tie between farm production and EU payments, which brings to an end 30 years of subsidy driven farming. It is imperative that hearsay and rumour do not play a part in the transition and that every possible means at the Minister's disposal are used to keep farmers fully informed of their rights and entitlements over the next two years so that an easy transition can be made. I hope that booklets are available in the near future. Senator Bradford referred to the one which was published in September. Farmers must be kept fully informed of any decisions made about full decoupling. I welcome the support available to young farmers and I hope there will be less bureaucracy in the administration of the scheme for young farmers than was previously the case.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome the successful model execution of a reform, namely, that one studies the question carefully with experts, but one also brings in the interest groups and tries to reach a maximum consensus on the solution. As far as I can judge, most farmers and other interests are either happy with the decision or at least accept it. There are other ways to bring about political reform. There is the crusader approach where the forces of light are on one side and the forces of darkness are on the other. A third approach is what I might call the harlequin approach where one takes on all comers from all sides. However, I prefer the Minister's approach, which, from my experience, is also the Taoiseach's approach.</P>
      <P>The elimination of much of the paperwork will be welcomed by farmers. I have come across cases where people have lost large sums of money through minor oversights or technical errors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" />It will also mean the redeployment of quite a number of civil servants. No doubt they will be anxious in due course to hear what they will be doing next. There will also be a greater element of commerciality. People will be able to judge what work they will do not only on the basis of subsidies. Also, if prices rise farmers will receive a better return.</P>
    <P>It is important that certain minimum standards are maintained. If farmers are in the REP scheme that is taken care of, but we do not want to see a deserted countryside and it is important to the community that farming be maintained. In any case, 2012 and 2013 will eventually come and people will need a base from which to go forward.</P>
    <P>As I said in the debate here last week, I disagree with the view of the ESRI that investment in farming should be scaled down. If we are to maintain a certain level of production we need ongoing investment. The reduction in sheep numbers will be an environmentally friendly development because there was overstocking a few years ago. I am pleased that forestry will be re-integrated into the Department of Agriculture and Food from next year. This will result in a much better synergy and perhaps progress will be smoother.</P>
    <P>I have found that after a good year, especially from the point of view of weather, there is much optimism among farmers and people begin to think about their plans for the future. The Minister should explore the ideas put forward by Senator Callanan about a possible role in energy development. Active consideration of REPS is also going on. I welcomed Senator McCarthy's opinion that as the Minister and his advisers are negotiating to the best of their abilities in Brussels, people should pull behind them rather than criticise them.</P>
    <P>During a trip to the Middle East recently, I visited Jordan and Palestine, which are mostly very barren. I saw a few flocks of sheep and goats but wondered on what they fed. It reminded me forcibly how fortunate we are in this country to have an ideal climate for agriculture and how important it is that the sector continues to be a major part of national life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister who mentioned that agreement had been reached by the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 26 June last. Reading some of the newspapers at that time I noticed that the Minister was being severely criticised by the farm bodies. An article from July states that farm bodies are turning on the Minister over reform. It was interesting to hear the IFA opinion that a very bad deal was on offer. The ICMSA said the Minister should be criticised for his failure to defend Irish farming interests. The Minister showed that he is a capable negotiator, but one of the best things he did was to hold information meetings throughout the country. I attended one with my colleague, the Mini<Col N="847" />ster of State, Deputy Treacy, in Loughrea and there was a great welcome for full decoupling. The only issues raised that evening were the farm retirement scheme, which has been mentioned, and the question of young farmers and quota. I hope those issues will be considered, especially from the point of view of the national reserve.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Department have made it clear all along &ndash; they said this as far back as July &ndash; that 100% production was still needed, even with partial decoupling of subsidies. There was no way people wanted partial decoupling; they wanted to go down this road and the Minister has responded to this. However, he has also shown us the great benefits involved in achieving this Agenda 2000 agreement, such as the great flexibility mentioned by Senator Callanan and the lack of bureaucracy. Getting rid of paperwork will be a welcome development among farmers, who are well ahead of us and the farming organisations in their thinking about the future. The Minister mentioned the savings of &euro;464 million that will be made through changes in the degression and modulation proposals, which are to be welcomed, along with the removal of the proposed reduction of up to 13% in direct payments to meet future financing needs. The proposed rate of modulation has also been reduced from 6% to 5%, with a return to Ireland of &euro;34 million of the &euro;40 million modulated.</P>
      <P>As a Senator from a rural area I feel the objective of retaining modulated funds within Ireland for rural development measures is important. This has largely been achieved by the Minister. It is important that young farmers receive the benefit of this. Environmental measures should also be introduced because these issues are important in rural areas. For example, the issue of good water supplies and sewerage schemes in our villages and towns must be considered. If we must obtain help through this measure I would like to see it put in place. It is important to consider what we can do for young farmers and those who may feel they are caught by the farm retirement scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Joe Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank every Member who contributed to this debate. The Seanad is an ideal forum for discussing an issue such as this because there is no great emotion and people speak sincerely about their concerns. Debate such as this is helpful to me as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the issues raised are of vital importance to people in the future. Concerns were expressed about farmers whose herds suffered because of animal disease during the reference years 2000 to 2002 and farmers whose families had undergone difficulties in that time. Those people will be regarded as <i>force majeure</i> cases. We had an example of this during the foot and mouth crisis of 2001 when some herds were entirely wiped out. <Col N="848" />These people are obviously entitled to full credit. They will be the first people to be credited &ndash; their quota will be given out first, followed by the 3% reserve, and the remainder will be divided out in quota entitlements to individual farmers. The type of cases regarded as <i>force majeure</i> cases are those in which the death or long-term illness of a farmer, a natural disaster, the destruction of buildings by lightning or similar, or animal disease such as BSE, brucellosis or TB, occurred during the reference years. The farmers in these cases are certainly entitled to full credit.</P>
    <P>Another category about which people were concerned was farmers who suffered penalties because of a mundane error or minor miscalculation of some kind. I did negotiate this. Those penalties will not be taken into account in forming the entitlement for farmers; they will receive their full entitlements. There are also new entrants to farming. These will be a priority category in obtaining quotas from the national reserve. This is right because in order to have to have a younger generation of farmers we must give them hope and offer them a chance of succeeding by giving them a decent quota. Younger farmers with inadequate quota are entitled to make a case for additional quota from the national reserve. I am pleased the Commission gave us some leeway in this regard.</P>
    <P>We also have farmers who for one reason or another did not measure up to the entitlement. In some cases, farmers got into farming in one or two years and they have a more equitable distribution of their entitlements. As a number of Senators said, next year will be busy because the Department will have to make out entitlements for each individual farmer. There will be a percentage of farmers who will be aggrieved or dissatisfied with their entitlement and we will do our best to ensure equity prevails. To be as fair as possible, I intend to set up an appeal system to allow people make an oral presentation before an appeals board, with their adviser or advisers, and get the fairest return possible. In making out the entitlements, establishing the appeal system and keeping up the payments, next year will be extraordinarily difficult and busy for the Department. As Senator Bradford said, the clinics probably will be fairly busy as well because individual farmers will want to get as good a deal as possible.</P>
    <P>Full decoupling has been acceptable to individual farmers and farming organisations mainly because it takes the bureaucracy out of farming and allows farmers to get on with the business of farming &ndash; I believe farmers will surprise us all by doing a great job in that regard. We are talking about farming for the marketplace and it has been clearly shown at some of the information meetings referred to that the single farm payment is not the best deal for farmers. The best deal is to have the cushion of the single farm payment, engage in good professional farming, perhaps reduce one's stock a little, cull the inferior stock, <Col N="849" />maintain better quality and operate a more efficient farming system. Teagasc people, particularly at the information meetings, showed that farmers can increase their income substantially by doing that.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is that it will stand us in good stead in the rejuvenated World Trade Organisation talks referred to earlier. Unfortunately, as Members will be aware, those talks broke down at the Cancun conference, but in the fullness of time they will be put back on the rails. The fact that we have decoupled means that payments to farmers are no longer coupled production. They are no longer regarded as aids to production. They will go from the blue box into the green box and they will be free from challenge in the WTO talks. That is important for the future and it will be a source of consideration for farmers because they will know where they will stand for the next ten years or so.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh made the good point that we have the benefit of consensus Government and this is a classic example of negotiation and consultation and information made available to farmers. The social partners were asked to submit their views, which they did, and based on all of that collective information, we made the right decision. I appreciate that the political system also showed a good deal of consensus in reaching the decision.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan raised the issue of land use and an energy policy and referred in particular to the possibilities for alternative energy use. I strongly support such moves. A co-operative in Bandon, in west Cork, is to the forefront in developing alternative energy uses, particularly green energy sources. There is a great opportunity for that and there will be a further opportunity with the natural resource of forestry coming within the remit of the Department of Agriculture and Food because that is an ideal land use activity. I would like to think I would be able to inject some dynamism into that area of activity because with decoupling and further land becoming available for use as a forestry resource, and the combination of forestry and the rural environment protection scheme, a synergy exists of which we can make good use over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their positive and unbiased contributions to the debate. I will take the various points made into account and if anybody wants a copy of the Department's information booklet, we will make it available. We will have to await the final detailed text, which will not be available for the next eight or nine weeks, before we can definitively publish an information booklet, but in terms of making the information available up to date, we can do that. The idea of making the decision now and making the information available was to let farmers and the industry know in good time the outlook for the future, <Col N="850" />thereby allowing them to make their decisions and get away from the confusion or lack of information available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), line 14, after &ldquo;funds&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of which a minimum of two-thirds is dedicated for the community media sector.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I spoke about the importance of community radio and the need to develop it. I also referred to the start-up costs involved in many cases. If we are to develop community bases, whether it is in radio or television, on a national basis, they will be stillborn unless some financial subvention is given to them.</P>
      <P>When the Forum on Broadcasting discussed this area, the Minister spoke in favour of the development of community radio and television. That is important. Also, concern was expressed by RTE at the forum about the fact that 5% of the licence fee was being targeted at development. It indicated that its concern was that much of the funding would go to commercial entities, many of which are based outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this amendment I hope that at least two thirds of the funding could be allocated towards the development of community radio and television. It is also important to bear in mind that there are certain impediments in the community area. For example, independent radio can advertise for ten minutes but local or community radio is limited to six minutes and the overall contribution from commercial activity must only be 50%. As a result, local community radio and television may have to depend on raffles, sponsorships, cake sales and a plethora of activity for support. We will have to recognise there is considerable expenditure involved in community radio which I will illustrate by way of one simple <Col N="851" />example. West Limerick Community Radio is on air on a pilot basis. It has submitted an application, which is being assessed by officials, to operate on a long-term basis. It will cover a large geographical area in west Limerick and, based on its success to date, will appeal to local activities. There will, however, be considerable start-up costs. In addition, there will be associated costs because not everybody will work on a voluntary basis and people will be needed at the top to deal with commercial activities. If we are serious about getting this off the ground, it should be possible to earmark two thirds of overall funding for community radio and television.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that Dóchas is an umbrella organisation for approximately 33 non-governmental organisations. Those NGOs have put Ireland on the map and have helped to establish Ireland's position in the international marketplace. I propose to table an amendment on Report Stage to section 2 on new television and radio programmes to foster understanding of the global dimensions of Irish society. I hope the Minister will seriously consider the amendment.</P>
    <P>I refer to the Minister's objective, as stated at the broadcasting forum, of developing community and radio television and ensuring it survives and prospers in rural areas. Funding of &euro;8 million will be provided each year. The funding will be controlled and submissions will have to be made initially to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland before it can be drawn down by community radio or television. If we are to seriously encourage community radio and television, rather than paying lip-service to the ideal, commercial stimulus will be required if we are to get it off the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the points made by Senator Finucane. My amendment No. 5 proposes that a specified percentage of funding be allocated to community broadcasters. It is a pity the Bill does not go further in this regard. We made this point extensively on Second Stage. It has come up in the discussions between certain groups and the Minister's officials. The Bill is deficient in this regard.</P>
      <P>Community media is a separate strand of media and has its own dynamic. One of the problems it faces concerns start up. Unlike commercial stations, it does not have a licence fee or investment so it needs help to get off the ground. This fund would have been an ideal vehicle to generate at least some of the start up costs associated with the establishment of a community radio or television station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment I have tabled proposes that a specified percentage of funding be allocated. The specified percentage could be left to the Minister in terms of the regulations and so on but it would, most importantly, provide for a ring-fenced <Col N="852" />amount of money for community media in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Senator Finucane pointed out, we have been lobbied by some groups of which I am sure the Minister is aware, including Dublin Community Television and Community Media Network Ireland. They made the point that there is a need for start up funding or operating costs so that producers of community media can get up and running and continue to operate. It would also be an important recognition of the separate function of community media. At a time of globalisation and growing concern about its effects, particularly in the media, it would be a small step forward in protecting the notion of community which we have always held dear and to which we have, to some extent, paid lip-service, particularly in recent times. This is an opportunity to move beyond that and to reflect it in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The use of media is important. The Minister agrees that the use of media is important and this is generally reflected in his legislation. Media is hugely important in preserving our culture and in reflecting and preserving our heritage in the modern era. Community media is a distinct strand of that and this legislation would be the ideal vehicle through which to open a fund to provide the necessary investment to give community media the kick start it needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points Senator Finucane and Senator O'Meara made and I will not repeat them. However, when speaking about community media, Senator Finucane seemed to cover rural areas. I want to make sure we are not limiting this to rural areas. I also spoke to the Dublin community television people and they made a strong case that the difference between local and community should be distinguished. I made this point on Second Stage and I am not sure what the ideal solution is but it is something the Minister might take into account. There is a need to proceed exactly as has been proposed for which a case has been strongly made.</P>
      <P>I refer to my amendment No. 4<i>b</i>. I also raised this issue on Second Stage. One of the things that is not spelled out in this legislation is the exact basis of the funding for the programme to be supported. It is easy to overlook the fact that a broadcaster incurs two types of costs in creating public service broadcasting. The first is the cost of making the programme which is easily understood. However, that is not the end of the matter. In arriving at the total cost to the broadcaster, one must note that the broadcaster must also take into account income foregone by broadcasting that programme rather than a more popular one which would attract a much wider audience and would, therefore, raise far more in advertising revenue. There is a difference. It is easy to understand but is not an easy case to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two costs and that is particularly an issue as the Bill specifically provides that pro<Col N="853" />grammes funded be broadcast at peak viewing or listening times. I approve of that proviso because it would be possible to cheat, that is, to produce a programme and broadcast it at the same time as &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; when we are all asleep, or should be. By insisting such programmes are broadcast at peak times, a cost is being imposed on the broadcaster. The cost being imposed is the cost of advertising revenue forgone. If broadcasters are not compensated for that cost, the incentive to compete for the funding will be greatly reduced. It may even be removed altogether in that there may not be competition for it. Under this scheme, we are paying to make things happen which would not otherwise happen. We must ensure we pay enough because if we do not, progress will not be made. The reality is that commercial broadcasters will outsource the costs and production of the programmes. What we have to remember is that after they pay the production company for its work, there has to be something left over for the commercial broadcaster to make it worth its while to give up valuable airtime to put the programme out in the first place. It is vital that in drawing up the scheme the BCI allows for this particular factor. If it does not, we will find that all the money will end up going to RTE. It will be the only one tendering and looking for the money.</P>
    <P>The amendment is necessary to make it clear to the BCI, beyond any possible doubt, that when it funds programmes, it is legally empowered, if it so chooses and to whatever extent it considers appropriate, to recompense a broadcaster for the advertising income that has been foregone by the broadcasting of the programme at peak times. I am not insisting that it does it every time, but it must be legally empowered to do it. I would like competition in this area, but I am a little worried that there might not be competition as we might be making the restrictions too tight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their amendments. They obviously have been thinking intensely about this issue. Even before they tabled the amendments, we in the Department were looking at the possibility of including such provisions in the legislation. When drafting legislation, it is important to allow some flexibility. However, while I understand the spirit in which the amendments were tabled, I cannot accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The detail of the funding, including grant rates, the calculation of eligible costs and the allocation of funds among various categories, is best left to when the detail of the scheme is being drawn up. If one was to ring-fence amounts for specific categories of broadcasters or programmes, this <Col N="854" />could, in effect, lead to an inefficient use of the fund. As I said earlier, I considered this approach but decided against it. The objective of the fund is to encourage the provision of additional high-quality programming for the licence fee paying public. While the broadcasters will benefit from it, we have to remember that the fund is for the audience, the public, and not for the broadcasters. It is not there to aid, or in some way kick-start, broadcasters, but to provide additional high quality public service broadcasts in certain sectors to the public.</P>
    <P>We should not attempt to anticipate in the legislation from where the best programme proposals will come. This is likely to be a developing phenomenon. If the legislation fixed amounts for specific categories, this would be likely to lead to a negative impact on the possibility that broadcasters and independent producers would bring forward innovative proposals.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifically provides that the broadcasting commission will have the power to decide that in any year the fund should be directed at particular classes of programmes or at programmes broadcast on a particular medium. This would allow for funds to be specifically directed at community broadcasters, as is the intention of two of the amendments, and national broadcasters.</P>
    <P>The issue of what costs will be considered eligible in the context of applications and grant approvals again is one of the detailed matters that should be considered in the drawing up of the scheme. The intention is that the Bill will provide the framework, but allow the necessary flexibility for the scheme to be developed, operate effectively and amended as necessary over time. If we wanted to amend it or put in specific provisions, we would have to come back to the Oireachtas every time rather than leaving issues, such as specific percentages, to the detail of schemes. I do not anticipate that within the scheme there will be specific percentages because sectionalising it may prevent the type of phenomenon we are trying to create.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the scheme will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and if the Dáil or Seanad wished to debate it, it would be a matter for that time. I suggest to the Senators that it is best left in more general terms in the legislation and that we address the specifics when the scheme is being drawn up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's point about ring-fencing a certain portion of the fund. Regarding Senator Quinn's point, I was giving a rural example as I come from a rural location which makes me cognisant of the rural scene. I have also been lobbied on the urban scene. Regardless of whether community radio or television is urban or rural, I want to ensure it gets off the ground and survives financially. It was in <Col N="855" />that spirit that I tabled the amendment, suggesting that a certain amount should be ring-fenced.</P>
      <P>What concerns me is that if we leave it until the scheme is in place, we will have very little input after it is passed by the Dáil and Seanad. The Minister is asking us to accept something with a great sense of vagueness. I ask the Minister to state specifically that in the case of this funding he will be favourably disposed towards the community radio and television concept.</P>
      <P>In the report of the Forum on Broadcasting, which I read at length, and also the Minister's commitment to it, I became aware that a senior person in the Minister's Department did not want this 5% development in the first place, which is worth bearing in mind. It is also worth bearing in mind that RTE did not want 5% of the overall licence fee diverted to this particular mechanism. If the senior official had reservations about the 5% input under the Bill and if the advice given to the Minister today has come from the same source, I am entitled to be very doubtful about the position of community radio and television under the Bill. There is no point having a broadcasting forum and discussing the themes of culture, heritage, historical issues and buildings we want to encompass if they are sidelined. In terms of local input, we have all experienced that the best contributions are often made on local community radio.</P>
      <P>Independent radio stations have a track record of survival, shown by the large fees that have been paid for them. Many of those commercial radio stations exist on the basis of commerce and making a profit. If they make a generous profit and have a licence for a period of time, they are ripe for take overs. In that situation, the people involved originally &ndash; one might say good luck to them for taking a chance &ndash; will go off with millions of euros of profit.</P>
      <P>The spirit and intent is for a certain percentage of current affairs and news, but the main theme of many of these commercial radio stations is programming for the 20 to 35 age bracket. The music played is chosen with that in mind. The themes of the Bill, in terms of spirit and intent, can best be achieved by the community type of radio, whether it is local or urban. While I understand that the Minister cannot ring-fence two thirds of the funding, I would like reassurance that despite the concerns expressed by RTE and his senior official, the Minister is serious about his intention, when matters are finalised, to proceed with the development of community radio and television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister paying lip service at the broadcasting forum only for the whole idea to be stillborn because of a lack of support. They need a certain level of support as they cannot exist on a wing and a prayer in regard to the type of start-up and operational expenditure involved. They are not looking for the State to <Col N="856" />bail them out completely as many of the people who participate tend to do so on a voluntary basis, but they achieve an objective within the community. The themes outlined by the Minister can be achieved in many cases by community radio and television. Before I press this further I would like firm assurances that the Minister and his officials are committed to the concept of community radio and television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a generalised approach. While such an approach might be designed to mean everything, it usually means very little. Unless something is stated specifically in legislation, there is no guarantee that it will happen. In fact, there is every likelihood that it will not happen. We have enough experience to know this is the case. Therefore, I am disappointed with the Minister's response and more convinced than ever that the amendments are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must declare interests. On the one hand I receive some of my income from the national State broadcaster. On the other, those who bothered to read my declaration of interests will know that I also have a small equity holding in a Dublin-based commercial radio station. I am between two stools on this issue, having an interest in both aspects of it. However, public service broadcasting is a totally different concept from commercial broadcasting.</P>
      <P>I rarely, if ever, disagree with my friend and colleague, Senator Quinn. His amendment seems to presuppose that commercial broadcasting stations, despite this scheme, would not provide radio and television programmes that people would listen to or watch at peak times. This seems to be the premise on which he bases his argument. If that is the case I point to the outstanding success of RTE, as the national State broadcaster, in developing its programmes for the widest possible diversity of views. The TAM ratings for any week show that the overwhelming majority of the top ten most successful programmes are home produced. They are programmes that in other countries, even on state broadcasting networks, would not be prepared, costed and implemented.</P>
      <P>This country has a unique tradition in this regard. We seem to want to watch programmes about ourselves. My criticism is that we are not developing enough programmes which reflect our culture and the real Ireland. This is where I hope the Minister's scheme will come into play. Senator Ryan has tabled amendments which relate to cultural diversity and which we will discuss later. There appears to be an overwhelming appetite for programmes that reflect and portray us as we are. This has been proven statistically in the decades since the introduction of television and before that in the early days of radio. Programmes of this nature which the State broadcaster has produced have always been successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" />Every speaker is correct that licences were granted to commercially based operators who then ran with them. The primary objective of commercial stations is to make money for their shareholders. We can argue about whether this is a good or bad thing and about whether it is moral or immoral, but business is business. I hope the station in which I am involved will continue to garner listeners because if it does I might have a chance of getting my initial investment back. It is looking extremely shaky at present, given the station's share of the audience in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Commercial broadcasters were then forced by the Government of the day to ensure that their programming would have a 5% current affairs content. That percentage of current affairs had to be presented in their peak time schedule and not shoved into the ghettos of the early morning or late night. Many of them railed against that requirement and continue to lobby to have it dropped, diluted, changed or in some way neutralised. The production of news costs money. It is a labour intensive operation. I have no doubt Senator O'Meara, through her sister's most distinguished career in public service broadcasting, can testify to the fact that news presentation is a labour intensive job. The 30 second clip which we see is preceded by, perhaps, a full day's work.</P>
    <P>Commercial operators do not want this 5% requirement and they jump through all sorts of hoops to convince the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland that they are complying with it. In some cases this is extremely difficult. A music based station&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. Far be it from me to argue with the Leas-Chathaoirleach but the point I am making relates to the 5% requirement and the manner in which it will be used once it is put into the mix. I am attempting to reflect the fact that there are two interests, the public service interest and the commercial interest, involved in this issue. RTE will be entitled to apply for this money for its programming.</P>
      <P>I would prefer the money ring-fenced for local and community broadcasting rather than for RTE. There is not a level playing field because radio has become so diverse. Deregulation has gone too far and soon there will be too many radio stations in the country. However, I accept Senator Finucane's point about community radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer if local commercial radio, where people have invested a great deal of their own money, would be given preference in this regard and that the emphasis would be placed on encouraging local radio operators to use the money to more accurately reflect the diversity of our culture, as stated in the Bill. We must understand from where we are starting. We have a unique broadcasting set up in Ireland and it is <Col N="858" />still evolving. I am interested to hear the Minister justify why he has framed the Bill in such a way. If I have a criticism of the Minister, it is his generality. I would like to hear more about his philosophy in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is no misunderstanding between me and Senator Mooney in this regard. My point was that I do not want this money to be used entirely by RTE. I was hoping that it would be used by community broadcasters. We must find a way to encourage communities to become involved. That is why I supported the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their comments.</P>
      <P>I do not share Senator Finucane's suspicion of public service officials. In all my dealings with the public service, as a Minister and otherwise, I have found the advice given to Ministers and Members of the Oireachtas and the work done for us to be nothing but professional. It is a public servant's job to advise, but it is the job of a Minister to decide. An official may lose an argument about what a Minister should do, but the public service &ndash; this is particularly true in the case Senator Finucane mentioned &ndash; will put into action the legislation that is passed by the Oireachtas. Senator Finucane need have no worries in that regard.</P>
      <P>I can understand why RTE was somewhat worried. This legislation represents a dramatic sea change. For the first time in the history of the State, a portion of the licence fee will not go specifically to RTE. The original intention was to ring-fence 5% for all broadcasters except RTE but on the advice of the Attorney General, that there was a strong possibility that this would fall foul of the state aid issue, it was decided that we would have to include RTE and allow the fund to operate on a level playing field.</P>
      <P>I was asked to be more specific about this issue. In response to Senator Quinn's proposal, Senator Mooney made the argument that I would make. Senator Quinn's proposal presupposes that this type of programming would lose audience share and, consequently, lose advertising revenue. I would like to think that it would do the opposite. People should not lose sight of what this legislation is trying to do, which is to give more emphasis to the diversity of our culture in specific areas. I am not saying anything that is against community or local radio and television; I am a great supporter of them. The genesis of this legislation is the need to assist broadcasters in providing additional high quality programmes in particular areas. The audience rather than the broadcasters will be the recipients of the benefits of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation must provide for an open, competitive market where all broadcasters are operating on a level playing field and can tender to the BCI for assistance. This method will allow <Col N="859" />the best type of programming to be produced. Where would one start and end with ring-fencing the fund for certain areas? A portion could be ring-fenced for television, while another portion could be ring-fenced for radio. Funds could be ring-fenced between public and independent broadcasters. Equally, there could be an insistence on a national, regional or community focus. We considered designating a specific part of this fund for Irish language programmes. Where does it end?</P>
    <P>The specific ring-fencing of funds ultimately would go against the whole idea of open competition and getting the best programmes for the available money. If we were to include this in legislation it would be difficult for us to change it or to dilute what we had previously done. It would be an easier process to amend this by regulations. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendments. However, I understand the spirit in which they were tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the Minister's sterling defence of the Civil Service. I said that if the Department's senior head of the broadcasting division had reservations about 5% of funding going towards the Bill and if RTE had similar reservations, one is inclined to be doubtful about the spirit and intent of this regarding community radio and television. The Minister elaborated on this in the same way as he did previously, but for me it is like buying a pig in a poke. I hoped for a new reassurance that, in the submissions to the BCI, community radio and television would get a sympathetic hearing from the commission. After all, RTE and commercial radio and television stations are starting with a tremendous advantage &ndash; a good financial position. I am talking about the concept of voluntary, non-profit-making enterprises and the restrictions and impediments that exist. For example, we are talking about ten minutes of advertising for a commercial radio station while a restriction of six minutes will be placed on a local community station. Community stations are restricted to raising 50% funding from commercial activities.</P>
      <P>I predict that if encouragement is not given to community radio and television stations in urban and rural areas, despite the greatest intent of communities, they will falter over time and the principle will be stillborn. There is a community radio station in Connemara serving a scattered population. While meaningful programmes on Irish culture or language could be produced by that station, unless the BCI looks seriously at helping it and providing financial assistance, stations such as this will falter and die.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Meara's amendment did not mention a specific amount of money to be ring-fenced for community radio and television. At this stage, I feel it incumbent on me to press the amendment. I have had many discussions with rural <Col N="860" />community radio stations and have heard their problems. I have been lobbied also by Dublin-based community television. I have received information from Dóchas on thematic issues and globalisation. I am almost tempted to insist on ring-fencing on the basis that I feel I am not giving these bodies anything back even by raising this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister can defend the officials and RTE. I read the forum report and I saw a spirit of hope that the whole community concept would be fostered and developed in this Bill. I am not 100% reassured. I believe that when it comes to submissions to the BCI, commercial entities will get a large percentage of the 5% fund of &euro;8 million. All I want is reassurance that the type of community radio and television we are trying to foster is given a fair chance and that there is a commitment from the BCI that it will seriously entertain proposals from this sector.</P>
    <P>So far, the Minister has not reassured me of this &ndash; he only criticised me a little as I appeared to be critical of the Civil Service. I only stated the facts as I see them and where reservations have been expressed to me. RTE's heart was not in it and neither was the heart of the Minister's senior official. Yet, the Minister won on what he wanted in the Forum on Broadcasting for community radio. Where is the Minister's serious intent after that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt Senator Finucane's sincerity. I do not speak for RTE but I am not at all surprised to hear him and the Minister refer to RTE's reluctance in this regard. RTE was in a serious financial crisis when this Bill was in gestation and when consultations were taking place in the public domain &ndash; we all followed them. RTE was up in arms when the Minister suggested he intended to divert &euro;8 million of his Department's budget under this Bill. Any organisation would be up in arms about it and I do not think there is any great conspiracy or secret about it. I do not see the political point of suggesting RTE was somewhat reluctant to accept it. If I was in charge of RTE, I would be reluctant to accept it. If I was working in RTE and relying exclusively on my income from that organisation I, too, would be concerned about the intention of the Minister, my political boss, to divert money from the place in which I worked. People working in RTE have families too. That is one side of the argument.</P>

    <P>I do not speak for the commercial sector but I rhetorically put the question of whether any Member of this House seriously believes that stations like FM104 or 98FM will seek money from the Minister or the BCI under this fund with the obligations inherent in applying for it? It is my view as a broadcaster, for what it is worth, that the overwhelming majority of applications will come from the very sector to which Senator Finucane and Senator O'Meara referred, the <Col N="861" />community and non-profit making sector. They will not come, in the main, from the commercial radio sector because that sector will see this as a further imposition on their schedules. Once they apply for and receive money from the BCI, they are legally obliged to meet the criteria under the fund. I do not see the commercial sector overwhelming the community or non-profit sector in this regard. I cannot see that happening; it is not a runner.</P>
    <P>The Senator should seriously consider this matter. It is a national disgrace that up to recently there was no diversity in broadcasting in this city. There was little alternative to RTE's public service concept. The vast majority of licences issued in this city have been, up to now, for music-driven radio programmes. Such licences have not been issued for any of the worthy, noble aspirations contained in this Bill. That is a disgrace. I say that as a broadcaster, a listener and as a politician without fear or favour. That situation should never have developed. There should have been much more diversity in the granting of licences in the greater Dublin area because it has deprived a huge volume of people of diversity in radio programming. The Minister should, perhaps, be complimented on introducing this initiative which might wake them up and increase listenership in the greater Dublin area. I am referring specifically to that sector. It must be remembered that two thirds of our population can access Dublin radio stations. That is not widely known. Anyone who travels the roads of Ireland knows one can pick up Dublin stations at least 70 to 80 miles away from the city.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the fears expressed in this amendment that somehow the community or non-profit making radio broadcasting sector will be further disenfranchised. That will not be the case. I am sure that when the Minister set about putting together this initiative in legislative form he was not intent on using it as a financial leg-up for the community radio sector. If that was so, the commercial sector would rightly be screaming blue murder about it. I am sure there is an EU directive which would prevent the Minister doing so.</P>
    <P>The &euro;8 million to be made available is a significant sum for the sort of community sector to which Senators referred. Their operating costs, as Senators know, are low. They operate, in the main, in the voluntary sector. Their main expenses are local transmission costs and limited production costs given the type of programming in which they are involved. I am firmly of the opinion that the very talented people operating in the community sector are the ones who will seek funding from the BCI.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Senator Finucane and others that there will be a level playing field and that local community radio and television stations will get due regard. Ultimately, it will be the qual<Col N="862" />ity of programmes that will determine whether they are successful. That is the way we envisaged this from the start. Senators must understand that this is part of an overall package relating to increases in licence fees. I felt there were areas of broadcasting that, with the best will in the world, much of our independent sector were not addressing because, as Senator Mooney said, they are driven by commercial costs. While they provide a public service in their local communities &ndash; most Senators from rural areas acknowledge that &ndash; the Government and I felt they needed to focus on specific areas such as heritage, cultural diversity and the Irish language. It is correct to say we are restricted in what we can target in these areas as they are subject to EU directives. We are working under directives in the area of culture in this respect to allow us produce this fund.</P>
      <P>The principle of the fund is not to provide a leg-up to any specific broadcaster. It is to provide additional high quality public service programming in certain sectors. It does not always follow that the more money a broadcaster has, the better the programme. Some of the most successful programmes have been produced on a shoestring. That is not merely a phenomenon in Ireland; it happens throughout the world. This is a genuine effort to try to engender some competition in specific areas of the public service. No sector will be excluded from applying for funding and that is how it should be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;on Irish culture, heritage and experience&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the diversity of culture, heritage and experience on the island of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the aim of this legislation is to provide additional high quality programmes for the audience and not for the programme makers. That is an important and valid point. We are not in the business of providing a fund with which people can play. The fund is important for the generation of particular types of programming as set out in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to Irish culture, heritage and experience. I wish to make two points, one of which relates specifically to the amendment and another which does not relate to it. However, I wish to make it anyway because I intend to raise it on Report Stage and I alert the Minister to that fact. <Col N="863" />The object of the amendment is to substitute the words &ldquo;on Irish culture, heritage and experience&rdquo; with &ldquo;the diversity of culture, heritage and experience on the island of Ireland&rdquo;. It is specifically designed to broaden the definition, and the whole vision, of Irish culture in the legislation. I hope the Minister will see the amendment's intention for what it is, namely to be helpful, using the opportunity to encompass a broader notion of Irish culture than that set out in the draft legislation. It is not my understanding or assumption that the wording is designed to be narrow in its interpretation of Irish culture. However, the amendment is designed to use the legislation to set down a marker that Irish culture is somewhat broader, encompassing the whole island. For instance, it would certainly include the culture of Ulster, which is obviously a very important integral part of our culture to which we should be seen to extend an encompassing hand in our definition. That is the purpose of the amendment, which does not rule out Irish experience abroad either, covering it further on in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had an interest in broadcasting. I can look back to the early years of community radio, which was the forerunner of local radio, at that time sponsored by RTE. I was also involved in the foundation of Tipperary Mid West Radio. I was a founding director of Dublin 98FM, and I have served on a liaison committee with RTE for over 30 years. Senators will recall that I made a very strong case for RTE last time. In fairness, I had to do that, since I felt it had made a huge contribution to broadcasting, including the areas that we are now discussing in the motion.</P>
      <P>I can fully understand some of the points being put forward by Senator O'Meara. The heart tends to agree with quite a few of the sentiments in all the amendments, but the head might give a little word of caution to be careful down the line. I am always a little worried at such times, when we start broadening definitions. One might almost say that it is the same argument as that for community radio. It is the very same idea. I do not want to see the parameters being extended at the moment. I know the word &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo; does not show up, meaning that one can assume the diversity mentioned in the amendment could be that of Irish culture, heritage and experience. That is a very broad definition to start with. I am sure everyone in the Chamber is quite clear, but lest anyone outside think that in some way we wanted to exclude some definition of Irish culture, history or experience, that is not the case, nor has it, in fairness, been the case in most broadcasting on the island for many years. It should not be so, for that would undermine the very credibility of broadcasting itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if the definition diverges from that, we get into multiculturalism, some<Col N="864" />thing that I very much support. I have the proud boast of being the godfather of a Chinese lady who came to Ireland not so long ago. I have always kept in touch with Chinese culture and listened to that community's views. She said to me on several occasions that she was always worried that, when we talked about being multicultural, we might misunderstand what visitors to this island want. They do not want us to sideline or dilute our own culture. It is like building a house. If our own culture is not firm and strong, we cannot build a multicultural society on the island. I argued on the very same issues when we were first entering the European Community, saying that, if we were going in only with a cultural begging bowl rather than offering our rich heritage and culture, we would lose out.</P>
    <P>I was therefore absolutely delighted when the legislation was brought forward that the Government had seen the need for ensuring that what was rich and ours would be kept intact, not just for ourselves but to share with others. If the diversity of culture as mentioned in the amendment means &ldquo;multicultural&rdquo;, members will all agree that all the big satellite stations are already serving that purpose exceptionally well. How often will Senators see Fox television or any of the other stations in any way representing our culture or heritage? It is very much a multicultural or, as someone has already said, global view. This is one occasion when even visitors from outside and those who have accepted us as their adopted country, I have no doubt, would want to see our culture strengthened. I am therefore extremely pleased with the legislation. I certainly hope Senator O'Meara might consider after the debate not pressing the amendment. The diversity on this island is well reflected and will be represented under this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I propose the new subsection on the theme on which I had been talking a great deal, namely, the concept of community radio and television. I felt, on the basis of the Minister's reassurance, that good proposals from community radio and television would be considered. If those subparagraphs referring to &ldquo;contemporary community culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;current dimensions of community cultural diversity&rdquo; were included as part of the themes of the broadcasting funding scheme, it would strengthen the community radio and television concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was approached by Dóchas, representing such organisations as Gorta, Trócaire and Concern, which said there was a need to recognise the global picture. That is rather different from the multicultural attitudes of which Senator O'Meara has spoken. It is the concept of Ireland's experience in the international context. <Col N="865" />They suggested &ndash; there is something to be said for it, so I ask the Minister to consider it &ndash; that they would like a formulation about fostering understanding of the global dimension of Irish society. Perhaps the Minister might be able to consider including that in some form when he is examining the suggestion from Senator O'Meara. I understand her point, but this is slightly different.</P>
      <P>I would like to address amendment No. 4<i>a</i> which I have tabled. It refers to a matter I raised on Second Stage. I have no problems with excluding news programmes from the Bill's scope, but I have a big problem with extending that exclusion to cover current affairs programmes. This Bill is all about public service programming. It is an attempt, which I fully support, to level the playing field for programmes that might otherwise get squeezed out of broadcasting schedules by commercial considerations. I therefore do not altogether agree with what the Minister said, since it seems to me that, if a programme is going to attract a very large audience, it does not need any support by virtue of being a community programme. My point is that current affairs should be included. The Bill does not cover current affairs, but one aspect should be included. As drafted the subsection undermines the point I made about commercial concerns.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider one type of current affairs programme, namely, investigative journalism, or documentaries as one would say in radio and television. These are programmes with a missionary intent, or with the aim of achieving something. They come about when a programme maker identifies a scandal that has been swept under the carpet, or a story that has been ignored in the ordinary scheme of things. The programme maker sets out to investigate the facts. The Minister mentioned earlier that Senator Mooney and Senator O'Meara's sister can confirm that it can take a full day to prepare 30 seconds of a programme. A programme maker who sets out to produce an investigative programme will face a long and expensive process. It can take a great deal of effort to uncover something that has been covered up, deliberately or otherwise, by the mists of time. Legal considerations may have to be pondered and expensive advice may have to be sought.</P>
      <P>Given that the long road to producing an investigative documentary is strewn with many pitfalls, it is not very surprising that not many such documentaries are produced for radio or television. The cost structure of broadcasting is such that the production of an investigative documentary may not provide a satisfactory return on a broadcaster's investment. The reality is that investigative documentaries are an endangered species. They will not survive because they are expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like us to examine this matter from the point of view of the national interest, however. <Col N="866" />As a citizen of a Republic that considers freedom of expression to be a key value, I want broadcasters to offer us investigative documentaries on a regular basis. If one asks ordinary citizens about this matter, one will discover that most people consider that public service broadcasters have a basic responsibility to take the risks involved in researching and producing investigative documentaries. As I have said, however, the everyday economics of broadcasting do not facilitate such productions. It is for that reason that I suggest that this type of programming should be on the list of eligible programmes in schemes such as those outlined in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The deliberate exclusion of investigative documentaries from the remit of this Bill could be seen as a form of censorship. I know that is not the Minister's intention, but I urge him to consider my amendment. I would hate this Bill to be regarded as a form of censorship, perhaps imposed by a regime that has chosen not to expose itself to the risk of embarrassment. I do not refer to the present Administration. I would like a measure such as that I have recommended to be part of public service broadcasting in the future. I hasten to add that I am not making a comment on the Minister or the Government. The wording of this subsection could have an unintended effect. I ask the Minister to consider removing the reference to current affairs in order to encourage investigative documentaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing current affairs requirements apply to all broadcasters. Part of the commitment given by RTE in the context of its large licence fee increase was that it would increase its current affairs and news programming by a sizeable percentage. Other broadcasters are obliged, under the terms of their licences, to provide a certain level of current affairs output. Senator Mooney said earlier that many such broadcasters do not like to provide such output because it is very costly.</P>
      <P>My original point relating to the fund was that we are not establishing a broad-brush fund, but a fund specific to certain areas. I am reluctant to accept amendments that would broaden the focus of the fund because they would take away from the specific idea that underpins it, which is that issues relating to Irish culture and heritage need more emphasis than they receive from RTE and, more particularly, from the independent broadcasting sector.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a need to amend the Bill in the manner suggested by Senator O'Meara. There are specific references to Irish culture, heritage and experience throughout the Bill, especially in sections 2 and 3. These references account for all cultures on the island of Ireland and I do not think that there is a need for change in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to the global experience. Section 2(1)(<i>a</i>)(vii) of the Bill refers to &ldquo;the <Col N="867" />Irish experience in European and international contexts&rdquo;. I am somewhat reluctant to broaden this section of the Bill, as it could lead to the fund being expended by broadcasters doing programmes from all over the world. This finite fund is aimed specifically at honing in on uniquely Irish experiences.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane spoke about community, culture and diversity. I believe we have covered these areas, which are not excluded under this Bill. If I start to open out its focus, the benefit of the fund will be diluted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I neglected to mention the global issue, which the Minister dealt with in his reply to Senator Quinn. An opportunity will be lost if this issue is not examined. I will put down an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I would like to respond to Senator Quinn's proposal in respect of current affairs. His amendment suggests that current affairs be included in this fund. I fundamentally disagree with the Senator's suggestion, however. Speakers have referred to the fact that my sister works as a public service broadcaster, but they may not remember that I, too, once worked as a public service broadcaster in the news area of RTE. It is true that I know the cost of producing current affairs programmes, but I also know that a fundamental part of the brief of a public service broadcaster is to engage in investigative journalism. The Minister has reiterated this. It would be wrong to include current affairs and investigative journalism in this fund. Such a measure would undermine the public service broadcaster's responsibility in this regard.</P>
      <P>Investigative journalism needs to be as independent as possible. It needs to operate behind closed doors, to a large extent, until it emerges into the open. A great deal of research needs to be done in a way that the public does not know about. One does not know how the programme one is working on will end up until one has concluded one's investigation and research. One can start looking at an issue in a particular way, but one may conclude by seeing it entirely differently. I disagree with Senator Quinn because I do not think this fund is suitable. I do not favour his amendment, based on my own experience.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7<i>a</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection 9(<i>a</i>), line 45, after &ldquo;made&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or amended under <i>section 2(6)(b)</i>, and the Minister shall cause to have published by electronic means all schemes which may from time to time be in effect&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to broaden the scope of the disclosure requirements for any schemes drawn up under the Bill. The existing provision requires merely that the scheme be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. This is a standard provision and it is necessary and very valuable. I entirely agree with it but it is not quite enough in this case. While it requires disclosure in a technical sense, it is a long way from requiring the publication of the information in a proper way. There will be strong public interest in the details of these schemes and the legislation should cater for this by providing for more than just the absolute minimum level of disclosure envisaged.</P>
      <P>I make the point in respect of every Bill that passes through the House that the average person does not read <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. Still less does the average person have access to the Library in Leinster House, unlike Members of the Oireachtas. Fortunately, we now have a very easy, inexpensive way to give every member of the public access to information, namely, the Internet. There is an enormous difference between requiring that information to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and requiring that it be published on the Internet or &ldquo;by electronic means&rdquo;, which I understand is the correct terminology. Public interest calls for the information requirement to be extended beyond the minimum level and that the details of the schemes drawn up under the Act be available immediately to anybody who cares to look for them.</P>
      <P>I have tabled an amendment such as this in respect of almost every Bill in the past five years. When I was first elected to the House ten years ago, the Internet practically did not exist. Now its use is growing. It is so accessible, easy to use and cost-effective that it seems a shame not to publish on it on every single occasion. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, in all that it does, is obliged to publish and consult. From my recollection, it has always published on the Internet. Equally, my Department, of all Departments, is the one that puts decisions made on many issues on our website for public consultation. We have discussed this issue in reference to previous legislation and I understand the Senator's position, but I do not want to be overly prescriptive. It is good practice that all documents, such as those pertaining to new schemes, be published on websites immediately but dilution of the practice of dealing with them <Col N="870" />in the Houses of the Oireachtas and publishing them in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is not desirable.</P>
      <P>We often complain about the broadcasters being interested only in the sexy news, such as the fact that we may have taken a week off, but they do not publish or give due regard to the day-to-day work done in the Houses. I hazard a guess that there will be some reference to this debate in the media tomorrow because it is about broadcasting and the broadcasters' own sector but, time and again, we discuss very important Bills in both Houses and not a line is published about us. I am first to favour of publication on the Internet. Certain statutory organisations are trying to prevent me from trying to publish too much information on our website, which I rail against, and I fear that if we legislate for the Senator's proposal and have a blanket requirement to immediately publish information on a website, it will cause difficulties in the system that we might not appreciate today. It might be a good idea in a general way but, in respect of specific issues, it could cause difficulties.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister's heart is in the right place and I agree entirely with him when he says that publication on the Internet is good practice. I know that this is done under his regime. However, it is not enough because he will not be in office for all time. It is important that others engage in good practice also. We should stitch my proposal into every Bill. When the word &ldquo;publish&rdquo; is used, it is not enough to publish in print or in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. I am not saying information on schemes should not be in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, because it should, as it should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, information can be published on the Internet at the press of a button and there is no cost factor involved. Therefore, publication &ldquo;by electronic means&rdquo; should be provided for.</P>
      <P>I have tabled amendments of this kind many times and they have been accepted on a number of occasions. I would have assumed that the Minister would have nodded his head, thanked me for reminding him and acknowledge that the Department had slipped up by missing this. I urge him to consider my amendment to ensure that publication by electronic means be carried out. Such a provision should be included in all legislation where the word &ldquo;published&rdquo; is mentioned. The Internet offers an easy, low-cost method of making publications accessible to the public.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7<i>b</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 20 and 21, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding anything in <i>subsection (1)</i>, any broadcaster receiving funding for a programme under a scheme operated pursuant to this Act shall be free to offer for sale the rights to any such programme to broadcasters outside the jurisdiction of the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment has been proposed to remove any possible doubts in regard to what rights attach to the broadcaster of a programme funded under the legislation. As currently framed, the Bill leaves it open to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to argue that programmes it funds may be used only to fulfil the objectives of the scheme as set out in the section. While I am not sure anybody would make such a case, it would be possible for the BCI to do so.</P>
      <P>The objectives listed in the section relate exclusively to matters which obtain here and say nothing about the dissemination of Irish culture abroad, an issue raised in my earlier amendment, or any such provision. As such, it may be open to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to argue that its funding of a programme precludes the broadcaster of that programme from selling it abroad if the opportunity arises. This would be counterproductive because it would increase the real cost of producing such programmes in that not only would the broadcaster have to take into account the actual production costs, namely, the advertising income which has been foregone, but he would also have to take into account the income foregone from any possible overseas sales. In addition, it is in the broad national interest that Irish made programmes are seen by the widest possible audience wherever it may be. We should be in favour of the largest possible number of the programmes funded under the legislation being shown around the world. As framed, the Bill could present an obstacle to this taking place, which the amendment seeks to remove.</P>

      <P>The issue of rights is a business matter for agreement between the producer of the programme in question and those who wish to purchase it and not one we should be delving into in legislation. Rights are an ongoing issue which will probably arise again in new, more significant legislation, namely, the broadcasting <Col N="872" />authority Bill designed to bring RTE within the remit of an expanded Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. While it is possible that the BCI, in drawing up the scheme, will take into account the costs involved, we should not intervene in a commercial transaction between the producers of programmes and those who wish to purchase them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the section, I have a few brief questions which return us to the core of our earlier dialogue. A close reading of the section would lead one to conclude that the response to the criteria laid down in the Bill will overwhelmingly emanate from the community and non-commercial sector. In a sense, this is a pity. While I do not wish to rehearse the argument, like my colleague, Senator Quinn, I cannot envisage commercial radio broadcasters producing peak time programmes based on Irish cultural heritage and experience, the Irish language and the diversity of Irish culture and heritage. I say this with great sadness and I wish the Minister could introduce some form of legislative framework which would force some operators to produce programmes of this nature. They will not do this, however, because having opened the gate, the horse has bolted and it will be difficult to get it back into the field again. In other words, the programming formats have been laid down by many of the commercial operators. Incidentally, I am glad the Minister and Senators made a distinction between rural and local broadcasters and those based in the greater Dublin area, which are my bugbear.</P>
      <P>Once the scheme is in operation, does the Minister envisage introducing any directives or a policy framework to encourage the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland proactively to go after obsessively commercial radio stations which play wall to wall music and dress up the news and current affairs they are legally obliged to provide in all sorts of abstract programming? I say this partly with tongue in cheek because some local broadcasters do this extremely well. On the other hand, one has to ask how broadcasters in Dublin have been able to get away with this practice for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased the Minister addressed the issue of archiving in the Bill. Will he consider legislating to make archive material available on the Internet, not only in terms of the programmes which will, I hope, result from the legislation, but also RTE's current archive? The reason I ask this question is that Greg Dyke, the director general of the BBC, recently stated that his organisation was seriously considering making its archives available to the general public because it is funded by the taxpayer. Almost 50% <Col N="873" />of RTE's funding comes from the taxpayer and although it generates a certain amount of overseas income from the sale of its programmes, it is insignificant as a proportion of overall income. I am aware this is a wider issue related to RTE, but given that the section addresses the archiving of material, has the Minister considered legislating to ensure that archive material is made generally available to the public?</P>
    <P>We are all aware from our experience of community and local radio that it broadcasts some wonderful programmes. If, however, one lives in counties Leitrim or Dublin, one will not hear a programme transmitted in counties Clare, Tipperary or Limerick. In the event that there is a public sector element &ndash; taxpayers' money &ndash; involved in encouraging people to provide and archive programmes of the type listed in the legislation, will the Minister consider legislating to ensure such material is made generally available on the Internet? </P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first issue, we cannot force, nor is it the intention to force, broadcasters to apply or try to adhere to the criteria laid down in the legislation. I do not envisage, therefore, that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland will actively canvass some of the obsessively commercial broadcasters, as the Senator described them, notably the pop radio stations, to focus on this element of the legislation. Minimum requirements with which broadcasters must comply under the licence are in force. This provision will apply only to those broadcasters who wish to get involved in this area by providing additional programmes of the nature outlined.</P>
      <P>On the issue of archiving, the rationale behind this aspect of the Bill flows from the forum report and its comments on the dearth of archiving, particularly in the independent sector. We do not want RTE to halt its current archiving activities and apply for funding under this section to continue with them. One can take it as read that this will not happen.</P>
      <P>On the question of making archives available on the Internet, RTE places a significant amount of its archives of specific programmes on the Internet. When agreeing to the licence fee increase, I was particularly insistent that the excellent RTE website be maintained as part of its public service remit. I would not be averse to allowing and trying to promote archiving on the Internet. However, this involves a number of small, local and community broadcasters who would not have the wherewithal to maintain a website to the standard that would be required. It might also hoover up any of the funds that might be available to them. I do not wish to be overly prescriptive in this respect.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider introducing an amendment on Report Stage to <Col N="874" />encourage the BCI to finance a website on which it could accumulate all the material we have mentioned, rather than putting the financial onus on community or local radio stations? After all, the BCI is monitoring the output of all the licensed stations. As a number of schemes are being created under this legislation and a sum of approximately &euro;8 million is involved, could some of that money be used to create a website to allow Internet users worldwide, particularly the Irish diaspora, to access this material? I accept the Minister's point about the cost involved in establishing websites.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Mooney's proposal. The Minister is correct that it would be beyond the means of small operators to establish and support such a website, nor would it necessarily be justified. However, it would be a justified and valuable proposal that the BCI undertake this in the context of archiving. The Minister should encourage the BCI to do it. It might not be necessary to provide for it in the legislation but it would be useful to do so. As I said earlier, if one does not specify something, it rarely happens. We are dealing with aspiration rather than reality. I would be happy to put down that amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Senator Mooney's suggestion is admirable. I am not sure who would pay for it or what the cost would be but it should not come out of a budget provided for something else. However, I doubt that the cost would be high. The suggestion is worthy of consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill only deals with the development of policy on archiving, not getting an individual broadcaster to look after archiving. The idea was that it would be a boost for the independent broadcasting sector to start archiving its material. I have no wish to pour cold water on Senator Mooney's proposal but it would take a huge amount of the focus of the BCI if it were required to start archiving all the material of the broadcasters in the country. It would be a mammoth task and it would probably be necessary to have a specific archiving authority, which would have to be funded. Ultimately, the funding would have to come from the sector and this, in turn, would reduce the level of funding for actual broadcasting.</P>
      <P>While I will bring it to the attention of the BCI and perhaps consider it in the context of the legislation on the BAI, I do not wish to raise any false hopes.</P>

The BCI currently has a website and anybody who wishes to access information on any of the licensed radio stations in this country can do so through that website. Perhaps the Minister, in his discussions on the implementation of this <Col N="875" />scheme, might be able to advance these views and encourage the BCI to look in that direction. I accept the Minister's point that the purpose of this legislation is to ensure that the money is spent on the creation of the type of programmes listed and the archiving of those programmes. My proposal was simply a follow up on that. Perhaps the Minister will consider it a worthy dimension to the BAI legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7<i>c</i>:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 17, after &ldquo;review&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and the Minister shall, as soon as may be after receiving the review, lay a copy of it before each House of the Oireachtas and shall at the same time cause it to be published by electronic means.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is concerned with the matter of publication. The Bill provides that the details of any scheme drawn up by the BCI under this legislation be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. However, it does not mention doing the same with any review of the scheme. That makes no sense. If the Oireachtas is entitled to be informed as a matter of law of the details of any scheme to fund programmes, it seems obvious that the same requirement should apply to the results of any statutory review of the arrangements.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that every item of correspondence between the BCI and the Minister should be put into the public domain. What is at issue is a formal statutory review which is provided for in the legislation. Such a review is an important document and is of public interest. That is the purpose of the review. There is no argument for the publication of the review being a matter for the Minister of the day to decide. That politicises the matter and it is uncalled for in the present circumstances. The publication of the review should be automatic and immediate.</P>
      <P>The amendment further provides that in addition to laying the review before both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister should also publish it on the Internet or by electronic means. My arguments for the wider form of publication are the same as the arguments I made earlier and I will not repeat them. The purpose of the amendment is to secure automatic publication of the review. It removes the decision to do so from the hands of the Minister and makes it a statutory requirement. If it is to be done with the original scheme, it should be done with the reviews as well.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister about licence fee collection and the recent decision by An Post to divest itself of this obligation. The commission will review the operation, effectiveness and impact of the scheme not later than three years from the date it comes into service but the collection of the licence fee will have a direct impact on the effectiveness of the scheme in terms of the amount of money made available. It is 5% of the total collection fee. I do not know the statistics in this country on the compliance rate in collecting the fee but I believe it is high, above 90%. The failure rate in some countries in Europe is above 90%. Obviously, the more money that is collected through the licence fee, the more will be available for this scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>An Post has not made a formal decision. There have been indications that it wishes to get out of non-core business to concentrate on its core business. It has indicated, at least informally, that it is considering getting out of licence fee collection. That would require amending legislation but no formal proposal has come to me or my Department in that respect. If it were to get out of the business of licence fee collection, the business would have to be put to public tender.</P>
      <P>The Senator is correct that there is a high degree of compliance. In the last two years, particularly since we started discussions with RTE about its financial position and in the context of the commitments RTE gave under the licence fee increase, it was decided to bring together, on an ongoing basis, representatives of An Post, RTE and the Department to ensure licence fee collection would be improved. If there were any new moves from a legislative point of view, they would be proposed to me in order to address some of the existing deficiencies. I guarantee the Senator that, regardless of the system, every effort will be made to ensure full compliance.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), lines 23 and 24, to delete &ldquo;The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The Minister shall, no later than seven years after the enactment of this Act, or at any earlier time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to put a time limit on the life of the legislation. My reason for suggesting what I call this sunset clause is the experimental nature of what is proposed in the Bill. We are moving into new territory with this legislation. We should, therefore, keep a close eye on what happens and how it develops. I am not doing this because I have reservations about the objectives of the Bill because it should be clear by now that I fully support them. However, I want to ensure that we legislate in such a way as to ensure that these objectives are realised.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Bill, as drafted, includes a provision for a review of the scheme every three years. I approve of and support that approach. However, we should go further. After two such reviews, namely, after six years, it will then be time for the Minister of the day to come back to the Oireachtas. He could say at that stage that the scheme has been a failure and that he wants to abolish it. I am fairly sure that will not happen. The second thing he could say is that the scheme's operation has proved to be satisfactory and that he wants to introduce amending legislation which will continue its effect beyond the seven years proposed in the legislation. The third thing he could say is that the scheme has proved to be broadly satisfactory, but that there is a need for some fundamental change in the enabling legislation. He may, therefore, introduce a Bill to give legal force to those changes.</P>
      <P>If my amendment is accepted, that will happen. If, on the other hand, the Bill is passed without such a sunset clause, the legislation risks falling into the type of limbo into which most legislation falls. Such legislation is on the Statute Book, but it is not revisited by the Oireachtas and we do not get the chance to ask if it achieved what we set out to achieve when we passed it. I realise a similar argument could be made for putting sunset clauses into most Bills, but that is not my point today. My argument today is that the experimental nature of this Bill creates a strong case for making it a requirement that the Oireachtas revisits the matter after a suitable period has elapsed. We would then be able to ask if it worked and whether we should change it. I included a period of seven years, which is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming here to discuss the issue of investment in the arts with particular reference to the negative impact of cuts on performing companies and the communities they serve. The last budget saw drastic cuts, which amounted to about &euro;4 million, imposed on the arts in general.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Minister to the Backstage Theatre Company, based in my own county of Longford, which is designated as a centre of excellence for theatre. This has enhanced the cultural infrastructure for the entire midlands region. This company, established in 1995, had its funding cut from &euro;216,000 to &euro;190,000 in 2003. This, together with the already disturbing shortage of touring companies in the region, has made it difficult to maintain programme standards in our community and has had a negative impact on staffing levels at Backstage, which has already lost one member.</P>
      <P>Without the prospect of increased and sustained funding it is impossible for companies such as Backstage to plan and keep up programme standards to the levels that have been enjoyed throughout the country heretofore. The blood, sweat and tears that go into any artistic endeavour will not be enough to keep theatre companies and artistic groups together and functioning effectively. Dependable capital investment is required. I hope the Minister will bear this in mind when considering future funding levels. It is essential that the crucial role of the arts in society be recognised and maintained and that the specific role of this theatre company be recognised in the 2004 budget allocation to the arts. Appropriate funding should be put in place within the overall arts structure to ensure that coherent development of this sector can be achieved.</P>
      <P>I know the amount of effort and energy put in by the people who operate the Backstage Theatre Company and it is a sad day when the Department cuts funding to this body. People give hours of voluntary time and effort to the theatre and it is a centre of excellence in the midlands for the arts. The Minister should consider increasing funding for this group next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Members of the House on the topic of funding for the arts and I thank Senator Bannon for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>The funding allocated to the Arts Council in 2003 was &euro;44.1 million, which represented a reduction of &euro;3.568 million or about 7% on the Arts Council's provision in 2002. Naturally, it would have been better to avoid any reduction but the provision of &euro;44.1 million to the Arts Council in 2003 must be put in context. The 2002 provision was the culmination of several years of unprecedented increases in funding for the arts. Between 1997 and 2002, funding for the Arts Council increased by about 80%. This increase in funding was a wonderful thing for the arts and allowed them to flower in a whole new way. However, there is no sector of our society that can expect increases such as these to be guaranteed, just as no sector of society can hope to be entirely isolated from the sometimes chill winds of economic cycles and the changing fortunes of Government finances.</P>
      <P>The year 2003 was quite different from the years that preceded it. All sectors came under pressure this year and there was no way to avoid some reduction. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, did not enjoy having to preside over the reduced funding &ndash; what Minister does &ndash; but he had no alternative at the end of the day. He is acutely aware of the difficulties that resulted for various sectors of the arts, including performing companies, as a consequence of reduced funding this year and although there was no way to avoid it, he regrets the problems that were faced by artists and arts organisations around the country. I appreciate what Senator Bannon says about the Backstage Theatre Company in Longford whose funding was reduced from &euro;216,000 to &euro;190,000. I appreciate this causes difficulties for the company. Everybody involved plays an important role and is difficulty to quantify in monetary terms the contribution made through voluntary time and effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the Government funds the Arts Council, the distribution of the funds among sectors, organisations and individuals is a matter entirely for the council, which is independent with regard to individual funding decisions. There has been much comment that the provision made to the Arts Council in 2003 does not match the finance required to implement the Arts Plan 2002-2006. The Minister has already made clear that the arts plan is an Arts Council document which suggests specific levels of funding over a period of several years. The Government has never committed to those financial targets &ndash; it cannot, because Government finances are currently based on an annual Estimates cycle, under <Col N="881" />which system it is not possible to know what funding will be available beyond the year ahead.</P>
    <P>The allocation for next year will, as always, be decided through the forthcoming Estimates process in the context of which the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism has given his commitment to make the strongest possible case for increased funding for the arts. He also remains committed to funding the arts and culture infrastructure around the country as an essential means of providing access for all to the arts. The arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS, was launched in 2001 and is scheduled to run until the end of 2004. Under the scheme &euro;45.71 million has been offered to the promoters of 44 projects that develop the arts and culture infrastructure, including integrated arts centres, theatres, museums and galleries as well as arts studios and other arts production, creative and performance spaces.</P>
    <P>The primary aim of this scheme is to ensure all our citizens have easy access to adequate venues for the creation, expression and appreciation of arts and culture, including our heritage. The scheme will lead to greater participation in the arts, with a greater number of facilities being provided on a broad geographical basis. The scheme will also result in the creation of direct and indirect employment in the arts and local economy generally. In addition, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism provides some capital funding for other projects outside the ACCESS scheme. A total of &euro;6.4 million was paid to these projects in 2002 and a further &euro;5.2 million is committed.</P>
    <P>Between 1997 and 2002 funding was increased by 80%, which means we are victims of our own success. It was unfortunate that there had to be a reduction this year of &euro;3.568 million because resources were not available. The Minister will be making every effort to secure the maximum possible funding for the Arts Council this year, taking into consideration the resources available.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. Some decades ago I was on holiday in Bolgheri, on the west coast of Italy. One evening we were talking to some of the locals, who told us they had just averted a national catastrophe. Naturally, we were eager to hear about this. They pointed to a lovely avenue of cypresses going up into the hills. The Minister may know the splendid avenues of cypresses one sees all over Italy. This one was about 2 km long and the people had prevented it from being cut down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bolgheri is located on the west coast of Italy on the Laverno-Roma motorway. The motorway was being built at that time by the Italians who, like their ancestors, the Romans, are tremendous road builders. When they came near Bolgheri, the <Col N="882" />denizens of Bolgheri looked at their plans and objected because the intention was to go through the avenue of cypresses. The engineers said they had to go through other cypresses on previous occasions but they were told that these were the cypresses Dante wrote about in the poem every Italian school child has to learn. The Italians, who have some respect for national monuments, decided this avenue of cypresses was a national monument of cultural importance, so the builders went around them. If one looked at that motorway now, one would never know, thanks to the skill of the engineers, that any sort of diversion had to be made. It is an example of how a motorway can be constructed while preserving a national monument.</P>
    <P>The opposite is about to be done with Carrickmines Castle. Apparently no amount of appeals to the Minister will make him change his mind on the path of the M50 motorway. What is sad about this situation, with his efforts before the Oireachtas to annul the Supreme Court judgment, is that he is acting as judge and jury in his own case. There is an old legal saying that one cannot act as judge and jury in one's own case &ndash;<i>nemo iudex in causa sua</i>. He is acting in this way because as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government he is responsible for national monuments. He must have decided it was a national monument as he intends to have it knocked down under a section of the National Monuments Act. At the same time, in his capacity as Minister with overall responsibility for the road network, he is consenting to what is being done on the basis that it is necessary. He says he is acting in the national interest but there is nothing in the national monuments plan which states one can demolish, destroy or devastate anything in the national interest. I do not understand why he decided to do that. Legally, national monuments can only be damaged where it furthers the interests of archaeology in that area.</P>
    <P>The Minister is acting in the most extraordinary way because, as in the case of the motorway in Italy, he is relying on funds from the European Union to construct this motorway in south Dublin. I understand that of the &euro;140 million to be spent, at least &euro;80 million will come from the European Union. The European Union petitions committee has been informed, it has registered its concern and its members have come here to investigate. The Minister should at least wait until they have adjudicated on the matter because it has always been made explicit that any EU funding is conditional on a proper environmental impact study being carried out. The Minister of State may recall that in the Supreme Court appeal, Mr. Justice Hardiman said he felt that the environmental impact study was deficient. He also said that he was treating Carrickmines Castle as a national monument. What would happen if the European Union withholds these funds <Col N="883" />because we have demolished a national monument?</P>
    <P>This order should be annulled because modification of the route is possible. It is interesting that other areas of the motorway can be modified if they are considered to cause practical problems. An example is the Red Cow roundabout, now rightly referred to as the mad cow roundabout because the situation there is so chaotic. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, who is not happy about what is happening at Carrickmines, has said that if the Luas light rail system causes more congestion at the Red Cow junction, a flyover can be built at a cost of &euro;11 million. More money can be found for an area in which traffic congestion has to be dealt with but it cannot be found to deal with national monuments.</P>
    <P>This monument is important because it comprises a very large site. I am sure the Minister saw an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today in which the chief archaeologist on the site, Dr. Mark Clinton, expressed his anger at a culture of greed and ineptitude that is destroying a priceless national monument. I am sure the Minister knows all about the history of the place, which was built in the 13th century by the Anglo-Norman Walshes to repel the O'Tooles and the O'Byrnes. I am sure they were right; they should have stayed in Wicklow. There is a long history to this place, including its important role as a fortification along the Pale. If money can be found to do something with the Red Cow roundabout, why can it not be found to do something with this extraordinarily important place? We bitterly regretted what happened at Wood Quay because it was such an important attraction, not just for ourselves but for tourists. This is a unique site which cannot be replaced and which, apparently, the Minister believes he is entitled to dispose, even in the absence of the adjudication by members of the EU petitions committee who are examining the project. The Minister is acting as a judge in his own case, which is improper. I hope the Minister of State has a sympathetic response to this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this matter. The order to which the Senator refers is the National Monuments (Approval of Joint Consent) Order 2003 made by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on 3 July 2003. This was laid before each House of the Oireachtas, as required by section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended. Either House of the Oireachtas is entitled, subject to the necessary voting support, to pass an order annulling the July 2003 order within 21 sitting days. Should this happen, the original order will be annulled. If this does not happen, the order will stand. I have just looked at the calendar and as far as the Dáil is concerned, the 21 sitting days, presuming it does not <Col N="884" />sit on Fridays, will expire on 19 November, although I stand to be corrected on that. In the Seanad, 21 sitting days will expire on 3 December. It is unreasonable to call upon the Minister to annul his own order, nor is it clear that he could legally do so in the present case. The prerogative of annulment rests more widely with the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Leaving these legal considerations aside, the Senator and the House should be aware that the Minister's order was made following a process of bona fide consideration and consultation and that it was based, as envisaged by the legislation, on considerations extending beyond archaeological ones alone. In other words, the Minister made, as he was entitled to do in light of all the facts, a determination on broadly based public interest grounds but which also ensured that the greatest possible preservation would be afforded to the archaeology at Carrickmines consistent with the need to continue the south eastern motorway.</P>
      <P>National monuments legislation envisages that it may be necessary in certain cases to interfere with a national monument. Where interference is required for reasons of public health and safety, the Minister may consent to the works involved without making an order and without reference to the Oireachtas. Where interference can be justified in the interests of archaeology, no reference to the Oireachtas is needed.</P>
      <P>The National Monuments Acts clearly envisage a third type of situation in which it may be necessary to allow interference with a national monument for reasons which do not relate either to archaeology or to public health and safety. The application from the road authority, in this case Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, to the Minister was expressly made in this last context, as was the Minister's determination of the matter in his order last July. In this type of case, reference to the Houses of the Oireachtas is required. This has been done in the present instance.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already publicly explained the factors which underlie his decision. It was based on the overall assessment by him that the public interest, in allowing construction of the south eastern motorway along its approved route, justified consenting to, or approving of, the works impacting on archaeology at the site. The Minister considered that it had been satisfactorily demonstrated that a systematic approach had been adopted by the county council to the archaeological resolution of the Carrickmines site. This had involved a major commitment of resources. These activities, coupled with further archaeological work to be completed, will preserve the main archaeological elements of the site, either by record or <i>in situ</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before making his decision, the Minister considered 23 submissions received relating to the case. Some 17 submissions supported the early completion of the project while six objected. The <Col N="885" />Minister had regard to the advice of his Department's national monuments section regarding further conditions to be inserted in the joint consent to ensure that the works to be undertaken at Carrickmines would be carried out in accordance with best archaeological practice.</P>
    <P>In arriving at his decision, the Minister had regard to the following: the scale and extent of archaeological excavations carried out on the Carrickmines site commencing in August 2000 and continuing to date &ndash; as many as 130 archaeologists have been employed on the Carrickmines site and the archaeological mitigation to date is estimated to cost &euro;6 million; the contribution that this work has made, and continues to make, to enhancing the national archaeological record, the understanding of the history and changing settlement patterns of south county Dublin and the knowledge of medieval and post-medieval frontier castle life in the area; the implications of further delay or non-completion of the south eastern motorway scheme for the Government's objectives regarding the integrated transportation strategy for the Dublin region set out in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and the Dublin Transportation Office's, A Platform for Change 2000-2016; the need to realise the full transport service objectives of the M50 in relation to the Dublin area and the radial national routes serving the regions; the objectives of the integrated transportation strategy for the greater Dublin area, including the role envisaged for the M50 in facilitating access to Dublin Port, thereby removing a significant volume of heavy vehicles from Dublin city centre; the significant environmental and safety implications for residential areas along the local road network in the south Dublin area arising out of any further delay or non-completion of the south eastern motorway scheme; the need to maintain commercial and economic activity in the south Dublin area and to provide for the further development of the area; and the potential additional substantial demands on Exchequer funding and the possibility of the loss of EU Cohesion Fund aid previously approved arising out of any further delay or non-completion of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In view of all I have explained, the House will acknowledge that the Minister has acted bona fide and in the public interest in this matter and that his order should be allowed to stand. I repeat that it is a matter for either House of the Oireachtas to annul the order made by the Minister on 23 July. That must be done with 21 sitting days.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for Social and Family Affairs for taking the time to reply to my Adjournment matter. Although it may be a complex issue I raise this matter for a simple reason. Suppliers of goods and services to the <Col N="886" />State must supply a tax clearance certificate if the good costs in excess of &euro;6,500. In the case of people who provide professional services to the State, such as archaeologists and geologists, the State retains 20% tax from the amount of money they are due before it pays them. At the end of the year, the supplier can regulate his or her affairs with the State and if there is an overpayment of tax, he or she is given a refund.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been an increase in accommodation in the rented sector and in the amount of money the State is giving to it. Concerns have been raised with me regarding the safeguards and procedures the State has in place to ensure landlords, to whom money is being paid, are fully tax compliant. If they are not fully tax compliant, it means their mortgages are being paid by the State. I would like the Minister to outline for my information and, I am sure, that of many others, the procedures in place and whether they will be tightened up if necessary.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús báire ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir as ucht ócáid a thabhairt dom cur in iúl don Seanadóir agus don Seanad an méid a bheidh le rá agus an freagra atá agam ar an díospóireacht seo.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising the issue. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. Neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist eligible tenants with reasonable accommodation costs. Rent supplements are paid to tenants living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.</P>
      <P>A landlord does not have an entitlement to a rent supplement. The entitlement to a supplement lies with the applicant, that is, the tenant. However, in some instances, a tenant will request that payment of the supplement is issued directly to the landlord. Occasionally, a health board will deem that it is in the best interest of the tenant that payment of a rent supplement issues directly to the landlord, which I am sure the Senator appreciates. This may occur, for example, in cases involving a person who has recovered, or who is recovering, from a drug or alcohol related problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of ensuring tax compliance is a matter in the first instance for the Revenue Commissioners. In that regard, health boards are required under the Taxes Consolidation Act to provide details to the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="887" />concerning landlords whose tenants receive rent supplements. To assist the health boards in discharging this obligation, there are facilities on my Department's computer system for the health boards to record the relevant details. In processing an application from a tenant for a rent supplement, data relating to the landlord and the <Col N="888" />amount of rent being charged is entered on this system and arrangements are in place for the transfer of the data to the Revenue Commissioners each year, usually on 31 October.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.30 p.m. until 10.30&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, 12 November 2003.</P>
