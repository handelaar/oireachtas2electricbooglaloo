      <P>I have received notice from Senator Higgins that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to confirm if he has had any discussions with An Post, in which he is the main shareholder, regarding the decision to withdraw the services of an auxiliary postman from the Lahardane area, Ballina, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Kathleen O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to expedite clause K of the State mining lease, to require the lessee, Mogul of Ireland, to remediate a number of mining related sites at Silvermines, Nenagh, County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator O'Meara as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Higgins as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, as early as possible in order that he can outline the Government's rationale for continuing to fail to support the case of Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin which will shortly come before the courts? As she is aware, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges recently requested the Minister to indemnify the legal costs of both Members. We discovered recently that he had failed to do so and to support the Members financially in their case, as has the Government. This is a very serious matter which should be taken out of the private setting of meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. A full public debate with the Minister should be held immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to know exactly the rationale of the Government. The Minister could find himself in a similar position to my colleague and Deputy Howlin in his clinic next week in respect of information given to him in the public interest and which should be used as such. We know there are many views on this subject in the House. Senator Jim Walsh expressed a contrary view to mine last week. We should debate the matter in the House because it is important that we know exactly what the Government is arguing in respect of its failure to fund the case. Both Members acted properly and in the public interest. They did not abuse privilege in the House. Therefore, it is incumbent on us all to support the case because it could <Col N="863" />affect us all. I ask that the debate be organised by the Leader at the most opportune time.</P>
    <P>We will have an unprecedented set of circumstances in the 22nd Seanad tonight when the first Private Members' Bill will be debated, the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2003 in the name of Senator Higgins. While other Bills have been published, they have not been debated. Will the Government side support the Bill? I expect that it will on the basis that legislation introduced by this side of the House should be given a free run in respect of Committee and Report Stages. If there are matters of principle of debate concerning the Government and Opposition, it is very important that they are sorted out on these Stages. I ask the Government side to set a good precedent tonight, support the Bill and allow it progress to Committee Stage when it can be amended according to its wishes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for the view of the Leader of the House because it would be a good precedent to allow the Bill to progress to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Leader to consider the Senator's point. As I have said to every Government for the past 16 years, it is important to realise that not all wisdom is on the Government side of the House at any one time. The Opposition can also raise issues which should be argued on their merits. What is happening is that civil servants are saying, &ldquo;How dare anybody other than those on the Government side bring forward a Bill?&rdquo;  This is schoolyard behaviour. If a Bill is good, it should be supported; if not, it should be buried and if it requires changes, they should be made. There are many Members on the Government side who support that point of view. It would bring greater independence of office to the Seanad, including those on the Government side.</P>
      <P>There used to be a proud tradition in politics whereby a Member on the Government side could bring a Bill to the House independently. There is nothing wrong with this. Any Member of the House can do so and the Government can deal with such a Bill in the same way as it deals with other legislation. It is wrong to adopt the blanket position that every Bill that comes from the Opposition side should be opposed, unless it represents a huge embarrassment to the Government. The Government should use it as a way to put pressure on Departments by asking if legislation introduced is good, why has it not been introduced. If it is bad, it could be opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could write the Minister's speech tonight. He will give many reasons the Bill is a good idea but say it is not drafted correctly and that he will come back again having examined it. This happens every time. It is a set script which will be taken from the top shelf and trotted out. Senators <Col N="864" />on the Government side will be forced to support it, although most will not believe it, including the Leader, perhaps, who might think it is a good idea to support some aspects of the Bill. This issue is worth raising.</P>
    <P>We hear conflicting reports about an issue that has been bubbling for the past year. The Minister for Transport is quick enough to tell the world his views on issues. I want to know where we stand on the Dublin Port tunnel, a matter raised by way of a Progressive Democrats motion at some stage. I am not raising it for any mischievous reason but it seems utterly daft that we are building the most important conduit for transport to the Dublin docks, although certain vehicles will be too high to use it. The higher vehicles, which are more environmentally friendly and efficient and will lead to fewer vehicles on the roads, although I dislike them and would like to have them banned, will not be able to go through the tunnel. This is utterly mad. I would like the Leader to invite somebody responsible for this decision to the House. If it is the Minister for Transport, let him come here and be clear on whether he defends or opposes it. He was quick enough to take on Dublin City Council when he did not like its signposts when he arrived home from abroad. He seems to be saying certain things and letting Dublin City Council take the flak. What is his current position? The necessary changes to the tunnel would increase costs by 16% but we should have the figures in front of us in order that we can discuss the matter and know what we are talking about. The Government is dithering and everybody is confused. This is unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In no way do I wish to question the decision of the Leas-Chathaoirleach on the Adjournment Matters but both Houses have something to sort out. If Ministers are not responsible for matters, they should be decent enough to stay away from official openings for which they eschew all responsibility. It the Minister for Transport is to open every single road in the country, he cannot tell the Houses of the Oireachtas that he has no responsibility for the roads programme. Let the Houses of the Oireachtas and, I presume, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges establish that Ministers who claim credit for matters should accept responsibility for them or else be precluded from doing so. That is a simple enough view and part of politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader consider having a debate on transparency and consumer rights? Aer Lingus and British Airways co-run a flight on the Dublin-London route. A colleague of mine was exploring this and discovered that the 6.40 a.m. flight this morning cost 25% more if one purchased one's ticket from Aer Lingus rather than British Airways. It is the same flight in the same aeroplane with the same crew, to the same destination, with the same return journey. That is not competition. It is a case of Aer Lingus abusing the patriotism <Col N="865" />of Irish people. It is an absolute disgrace. The idea that one would log on to an Aer Lingus website and end up paying 25% more than one would have if one had booked the same flight with British Airways is an outrage. This should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Every night on television after 9 p.m. we see images of the most appalling brutality and violence. Apparently, it is acceptable to show this as long as it is fiction. Listening to Robert Fisk yesterday I was struck immediately by the fact that we kept seeing a sanitised version of war. This House should debate broadcasting standards. I fully support all that has been said about RTÉ's coverage. Why is it that we never see the brutality of war in news coverage in a way that is apparently acceptable in fictionalised accounts? Is it to protect us or to ensure we do not realise what is really happening, <i>de facto,</i> in our name? That is all I will say on the matter.</P>
    <P>I seek a debate on industrial relations as a matter of urgency. There is a new style of macho management developing which is evident in Peerless Rugs in Athy and The Irish Glass Bottle Company Limited. In my constituency ADM Limited has locked out 140 people without bothering to negotiate with them. It presented a <i>fait accompli</i> on a take it or leave it basis, and when workers would not take it, they were immediately locked out. In a country which sells partnership as its greatest institutional achievement the fact that this type of cowboy industrial relations is still ongoing says very little about the depth of IBEC's commitment to partnership. It is an issue we need to discuss.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to go back over something mentioned yesterday. It was my fault as I had failed to catch the Leas-Chathaoirleach's eye in time.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly raised the matter of the public health response to SARS, a hugely important and relevant issue, and the Leader undertook to refer it to the Minister for Health and Children. I ask her to extend the reference to include the preparations that need to be made to ensure those coming to the Special Olympics at the end of June can be properly accommodated. This might include liaising with the countries from which they come. It will certainly require a huge mobilisation of public health expertise at points of entry when large numbers come in at the same time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support those of my colleagues who advocate backing Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin. What they are fighting for is an important political point in terms of the freedom of Members on all sides of the House. I am sure everyone here supports what they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important point was made by Senator Brian Hayes about the need to give, in a spirit of magnanimity from the Government, a reasonable degree of support to legislation that originates from this side of the House or individual <Col N="866" />Members on the Government side. If there are good ideas, let us have them in the interests of the country. It is fine if the Government wants to take the legislation over at a later stage or put its stamp on it. Who cares? Ideas should not be stifled simply because they do not come from within the Government or, as Senator O'Toole said, the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I again call for a debate on Iraq. I am not proposing an amendment to the Order of Business nor will I be calling for a vote because I know the Government side would have to troop through the division lobbies like sheep. Am I allowed to say that?</P>

      <P>While the vote was taking place &ndash; I wonder if this escaped the attention of my friends; I would like to think they are all still my friends &ndash; General Michael Jackson was giving evidence in Derry. He is the man who was in command of the entire British army. He was giving evidence to the effect that what the British army did in Derry was perfectly reasonable, that it was perfectly well justified. I am not at all surprised that he takes the same view about what is going on in Iraq. I doubt if that recommends itself to my good independent-minded colleagues in Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>We should also support what Senator Ryan said, especially in the light of the call by the International Federation of Journalists for a full independent inquiry into the apparently deliberate assassination of European journalists and those from Al-Jazeera, which was targeted not just in this war but also in the previous one. It has been said that we should look at the success of Afghanistan.

We need to have the Tánaiste here to debate the issue. While I appreciate what she is trying to do, many sectors are included which will make it prohibitive for those in the hotel and catering trade and other sectors to do business. Some of the employer organisations which have been in contact with me are very concerned. I ask the Leader to endeavour to have the Tánaiste here as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The national disease surveillance board has published its report, some details of which are rather frightening. Some 73% of the heterosexual population infected with HIV come from sub-Saharan Africa. In that context, should we not be screening immigrants from those locations? It is important to do this in order to determine if medication is subsequently required. It is a frightening statistic. It is incumbent on the Department of Health and Children to follow it up.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Maurice Hayes in regard to SARS. I call on the Government to resolve the outstanding issue with public health doctors. SARS is a matter which is causing much concern worldwide. We have to have procedures in place in order to ensure it does not gain a foothold here.</P>

I accept that the quartet of the Russians, the EU, the British and Americans have produced the road map proposal, which I welcome, and that a Prime Minister has been appointed in Palestine. It would be appropriate, however, for the House to send an <Col N="869" />official group to meet the Palestinians and see, at first hand, the atrocities that are being carried out by the Israelis in the occupied areas of Palestine.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader confirm if it is still the Government's intention to take No. 9, the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003, next week?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes in respect of the two important matters he raised. The first of these is the case of our colleague, Senator Higgins, and Deputy Howlin. Members on both sides of the House have already agreed that there is an important principle at stake. Perhaps it is time, as Senators Hayes has proposed, that we debated the issue with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Brian Hayes's comments on the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2003, which will be debated tonight and which, I hope, the Government will accept. There are two things which the Bill proposes to do and which I could not but see the Government welcoming.</P>

      <P>In referring to the case of Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin, Senator Brain Hayes has raised an appropriate and important issue that is relevant to every Oireachtas Member. It impacts on the effectiveness and functioning of parliament. There is a need for a debate, certainly on the financial aspects of the case but also on the broader issues. People are anxious to know what are our views. We have debated this matter at meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and it is evident that we understand the position of Senator Higgins and the esteemed Deputy.</P>
      <P>What is important here is the citizen. Up to now, citizens felt comfortable at all times in approaching Members of the Oireachtas and providing information. Oireachtas Members, providing a service to the State, would then be in a position to decide how best to impart that information to the relevant Department. It would have been easy for Senator Higgins to have spoken openly in the Lower House on the relevant issues, but he would have been criticised for doing so at the time. He decided that it was in the best interests of everyone concerned that the information be relayed in a certain manner. The value of a debate now would be that we would be able to help the public understand the fundamental importance of this issue. Many of the newspaper editorials on the issue have taken the side of Senator Higgins and the esteemed Deputy and a debate on it would be helpful to all our positions in the future.</P>

      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes is right to express concerns about the SARS epidemic and about the need for the Minister for Health and Children to liaise with the countries from which young athletes are coming for the Special Olympics in June. Senator Finucane made the important point that public health doctors are in dispute <Col N="870" />with the Minister for Health and Children at present. It is their assistance that is needed. This dispute has been going on for nine years. Will the Minister for Health and Children come before the House and indicate the action he intends to take to address both issues?</P>

We are not attempting to isolate any group of people because they are entering the country, we are trying to protect them and Irish citizens. The time for indulging in this practice has gone.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise another public health matter. We are all aware that young people can be seen walking around public houses with their thumbs over the mouths of their bottles. They do so to ensure that their drinks will not be spiked. There is an additional danger in this regard because anybody who knows anything about drink will be aware that rats have a habit of occupying rooms where alcohol, particularly beer, etc., is stored. There is a strong possibility that Weil's disease could be communicated in this way. I accept that the spiking of drinks is a matter for the Department of Health and Children&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the case of Senator Higgins, an issue on which there is complete agreement among all parties, as we saw during the debate on the Order of Business. Senator Hayes has asked that the Minister for Finance come before the House to explain the failure to indemnify Senator Higgins. We will deal with the case of the Member of this House, which is not to downgrade Deputy Howlin. An explanation is needed because any Member of the House could be affected in this way at any time. Senator Hayes was correct in what he said. The Minister for Finance will come before the House tomorrow for the debate on the motion regarding the Ombudsman and we can ask whether he will return for a debate on the case of Senator Higgins.</P>

The reason higher trucks are reckoned to be more environmentally friendly is that because they carry more, there are fewer of them. He wanted an explanation. I have been informed that this matter has been raised at the Joint Committee on Transport. An investigation is taking place and those responsible will come back to the committee with their findings.

      <P>Senator Ryan asked why Ministers accepted invitations to open various facilities for which they subsequently said they were not responsible. I expect it is an honour given to the Minister in question by whatever corporate body. He also asked why Aer Lingus charged 25% more than British Airways for the same flight and at the same time. I do not know whether there is an issue behind that about which we do not know. I agree it is worth pursuing the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also asked why we are not shown the full brutality of what is happening in Iraq. He also called for a debate on industrial relationships because of the development of what he perceives as a macho company director or company manager image. When we return after the recess, we hope to have a debate on the social partnership arrangement and this is an issue which would fit comfortably into that.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the huge number of people who will attend the Special Olympics here in June. It is a public health issue in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus. It is worth exploring that matter with the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris supported Senator Brian Hayes in regard to Senator Higgins, as we all do. He also called for a debate on Iraq and I hope we will be able to have such a debate. He said we were like sheep, although yesterday he said we were of the canine variety. Those on this side of the House are very opinionated and are well able to stand up for themselves and to put forward their own points of view.</P>
      <P>Senator MacSharry referred to work permits. I was contacted this morning about this matter, as I am sure were many other Members. The hotel and hospitality side of industry is most affected. If people have permits, they will not be taken from them but there is an article in the newspaper today about a hotel which will not be able to continue to operate unless it gets new work permits. I will telephone the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's office this morning in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Finucane said 73% of AIDS victims <Col N="873" />come from sub-Saharan Africa and that there should be compulsory screening for AIDS. That issue has been raised on a few occasions but it is generally believed that such screening would be an invasion of the person. I would be of that view. It is a suggestion which has been turned down to date. He also spoke about public health doctors and the incipient strike.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden explained himself yesterday. He is certainly the first campaigning Senator for the next election. He suggested that a delegation from the House go to Palestine. I do not know the mechanisms by which we would send a delegation from this House, as distinct from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, but I will find out.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan asked about the companies Bill which will be taken next Wednesday and for which Senator O'Toole laid the foundations. He also supported his own leader in regard to Senator Higgins.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú made a committed and passionate statement about the wider issue of using Senator Higgins's case in the context of its happening to somebody else. We should try to move it on from the specific, which we want to see addressed, to the generality. Any one of us might be caught through good behaviour. The Senator did not rant about the matter in this House or in the other House but made his case to the relevant Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to public health doctors. I did not realise this issue has been going on for nine years, which seems extraordinary. The Minister for Health and Children always seeks to bring about consensus on such issues and I am sure he is working on this one.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly referred to the EU initiative on which the Commissioner is working in regard to public health and the SARS virus. He asked for clarification in that regard. Senator Glynn supported Senator Finucane's call and went on to talk about the spiking of drinks and the public health disorders which may arise from that.</P>

      <P>An rud atá i gceist ná in aon chomhlacht, ag brath ar an gcomhlacht agus na dualgaisí atá air, beidh dualgaisí ar leith air i leith na Gaeilge. Ní shin le rá go mbeidh air gach seirbhís a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge nó trí Bhéarla. Tá nós ag mo Roinnse nach gcuireann sí ach leaganacha Gaeilge den fhoirm dheontais tithíochta ar fáil i nGaeilge, ar tharla gur deontas tithíochta Gaeltachta atá i gceist agus go bhfuil cailíocht Gaeilge ag teastáil leis an ndeontas a fháil sa gcéad dul síos. Sin seirbhís a chuirtear ar fáil as Gaeilge amháin ach is seirbhís scríofa í. Thiocfadh leis an Roinn duine a fhiosrú faoin ndeontas i mBéarla. Má labharann an iarrthóir i mBéarla, labhartar ar ais leis i mBéarla.</P>
      <P>Má thógaimid ospidéal mar shampla, beidh ar ospidéal i nGaillimh riarsheirbhísí a chur ar fáil nach bhfuil siad ag cur ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge nó trí mheán na Gaeilge agus an Bhéarla, ag brath ar an tseirbhís atá i gceist. D'fhéadfadh sé bheith istigh sa bplean nach gcaithfeadh an príomhanailísí ar rud éigin teicniúil seirbhís a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge go béal mura mbeadh Gaeilge ag an saineolaí áirithe sin.</P>
      <P>Soláthraíonn an Bille seo deis déileáil leis na ceisteanna casta seo. Tá idirdhealú, ní amháin idir an tseirbhís a chuirtear ar fáil i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla, ach ar an mhó a chuirfear ar fáil i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge.</P>
      <P>Mar a phlé muid inné, beimid ag éilimh má chuirtear comhfhreagas i nGaeilge go bhfaighfear freagra i nGaeilge agus beidh sin forleathan. Is rud éagsúil ar fad é agus duine ag caint ar sheirbhís ó speisialtóir mar ní féidir an t-éileamh céanna a dhéanamh mar muna bhfuil an teanga ag an duine sin, ní féidir a éilimh go labharfaidh sé teanga nach bhfuil aige. Is le teacht thar an dua leis an iliomad casta deiseanna agus fadhbanna sin go bhfuil an soláthar ann go ndéanfar go leor seo trí rialacháin ar lámh amháin de agus, ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, trí phleanáil. Níl aon mhíniú eile leis seo. Ní hé nach mbeidh dualgas é ar roinnt comhlachtaí aon seirbhísí a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge. Beidh sin ginearálta ó thaobh comhfhreagrais agus staisiúineoireachta de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Éiríonn fadhb shimplí eile. Phlé muid an cheist <Col N="876" />inné maidir le comharthaí a bheith i nGaeilge amháin. Bheadh sé sin iontach dá mba rud é go raibh an Ghaeltacht mar atá sé sainmhínithe in áiteanna ina bhfuil 90% den phobal ina gcainteoir Ghaeilge ó dhúchas. Tá áiteanna sa nGaeltacht faoi láthair nach bhfuil úsáid na teanga chomh forleathan. Tá mé ag díriú ar cheist na dteorannacha Gaeltachta mar tá áiteanna nach bhfuil ach 30% den phobal a labharann an Ghaeilge go laethiúil. Tá sin trí oiread níos airde ná an áit is airde taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht agus mar sin bhí tionchar ag an stádas Gaeltachta ar an cheantar sin. An bhfuil an Seanadóir a rá in áit mar sin má chuireann dochtúir in ionad sláinte comhartha dátheangach suas go mbeidh sé in aghaidh an dhlí? Sin an fhadhb atá agam leis seo agus sin an fáth go bhfuil an solúbthacht ann. Beidh sé leagtha síos agus cuirfear i bhfeidhm é trid an gcoimisinéir go mbeidh ar chomhlachtaí, ag brath air láidreacht na Gaeilge sa cheantar, seirbhís de leibhéalacha éagsúla a chur ar fáil taobh istigh den nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Beidh seirbhís dá chomhionann i gceist taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht fosta. Leagfar amach é bunaithe ar an éileamh agus ar an soláthar daonna a bheidh ann do dhaoine leis na seirbhísí a chur ar fáil. Níl aon mhaith, mar a rinneamar cheana, a rá go mbeidh iliomad seirbhísí ann agus ansin gan daoine a bheith ann chun iad a chur ar fáil.</P>

B'fhéidir gur ormsa atá an locht toisc nach dtuigim, ach cá bhfuil sé sa Bhille go soiléir go bhfuil sé de chead agamsa comhfhreagras a dhéanamh le gach eagraíocht Stáit agus comhfhreagras a fháil thar n-ais chomh maith? Tá teach samhraidh agam i gceartlár fíor-Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne. I mBéarla amháin a bhí litir a fuair mé ón bPost ag iarraidh orm an raibh ceadúnas teilifíse agam. An bhfuil aon rud sa Bhille seo a chinnteoidh go mbeidh litir i nGaeilge, i dtús báire, má scríobhann eagraíocht cosúil leis An Post go dtí tithe atá i gceartlár na fíor-Ghaeltachta? Má teastaíonn ó dhaoine ina gcónaí in áiteanna mar siúd a chuid gnó a dhéanamh leis an bPost trí Bhéarla, an mbeidh sé de chead acu é sin a chuir in iúl dóibh. An mbeidh sé, i dtús báire, de dhualgas ar eagraíochtaí cosúil leo siúd déileáil le daoine a bhfuil tithe acu i fíor-Ghaeltachtai agus an mbeidh sé de chead acu a bheith ag súil le chomhfhreagras trí Ghaeilge? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Má scríobhaim chuig eagraíocht Stáit, eagraíocht poiblí, nó eagraíocht atá in ainm is a bheith mar eagraíocht poiblí, an mbeidh sé mar san? Cuirim i gcás eagraíocht cosúil le Eircom. Bhíodh sé de cheart agamsa comhfhreagras trí Ghaeilge a dhéanamh le Eircom. An mbeidh sé mar san? Tá an oiread Gaeilge sa telephone directory laghdaithe go mór le blianta anuas. An mbeidh sé de chead ag duine cosúil liomsa &ndash; nó aon duine eile, taobh istigh nó taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht &ndash;<Col N="877" />comhfhreagras a dhéanamh i nGaeilge le heagraíocht nó le comhlacht Stáit agus a bheith cinnte go bhfaighfear thar n-ais comhfhreagras trí Ghaeilge chomh maith?</P>

      <P>Tá soláthar ann leis na rialacháin agus na scéimeanna sin ar fad a dhéanamh. Bí cinnte de sin. Ní bheadh aon fheidhm leis an mBille muna d'fhéadfaí a leithéid a chur i bhfeidhm. An dara rud atá ann ná go bhfuil an coimisinéir ann chun cearta a gcosaint. Beidh treoirlínte leagtha síos faoi na pleananna agus ansin, ar ndóigh, má chuirtear chomhfhreagras chugat, caithfidh tú chomhfhreagras a chur ar ais.</P>
      <P>Chomh maith le sin, beidh an rud nach raibh ann cheana. Beidh an plean ann ag éirí as na treoirlínte agus daigneófar é sin. Tuigimse go laethiúil agus tuigimid uilig go raibh rud éigin in easnamh. Má chlis ar éinne go dtí seo, a dhualgas ó chomhlíonadh, cé a bhí ann chun an dlí a chur i bhfeidhim? Mar shampla, tá comhartha bóthair taobh amuigh de Uachtar Ard, i gContae na Gaillimhe, atá in aghaidh an dlí. Cé atá ann? Ní theastaíonn ón gnáth-dhuine dul chun cúirte. Sin an áit a thagann an coimisinéir teanga i gceist, mar níl le déanamh agat ach scríobh chuige. Chomh maith le sin, tá cumhacht fé alt 28, más buan mo chuimhne, scéim cúitimh le cead na Roinne Airgeadais a chur in áit. Sin rud atá éirithe coitianta, mar shampla, le Bord Soláthar an Leictreachais. Má ghearrtar an cumhacht níos mó ná an oiread seo ama, gheobhaidh tú cúiteamh mar ní cheart go dtarlódh a léithéid.</P>
      <P>Sin, dar liomsa, an áit bhunúsach go bhfuil difríocht idir an rud seo agus rud ar bith a rinneadh cheana. Nuair a cuirtear an plean in áit, ní plean dea-thola a bheidh ann níos mó ach plean a thabharfaidh ceart do shaoránach dul do dtí an coimisinéir agus a rá gur sáraíodh an plean i gcás áirithe. Beidh an cumhacht céanna ag an gcomisinéir agus atá ag an Ombudsman, agus beidh air dul agus cás an tsaoránaigh a throid gan aon dua don saoránach agus, ar ndóigh, déanamh cinnte nach dtarlóidh a leithéid arís. Nuair a choimsíonn tú an t-iomlán sin, feiceann tú gur cineál jigsaw é seo. Nuair a chuireann tú le chéile é tá pictiúr iomlán ann agus tá an rud nach raibh ann go dtí seo, an cur i bhfeidhm, ann. Go dtí seo, bhí na pleananna ann. Bhí an tír lán de phleananna maidir leis an Ghaeilge ach ní raibh aon bhealach ag an saoránach a dhéanamh cinnte go raibh seasamh leis an bplean ach é a bheith ann.</P>

      <P>Tá nithe bunúsacha ardaithe, i ndáiríre, ag an Seanadóir Ó Riain. Más rud é nach bhfuil ar ár gcumas an rud atá i gceist ag an Seanadóir a dhéanamh maidir leis an nGaeilge, glacaim gur ionann é sin agus a rá nach bhfuil ag eirí linn. Bhí dhá rud lárnach sa díospóireacht a bhí againn inné. I dtosach, an stádas atá ag an Ghaeilge sa Bhunreacht, nó an ceart atá ag an saoránach ó thaobh na Gaeilge. An dara rud a bhí i gceist ná go bhfuil beart uileghabhálach i gceist sa reachtaíocht seo. Sé sin le rá, insan <Col N="878" />obair a bheidh á dhéanamh, go mbeidh bunchloch reachtúil ag dul leis.</P>
      <P>Ní féidir, i ndáiríre, labhairt faoi seo gan féachaint ar an gcóras atá luaite ag an Aire. Beidh orainn teacht thar n-ais do dtí an córas sin i ngach díospóireacht a bheidh ann inniu agus amárach, má leanann an díospóireacht ar aghaidh go dtí amárach, chun féachaint an bhfuil sé sin láidir go leor, indéanta agus solúbtha, mar níl éinne atá i bhfábhar na Gaeilge a deir gur féidir a bheith righin iomlán maidir le rudaí. Ag an am gcéanna, caithfimid a rá nach raibh cothram na Féinne á fháil ag daoine gur mhaith leo Gaeilge a úsáid. Tá taithí phearsanta againn go léir. Is cinnte go raibh taithí phearsanta agamsa le blianta fada anuas agus is minic gur ghlac mé leis mar mhasla cuid de na rudaí a tharla nuair a dhein mé iarracht gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge; caithfidh mé é sin a rá.</P>
      <P>Thug mé cúpla sampla inné le cruthú gur féidir leis an gcoras seo a bheith éifeachtach. Luaigh mé na Coimisinéirí Ioncaim &ndash; tá tuiscint agus eolas ag an Seanadóir Ó Riain maidir le sin. Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuair mé seirbhís iomlán trí Ghaeilge ó na Coimisinéirí Ioncaim i gcónaí, gan aon iarracht ró-mhór uaim féin, ó Aonad 88. Bíonn sé i gcónaí an-chabhrach ar fad, an-tuisceanach agus an-bháúil, caithfidh mé a rá. Is é an smaoineamh sa chóras seo ná gur féidir é sin a thógaint mar shampla, agus an rud céanna a dhéanamh i ngach comhlacht phoiblí. Chun é sin a dhéanamh, caithfidh tú féachaint cad atá ag teastáil, cad é an t-ábhar, cad iad na hoifigí a bheidh a teastáil agus cad é an <i>modus operandi</i> a bheidh i gceist.</P>
      <P>Thug mé sampla amháin. Má thógaimid aon chomhairle chontae, bárdas nó Roinn Stáit sa tír, caithfimid a ghlacadh i dtosach nach mbeidh Gaeilge ag gach duine sna comhlachtaí sin. Ní hionann é sin agus a rá nach féidir seirbhís iomlán a chur ar fáil. Caithfimid a thaispeáint, sna pleananna atá i gceist, conas is féidir córas a chur isteach, mar shampla i gComhairle Chontae Tiobraid Árann Theas, á rá seo a leanas: má chuireann duine go bhfuil seirbhís uaidh nó uaithi i nGaeilge glaoch nó cáipéis ag lorg eolais nó aon rud eile, bíodh daoine taobh istigh den chóras atá in ann é sin a dhéanamh gan aon leithscéal nó, a mhalairt, gan aon compliment ag gabháil leis. Ní féidir linn a glacadh a thuilleadh nach bhfuil na daoine ann chun é sin a dhéanamh. Caithfimid cinntiú go bhfuil sé ann agus caithfidh sé sin a bheith sa phlean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá cosaint ann dúinne atá i bhfábhar na Gaeilge sa phlean seo, mar go mbeidh tuarascáil i gceist. Beidh ar an Aire an tuarascáil sin a chur os comhair Tithe an Oireachtais. Tá coimisinéir i gceist. Beidh an coimisinéir sin neamhspleách agus beidh air gníomhaíocht a thabhairt dúinn cosúil le gnáth-Ombudsman, agus tuigimid cé chómh héifeachtach is atá an Ombudsman. Beimid ag brath ar an gcóras iomlán. Tá sé an-deacair cuid bheag den chóras nó den phlean seo a thógaint gan féachaint ar an phlean iomlán. Glacaim agus aontaím leis an Seanadóir Ó Riain gur rudaí bunúsacha atá á ardú aige. Caithfimid <Col N="879" />a bheith cinnte go bhfuil an córas in ann na rudaí sin a chlúdú agus a láimhseáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Rinne mé iarracht inné cúpla focal a chur le chéile le mo smaointe a leíríu don Teach ach ní raibh an t-ádh liom.</P>
      <P>I will revert to Irishman's English. A fundamental issue is being raised in terms of the current position of the Irish language and how the Minister envisages the evolution of the programme for its ongoing development. It begs the fundamental question that has existed down through the decades about the promotion of Irish by the State, State bodies and successive Ministers. It also begs the question as to which is the best method, namely, to direct and dictate or enable and facilitate.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that this is the central issue and I ask the Minister to correct me if I am mistaken. Everybody in favour of the Irish language would be warmly and enthusiastically supportive of what Senator Ó Murchú has said, namely, that when a person communicates in Irish, either orally or in writing, with a public body, the State should make a positive effort that the communication is responded to in the Irish language. I am in favour of that proposal and I know in recent times there has been a warming of attitude and response to the promotion of Irish outside the Gaeltacht. However, I must acknowledge reality. I am a teacher and I am reluctant to admit that at all levels of the public service and even within the teaching profession there is a reluctance and a shyness &ndash; it could, perhaps, be called a lethargy &ndash; towards making a spontaneous response in Irish, whether orally or in writing.</P>
      <P>The Minister's strategy has been well articulated by Senator Ó Murchú. The Minister has set out an overall framework in the Bill. There are mechanisms within that framework such as the scheme, the commissioner and the arrangement for reporting back. The Minister has established an ability for all schemes from the public bodies and local authorities to be examined by him. The Bill gives him the power to scrutinise and to make further recommendations to the relevant bodies and local authorities. That is the right approach, the bealach ceart that he should follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that Senator Ryan has always promoted the Irish language and that his heart is in the right place in that regard. I wish that, like the Senator, I had the ability to express myself in Irish. Mistakes have been made too often in the past such as in pre-Bord na Gaeilge days. All too often there was an enticement to be dictatorial. Those who were so anxious and so committed to the promotion of the use of the Irish language sometimes had an attitude that smacked of elitism and arrogance towards the poor souls like me and others who are anxious to speak Irish, even though we are not able to be articulate in the Irish language. I have a vocabulary that I am <Col N="880" />unable to put together in the form of structured speech.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred on numerous occasions yesterday to féinmhuinín &ndash; self-confidence. Many people who are motivated to speak Irish are not self-confident in their ability. We must try to encourage people and tap into the goodwill that exists. This is my interpretation and if I am wrong I will be delighted for the Minister correct me. I do not agree with a dictatorial approach that tells people they must reply in Irish on all occasions to a communication made in Irish. I am familiar with people in public bodies, Government Departments and local authorities, who will be put off by such an approach. We must encourage and enable the use of the language to build on the goodwill that exists for the Irish language. I do not wish to take away from the sound principles enunciated by Senator Ryan.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 18, to delete from and including &ldquo;(other&rdquo; in line 19, down to and including &ldquo;schedule&rdquo; in line 22.</P>
      <P>I am standing in for Senator McHugh. I agree with the views expressed by Senator Fitzgerald. There is a great fund of goodwill towards the Irish language. We are all trying to catch up on what we have forgotten. Senator Fitzgerald and I have taken some practical steps in that regard and we are awaiting a further call.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I agree with the Senator. We do not wish to see any arrogance or elitism because it is only through love of the language and not by any recurrence of failed past policies that it will advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is that the First Schedule of the Bill refers to public companies which may be privatised in the future. From our experience of the privatisation of Eircom, people who had always received an Irish language service from Telecom Éireann had to fight hard to retain even a limited service. We cannot understand why the State, which has invested heavily in public bodies since its foundation, should not attach a condition in favour of our national language when disposing of these companies. Rights are again being denied and that is the argument <Col N="881" />Senator McHugh has asked me to advance on his behalf.  </P>

      <P>An phríomhaidhm leis an Bhille seo ná seirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil ar bhunús níos forleithne agus ar chaighdeán i bhfad níos airde. Tá ceist chasta ann faoi iar-chomhlachtaí agus comhlachtaí príobháideacha. Ba é mo thuairim agus mé ag réiteach an Bhille gurbh fhearr déileáil i dtosach báire leis an 300 comhlacht &ndash; eagraíochtaí, Ranna Stáit, údaráis áitiúla agus a leithéid &ndash; a thagann faoi réimse an Stáit. Ní féidir le aon cheist a bheith air sin. Tá foráil sa gCéad Sceideal den Bhille go leanfaidh réimse an Achta amach seo d'earnálacha seachas an earnáil phoiblí.</P>
      <P>Níl chomhlachtaí príobháideacha san áireamh go sonrach san fhoráil atá muid ag plé ar chúis atá leagtha amach cheana féin. Tá muid ag tógáil san áireamh na costais a bheidh ag baint agus an t-ualach airgid míreasúnta a bhféadfadh a bheith i gceist do na comhlachtaí seo.</P>
      <P>Má tá muid ag dul déileáil leis na hiar-chomhlachtaí Stáit atá príobháideach anois, is dócha nach bhfuil aon bhealach sin a dhéanamh ach i gcomhréir leis na comhlachtaí a bheadh in iomaíocht leo. Luaigh an Seanadóir Eircom ach, go fadtéarmach, ó tharla gur comhlacht príobháideach sin, ní bheadh sé reasúnta plé leis ar bhealach a bheadh difriúil ó chomhlachtaí eile teileachumarsáide atá ag cur na seirbhísí ceannan céanna ar fáil. Tuigimid freisin ón mBille Míchumais nuair atá ualach mór costais i gceist do chomhlachtaí phríobháideacha go dtagann ceisteanna áirithe eile suas fosta. Mar sin, tá an chuid den Bhille dírithe ar rud atá muid ag tabhairt comhlacht poiblí air. Cuimsíonn sé sin na heagraíochtai ar fad atá luaite sa sceideal. Má cuirfear an méid sin i gcrích fágfaidh mé ag comharba de mo chuid an chuid eile a dhéanamh, mar feicfidh na Seanadóirí go bhfuil leathanach i ndiaidh leathanaigh de eagraíochtái a bheas orainn a Ghaelú, a bheag nó a mhór, i gceist sa mhéid sin amháin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tacaím leis an leasú seo. Tá meon an Rialtais seo, agus b'fhéidir pé Rialtas a thiocfaidh ina dhiaidh, dírithe i dtreo príobháidiú chuid mhaith des na heagraíochtaí a chuireann seirbhísí poiblí ar fáil. Tá sé ar intinn Bord Soláthar an Leictreachais a phríobháidiú. Tá daoine in ard-bhainistíocht an chomhlachta san ag iarraidh go bpríobháideofaí é. Má déantar san agus má athraítear an eagraíocht san sa chaoi is gur eagraíocht príobháideach í, cad a tharlóidh don dualgas a cheapaimid atá uirthi faoi láthair gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge le pé duine a iarrann sin? Má leantar leis san beidh an córas teileafóin agus an córas soláthar leictreachais príobháidithe agus beidh siad ábalta éalú ó na dualgais atá ar comhlachtaí poiblí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní dóthain a rá go bhfuil an cheist casta agus ní ghlacaim leis go bhfuil ceist bhunreachtúil ag baint leis &ndash; toisc go bhfuil príomh áit na Gaeilge leagtha amach sa Bhunreacht &ndash; ná go mbeadh <Col N="882" />comhlacht ábalta a rá go raibh rud éigin míbhunreachtúil á bhrú. Glacaim leis, nuair atá trí nó ceithre cinn de chomhlachtaí ann ar nós Esat agus na comhlachtaí eile, go mbeidh orainn a chinntiú go mbeidh na dualgais céanna ar na comhlachtaí go léir. Ní dóigh liom gur féidir liom gnó dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge le Vodafone, le O2 nó le Meteor. Sa sean-chóras nuair a bhí Eircell sa chóras poiblí ceapaim go raibh sé de chead agamsa gnó a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge leis. Tá mé cinnte nach féidir aon cheann des na directory inquiries atá ar fáil sa tír seo a úsáid trí Ghaeilge, fiú amháin más uimhir teileafóin na meánscoile lán Ghaelach ina bhfuil mo mhac ag dul ar scoil atá á lorg. Nuair a bhí mé ag lorg uimhir teileafóin na scoile bhí orm an t-ainm a litriú go mall don duine a bhí ag freagairt an teileafóin dom agus é sin a dhéanamh dhá uair, toisc a laghad Gaeilge a bheith ag an tseirbhís san.</P>
    <P>Níl an cheist seo simplí. Tá cúpla rud a dhein damáiste don Ghaeilge. Ceann amháin an iomarca béime ar bhrú ar dhaoine rudaí a dhéanamh nár theastaigh uathu a dhéanamh agus droch chaighdeán múinte Gaeilge agus na rudaí a théann leis. An dara rud ná an tseafóid agus an cur i gcéill ag na daoine a deir rud amháin agus a dhéanann rud eile. Go luath i ndiaidh bhunú an Stáit deineadh an Ghaeilge éiginteach do phost ar bith sa chóras poiblí, ach amháin i dTithe an Oireachtais. An t-aon jab go bhféadfá a lorg agus a fháil agus gnó a dhéanamh in iomlán trí Bhéarla ann ná ballraíocht Thithe an Oireachtais. Ní raibh an Ghaeilge éiginteach ariamh do Bhaill an Oireachtais ach shochraigh siad cinneadh go mbeadh sí éiginteach do gach éinne eile ach iad féin. Sin an rud a chuaigh a bhfeidhm ar dhaoine agus a dhein damáiste do chúis na Gaeilge. Má labhraímid faoi spriocanna agus ag an am gcéanna, má fhágaimid saor eagraíochtaí móra príobháideacha atá ag déanamh teagmhála leis an ghnáth duine gach lá, agus más rud é go mbíonn oifig an Bord Soláthar an Leictreachtais i nGaillimh, sa Daingean nó in áiteanna eile agus muna bhfuil sé soiléir, má déantar iad a phríobháidiú, go bhfuil sé de chead ag pobal na Gaeilge agus ag pobal na Gaeltachta gnó a dhéanamh go compordach trí Ghaeilge, ní fiú an Bille seo. Caithfear smaoineamh faoin gcóras poiblí áit is a bhaineann sé le seirbhísí poiblí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Níl sé sásúil ná ceart nach féidir seirbhís a fháil trí Ghaeilge ar an mbonn. Tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir Ó Riain. Má bhíonn duine ag lorg cabhrach caithfear an rud a phlé as Béarla. Níl sé sin sásúil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a bheidh comhlacht á dhéanamh príobháideach caithfimid féachaint go bhfuil coinníolacha áirithe ins an conradh le cinntiú go dtabharfar seirbhís trí Ghaeilge. Más rud é gur tharla sé in aon tír eile ní bheadh ionadh ar éinne go raibh a leithéid de choinníol ann. Muna féidir linn an timpeallacht iomlán a Ghaelú mar sin beimid i gcónaí ag teacht thar n-ais chun na ceiste seo a plé. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire in ann smaoineamh ar sin am éigin taobh istigh dá Roinn <Col N="883" />agus moltaí a thabhairt don Rialtas do chásanna den saghas seo.</P>
    <P>Bíonn comhlachtaí príobháideacha i gcónaí ag déanamh suirbhéanna ar dhearcadh a gcustaiméirí. Tá an-chuid daoine a bhfuil an Ghaeilge á úsáid acu agus roinnt eile atá báúil don Ghaeilge. Ba chóir go mbeadh comhlacht sásta féachaint air sin mar rud atá tairfeach dó féin. Ní rud diúltach atá i gceist anseo. Caithfimid a bheith sásta dul i gcomhairle leis na comhlachtaí seo, ar leibhéal an-ard, le míniú dóibh go mbeadh an Stát ag súil go mbeadh seirbhís den saghas sin ann. Ní leor ráiteas a chur amach ná litir a scríobh nó, fiú amháin, gearáin a dhéanamh ach comhairle bunúsach a chur chucu go bhfuilimid-ne dáiríre faoi stádas na Gaeilge agus gurb é an tuairm atá againn ná gur chóir go mbeadh seirbhísí den saghas sin le fáil. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire, am éigin, in ann féachaint air sin. Tá súil agam nach bhfuíl ins an Bhille seo ach tús agus go bhfuil sé i gceist againn forbairt agus leathnú a dhéanamh amach anseo.</P>

      <P>Caithfidh na Seanadóirí breathnú, i gCéad Sceideal, ar an sainmhíniú ar chomhlacht poiblí. Má dhéanann siad sin feicfidh siad go bhfuil na Ranna Stáit agus na heagraíochtaí Stáit ar fad luaite. Luaitear údaráis áitiula agus boird sláinte. Ansin déantar tagairt do na heagraíochtaí deonacha a fhaigheann an chuid is mó dá gcuid airgid ón gciste phoiblí. Beidh leasú a thabhairt isteach maidir le comhlachtaí a oibríonn faoi cheadúnas ón Stát. Nuair a bheidh sin ar fad cuimsithe, is mór an méid a bheidh déanta, ach níl comhlachtaí príobháideacha sa gcíall an gharáiste áitiúla agus mar sin luaite. Tá brí uafásach leathan a thabhairt i gCéad Sceideal ar an chiall a bhaineann le comhlacht poiblí.</P>
      <P>Bhí imní orm nuair a bhí muid ag dréachtú an Bhille. Chuir mé ceist faoina heagraíochtaí deonacha ar fad atá ag fáil 90% dá gcuid airgid ón Rialtas. Tá go leor acu faoi chúram mo Roinn féin. Cá seasann siad? Tá soláthar déanta sa mBille don chineál eagraíochta sin, d'eagraíochtaí a dhéantar príobháideach agus d'eagraíochtaí a bhfuil feidhm i ndáil leis an phobal i gcoitinne acu.

      <P>Ní fhaca mé an fhomhír sin faoi. Ní chlúdaíonn atá ar siúl ag an Aire, áfach, Eircom nó na heagraíochtaí eile teileafóin. Tá Eircom príobháidithe cheana agus tá deacracht ann. Ní hé go bhfuil deacrachtaí teangan ag pobal na Gaeltachta, mar tá Béarla níos fearr ag a lán daoine sna Gaeltachtaí ná mar atá agam. Is minic a ceartaíodh mo chuid Bhéarla ag daoine ón nGaeltacht. Ní chóir go mbeadh orthu, afach, gnó a dhéanamh le córas chomh forleathan leis an gcóras teileafóin trí Bhéarla. Glacaim go bhfuil sé leagtha amach ag an Aire leis an todhchaí ach tá deacrachtaí ann anois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" />Tuigim nach mbeadh sé ceart dualgas dleathach a chur ar eagraíochtaí beaga ach déarfaidh cuid mhór gurbh é an gheit is mó a bhaintear astu nuair a théann siad isteach i bpub, siopa nó bialann sa nGaeltacht ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge bheag acu a úsáid agus freagraítear as Béarla iad. Níl sé ró-olc nuair a thiteann sé amach gur eachtrannaigh atá ag obair sna bialanna agus na tithe tábhairne ach nuair atá daoine ón Ghaeltacht ag obair agus is cuma leo Béarla nó Gaeilge is rud difriúil é.</P>
    <P>Seo ceist airgid. Má leanfaidh cúrsaí mar sin sna Gaeltactaí, caillfidh siad dea-thoil middle Ireland a cheapann go bhfuil rud éigin faoi leith sna Gaeltachtaí a tharraingíonn don áit iad. Tá daoine ann a dhéarfadh gurbh é ceann de na fáthanna go bhfuil Corca Dhuibhne ag tarraingt isteach níos mó cúirteoirí ná áiteacha eile atá chomh hálainn ná go bhfuil Gaelainn ann agus go gceapann daoine go bhfuil rud eile ann seachas an áilleacht agus an fharraige. Is fíor Gaeltacht í fós ach d'fhéadfadh duine dhul isteach i siopa in Iarthar Dhuibhne gan a bheith cinnte go gcloisfeadh sé Gaelainn. Tá daoine cosúil liom féin ann a bhfuil taithí acu cé acu siopa nó pub gur féidir Gaelainn a úsáid agus siopa nach fiú mar má labharann sé Gaeilge, ligeann siad orthu nach dtuigeann siad.</P>
    <P>Ní ábhar a bhaineann leis an reachtaíocht seo é ach baineann sé le fealsúnacht an reachtaíochta &ndash; conas a spreagtar eagraíochtaí cosúil leo siúd rud a dhéanamh atá fiúntach ó thaobh tradála agus airgid. Bheidís ina suí go te dá mbeadh dearcadh níos fearr acu ar an Ghaelainn.</P>

      <P>Tá nóta anseo faoin Sceideal agus freagróidh sé an cheist go cuimsitheach. Sé an aidhm atá ag fómhíreanna (1) go (5) an Chéid Sceidil ná meicníocht a chur ar fáil chun scóip an Bhille a leathnú amach anseo chuig earnálacha, seachas an earnáil phoiblí, a sholáthraíonn sheirbhísí go díreach don phobail &ndash; na bainc, cuideachtaí arachais, cuideachtaí teileachumarsáide agus mar sin. Beimid ag plé sin ar ball agus nuair a thiocfaimid go dtí sin, feicfidh an Seanadóir go bhfuil freagra don cheist sa Chéad Sceideal. Beimid ag teacht ar ais le leasú teicniúil air seo ar Chéim na Tuarascála.</P>
      <P>Glacaim leis an gceist mar tá an líne a bhíodh ann idir seirbhísí poiblí agus seirbhísí príobháideacha ag athrú de shíor sa tír seo. Tá páirtnéireachtaí agus fo-eagraíochta atá ag soláthar seirbhísí don Stát ann agus tá méadú mór ar eagraíochtaí deonacha fosta. Tá an sceideal ann leis sin ar fad a chuimsiú. Ní chuirfidh seo isteach ar an ghruaigeoir áitiúil, ní bheidh air plean a réitiú, tá na réimsí móra i gceist anseo.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom féin an t-atmasféar a fheiceáil ag athrú. Sé mo thaithí féin ná cibé áit a théim sa nGaeltacht gur labhartar Gaeilge liom ach lena cheartú do mhuintir Chonnemara, ní smaoiním go rachfaidís isteach i bpub ag labhairt Béarla le muintir an tí i bhfíorGhaeltacht Chonnemara mar ní shin an nós atá againn mar phobal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tuigim, áfach, a dúirt an Seanadóir agus is rud <Col N="885" />é a chuireann imní orm mar go minic. Braithim nár éirigh linn fós a chur in iúl do phobal na Gaeltachta an buntáiste atá acu agus an Ghaeilge a bheith acu ó dhúchas. Níl aon ghasúr sa nGaeltacht nach bhfuil Béarla aige, níl siad ar nós fiú 30 bliain go bhféadfadh duine a fhás suas gan mórán Béarla. Mar thuismitheoir Ghaeltachta, níl fadhb ag mo ghasúir ná aon ghásúr a tógadh le Gaeilge sa nGaeltacht an Béarla a shealbhú ag aois scoile.</P>
    <P>Dá bhféadfainn meon an dátheangachais a bheith againn, meon nach bhfuil ag iarraidh a rá nach mbeidh éinne gan Béarla sa tír seo, ní bheadh buntáiste ar bith a rá go bhfuil rogha ag daoine go mbeadh pubanna Gaeltachta dhátheangach ná aontheangach Gaeilge. Is fearr i bhfad go mbeidís dhátheangach, trítheangach agus ceithretheangach ach go mbeadh an nós ann atá ag go leor de an tíortha san Eorap &ndash; an Iorruaidh agus an tSualainn agus an Fhionlainn &ndash; a dteanga féin a labhairt eatarthu féin ach an Béarla agus teangacha eile ar a dtoil acu freisin. Sin an bóthar ba cheart dúinn bheith ag iarraidh a dhul.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar alt 11, is é mo thuairim go nglacann gach éinne go bhfuil dúil agam sa Gaelainn agus go bhfuilim ana-bhádhúil di, ach ní fhéadar an fiú brú a chur ar eagraíochtaí cuntais iniúchtha nó ráitis airgeadais a fhoilsiú trí Gaelainn. Is ceist ana-theicniúil í. Níl aon mheas agamsa, mar shampla, ar bhrú a chur ar an EPA Gaeilge a chur <Col N="886" />ar pháipéar teicniúil faoi staid abhna ó thaobh truallithe de. Tá an oiread sin focal taobh istigh de leagan Gaeilge mar seo nach dtuigfeadh duine ar bith sna Gaeltachtaí é. Fiú má scríobhtar tuarascáil teicniúil den saghas seo as Gaelainn, má léitear sna Gaeltachtaí é, is i mBéarla a léifear é, mar is i mBéarla i ndáiríribh a scríobhadh é. Ansin, déantar aistriúchán go Gaelainn. Níl mé chun argóinte fhada a chur ar siúl faoi seo, ach is cóir dúinn bheith praticiúil.</P>
      <P>Thugas faoi dheara, nuair a bhíos ag déanamh taighde ó thaobh comhshaoil de le mo chairde ón Danmhairg, gur athraíodar ón Danais go Béarla go rialta. Ba fhocail Bhéarla iad cuid mhaith de na focail theicniúla a d'úsáideadar faoi cheisteanna comhshaoil. Ó thaobh airgid a chaitheamh ar chur chun cinn na Gaelainne de, níl mé cinnte an bhfuil mórán maithis á dhéanamh don Gaelainn trí tuarascála teicniciúla a aistriú go Gaelainn. Níl mé chun ceiste fhada a dhéanamh di, ach mholfainn don Aire smaoineamh faoi seo. Ní fiú tuarascála teicniciúla a aistriú. Má tá duine ag cur amach tuarascála faoi the intricacies of microwave technology, cad is fiú am agus airgead a chur amú trí iad a aistriú go Gaelainn? Ní thuigfeadh fiú amháin muintir na Gaeltachta iad.</P>

      <P>Níl a fhios agam cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé díreach ag an am seo, ach i gcónaí, éiríonn leis an Seanadóir Ó Riain rud a rá a spreagann diospóireacht. Níl mé 100% ar a thaobh sa rud seo, ach tuigim an rud atá i gceist aige ag an am gcéanna.</P>
      <P>Is breá liomsa tuarascáil a fheiceáil i nGaeilge, fiú munar féidir liom í a thuiscint. Ar slí, cabhraíonn sé leis an perception ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Tá sé cosúil le comharthaí bóithre atá dátheangach. Tá daoine ann a fhiafraíonn cad ina thaobh a bhfuil Gaeilge ann más rud é go bhfuil Béarla ann chomh maith. An rud a deirimse i gcónaí ná, nuair a bhíonn Gaeilge ar na comharthaí bóithre, ar slí éigin, tá an timpeallacht Gaelaithe.</P>
      <P>Tá sé sin tábhachtach mar is é sin an laige is mó atá ann ó thaobh dul chun cinn na Gaeilge de &ndash; gur féidir le duine breis agus 12 bhliain a chaitheamh ar scoil gan muinín a bheith aige nó aici dhá abairt a chur le chéile lasmuigh den scoil. Is ceann de na deacrachtaí é ná an timpeallacht atá lasmuigh den scoil féin, áit nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge le feiceáil. Níl mé ró-chinnte cé chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé, ach ba bhreá liom an méid sin a rá. Ar aon nós, tá cáipéis bhreise ann as Gaeilge, nó táimid ag cabhrú leis an perception go bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga labhartha agus úsáideach sa tír, ach is í an cheist an mbeadh i bhfad ní ba mhó ama ag teastáil chun  a phlé.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm gur ardaigh an Seanadóir an cheist seo, mar shíl mise go mbeadh daoine caite nach bhfuil á ndóthain doiciméad leagtha síos ansin. Chonaic mé daoine agus iad á rá go mba cheart dom éileamh go n-aistreofaí chuile fhocal a deirtear i gceachtar an dá Thí agus <Col N="887" />sna cúirteanna thar bharr ó Bhéarla go Gaeilge nó ó Ghaeilge go Béarla. Tá a fhios againne mar Bhall an dá Thí an méid labhartha a chuirtear amach, agus is cuma cé chomh minic nó a mhalairt agus a léitear iad.</P>
      <P>Ag dul ar ais go dtí an fhealsúnacht a bhí ann 20 bliain ó shin, nuair a cuireadh an cheist seo orm, bhí mé féin agus m'athair mór, Dónall Ó Móráin &ndash; go ndéana Dia grásta ar a anam &ndash; ag argóint faoin gceist seo. Bhíodh muid ag sárú faoi cé acu ba thábhachtaí &ndash; reachtaíocht na tíre a aistriú go Gaeilge nó go mbeadh Gaeilge ar a phaicéad Cornflakes. Bhí mise i gcónaí i bhfabhar an phaicéad Cornflakes. Dúirt mé go léadh chuile dhuine sa tír é sin. Ní mórán daone, i measc mo charad ar aon bhealach, a chaitheann am ag léamh Achtanna agus iad ag dul a chodladh san oíche nó i rith an lae. Bhí mise i gcónaí dírithe ar an rud is mó a mbeadh tionchar aige ar an ngnáth-phobal ó lá go lá.</P>
      <P>Ar an dtaobh eile den sceal, ghlac mé leis i gcónaí go raibh rudaí bunúsacha ann, agus sin an fáth go bhfuil an focal &ldquo;reachtaíocht&rdquo; luaite. Sin an fáth go bhfuil bundoiciméid agus bunpholasaí poiblí luaite. Tá an ceart aige nach bhfuil aon dualgas anseo <i>per se</i> gach doiciméad den EPA nó gach rud teicniúil a aistriú. Ni hé sin an public policy statement. Bheadh orthu, áfach, an straitéis phoiblí &ndash; an bundoiciméad a leagann amach cad a dhéanann an EPA &ndash; a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge chomh maith le Béarla &ndash; an tuarascáil bhliantúil.</P>
      <P>Tugaimse é sin faoi deara anois go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó eagraíochtaí ag cur ráitis ó chathaoirligh amach i nGaeilge is i mBéarla ar a laghad. Ní fadhb an-mhór í an tuarascáil bhliantúil a chur amach go dátheangach. Má chuirtear an tuarascáil amach, go hiondúil bíonn na cuntais in éineacht léi. Is iad na audited accounts na cúntais a bhfuil muid ag tagairt dóibh &ndash; na cuntais iniúchtha. Bíonn siad ar chúl na tuarascála, agus beidh sé sin dátheangach. Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh polasaí stráiteisiach faoin Public Service Management Act 1997 agus na rudaí eile a chuala muid á gcur ar fáil. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an iomarca ann sin, agus is dóigh liom go leagann sé síos bunús. Déanfaimid rudaí eile ina dhiaidh sin, de réir a chéile agus de réir úsáide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí plé ollmhór gur cheart go mbeadh chuile fhoirm sa tír dátheangach. Tá rian foirmeacha ann nach mbaintear úsáid astu ach trí huaire sa bhlian, agus b'fhéidir 100 leathanach iontu. Ba cheart dúinn tosacht leis na foirmeacha sin a úsáideann chuile dhuine. Mar shampla, is beag duine fostaithe sa tír nach bhfuil ceadúnas tiomána aige nó aici. Tá go leor daoine ann a bhfuil carranna acu. Bíonn ar dhaoine cáin bhóthair a íoc. Tagann an fhoirm iniúchta sa bpost. Bíonn orm fios a chur orthu, agus tagann sé i nGaeilge. Tá sé chomh simplí sin nach fadhb ar bith é an rud a líonadh. Sin an cineál bealaigh agus cur chuige, ach, cé go nglacaim leis na pointí atá déanta, sílim go bhfuil rudaí áirithe bunúsacha ann ar cheart <Col N="888" />dúinn iad a dhéanamh go dátheangach ón tús. Is é sin atá leagtha síos sa mBille mar atá.</P>
    <P>Aon phointe atá déanta, beidh mé ag déanamh machnaimh air, ach níl muid ag cur an uafáis ualaigh ar aon chomhlacht na cuntais iniúchtha a chur amach go dátheangach in éineacht leis an tuarascáil bhliantúil uair amháin sa mbliain.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist amháin agam. An rud is mó a d'fhoghlaim mé ón Seanadóir Quinn ná an tréimhse ama ina dhéanfar na rudaí seo. Is é a deirtear ann ná: &ldquo;The Minister shall issue to public bodies guidelines&rdquo;, &ldquo;Eiseoidh an tAire treoirlínte&rdquo;. Ní chím aon téarma ama taobh istigh de sin. An bhfuil aon chinneadh déanta ag an Aire ar cé chomh tapaidh agus a chuirfear na treoirlínte amach nó an mbeimid ag súil leo le blianta?</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh treoirlínte againn an fómhar seo chugainn, ach tá ceist níos casta ná sin i gceist. Tiocfaidh sé aníos arís agus arís eile. Feicfear go bhfuil an Sceideal, a phléfimid ar ball,chomh leathan agus a d'fhéadfadh sé a bheith. An fhadhb phraicticiúil a bheidh againn, ní i gceist na treoirlínte mar déanfar iad sin a réiteach díreach tar éis don Bhille a bheith achtaithe agus ní don eisiúint ag an gcéad dream go mbeimid ag iarraidh pleananna uaidh, ach ansin beidh orainn iad a scrúdú agus níl aon mhaith pleananna a fháil muna mbíonn siad foirfe, muna dhéanann siad déileáil le ceist na Gaeltactha agus mar sin de. An fhadhb a bheidh ann go mbeidh sé an-deacair, leis an iliomad comhlachtaí agus na fo-eagrachtaí eile a thagann faoin Sceideal, scála ama cinnte a chur leis.</P>
      <P>Tá mé ag ceapadh gurb é an faitíos a bheadh ar daoine ná go mbéadh leisce ar an Roinn nó gan mórán dúil ag an Aire dul ar aghaidh agus na pleananna seo a éileamh ar na heagraisí poiblí. Céard a tharlódh sa chás sin? Tá sé ráite agam go minic nuair a árdaítear an cheist go bhfuil súil agam go mbeidh mé sa bhFreasúra nuair a tharlaíonn sé sin.</P>

      <P>B'fhéidir nach bhfuil, b'fhéidir go bhfuil, ach feicfimid. Beidh spraoi ann mar beidh ceist Dála ag chuile Theachta cathain go mbeidh sé i gceist treoirlínte a eisiúint go eagraíocht A agus cathain go mbeidh sé i gceist cur faoin bplean. Caithfimid ligean don daonlathas feidhmiú. Ní féidir scála ama a chur leis an méid atá sa Chéad Sceideal. Níl éinne anseo in ann a rá liom cén fhad a thógfaidh sé sin. Sin í an fhadhb.</P>
      <P>Ansin bíonn daoine ag caint air go bhféadfadh cuid acu áirid a luadh agus go gcaithfear a dhéanamh taobh istigh de thréimhse ama. Cén chaoi a roghnófar iad? Mar shampla, bhéadh fonn orm go fíor-luath díriú ar na heagraíochtaí is mó atá ag plé le pobal na Gaeltachta go laethúil. Tá roinnt údaráis aitiúla i gceist ansin go mór, roinnt boird sláinte agus, dár ndóigh, roinnt Ranna Stáit, ar nós an Roinn Talmhaíochta agus Bia, an Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh agus mar sin de. Sin é an chaoi go gcaithfear iad a phiocadh ach níor mhaith liom go dtabharfaí aon tuairim do dhreamanna áirid nach bhfuil tábhacht ag baint leo sin ach oiread. Sin í an fhadhb.</P>
      <P>Bhí go leor cur is cúiteamh agus machnamh le déanamh faoi seo. Sílim féin dá mbéadh Aire faillíoch faoin rud seo a bhrú chun cinn, tá mé ag ceapadh go mbeadh an Freasúra ina dhiaidh go scioptha dá mbeadh aon mhaitheas leis. Tá me cinnte go bhfuil éifeacht leis an bhFreasúra atá againn i láthair na huaire.</P>

      <P>Tá ceist amháin agam don Aire. Glacaim leis go bhfuil jab mór le déanamh chun na treoirlínte seo a chur le chéile agus a chur i bhfeidhm, ach tá liosta fada eagraíochtaí luaite &ndash; rud nach gcuirfinn ina choinne mar tá a lán eagraíochtaí go mbeadh tuairimí agam faoi. An <Col N="890" />mbéadh an tAire sásta a rá nach bhfanfaidh sé nó sí go dtí go bhfuil an eagraíocht is déanaí críochnaithe le chur thar n-ais chuige na tuairimí faoi treoirlínte agus nach mbeidh an Roinn Stáit is lú suime sa Ghaeilge ábalta moill a chur ar an rud go léir? Tá a lán eagraíochtaí agus is minic go gcuirtear moill ar reachtaíocht toisc nach dtaitníonn sé le Roinn amháin agus cuireann sé moill air trí bheith mall ag cur a chuid tuairimí a chur thar nais go dtí an issuing Department. Bhéadh eagla orm go mbeadh an-mhoill curtha ar an bpróiséas. An bhfuil aon tuairimí ag an Aire faoi sin?</P>

      <P>Réiteofar na treoirlínte agus caithfear tuairimí a lorg. Muna dtagann siar ar ais, féadfar brú ar aghaidh. An rud a bheadh i gceist i dtosach báire ná na treoirlínte a réiteach agus éileamh a dhéanamh ar na dreamanna is mó a mbíonn plé acu go laethúil leis an bpobal, na pleananna a réiteach ag éirí as na treoirlínte. Tá sprioc iomlán ama i gceist ansin. Tá teorann leis an am gur féidir le daoine a thógáil ag réiteach na bpleananna sin. Mar sin, ní féidir leis an moilleadóireacht, a bhfuil faitíos ar an Seanadóir Ó Riain roimhe, tarlú.</P>
      <P>An t-aon duine amháin go bhféadfadh moill a chur air ná an tAire. Ach acmhainn foirne a bheith agam, níl i gceist agam é sin a dhéanamh. Beidh aonad ag plé leis seo go leanúnach. Ní shin fhadhb. Ní féidir le héinne moill a chur ar seo seachas an fhadbh phraiticiúil ag plé le na pleananna agus déanamh cinnte go bhfuil siad foirfe. Ní bheadh aon mhaith bheith ag cur 300 pleananna tríd nach raibh aon mhaith leo. Caithfidh siad díriú ar sain-cheisteanna éagsúla. Má thógfaimid na heagraíochtaí atá ag plé leis an bpobal, beidh sain-cheisteanna áirithe i gceist i mBaile Átha Cliath, áit a bhfuil daonra an-mhór agus mar sin, cé gur céatadán an-bheag den daonra iad lucht labhartha na Gaeilge sa chathar, is pobal réasúnta mór iad san iomlán. Ansin, tá na Gaeltachtaí thiar agus mar sin de. Beidh ar na pleananna díriú ar sheirbhís a chur ar fáil. Tá roinnt áirithe staidéir déanta ar, mar shampla, an gcaoi go ndéantar a leithéid i gCeanada.</P>

      <P>Seo an cheist is tábhachtaí atá á phlé againn anois maidir leis an mBille &ndash; conas is féidir é seo a chur i gcrích agus cé chomh tapaidh agus cé chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir linn é a dhéanamh? Tá tuairim agam nach treoirlínte amháin a bheidh i gceist ná ag teastáil ó na comhlachtaí poiblí seo. Beidh cabhair ag teastáil chomh maith le gach rud eile. Táim cinnte nuair a bheidh an tAire ag smaoineamh ar an bplean seo a chur i gcrích go bhféadfaimis féachaint air cad díreach a bheidh ag teastáil ó na comhlachtaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá scéim amháin cheana féin, mar shampla, gur féidir le daoine go bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus gur bhreá leo freastal ar an nGaeltacht, saoire a fháil chun é sin a dhéanamh. Ceapaim gur ag Gaeleagras atá sé sin á láimhseáil. Is fiú smaoineamh freisin amach anseo go mbeadh <Col N="891" />Gaeleagras, agus b'fhéidir daoine eile sásta féachaint air, seans a thabhairt do dhaoine a bheadh ag feidhmiú ins na comhlachtaí chun an phlean a chur i gcrích freastal ar an nGaeltacht, ní chun Gaeilge a fhoghlaim ach chun téarmaíochta agus modh oibre a fhoghlaim trí Ghaeilge maidir le é seo a chur i bhfeidhm. Muna bhfuil cabhair mar seo ar fáil, is cuma cad é an dea-thoil atá ann sa gcomhlacht, beidh deacrachtaí aige.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire in ann roinnt mhaith airgid a fháil ón Roinn Airgeadais chun cur leis an Roinn aige féin sa dóigh is go mbeidh foireann speisialta aige sa Roinn chun seo a dhéanamh. Tá sin an-tábhachtach. Beidh foireann ag teastáil on choimisinéar. Beidh an-díoma orainn más rud é go dtiocfaidh sé thar n-ais i gceann dhá bhliana a rá nach bhfuil foireann aige mar gheall ar easnamh airgid.</P>
    <P>Sin iad na ceisteanna is tábhachtaí. Conas is féidir seo a dhéanamh? Cad iad na dúshláin agus na deacrachtaí? Cad é an t-ábhar a bheidh ag teastáil? Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh sin á phlé leis an Aire Airgeadais agus a Roinn. Beidh sé á phlé i dTithe an Oireachtais fosta.</P>

Nuair a chuirfidh an tAire na fógraí scríofa chuig ceann chomhlachta phoiblí ar lorg scéime chun na Gaeilge a chur cinn, caithfidh an comhlacht an scéim a chur le chéile taobh istigh de sé mhí. Tá dualgas ar na comhlacthaí Stáit rudaí a dhéanamh i dtréimshe ama ach níl sé de dhualgas ag an Aire nó ag an Rialtas rudaí a dhéanamh taobh istigh thréimhse ama.

      <P>Ní bheidh ar an gcomhlacht, ag tógáil na céille san reachaíocht le comhlacht, ach plean amháin a réitiú &ndash; beidh treoirlínte réitithe dóibh. An fhadhb atá an Roinn ná go mbeidh air iarraidh ar liosta grúpaí nach bhfuil fiú áireamh orthu sa Chéad Sceideal mar go bhfuil fo-alt (5) ann. B'fhearr linn déileáil leo ina n-iomlán mar tá sé i bhfad níos deacra sceideal ama a chur air sin ná mar atá sé le comhlacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dúirt an Seanadóir nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur an dhualgais céanna air féin. Sa gcuid is mó beidh sé ag plé le Ranna Rialtais nó fochuideachtaí de chuid an Rialtais. Tá an-difríocht ann má deir an Roinn le comhlacht plean Gaeilge a réitiú taobh istigh de sé mhí, tá sé i bhfad nios eascaí scál-ama a chur leis sin ná mar atá sé ag dul siar do don gCéad Sceideal agus a rá cén scál-ama a bheidh i gceist i réiteach plean do gach aon <Col N="892" />cheann de na heagraíochta sin. Go mór mór, nuair atá na forálacha breise ann, &ldquo;aon chomhlacht, eagraíocht nó grúpa a bheidh forordaithe&rdquo;, bheadh sé dodhéanta go praicticiúil scál-ama a chur leis sin mar chaithfeadh sé bheith chomh fada is nach mbeadh aon chíall leis.</P>
    <P>Tá riail thábhachtach ann i gcruth an daonna. Tá a fhios againn uilig go bhfuil 80% den phobal ag plé le thart ar 20% de na heagraíochtaí seo go laethiúil. Má iarrtar ar an gcuid is mó lena mbíonn plé ag an bpobal leo &ndash; tá eagraíochtaí ansin nach raibh aon phlé agam féin leo, ní shin atá tábhachtach &ndash; bheadh Ranna agus comhlachtaí cosúil leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta, Bia agus Forbartha Tuaithe agus Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais tábhachtach. Sin iad an dream a iarrfar orthu i dtosach. Má dhéanfaimid ar an mbealach sin é, beidh éifeachtas cuimsitheach leis an reachtaíocht an-scioptha, fiú nuair nach mbeidh ach riar beag de na heagraíochtaí clúdaithe againn mar beimid ag díriú isteach ar an áit ara bhfuil plé laethiúil ag an bpobal léi.</P>

      <P>Tá sé tábhachtach d'fheidhmiú éifeachtach na reachtaíochta seo go mbeadh discréid ag an Aire maidir le feidhmiú fhorálacha áirithe atá sonraithe sa mBille. Tá sampla amháin san fhoráil áirithe ina bhfuil sé riachtanach go mbeadh discréid ag an Aire maidir le feidhmiú na fhorála. Ag cur san áirimh an saincheist maidir le hacmhainní agus an liosta cuimsitheach de chomhlachtaí atá sa Chéad Sceideal, an bhfuil sé réadúil nó praicticiúil oibleagáid a chur orm mar Aire, nó ar mo chomharba, fógraí a scríobh do chinn na gcomhlachtaí poiblí ar fad a luadh sa Sceideal ag iarraidh orthu dréachscéim a ullmhú agus a chur faoi mo bhráid i sé mhí do mo Roinn a bheith in ann gach scéim dá leithéid a scrúdú laistigh de sé mhí nó do mo Roinn a bheith in ann gach scéim dá leithéid a scrúdú agus a dheimhniú tar éis comharleachaí a ghlacadh? Ní bheadh sé praicticiúil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ag déanamh mugadh magadh den mBille ar fad é dá scríobhfainnse do chuile chomhlacht a rá seo iad na treoirlinte, cuir plean isteach. Tá a fhios ag an Teach cad é a tharlódh. Bheadh cnápacha pleananna ina luí thart san oifig go gceann i bhfad agus sinn ag déileáil leis an chuid is tábhachtaí díofa. Má tá muid i ndáiríre faoi seo is fearr i bhfad a rá leis an Aire, agus glacaim leis aon dhuine a bheidh sa job áirithe seo go mbeadh sé díograsach faoin nGaeilge, agus má tá an duine sin i mullach na ceirde, sé an rud atá muid ag tabhairt dó ná deis aige na pleananna seo a éilimh de réir mura mbeadh sé in ann déileáil leo le go <Col N="893" />mbeadh se in ann lán-éifeacht a chur leis na pleananna.</P>
    <P>Beidh go leor mionobair i gceist anseo. Ní phlean &ldquo;ba mhaith linn&rdquo; a bheadh súil ag an Roinn leis, tá rud i bhfad níos cuimsithe ná sin i gceist. Má tá Roinn Stáit aga bhfuil plé mór leis an bpobal, beimid ag éilimh rudaí simplí ar nós go mbeadh uimhir speisialta ann má theastaíonn ó Ghaeilgeoir ó áit ar bith sa tír glaoch agus seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a fháil ó thaobh eolais ghinearálta. Ní raibh riamh cúis ar bith ó tháinig an teicneolaíocht nua i bhfeidhm nach mbeadh oifig éigin de chuid na Roinne Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh agus go mbeadh duine i gcónaí ar fáil le ceisteanna faoi seirbhísí ginearálta a fhreagairt. D'fhéadfaí seirbhís mar sin a chur ar fáil i gcroílár Chonnemara ná ceann de na hOileáin Arainn. Níl aon fhadhb ach an cur chuige.</P>
    <P>Beimid ag éilimh rudaí praicticiúla mar sin mar tá siad indéanta. Caithfidh na pleananna seo dhul isteach i sonraíocht. Mura mbeidh sonraíocht, níl aon mhaith leis na pleananna mar ní bheidh an coimisinéar in ann iad a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    <P>Más éard atá sna pleananna ná &ldquo;dea-mhéin&rdquo;, &ldquo;ba mhaith linn&rdquo;, &ldquo;tá súil againn&rdquo;, cen mhaith? Tá muid ar ais ag an rud a bhí ann ó bunaíodh an Stát seo. Sin an difríocht. Beidh obair i gceist leis na pleananna ach trí díriú ar na Ranna sin ar an liosta beag sin a pléann lá i ndiaidh lae le pobal na Gaeilge i dtosach, beimid in ann i dtréimhse an-ghairid an difríocht a dhéanamh. Má bhreathnaítear, mar shampla, ar chuid de na comhlachtaí atá luaite anseo, cé acu is tábhachtaí, go mbeadh plean de shaghas éigin caite isteach acu siúd nó go mbeadh plean ceart i bhfeidhm ag Roinn nó ag údarás atá ag plé de shíoraí leis an bpobal, agus go mórmhór le pobal na Gaeilge agus pobal na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bheadh súil agam go mbeadh muinín ag an Teach seo an discréid seo a fhágáil ag an Aire, cibé Aire a bheas ann, agus go dtuigfeadh Seanadóirí, dá ndéanfadh Aire ar bith faillí sa ghnó seo nach fada go mbeadh Freasúra ar bith, ar mb'fhiú Freasúra a thabhairt air, sa mullach ag éileamh gnímh.</P>

      <P>Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach do fheidhmiú éifeachtach na reachtaíochta seo go mbeadh discréid ag an Aire maidir le feidhmiú fhoráileach áirid atá sonraithe sa Bhille. Is sampla amháin an fhoráil áirithe seo ina bhfuil sé rialta go mbeidh discréid ag an Aire maidir le feidhmiú an fhoráil. Mar atá curtha in iúl agam cheana, is é príomhchuspóir an Bhille ná soláthar níos mó, agus ar chaighdeán níos airde, de sheirbhísí Stáit i nGaeilge a chur ar fáil. An cur chuige atá á roghnú don Bhille ná meicníocht a chur i bhfeidhm chun go mbainfear amach an cuspóir seo ar chaoi réasúnach ar bhonn céimnithe, comh-pháirtíochta leis an mbéim ar chomhaontú a bhaint amach. Chun go bhfeidhmeodh an próiséas páirtíochta seo go sásúil tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil discréid ag an Aire dul i gcomhairle le daoine eile a cheapann sé gur chóir dul i gcomhairle leo roimh aon dréacht-scéim ar leith a dheimhniu.</P>

Nuair atá an oiread sin cainte críochnaithe agus tar éis dul i gcomhairle le daoine eile fágann an Bille fós ag an Aire an seans nach mbeidh air dréacht-scéimeanna a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>

    <P>I will revert to English for a moment because sometimes my Irish lets me down. I agreed with the Minister on section 13, when we discussed the phrase, &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;, and was quite happy to accept his argument. That a Minister, having <Col N="895" />consulted whoever he wishes and making whatever amendments he wishes to make, should still should have the discretion not to make a draft scheme is beyond me.</P>
    <P>Tuigim cén fáth go mbeadh solúbthacht aige ar an gcéad dul síos. Ach nuair atá sé tar éis comhairle a fháil nár chóir é bheith de dhualgas air rud éigin a dhéanamh leis, agus gan bheith in ann an scéim a fhágáil ar leataobh gan aon rud a dhéanamh leis?

      <P>Bhí plé fada faoin gceart a bheith ag an Aire a rá, &ldquo;Tough luck. Seo é&rdquo;. Bhí daoine ag fiafraí cad air a chaitheamar an t-am le cúig bliana anuas ag plé na ceiste seo. Ach nuair a bhí an rud ar fad pléite againn ba é ár dtuairim nárbh fhiú plean a chur i bhfeidhm ar chomhlacht muna n-éireodh linn an comhlacht sin a thabhairt linn. Ag an am gcéanna muna raibh comhlacht sásta aontú linn ar phlean a bhí réasúnta agus feidhmiúil, caithfimid a bheith in ann rud éigin a dhéanamh. Is é an rud atáim in ann a dhéanamh ná diúltú an plean a chur i bhfeidhm muna bhfuilimid sásta leis. Is é sin le rá go n-eiseoimid na treoirlínte, go gcuirfimid go dtí an comhlacht iad, go réiteoidh sé an plean agus go gcuirfidh sé ar ais é. Caithfimid aontú ar an bplean leis an gcomhlacht ansin mar tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh úinéireact ag an gcomhlacht ar an bplean mar plean s'aige féin. Ag an am gcéanna caithfidh an plean teacht chun caighdeán na Roinne. Muna bhfuilimid sásta go dtagann sé chun caighdeáin na Roinne agus muna bhfuil an comhlacht sásta an rud a cheapaimid ar cheart dó a dhéanamh, a dhéanamh ní cheart go mbeadh dualgas orainn géilleadh agus glacadh leis an bplean.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go dtiocfar ar réiteach sa bpróiseas seo mar beidh brú ann. Beifear ag cur na ceiste cá bhfuil an plean agus cén fáth nach bhfuil plean eagraíochta X ar fáil agus beidh an tAire ag rá nach bhfuil sé sásta go bhfuil an plean feidhmiúil de réir na dtreoirlínte. Ansin toshófar ag cur ceiste ar an Aire atá freagrach cén fáth nach bhfuil sé an in ann plean a chur ar fáil atá sásúil. Caithfimid ligint don phróiseas daonlathach. Muna bhfuil an tAire sásta leis an bplean tá sé in ann a thuairim a chur in iúl do Thithe an Oireachtais.</P>

    <P>Tá mé ag úsáid an bhrú atá thar a bheith tábhachtach agus a bhfuil tionchar aige i gcómhthéacs an Ombudsman, is é sin go bhfuil rudaí áirithe nach féidir le comhlachtaí Stáit a <Col N="896" />bheith feicthe ag déanamh mar nach mbreathnódh sé go maith dóibh nach bhfuil siad ag comhlíonadh a ndualgais faoin dlí.</P>

As I see it, the core and spirit of the Bill is partnership &ndash; reaching out and embracing public bodies in a spirit of partnership in order to give them ownership of as much as possible of this Bill and what the Minister intends to do. This section, as with others, is about implementing that approach. If the amendment was to be followed to the letter I believe that ownership would be taken back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is giving out a very important message in this section. By including the powerful phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the head of the public body concerned&rdquo;, he is inviting all the agencies involved to assist him in moving forward with this <Col N="897" />policy. I would not be in favour of anything that dilutes the strength of this message. It is consistent with what the Minister is doing and with the spirit he wishes to engender among the public bodies and it would be very unwise to consider withdrawing it at this stage.</P>

      <P>Ó ham go chéile bíonn seans againn sa Seanad labhairt faoi rudaí áirithe i rith na bliana, ní amháin ar an Ord Gnó gach maidin ach fosta bíonn ráitis ann agus tagann an tAire isteach, mar a tharlaíonn leis an nGaeilge go minic. Is rí-annamh a bhíonn seans againn labhairt faoi phríomfheidmeannaigh chomhlachtaí phoiblí ach dá mba rud é go raibh mé féin i mo phríomhfheidhmeannach ar chomhlacht phoiblí agus chuir mé dréach scéim chuig an Aire, agus gur tháinig an Roinn ar ais dom a rá nach bhfuil sí ró-shásta leis agus gur cheart smaoineamh air arís, ba chóir dom smaoineamh má dhúiltím, beidh an scéim sin am éigin á phlé san Oireachtas mar níl aon mhaith sa reachtaíocht seo muna bhfuil sé á scrúdú againn go rialta. Más nach ndéarna duine áirithe a fuair comhairle ón Roinn a leithéid a dhéanamh, is beag duine atá báúil leis an nGaeilge nach labharfaidh faoi sin. Caithfimid féachaint go fadradharcach ar an gcóras seo agus sinn á chur i gcríoch.</P>

      <P>Tá sé tábhachtach. Tá muid ag iarraidh dhá rud a dhéanamh anseo. Is leis an gcomhlacht an scéim. Caithfidh sé é a réiteach de réir treoirlínte agus nuair atá an scéim aontaithe tá sé tábhachtach go mothaíonn an comhlacht gur leis an scéim. Sin an fáth go bhfuil sé socraithe gur cheart go mbeadh comhaontú idir an eagraíocht agus an Aire. Cen fáth gurb é an príomhoifigeach feidhmiúcháin? Sin an duine sinsearach lán aimsire a bhíonn ag plé le rudaí mar sin. Tá gach príomhfheidhmeannach freagach do bhord agus faoina gcuid rialacha féin, ní fhéadfadh an príomhfheidhmeannach feidhmiú amhail is nach raibh bord ann. Beidh dualgas aige faoina rialacha leagtha amach ag an eagraíocht dona bhfuil sé ag obair bheith freagrach don bhord faoi gach nigh, ceist na Gaeilge san áireamh, sa ngnáthbhealach.</P>
      <P>Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil cumhacht ag an Aire gan a aontú. Má tá comhlacht ag cur plean ar aghaidh nach bhfuil féiliúnach ar chor ar bith, cad é a tharlaíonn ansin? Téann an tAire ar aghaidh chuig alt 18. Sa gcás go ndiúltaíonn comhlacht plean a chur ar fáil, nó sa gcás nach féidir leis an Aire nó an comhlacht teacht ar chomhaontú, déanfaidh an tAire an mhainneachtain sin ar an diúltú nó an neamhábaltacht sin a thairisciú do gach Teach den Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An féidir leis an Seanadóir a shamhlú an raic a tharlódh sna meáin dá mbeadh orm fógra oifigiúil a chur isteach go Seanad Éireann gur theip ar Roinn X nó comhlacht Y teacht ar chomhaontú le mo Roinn faoi phlean Ghaeilge agus go raibh mise chomh deimhin go raibh sé míshásúil agus gur chuir mé faoi bhráid Thithe an Oireachtais nach raibh mé in ann teacht ar chomhréiteach? <Col N="898" />Tharraingeoidh Seanadóirí agus Teachtaí sna Tithe seo raic gur theip ar chomhlacht rud a chuir ar fáil a bhí sásúil don Aire.</P>
    <P>Má tá aon mheas againn ar dhá Theach an Oireachtais, tá mé ceart nuair a deirim gur céim láidir a bheadh ann in aghaidh aon chomhlachta nó eagraíochta Stáit dá gcaithfimis tuarascáil oifigiúil a chur faoi bhráid Tithe an Oireachtas a rá gur theip orm teacht ar chomhréiteach sásúil leis an gcomhlacht. Ba mhaith liom bheith ann don díospóireacht sin. Ní shamhlóinn go nglacfadh éinne an dúshlán sin. B'fhéidir nach dtuigeann an dream taobh amuigh cé chomh tromchúiseach agus a bheadh a leithéid ach tuigimid cé chomh tromchúiseach agus atá sé don Oireachtas nuair a chuireann an t-Ombudsman tuairimí láidre amach faoi rudaí áirithe.</P>

Sa chéad phlean a chuirfear ar fáil beimid ag tosú ar bhóthar. Bheadh súil agam go ndéarfadh cuid de na heagraíochtaí Stáit go gcuirfidís oifig nó aonad faoi leith ar bun ag plé leis an nGaeltacht agus go mbeadh orthu cinnithe a dhéanamh maidir le earcú agus mar sin de. Tar éis trí bliana bheadh súil agam go mbeadh go leor den obair sin curtha i gcrích acu agus go mbeidís in ann dul go dtí an chéadh chéim eile. Próiséas leanúnach atá i gceist. Is é sin, ní bheidh an chéad phlean mar an gcéanna leis an dara plean ná leis an tríú plean.

Cé acu ab'fhearr &ndash; go mbeadh triúr ag obair in oifig an Ombudsman ag cur ceithre litir meabhrúcháin ag iarraidh freagra nó go mbeadh an nós cothaithe sa Stát go bhfaighfaí an freagra an chéad uair? Cuirim an-bhéim air seo. Ní dóigh go bhféadfaí a rá go bhfuil breis acmhainní i mo Roinn ó thaobh cúrsaí foirne de. Go deimhin, bhí mé ag breathnú ar bhuiséad riaracháin na Roinne le déana. Rud amháin a thugan an-suntas dom, agus déanaim é a sheiceáil go minic, an méid ceisteanna Dála a thagann isteach faoi cheisteanna meicniúla.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Déarfadh duine, mar shampla, gur scríobh sé ag Roinn agus nach bhfuair sé freagra. Le sár-chumas na fóirne atá againn &ndash; agus táimid ag obair i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge &ndash; corr uair ariamh a tharlaíonn sin mar go mbíonn scoth na seirbhíse ar fáil. Baineann sé seo le ceist an-leathan sa tseirbhís phoiblí. Tá sé in am againn foghlaim nuair a chuirtear scéala chuig duine go mba cheart scéala a fháil ar ais sciobtha agus an t-eolas mar atá sé ar fáil i láthair na huaire a thabhairt. Tá taithí agam ar bheith ag plé leis an Ombudsman, mar atá againn uilig, agus ar bheith ag fanacht go ceann sé mhí nó bliana ar fhreagra uaidh. Ní chreidim go bhfuil an tOmbudsman ag cai<Col N="904" />theamh an ama ag scrúdú na ceiste ach go bhfuil dua ar an Ombudsman an t-eolas atá uaidh a fháil leis an gceist a chíoradh. Sin, dar liom, an áit go gcaithfidh an t-athrú meoin teacht. Is ceist níos leithne í ná ceist an Bhille seo. Cén chaoi a éireoidh linn cur i gcionn ar an tseirbhís poiblí go ginearálta freagra a thabhairt nuair a chuirtear ceist.</P>

Nuair a théann daoine ag lorg eolais ó Roinn Stáit &ndash; eolas a bhfaighfí go neamh-oifigiúil go dtí seo &ndash; go bhfuil gach rud á chur faoin gcóras um shaoráil faisnéise. Tá sé sin ag cur moill ar dhaoine. Faoi láthair tá an tAcht um Shaoráil Faisnéise ag obair go maith ach tá sé á úsáid i gcónaí anois, de réir daoine, in áiteanna go bhféadfaí gan é a úsáid agus an t-eolas a chur ar fáil i bhfad níos tapúla.</P>
      <P>Aontaím leis an Aire faoi chuid mhaith den chóras Stáit. Cuireann sé ionadh orm agus ar Bhaill eile den Oireachtas an oiread daoine a deir linn gur scríobh siad chuig oifig Stáit agus nach bhfuair siad freagra. Tá sé do-chreidte go mbeadh eagras ar bith sa Stát, idir Ranna Stáit agus eagraíochtaí poiblí, nach mbeadh sé de dhea-mheas acu ar dhaoine freagra a thabhairt ar dhuine a scríobh litir.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Within two years of the coming into operation of this Act, the Minister shall present to the Oireachtas a review of the operation of the Act which will <i>inter alia,</i> assess&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;the impact of the operation of the Act on the Credit Union Movement,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;the adequacy of the system for developing a strong pro-consumer financial environment, and</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;the quality of the reporting arrangements to provide the Oireachtas with timely information in regard to&ndash;</P>
      <P>(i)&nbsp;protection of consumer savings,</P>
      <P>(ii)&nbsp;transparency of information for the users of financial services,</P>
      <P>(iii)&nbsp;competition among the providers of financial services, and</P>
      <P>(iv)&nbsp;efficient redress for consumer grievances in relation to the provision of financial services.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Second and Committee Stages, considerable anxiety was expressed regarding the manner in which the credit union movement would fare within the new arrangement being introduced for the regulation of the financial services sector. The credit union movement was set up with the specific aim of providing for the small saver &ndash; for the person for whom the banks would not consider as having sufficient claim to make financial arrangements with a bank. It was established as the bank for the small people. It has succeeded to such an extent that it has grown from small beginnings and to a position where its tentacles are spread across the country. The credit union movement is established in every community, both urban and rural. Its success, in terms of its membership and service, speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credit union movement is now being brought in under the umbrella of the new agency, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which will be under the thumb of the Central Bank. It is important to monitor how the new legislation will affect the credit union movement. The Government has moved away from its original intention to create an independent statutory regulatory body to deal specifically with the credit union movement. It has decided to subsume this body into the new authority. Reports from the credit movement union will come directly to <Col N="908" />the Central Bank and not to the Oireachtas, as was the original intention.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that there seems to be an intention to bring together two conflicting sets of imperatives, namely, prudential management and consumer protection. I refer to observations made by independent authorities such as Dr. Ray Kinsella, an eminent professor at the Michael Smurfit graduate school of business at University College Dublin and a former adviser to the Government on economic and financial affairs. He has set himself firmly against the merging of the two roles and regards it as a total conflict of interests. He has stated that not only should they not be merged, but that they are also mutually incompatible and that the capacity of both bodies to carry out their individual agendas or remits would be damaged.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the capacity of the Oireachtas to oversee the effectiveness of these bodies and I wonder if they will have the resources to do what is required of them. I propose this amendment because of the considerable anxiety within the credit union movement. I ask that a two-year review be carried out to investigate whether the system works and whether the Central Bank has delivered on consumer protection, whether the bank is providing proper consumer information or whether there is real competition in the financial services sector rather than the kind of cartel approach that operates at present, under which there is little difference between anything on offer from one bank as against another. A marginal increase or reduction in interest rates by one institution is inevitably followed by the others.</P>
    <P>The Bill is trying to marry too many conflicting imperatives. The large financial institutions are entirely driven by high margins and profit-making. That is understandable because they have a responsibility to their directors and shareholders. On the other hand, the credit union movement is driven by a totally different agenda and set of imperatives, namely, low margins and maximum service to the hundreds and thousands of consumers who are its members. It is based on mutual trust. The small saver can be an active participant and a genuine stakeholder in the movement. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply.</P>

      <P>I apologise for my absence from the House last week. Unfortunately, as I was abroad I missed Committee Stage. I want, therefore, to resist the temptation to repeat what might have been said already by other Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the notion of a single regulatory authority. The way various financial institutions have been regulated over the years has been unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons. There has been <Col N="909" />inconsistency and, while some elements worked well, other elements worked rather poorly.</P>
    <P>The overall authority of the Central Bank has been wielded in a fashion which people have found unsatisfactory when it comes to consumer protection. The Central Bank would point out, correctly from a legal point of view, that as it never had specific legal responsibility in that regard, it could not be expected to stray beyond its primary duty. I support the notion of bringing the two functions within one body. Like others, however, I assert the need for a measure of independence between the two respective functions. Broadly speaking, I am willing to give fair wind to the structure devised by the Department after such lengthy debate.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator Higgins's amendment, I am in two minds about the whole credit union issue. I acknowledge credit unions have done huge work in recent years. They provide a service in many communities and workplaces which is not provided by others, or they provide it on more preferential terms to people who want to borrow small amounts of money. That service was not being provided for a long period by the commercial banks. It is very praiseworthy that the credit unions have provided this service. Within the movement, however, there is a wide disparity in regard to the different types of credit unions. There are some very small ones in rural villages or small workplaces and there are some very large ones which dispose of a lot of money, including credit unions based in some of the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, regulation of the credit union movement has been very inconsistent over the years, even lax, as has the regulation of building societies. Within the new body, we should try to benefit from the expertise and regulation generally, which is bound to arise, to apply uniform rules to the credit unions. It should not be uniform in the sense that we should apply the same rules to them as to commercial banks, but at least it should be clear what the rules and regulations are and they should be applied on a consistent basis to all credit unions, irrespective of their size and so on. No system is perfect. Credit unions are not perfect, nor would they claim to be. They have had experience of imperfection in the not too distant past, about which I am sure they are conscious. While it is fair to seek to have a report back within a reasonable period to see whether the additional responsibility being placed on credit unions is onerous, nevertheless it is reasonable for the credit union movement to be brought within the single regulatory authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment suggests that a review of the operation of the Act should take place, the results of which would be presented to the Oireachtas <Col N="910" />within two years of the Act coming into operation. The Minister for Finance has stated that any review of the legislation should wait until we see how the legislation has operated over a few years.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the re-organisation of the Central Bank and the establishment of a regulatory authority. It will be necessary to allow sufficient time for the new structures to come into operation before a realistic assessment of their impact can be made. This will allow the regulator sufficient time to make a judgment on whether the legislation needs further amendment. Both the Central Bank and the regulatory authority will produce annual reports which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The annual strategic plan of the regulatory authority will also be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, following which the authority must publish the plan.</P>
      <P>Coupled with the provisions of section 33AM to the principal Act, which provide for certain officers of the bank to attend before the appropriate Oireachtas committee, this will allow the Oireachtas ample opportunity to assess the operations and activities of the Central Bank and the regulatory authority. The consumer director and the registrar of credit unions will also produce both strategic plans and annual reports for submission to the regulatory authority. Under the circumstances, an effective ongoing review and assessment process will be facilitated by the existing provision, therefore I am not disposed to accepting the amendment.</P>
      <P>As previously announced by the Minister for Finance, it is intended to publish a second Bill to implement other recommendations contained in the McDowell report. The Bill will include provisions establishing consultative panels of consumers and the financial services industry. Among the functions planned for the consumer panel will be review of the discharge by the regulatory authority of its functions, including those of the consumer director and the registrar of credit unions.</P>
      <P>Senator Higgins raised a number of points of general principle in consideration of his amendment. With his leave, I might postpone the question of consumer protection to a further amendment in his name and deal with the question of the credit union movement, which does not appear to be covered in any further amendment raised by the Senator. Senator McDowell also referred to credit unions. I acknowledge the broad welcome he has given the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was considerable discussion in both Houses on whether there should or should not be a one-stop-shop in terms of financial regulation. It is understandable that some advocates argue consumer protection should have a distinct priority of its role in a separate authority or that the credit union movement should not be regulated in a Bill of this type. It is important to <Col N="911" />realise that it is important in a small jurisdiction that we have one effective body which can perform all of these tasks in a complementary manner. We will be addressing these issues during debate on the amendments. The issue which does not appear to be reflected in further amendments is that of credit unions.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that there have been detailed discussions between the Minister, his officers and the credit union movement. The Bill as initiated provided that the functions of the registrar of friendly societies, under the Credit Union Act, should be carried out independently by a registrar of credit unions loosely within the overall framework of the regulatory authority. Both the members of the interim regulatory authority, which was established in April 2002 on a non-statutory basis to manage the transition to the new arrangements, and the Governor of the Central Bank expressed reservations about the reporting arrangements for the registrar of credit unions within the proposed authority and the fact that the level of independence proposed for the registrar appeared to contradict principles of good governance.</P>
    <P>In the context of these concerns, the Minister felt obliged to look again at the provisions relating to the registrar. He stressed that these were the only reasons he proposed the amendments. Amendments were made in the Dáil which have altered the reporting relationship of the registrar of credit unions, bringing the position more fully within the framework of the new authority. The reporting relationship of the registrar is now similar to that proposed for the consumer director.</P>
    <P>The acting secretary to the interim Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority wrote to the league on 14 November 2002, before its conference in Galway, and the new chief executive designate of the regulatory authority also wrote to the league on 3 December 2002. The letter stated, among other things, that the members of the interim authority should recognise and understand the important role the credit union movement plays in this country, the size and reach of the movement, its 'not for profit' but voluntary nature and that it has broad support among the communities it serves. They should also recognise that the credit unions have different functions and objectives from commercial financial institutions such as banks and building societies, the regulation of the credit union movement must be appropriate to those functions and objectives, highlight that for this reason the Government, in making clear its acceptance of all these principles, is proposing a separate statutory post of registrar of credit unions who will work under the requirements and protection of the Credit Union Act 1997 and want to work with the Irish League of Credit Unions. They have stated they are open to discussing the valuable role the field officers play <Col N="912" />in assisting the league members and that their only concern with the legislation as currently drafted is the accountability of the registrar of credit unions. The Minister for Finance and I agree with the members of the interim authority on these matters.</P>
    <P>During all Stages of the debate, Deputies and Senators expressed their appreciation of the role and contribution of the credit union movement to national life. The officers of the Department of Finance met with the league on a number of occasions in January. A draft text was arrived at, with which the league confirmed it was satisfied. This draft was then submitted to the parliamentary counsel for official drafting with a view to making the amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I stress that the supervision of credit unions by the new regulatory authority should not be viewed as a threat to the movement. It should be seen as a development that will work to the advantage of the credit union movement and member customers of credit unions.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it stands, ensures that the concerns expressed by the Irish League of Credit Unions have been taken into account by ensuring any directions given to the registrar must be within the scope of the Credit Union Act 1997. Legally speaking, that Act is the Ark of the Covenant for the credit union movement. Furthermore, in issuing directions to the registrar under this subsection the regulatory authority shall have regard to the particular nature of credit unions by reference to the conditions for the registration of credit unions set out in the 1997 Act, the objects and common bonds referred to in that section, and the voluntary ethos of credit unions. That is now written into legislation. I reiterate the position of support by the Minister for Finance for the credit union movement. The position of a statutory registrar of credit unions within the regulatory authority will help ensure the strong voluntary and community ethos of the movement continues. This is now clearly acknowledged in the Bill, as it stands.</P>
    <P>A note was circulated by the league to the credit unions making it clear that the further amendments proposed in the other House recognised, as they recognise in this House, the distinct voluntary character and social and economic roles of credit unions. They are reinforced by correspondence from the interim board of the authority in relation to the regulation of credit unions. The Bill, as it stands, therefore, will mean that the authority will have to take into account the unique nature of credit unions and decisions affecting them, and credit unions will continue to be regulated under the 1997 Act. That is the letter of comfort the Government received from the league.</P>
    <P>Looking at the issue in a balanced way, I agree with what Senator McDowell said, that for the <Col N="913" />credit unions' own sake it is better that they are integrated into this one-stop-shop because they have important financial responsibilities. In a sense their integration into this legislation through the registrar, the person who will stand on his or her own feet under this legislation, is a clear recognition of their importance in the modern financial services set-up.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister of State has not seen worthy to accept this amendment. I do not want to misquote him but he said the Minister of Finance was well disposed towards having a review carried out of the working of the legislation and the new regulatory authority &ldquo;after the passage of a few years.&rdquo;  What I am talking about is the passage of two years. Surely after the legislation has been operational for two years that would be a timely juncture at which to carry out a review of how it is working under the different headings. What I have set down in the amendment is a series of areas which would be monitored by the review body to see if the legislation was working and delivering. The legislation is going to go through and we wish it well. The role of credit unions is now <i>de facto</i> part and parcel of the remit of the new agency, though we might differ as to whether it is appropriate.</P>
      <P>I welcome the ongoing dialogue between the Department and the credit union movement, and the comfort and assurances given to the movement but essentially I am talking about a review being carried out at a 24 month juncture and a report to the Oireachtas in order that we would know exactly how the Bill was working. If it is working well, &ldquo;if it ain't broke, don't fix it&rdquo; but if not, let us address the defects and deficiencies and bring forward amending legislation to plug whatever gaps are apparent or rectify any weaknesses or malfunctions. I am at a loss to know the reason, rather than just fending off the amendment into the dim and distant future, the Minister of State and the Department will not accept the amendment. How long is a few years? How long is a piece of string? What length of time is the Minister of State talking about when he says the Bill will be reviewed &ldquo;after a few years&rdquo;?  Are we talking about three, four or five years? It is wrong that any legislation which has far-reaching consequences should be allowed to continue in an open-ended fashion under the general heading that a review will be carried out &ldquo;after a few years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take into consideration the fact that the regulatory authority shall have due cognisance of the role of the credit union movement, its uniqueness, etc., but these are all words and are very vague. I would like a root and branch examination by an independent review body or by the Department of Finance of whether the legislation was working and fulfilling its remit. I have set down a list of specific headings which most <Col N="914" />reasonable people would accept as appropriate from the point of view of gauging whether the legislation was delivering on the purpose for which it was introduced to both Houses in the first place. That is the reason I am disappointed. I ask the Minister of State again about the phrase &ldquo;a few years&rdquo;. How many years are we talking about? Is it three, four or five years? How will the legislation be reviewed? What kind of gauge, monitor or barometer will be used to see if the various elements of the legislation are working in carrying out its remit?</P>

      <P>In page 10, paragraph <i>(g),</i> line 18, after &ldquo;problems&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the quality and cost of services to the consumer&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals with section 5 which deals with the general functions and powers of the Central Bank. It sets out a list of functions. It states the bank has the following functions: to carry out the efficient and effective co-ordination of the activities of its constituent parts; to promote the development within the State of the financial services industry; where appropriate, to represent and co-ordinate the representation of the bank on international financial bodies and at international meetings relating to financial or economic matters; and to establish and maintain, either directly or indirectly, contact with the monetary authorities.</P>
      <P>The paragraph I am seeking to amend is paragraph <i>(g) </i>which provides as follows: &ldquo;to provide for the collection and study of data that deal with monetary and credit problems and to publish information about that data&rdquo;. I am seeking to insert after the word &ldquo;problems&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and the quality and cost of services to the consumer&rdquo;. It would seem a sensible insertion, not alone would it deal with monetary and credit problems, it would also deal with the quality and the cost of services to the consumer. That marries with what I was talking about &ndash; consumer protection, value for money, competition in the sector, etc. The amendment is self-explanatory.

      <P>The amendment proposes to change section 5A of the principal Act as inserted by section 5 of the Bill which provides for the general functions and powers of the Central Bank. However, responsibility for consumer protection is a delegated function of the bank to the regulatory authority, and the legislation relating to the authority provides a variety of measures <Col N="915" />that deal with the quality of financial services to consumers and accountability with regard to consumer protection.</P>
      <P>First, the regulatory authority is charged with responsibility for taking action to increase awareness among members of the public of available financial services and the cost to consumers, as well as risks and benefits associated with the provision of those services. This includes reference to the quality of financial services to consumers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Bill provides for the appointment of a person to the statutory position of consumer director who will be responsible for monitoring the provision of financial services for consumers of those services, having regard to the public interest and the interests of consumers. The consumer director is required under the Bill to produce an annual report. One of the matters which must be included in the report is the steps taken by the regulatory authority to increase the awareness of consumers of relevant financial services, the cost to consumers, and the risks and benefits involved in using those services. The authority is also required to produce an annual report which must be submitted to the Minister for Finance who must, in turn, have the report laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Both the consumer director and the regulatory authority are required to produce strategic plans each year, which must specify the nature and scope of the activities to be undertaken and the strategies and policies for achieving those objectives. They must also specify the targets and criteria for assessing the performance of the authority and the consumer director.</P>
      <P>The chairperson of the regulatory authority, the chief executive of the authority and the consumer director can all be called before the relevant Oireachtas committee. It is appropriate that the authority take responsibility for matters relating to consumer protection and awareness. The existing provisions of the Bill allow the authority to address the matters raised in the amendment and to be held accountable for them.</P>
      <P>I regret therefore that I cannot accept this amendment. Essentially, my argument is on the narrow issue of this amendment. The matters comprehended in it are comprehended in the Bill already under the heading of the regulatory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This might be as good a stage as any to deal with the more general argument which I think the Senator is pressing about the wisdom of combining the prudential regulatory function, a traditional function that has always been performed by the Central Bank, with the consumer protection function which it is now proposed to vest in the regulatory authority. In relation to that issue, which has occupied a good deal of the debate, the Central Bank has always been responsible for the prudential regulation of certain financial institutions <Col N="916" />operating in the State. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment supervised the insurance industry, while the Director of Consumer Affairs had certain responsibilities under the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in relation to financial service providers, including responsibilities relating to charges and advertising.</P>
    <P>Due to legal confidentiality requirements there has been a well highlighted difficulty in the full exchange of information between regulators. The McDowell group felt strongly that separating the consumer issues from the prudential regulator had two important disadvantages: first, it left unresolved the legal problem of passing relevant information from the regulatory authority to the Director of Consumer Affairs, and second, the advantages of a one-stop-shop would be lost in that there would be two official bodies dealing with different aspects of financial services regulation. The McDowell group concluded that, given the requirement imposed by the relevant EU law in relation to disclosure between regulators, the best method of providing for the maximum flow of information between prudential regulators and those concerned with consumer protection was to combine both functions within one authority. The Government considered this issue at some length and decided that this restriction in the exchange of information was unacceptable and because of this it decided to implement the structure before the House.</P>
    <P>The question of how best to deal with the issues arising from combining the functions of prudential regulation and consumer protection were dealt with comprehensively in the report of the McDowell group. A number of options were examined to see how best each of them would work. The group examined the issue of protecting the interests of clients of financial institutions at two levels, first, the level of the protection of consumers' interests in the context of the solvency of regulated entities and, second, at the level of the individual consumer in his or her banker-creditor relationship, or his or her relationship with a particular financial institution. The relationship between these levels was looked at particularly from the point of view of the obligations imposed under EU law, in relation to the prohibition on disclosure of information to the relevant authorities on issues for which it has no statutory function.</P>
    <P>The ability to disclose information is very important, as was seen for example in the DIRT inquiry. In the end the expert group took the view that the consumers' interests would be best served by combining the functions of consumer protection and prudential regulation in one body. Various alternatives were examined, first, separate authorities for prudential regulation and consumer protection; second, two competent authorities with one having a consumer protection function; or third, a regulatory authority with a subsidiary responsible for consumer protection. They were all ruled out as it was only within the entity which combined prudential regulation with <Col N="917" />consumer protection that the disclosure of information between the two could be done within the provisions of EU law.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issue of the exchange of information, the Government was of the view that integration of prudential supervision and consumer protection had certain advantages. First, it provides a one-stop-shop for consumers, business and the financial services industry by having the regulation of insurance, banking and credit unions under the one roof. Second, Ireland is a relatively small country with a limited pool of expertise in the area of financial regulation. The building of a critical mass of skills relating to financial regulation in a single location is of major importance to the country. Third, it places the interests of consumers at the heart of financial services regulation by giving the authorities specific responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for very clear structures. The functions of the financial authority, the consumer director and the registrar of credit unions are clearly set out in the legislation. Each of these must produce a strategic plan outlining their policy objectives. These strategic plans then participate in the authority's strategic plan which has to be approved by the Minister. If there were any suggestion of a conflict in policy objectives the Minister would ensure it was resolved. A simple example of this would be if there appeared to be an overlap in the policy objectives of the Army and the Garda in relation to drug seizures. The appropriate Minister or Government would step in and ensure it was resolved.</P>
    <P>Likewise in this area if such a major conflict emerged it would have to be addressed. It is important to stress that this Bill effects a fundamental transformation in the character of the Central Bank. To argue that it is dangerous to combine the prudential regulation function with the consumer protection function because as a matter of history the prudential regulation function was the dominant activity of the Central Bank, apart from safeguarding the currency, somewhat misses the point that in this legislation there is a fundamental transformation in the character of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I was not able to reply to Senator Higgins's previous interventions but I should say that the ministerial review that has been promised is a review by the Minister of the legislation. From his perspective the top priority is now to advance the second item of legislation dealing with the consultative panels from consumers and from the industry. When that legislation is enacted a number of years will have passed and at that stage he envisages conducting a ministerial review. It is important to stress that full accountability to these Houses has been written into this legislation, not just through the laying down of documents and the formulation of strategic review plans but through the designation of a number of crucial officers in the new authority, and in the Central Bank, who can be called before Oireachtas committees to give an account <Col N="918" />of themselves. The Oireachtas is free at any time to review this legislation and its operation and implementation, and that is fully written into the Bill. That is my reply to the point raised by the Senator in his previous remarks.</P>

      <P>There is a marked degree of <i>glasnost</i> in this House by comparison with the other House. I take the point that the Minister of State is making and I will be withdrawing the amendment. In relation to the Minister of State's comments that this fundamentally changes the character of the Central Bank, we will all welcome that if it happens. Does the leopard ever change its spots? The problem is &ndash; and this was quoted <i>ad nauseam</i> in both Houses on Second Stage &ndash; that the Central Bank effectively has divested itself entirely of its consumer protection remit, as it said on occasion in the past that it wished. That was for somebody else. It had a central, important role that we all acknowledge which was to ensure the solvency of its constituent members. It ensured that the consumer was protected in that regard by ensuring that the banks were solvent. We certainly hope that the pledge of faith that has been given to the Central Bank in relation to its overarching responsibility in connection with this regulatory authority actually will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why the Minister of State and his advisers refuse to accept the change I seek to introduce, that is to insert &ldquo;and the quality and the cost of the service to the consumer&rdquo; albeit that it is already comprehended within the Bill. Why not be doubly sure and doubly safe? This is innocuous enough from the point of view of inserting what would seem to be two further sensible areas of assessment by the authority, that is, to ensure that as well as establishing the monetary and credit problems and examining these, it would also examine the quality and the <Col N="919" />cost to the consumer. Those are my final comments.</P>

      <P>In page 31, line 29, after &ldquo;designate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the Director of Consumer Affairs and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subsection in question states: &ldquo;Instead of appointing a person under subsection 1(c), the Minister may designate the holder of a specified office as an official member of the Regulatory Authority. Whoever is for the time being the holder of such an office is an official member of that Authority.&rdquo;  What I am attempting to insert there is the Director of Consumer Affairs. Perhaps the Minister would like to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. As it refers to the Director of Consumer Affairs, or Consumer Director as will be, perhaps I can say what I would have said in response to the previous amendment.</P>
      <P>The structure being developed is ingenious, although I am not totally convinced it will work. I was never completely persuaded that it was not possible to have the exchange of information to which the Minister of State refers within the structures we had previously. In the light of the legal advice we were given about the application of the European directives to the previous position, I am not totally convinced the new structure gets around this. We can argue law until we are blue in the face and it will do us no good and give us no satisfaction but let us assume for the moment that the structure being put together is legally sound.</P>
      <P>It is hugely important that there should be the exchange of information referred to. The most recent example of this was when specific practices within a certain bank were discovered &ndash; perhaps not as extensive as we were led to believe at the time but nonetheless they were discovered &ndash; which clearly were not in consumers' interests. On the contrary, it was suggested that consumers were being ripped off by the bank. It came to light later that the Central Bank was aware to some degree at least of these practices but did not disclose the information. It made the case that it was not obliged or allowed to under law. Such a position is intolerable. Certainly, if the bank in the exercise of its prudential supervision powers comes across practices which are clearly not in the interests of consumers, there must be some facility whereby that information is shared with the consumer directorate side of the business. In so far as the new structure allows this, clearly it is a good thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State makes the point that the Central Bank has changed its ethos. I am not sure that it has or that it would be totally a good thing that it would. It has been good at prudential <Col N="920" />supervision and has generally done a very good job. There have been no rifts in the banking or financial services structure generally going back over a long period, which must be marked as a signal of success. It is the primary function of the bank on that side of the business. What it has not done is the stuff that is not its business, namely, consumer protection.</P>
    <P>For consumer protection to work properly, there must be a certain positive creative tension between it and the regulatory side of the business. Clearly, the ethos of those working in both sections of the new structure will be somewhat different because they will perform different tasks. It would be good if there was to be a certain tension between them, albeit within the context of shared information. There is within the structure a tension which, I suppose, will in time have to work its way out and find its own means of expression. As I said when making the point earlier, it is a reasonable goal and deserves fair wind but is not without tensions. We must keep a close eye on how it works out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendment would change the provisions relating to the membership of the regulatory authority to provide that the Minister for Finance may designate the Director of Consumer Affairs as an official member of the authority. I am glad to advise the Senator that the Bill already allows for this possibility. The proposed new section 33E(2) of the principal Act as inserted by section 26 of the Bill provides that the Minister may, instead of appointing a person to be a member of the regulatory authority, designate the holder of a specified office as an official member of the authority. That power, although stated in more abstract language, is already conferred on the Minister in the Bill. The Director of Consumer Affairs is the holder of a specified office within the meaning of the Bill and the current wording of subsection (2) leaves it open to the Minister to appoint the director as an official member of the regulatory authority. In the circumstances, the proposed amendment is superfluous as its purpose is already comprehended by the legislation and there is no difficulty about designating the Director of Consumer Affairs as a member of the regulatory authority. It is permitted under the legislation. On that purely technical issue, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the wider issues canvassed on this occasion by Senator McDowell, the kernel of one of the objections of Opposition parties to the Bill has been the combination of the prudential regulation function with the consumer protection function. It is important to stress that this is a new Bill. As I said on Committee Stage, it is not a case of &ldquo;New presbyter is but old priest writ large&rdquo;. The Bill is detailed. It essentially transforms the Central Bank into a new bank which combines with a regulatory authority. Because of the fundamental change in the character of the bank envisaged by the legislation, this is a case of a leopard <Col N="921" />changing its spots. The Government took a view on combining the functions in order that the issue of prudential regulation, a traditional function of the bank, is restated in the Bill but is combined with consumer protection in the regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>I agree that the choice of an appropriate supervisory structure was a difficult one. Senators are well aware of the huge changes that have taken place in the financial services industry in recent decades. The traditional lines of demarcation have become blurred in the provision of financial services, whether by way of credit, loans, current and other types of account operations and international finance. There has been considerable change. Financial institutions of all types tend to offer products and services, directly or through affiliates, that compete against those offered not only by similar types of institutions but also by other categories of service providers. The traditional lines of demarcation have become blurred as we can see in all the markets in the financial services sector.</P>
    <P>The Government had to make a judgment call and decided that, by combining both functions in a small jurisdiction like Ireland, a one-stop-shop would have all the information available to it. There is an attraction and cogency to this argument. It is hoped we can establish the authority by May this year. Assuming that happens, the legislation will have provided an opportunity to establish an authority which can put consumer protection at the heart of good banking practice. By combining these functions, one creates that opportunity.</P>

      <P>In page 35, line 46, after &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that the Chief Executive has published a report demonstrating that these levies are necessary for recovery of its cost and indicating the performance indicators which are being monitored to ensure efficient and cost-effective operation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an add-on to the existing text. It relates to the powers to impose levies. The Bill reads:</P>
      <P>The Chief Executive, with the agreement of the other members of the Regulatory Authority, may make regulations prescribing levies to be paid by persons who are subject to regulation under the designated enactments and designated statutory instruments.</P>
      <P>My amendment would add:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>provided that the Chief Executive has published a report demonstrating that these levies are necessary for recovery of its cost and indicating the performance indicators which are <Col N="922" />being monitored to ensure efficient and cost-effective operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment and wish to ask the Minister of State two questions. One relates to the nature of the levies that will be imposed to recover costs. Is it intended to equalise this in some way between institutions or is it intended to make some assessment of the cost of regulating a certain institution or type of institution? I presume, for example, it would not be intended to levy a relatively small building society in the same way as one might a large commercial bank. How is it intended to reach a decision on what class of levy will be imposed on an institution or will the institutional basis be used? Will it be done instead on a class basis by attempting to levy the commercial banks together and allowing them to divide the cost between them?</P>
      <P>Is it intended to make a profit? The Commission for Communications Regulation has been quite successful in making a substantial profit in the regulation of the telecommunications sector in recent years. I am not sure this is entirely appropriate. On the face of it, money is being taken from large commercial institutions with reasonably deep pockets but the inevitable result is that the cost is passed on to consumers which adds to the cost they pay. That is something we would not want to support. Is it intended that the levy should simply recover costs incurred by the regulator? What happens in the event of a profit being made in the course of a year? I am aware the section allows for a refund of levies in certain circumstances. Is it intended in circumstances where the amount levied exceeds costs in any one year that the excess will be released back to the institutions which paid it in the first place?</P>

      <P>The McDowell report recommended that funding for the operation of the new financial services regulatory authority should come from the industry. Levies to fund the authority will be prescribed by the chief executive, with the agreement of the other members of the authority, by way of regulations. This will be done only after a detailed consultation process. Any regulations made by the chief executive must, in turn, be approved by the Minister for Finance who must lay them before each House of the Oireachtas. In addition, the budget of the regulatory authority, which the levies will finance, will, having been approved by the Minister, be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The essential safeguards written into this legislation are ministerial approval of both the budget and the levies, parliamentary disclosure and preparation by the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate of annual income and expenditure must, under the legislation, specify the amounts expected to be collected and recovered <Col N="923" />during the financial year concerned from the imposition of levies and specify any other sources from which funds are expected to be obtained during that year to finance the authority's activities. It must also specify the amounts expected to be raised from both sources and the activities the authority proposes to undertake during that year.</P>
    <P>The McDowell report emphasised the importance of adopting an approach which achieved a fair and equitable outcome. The approach, as set out, is considered the optimum one to achieve that aim. It is a preferable approach to that suggested in the amendment moved by Senator Higgins. The issuing of a statement, as this amendment proposes, would not achieve a desirable level of active consultation. The procedure outlined, in addition to the accountability provisions elsewhere in the Bill, ensures that the chief executive of the authority is accountable to both the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas in regard to the justification for the levies.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the annual estimates will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas following approval by the Minister. Their accountability will be supported by the fact that the authority must also submit the annual strategic plan and the annual report to the Minister who, in turn, will lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister will also require the authority to ensure that its annual report includes appropriate indicators of its performance.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the approach outlined in the legislation is more effective than that proposed in the amendment, which would just require the chief executive to produce a statement. Consequently, I regret I will not accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator McDowell raised questions in regard to the levies and to whether funding can be achieved in a fair and equitable manner. He also inquired about how the levy system will operate. This is a matter to which the expert group gave much consideration. The first view it expressed was that if a system was to be developed which would be simple and generally acceptable to the industry, it would mean developing a formula for allocating the costs of regulation on an annual basis between the regulated entities. Clearly, this would have to be proportionate. The group felt that this could be achieved by devising a charging structure which would be based on a range of factors. These include the size of the firm's assets, the number of clients, the amount of funds under the firm's control, the value of new business in any one year and the value of commission payments and fee income, or a combination of these factors. A simpler approach could be adopted using factors such as the number of principals and employees in a firm.</P>
    <P>The group also agreed that a principle in any charging regime would be the need to ensure that the competitiveness of the financial industry is not undermined by the charges imposed. This applies both to the competitive position of financial services entities relative to each other and the <Col N="924" />competitiveness of the financial industry internationally.</P>
    <P>In light of the wide and varied nature of the body to be regulated, the group acknowledged that a number of different approaches could be adopted by the regulator. Essentially, the matter has been left for consultation under the scheme envisaged in the legislation with the relevant interests. Under the new legislation, which will be published later this year, the consultative panels &ndash; both representing consumers and the industry &ndash; will be established to deal with the regulatory authority. These panels will be established under the legislation to keep under review the operations of the authority.</P>
    <P>The second issue raised by Senator McDowell related to whether the cost of these levies could be passed on to the consumer if they were excessive. It is important to point out that a specific cap on the amount of levies that can be applied to the credit unions is included in the legislation. That amount cannot exceed the cost of their regulation under the Credit Union Act 1997. That is the maximum cost that can be imposed on the credit unions. It is important that this protection is written into the legislation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other financial institutions, the ultimate safeguard is the ministerial sanction that is required for their regulation. I accept Senator McDowell's point that it can be tempting for a regulator to fund to excess. It is the vigilance of the Minister for Finance that must act as a deterrent if this problem develops.</P>

      <P>In regard to the two important points raised by Senator McDowell concerning the formula to be used, the Minister of State said that the two options considered were a simple formula or a formula whereby the assets of a particular financial institution would be assessed together with the other elements and that the levy would be applied on that basis. Is he in a position to reassure us that this is what will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also stated that the cap applies in regard to credit unions, but that the ultimate sanction lies in the hands of the Minister for Finance. What can the Minister for Finance do in regard to the other financial institutions? On each occasion there is an imposition &ndash; this is happening in regard to the rather paltry &euro;300 million levy imposed in the December budget by the Minister on the banks &ndash; it is inevitably passed on to the consumer. The banks pass it on and it is the consumer who pays at the end of the day. The Minister might use it as a way of garnering funds for the central Exchequer, but consumers actually <Col N="925" />pay whatever levies or taxes are imposed because banks protect themselves and their profits. Banks seem to have ample and ultimate power to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the credit union movement, there is a specific cap written into the legislation. As far as the other financial institutions are concerned, the proposal that will be devised in the regulations drawn up by the authority will require ministerial sanction. There is no intention in this legislation to establish a body which will make a profit at the expense of the financial services sector. I appreciate that the Senator canvassed wider issues regarding taxation in the State and the imposition of levies on financial institutions, but such matters are relevant to a debate on a Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>As far as this particular measure is concerned &ndash; I wish to reassure Senator McDowell who also raised it &ndash; this entity, comprising the Central Bank and the regulatory authority, is designed to work on a break even basis. That is the scheme of the legislation. The regulations drawn up by the authority are to fund the services provided by the authority and to extract from the industry a contribution for their funding. A detailed consultation process is laid out in the legislation and this will eventuate in regulations being drawn up by the authority which will require ministerial sanction and which will be laid before the Houses.</P>

      <P>In page 45, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;in the name of&rdquo; in line 22, down to and including &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; in line 26 and substitute &ldquo;after consultation with the other members of the Regulatory Authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the responsibility of the consumer director and seeks to amend the new section 33S(6) which states:</P>
      <P>The Consumer Director may issue codes or impose requirements under an enactment or statutory instrument referred to in subsection (2), but only in the name of the Regulatory Authority and after those codes or requirements have been approved by the other members of the Regulatory Authority.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to delete all words after &ldquo;but only&rdquo; and to insert in their place &ldquo;after consultation with the other members of the Regulatory Authority&rdquo;. It basically seeks greater consultation with the regulatory authority.</P>

      <P>The Bill provides that the consumer director may issue codes or impose requirements on financial services providers, but only in the name of the authority and with the approval of the other members of the authority. The amendment proposed by Senator Higgins is that the Director of Consumer Affairs be only <Col N="926" />required to consult with the other members of the authority in respect of issuing codes or imposing requirements.</P>
      <P>The codes and requirements will be issued to protect the consumer. It is important that there be complete agreement from the regulatory authority, in whose name they will be issued. If some institution is in breach of a code of conduct or requirement, the regulatory authority will have to deal with it. Thus, although the Director of Consumer Affairs is a member of the authority, it is fitting that codes or requirements issued by him or her be in the name of the authority. I am, therefore, of the view that the provision, as drafted, should remain and I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The McDowell group recommended that the regulatory authority should have the power to impose penalties. The question of providing this power to the regulatory authority is being considered in the context of the No. 2 Bill. As the imposition of penalties will be linked to these codes of practice, it is only appropriate that the codes be issued in the name of the authority and not in that of the consumer director because the power to impose penalties, as recommended by the McDowell report, will be vested in the authority.</P>

      <P>In page 46, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>)&nbsp;comparisons against best practice in other comparable countries in relation to the cost of financial services and the range and quality of  services offered.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the annual report. The new section 33T(3) sets out in detail what must be included in the annual report. It states:</P>
      <P>(3)&nbsp;In particular, an annual report must include information specifying&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;how far the Consumer Director has promoted the interests of consumers of relevant financial services during the financial year concerned, and</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>)&nbsp;what steps have been taken by the Regulatory Authority to increase the awareness of consumers of relevant financial services of the costs to consumers, risks and benefits involved in using those services, and</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>)&nbsp;the extent to which competition exists among providers of those services in so far as it affects consumers of those services, and</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) developments that have taken place with respect to the provision of those services in so far as those developments affect consumers of those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions are very laudable and commendable. I am seeking to insert another require<Col N="927" />ment relating to &ldquo;comparisons against best practice in other comparable countries in relation to the cost of financial services and the range and quality of services offered&rdquo;, which would be contained in the annual report. It would be wise to examine how our model fares against others.</P>
    <P>The McDowell report has been referred to extensively and was the source of this legislation. However, the appendix to the report refers to 24 or 25 different countries, most of which did not adopt the kind of model being enshrined in law in the Bill. It would, therefore, be good to have a review that would be as all-embracing as possible in order to see what is happening in the international market and how we compare in terms of best practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I understand that it deals with the strategic plan to be presented by the consumer director on an annual basis. It seems reasonable to include the provision contained in Senator Higgins's amendment.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties with financial services is that those who use them &ndash; I refer to individual consumers rather than institutions &ndash; frequently have a limited notion of what they are buying. They rely heavily on the advice of so-called experts &ndash; sometimes they are experts &ndash; and they frequently possess no information of an objective kind. Information about what happens in other jurisdictions and the products on offer there is often not available to the average consumer. It would, therefore, be reasonable to include an assessment of best practice in other countries in the strategic plan of the consumer director.</P>

The chief executive will be required to specify if any other matters should be included. The chief executive will be the person in the body being established by the legislation who will have the power of initiative in this respect. I have no doubt that he or she will take into account the kinds of issues the Senators have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not appropriate to be so prescriptive in legislation in respect of what else should be contained in the report. International comparisons might well be a feature of the report, but it will be a matter for the consumer director to decide what comparisons or methods might be used to fulfil his or her obligations. For those reasons, I am unable to accept the amendment. However, I was impressed by the tenor of Senators' contri<Col N="928" />butions on this section and I will undertake to bring their concerns to the attention of the appointee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators Quinn and McDowell for supporting the amendment. The Minister of State stated there is no doubt that the chief executive will take the issues we have outlined into consideration. However, I am at a loss as to why he would not enshrine in the legislation the fundamental requirement to gauge and monitor the operation of our strategy as against that of similar strategies in other countries. We pride ourselves on our internationalism and our taking part in what is happening globally, but the Minister of State is turning down the requirement to include, as an integral and vital part of the annual report, an analysis of what is happening in other jurisdictions. I genuinely believe that the Minister of State appreciates the merits of what is being proposed and it should be given serious consideration because it seems to make absolute sense.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State might indicate when he intends that the legislation will be enforced. I understood from his earlier comments that the Minister intends to appoint the board in a few months or perhaps even sooner.</P>
      <P>This legislation is an extremely important departure in the regulation of financial services and the industry is concerned that it should work well. Nonetheless, we should ensure that each function of the new authority will be allowed to have its own ethos. As I said earlier, there will inevitably be tension. I am aware of what has happened in other jurisdictions and the temptation will exist to adopt a softly-softly approach in the coming years in which the old embedded &ndash; if Members will excuse the use of that much-used phrase &ndash; traditions of the Central Bank will come to the fore and result in a careful approach to prudential supervision. However, there will be reluctance on the consumer side to exert the new powers of the regulatory authority with the force necessary to lend credibility to the new structure. I hope the consumer protection functions are provided with sufficient teeth in the Bill so they can be used in a public fashion, even if this is seen by some as rocking the boat and uncomfortable for certain elements in the financial services sector.</P>
    </Speaker>

It is important that the authority works, despite the fact that we have expressed doubts about the merits of merging its prudential and consumer <Col N="929" />protection elements. I agree with everything Senator McDowell said.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and I had an argument about when the review would be carried out. It should be carried out after a two-year period. The Minister of State said it would be a after a few years, but any reports the Minister or the Houses receive on an annual basis will, to an extent, be subjective. We need an objective, independent analysis of how the legislation will work. Will the Minister consider two years in place of the &ldquo;few years&rdquo; that is specified? It would be a timely juncture at which to carry out the regulation and would give sufficient time to see how the new body is discharging its remit once it is up and running.</P>

      <P>In regard to the point made by Senator Higgins on the proposed review of the Act, it is difficult to specify a particular time such as two years.

There is doubt in the public's mind about financial services and how they will be monitored. It is questionable whether the Central Bank has always acted in the public's interest as against the interest of other banks. The steps taken in the Bill go a long way towards ensuring that it is acting in the consumer's interest.</P>
      <P>I fully support the notion that almost every item of legislation should be subject to review, even if it is only a question of acknowledging that everything is all right.

      <P>Senator McDowell raised the matter of the commencement date of the new authority. The date fixed will be 1 May this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Senator Higgins, I am undertak<Col N="930" />ing on behalf of the Minister for Finance to write to the chairman of the regulatory authority to accept the spirit of the last amendment he tabled regarding the importance of including in the report comparisons against best practice in other comparable countries in relation to the cost of financial services and the range and quality of services offered. I regret I was unable to immortalise it on the legislative page.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general question raised by Senator Quinn on the manner in which the Bill is drafted, I accept it is complex legislation. Senators will have an opportunity to reconsider these matters in the context of the second Bill which will be introduced later in the year. It is an important Bill which deals with other aspects left over from the McDowell report.</P>
    <P>Senator Higgins also raised the issue of the number of years after which a review will take place. The Minister's uncertainty in regard to the number of years relates to the No. 2 Bill and when it will finally be enacted through both Houses of the Oireachtas and submitted to the President for signature. It is clearly an important Bill and, in a sense, it is difficult to assess the whole area before both items of legislation are in full operation. It is important to note that a measure of accountability of the new authority will be established from 1 May in regard to the Houses of the Oireachtas and its committees. There is nothing to prejudice or prevent an assessment at any stage of this new institution in that context.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the interest they have shown in the Bill and for their co-operation in facilitating its passage through the House. It was a priority for the Government to have the measure enacted by 1 May so that we could proceed with the establishment of the authority.</P>
    <P>I echo what the Minister for Finance said on Second Stage in the Dáil by paying tribute to those in the Central Bank, the officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, and the office of the Registrar of Friendly Societies who are involved in the supervision of the financial sector. Their diligence and hard work has ensured Ireland is an attractive, soundly regulated location for the financial services industry. I wish them well in their work within the new structures. I again thank Senators for the co-operation they extended in facilitating the enactment of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I shall speak on the section anyway. I am sorry that amendment No. 1 was not acceptable. The purpose of it was to bring our own policing operation up to the same standard as the Police Service of Northern Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland, we have all been very keen to press home the importance of implementing the Patten recommendations and how significant they are in terms of policing in Northern Ireland, but we have not taken on board the fact that, as a result, the police service in Northern Ireland is a lot more modern than our own.</P>
      <P>I know there are proposals for a police inspectorate a couple of years down the line. However, a number of NGOs, for example, have indicated that this would be inferior to a proper ombudsman. If we are to have North-South co-operation, it would be a good start to have common standards of control and accountability in relation to our police forces.</P>
      <P>I am not really clear as to why amendment No. 1 is not in order. I would have thought it was relevant to the section, and I would appreciate any clarification on this.</P>

      <P>I approve of section 2 and have no problem with it whatsoever. My query is the same as Senator Tuffy's. My heart is not in amendments Nos. 1 and 2, but I am puzzled as to why they are not in order. It may well be because they are not relevant specifically to section 2. I know that Senator Terry put down amendment No. 2 in the belief that it would strengthen the Bill in meeting its objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who spoke on Second Stage yesterday are very enthusiastic about this Bill and any effort we make now is designed to improve it. I am sure that Senator Terry and Senator Tuffy, in putting down a similar amendment, both hoped to improve the Bill by making it more realistic and more valuable. I would assume, therefore, that there is an explanation as to why any proposed amendment to the Bill is not acceptable. I <Col N="932" />imagine it is because the amendments are in the wrong place and might have been quite acceptable had they been included not under section 2 but elsewhere. I would welcome any advice the Chair can give me on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Two sections form the essence of the Bill. Section 2 relates to lateral mobility and section 3 relates to secondments. As was suggested yesterday, the Minister should ensure that people will avail of the opportunities provided for in section 2 by applying for positions. I wonder whether, at some stage, opportunities for lateral mobility might be created at levels below that of superintendent. Qualification for the scheme is set at a very high level at present, so a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland can apply for a position here, for example, but not below the level of superintendent. The same applies to members of the Gárda Síochana applying for positions in the PSNI.</P>
      <P>This measure is very much to be welcomed and I hope that every encouragement will be given in that regard. It will assist and be of benefit to the police forces in both jurisdictions. In taking on board the whole purpose and <i>raison d'être </i>of the Patten report, the measure will obviously also assist in instilling confidence in and support for the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy inferred, or even stated, that the Garda Síochána should be brought up to the standards of the PSNI. I believe we can be proud of the service we get from the Garda Síochána, and I certainly would not make any distinction between the two services in that regard. Whether there is an ombudsman or not is not particularly relevant to this section of the Bill. This is about people applying for positions. Whether we have the system in place in this jurisdiction or the ombudsman system that applies in Northern Ireland is germane to the whole import of the Bill but not this particular section.</P>

      <P>I would not like what I said to be interpreted in the manner that Senator Walsh has suggested. I absolutely accept that our police service is up to a good standard in terms of the work it does, but we do need to modernise our structures. The types of structures that have been brought into the Police Service of Northern Ireland are something we could model our structures on in terms of the accountability of the police service.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Labour Party amendment was, on the one hand, to render the Garda more directly accountable to the public but also to improve its effectiveness. It was a positive proposal. As I made clear yesterday, I do welcome the section in general and the thrust of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Senator's amendment was ruled out of order. It was not my decision but was a ruling <Col N="933" />by the Clerk. I understand the ruling is based on article 88 of Standing Orders, the relevant part of which states, &ldquo;No amendment shall be proposed which is in conflict with the principle of the Bill, as read a second time.&rdquo;  The view taken, apparently, is that the amendment proposed does not arise under the terms of the Bill, which is especially evident if one reads the Long Title to the Bill:</P>
      <P>Bill entitled an Act to make provision, in accordance with the Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on Police Co-operation, done at Belfast on 29 April 2002, in relation to the appointment and secondment of members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to such ranks in the Garda Síochána as may be prescribed, the secondment of members of the Garda Síochána to that Service and other connected matters.</P>
      <P>There is nothing there about an ombudsman. The issue does arise in relation to disciplinary measures that would have to be taken in the case of certain conduct when people are serving in one police force or the other.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh's point that superintendent is the lowest rank at which people can apply for transfers relates, of course, to the lateral transfer provisions of the legislation. My understanding is that the agreement on which the legislation is based provided for that. That was the rank agreed. It is always up to the Governments on both sides of the Border to change this in the future if there is a new agreement.</P>
      <P>I made the point yesterday on Second Stage that the Government was going ahead with legislation to introduce a Garda inspectorate which would be something equivalent to the ombudsman in Northern Ireland, although not exactly the same. I do not think the people appointed to deal with discipline in a police force are exactly the same in any two jurisdictions. We are calling it an inspectorate because the Minister is attracted by the idea of having three members. Usually, when only one person is in charge, it is called an ombudsman. We are not hung up too much on the name but it is more appropriate to call it an inspectorate. It will have fairly wide powers of investigation and replace the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. It will also have a more general focus.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Tuffy that its establishment is several years down the road. If that was the case, there would be an unanswerable argument to reject the amendment which, unfortunately, she was not able to propose because it would mean that this legislation, which is urgent, would be delayed for several years. It is the Government's intention to proceed as quickly as possible. It is my intention and that of the Minister to have the legislation for a Garda inspectorate in place before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="934" />My inclination is to agree with Senator Maurice Hayes that this legislation has already been delayed for too long. I think he made this point yesterday on Second Stage. In the light of what is happening at in the North, there would need to be a strong and compelling case to justify further delay. The fact something is coming but not yet in place is not a sufficiently strong reason to justify the further delay of something which, by common consensus, has already been delayed for too long.</P>
    <P>It is our intention to proceed with this legislation and put the new Garda inspectorate in place at the earliest possible opportunity. No doubt we will debate that Bill in this and the other House. I will welcome Members' comments on it. Our focus for the moment is to put this legislation on the Statute Book at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>Ms Terry: I apologise for being late. I believe two of my amendments have been ruled out of order. I would, therefore, like to speak to the section. I welcome the provision whereby permanent members may be seconded to the two police forces. I do not wish to delay the Bill which is necessary. Any proposals we bring forward are to improve the Bill rather than delay it.</P>
    <P>Dr. M. Hayes: Two things are required to move policing on in the North and they are interlinked. One is the ability to transfer and the other the participation of Sinn Féin in policing arrangements. Since it is looking for this, it seems rather ironic that it does not move. I hope it moves quickly on the other issues because it would make it much more attractive and much easier to get members of the Garda Síochána to go North. It is also difficult to say people are respected when they are on this side of the Border and that somehow they lose respect when they are on the other side.</P>
    <P>I ask the Senator to consider that the greater public purpose is served, at least in the short term, by the passing of this Bill. I, too, subscribe totally to the idea of a police ombudsman, inspectorate or whatever one wants to call them. It is totally illogical and unbalanced unless roughly the same arrangements apply on both sides of the Border. It might help if instead of saying the Government intends to introduce the inspectorate soon, there could be a narrowing of the window; for instance, that the Bill could be brought forward before the summer. That would be helpful to those concerned about it.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Dea: I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes. It is our intention to publish the Bill as quickly as possible. I will convey what he said to the Minister. As matters stand, it is our intention and, dare I say, our expectation that the Bill will be in the public domain before the summer.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    <P>Ms Tuffy: I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" />In page 4, between lines 37 and 38 to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;subject to this Act, be a member of the Garda Síochána,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide legal clarity. The Bill, as it stands, does not state whether members from the Police Service of Northern Ireland will be members of the Garda Síochána during their stay here. If the amendment was inserted in the Bill, it would clarify the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with the amendment but the reason I will not insert it in the Bill is that, strictly speaking, it is not necessary. It is clear from the provisions of section 3(1) that a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland seconded to the Garda Síochána and appointed in accordance with this section is appointed to a rank in the Garda Síochána. I will read the full text of section 3(1) to make it clearer: &ldquo;. . . the Commissioner may, at the request of the Chief Constable [this refers to somebody from the PSNI appointed to the Garda Síochána] (<i>a</i>) appoint a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to a rank in the Garda Síochána. . . &rdquo;. It is stated in paragraph (<i>b</i>) that the Commissioner may, at the request of the Chief Constable &ldquo;request the Government to appoint such a member to a rank in the Garda Síochána not below that of superintendent. . . &rdquo;. The Government must appoint superintendents but they are appointed to a rank in the Garda Síochána. Subsection (2) states, &ldquo;The ranks in the Garda Síochána to which such members may be appointed. . . &rdquo;. It is clear that somebody so appointed for the period of the secondment is, effectively, a member of the Garda Síochána. As that is clear in the text, I do not see any need for the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might seem clear but if it is, why is it is necessary to state the person will be under the direction and control of the Commissioner and have the powers, duties, rights and obligations of a member of the Garda Síochána? That would seem obvious also but it has had to be spelled out in the legislation. Not inserting the amendment is an omission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator has a point but, strictly speaking, it may not be necessary to make it clearer as we are making it clear that the person appointed shall be under the full direction and control of the Commissioner because up to the point of secondment, they will have been under the control and direction of the Chief Constable. It was considered necessary by the parliamentary counsel to clarify the matter but I do not think it is necessary to insert another paragraph to state that the person so seconded is a member of the Garda Síochána because that is absolutely clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" />My inclination is to keep legislation as short as possible. If the meaning is clear in the text, I dislike adding to it. Adding to the text along the lines the Senator suggested would not do any harm to it and would not make any difference one way or the other. Therefore, the case for including it has not been made.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 44 and 45 to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>)&nbsp;a senior Garda shall sit on the interview panel,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is not clear what the make-up of the interview panel will be. We should ensure there is a senior member of the Garda Síochana on the interviewing panel. I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator seeks is not unreasonable. However, it is not regarded as a matter for primary legislation, in the context of appointment to a rank in the Garda Síochana under this section, to provide for the composition of the selection board or interview panel. That is a matter which can be provided for, as appropriate, by regulation.</P>
      <P>The amendment, as proposed, is to include a new paragraph (<i>a</i>) in subsection (4). That subsection states that the provisions outlined do not apply in relation to a person appointed under the section. Therefore, if the amendment was to be accepted, we would be making a provision to ensure a senior garda would not be able to sit on the panel &ndash; the opposite of what the Senator intends.</P>
      <P>I realise that this was probably an error and that the intent was to ensure Garda management was involved in the interview or selection process, which is quite reasonable. However, the selection of PSNI officers for secondment will be a matter for the Chief Constable in the first instance. It may transpire that senior Garda management may be involved in that process but this will be a matter for consultation between the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable in due course. Matters relating to the appointment of officers under section 3 can be provided for in regulations by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the approval of the Government, as provided for in section 7 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Garda Commissioner and Chief Constable may decide that a Garda officer will sit on the Northern Ireland selection board, the <Col N="937" />composition of a selection board in another jurisdiction is not something for which we can legislate. However, if the Commissioner and Chief Constable agree, as may well be the case, that a senior member of the Garda Síochana will sit on a Northern Ireland selection board, I presume that would only be in the light of a reciprocal arrangement whereby we would agree that a senior member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland could sit on our interview boards. It is a matter that can safely be left to regulation following discussion between the Chief Constable and the Commissioner.</P>

It may have been a misprint but it is difficult to see where the amendment would fit in between lines 44 and 45. Subsection (4) deals with a series of exclusions and to add a proscription would be to mix the sugar with the salt.</P>
      <P>These small matters are better dealt with by regulation. I anticipate that the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable will have a joint board to deal with such matters, perhaps all at once. I suggest that we accept the Minister of State's view that these matters will be better dealt with when we discuss the regulation.</P>

He applied the caveat that it would be for the two police forces to decide whether an arrangement would be made with regard to cross-representation on interview boards, which would be very welcome. It would show excellent co-operation but would also apply safeguards from the point of view of both police forces.

      <P>It may not be possible for the Minister of State to address my concerns as there may be no specific answers at this stage. However, it would be desirable to have parameters with regard to the take-up of this facility in the Bill. The success of the legislation depends on the extent to which people avail of sections 2 and 3. It might be useful if there were some target areas. It is fine if there are not but this should be considered in order that the success or otherwise of the Bill could be gauged. It could be done on a mutual basis with the PSNI. It could be useful in that, as Senator Maurice Hayes said on Second Stage, this may require some incentives to be built in to encourage people to make applications and avail of it. That may not be necessary but we will not know until the legislation has been in operation for a period. However, in the first instance, there should be some sort of targets at which to aim. Otherwise, the experience of the legislation will become the target for future years. I would like to think that, at the outset, a certain number of placements would be expected in a given year from one side to the other. I do not know what information the Minister of State has on this.</P>

      <P>Section 3(2) provides specifically that the ranks in the Garda Síochána to which members coming from the North may be appointed under this section, and the number of such members to be appointed, may be proscribed. In other words, it will be dealt with in regulations which obviously will be drafted in the light of discussion between the police services on both sides of the Border and political contacts between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Administration on the other side.</P>
      <P>I understand the Garda Commissioner has something in mind, although the exact number or target has not yet been communicated to me. The Commissioner has something in mind but has yet to find out if that is achievable. We have wide discretion as to how we put this in the regulation. For example, a maximum number could be put in and varied in different ways. The Government is thinking along these lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider some brief questions. After the disciplinary action has been heard in the North and the issue has been dealt with by the Garda Commissioner in this jurisdiction, would the Minister see his way <Col N="940" />to granting a garda or his/her legal or union representative the right of audience with the commissioner or deputy commissioner? I do not suggest that the case should be re-opened or reheard, but that a synopsis of the case should be put before the Garda Commissioner, or his deputy, bearing in mind that they will not have heard the verbal evidence but will merely have received a transcript. I am aware that when disciplinary actions are dealt with by the bodies on which I sit &ndash; the Medical Council and An Bord Altranais &ndash; the person who is the subject of the action is always given a final right of audience before the individual who has the final say.</P>
      <P>I have read the details of the actions that can follow a disciplinary hearing. The gravest action is dismissal and the next &ndash; an alternative to dismissal &ndash; is the requirement to retire or resign. The second rank of punishments seems to involve a similar kind of action to dismissal. Would be possible to provide for the suspension of a garda rather than resignation or forced retirement? It is something the Minister of State might consider.</P>

      <P>One presumes that both services will send their best and brightest people to the other forces. One hopes, therefore, that cases where disciplinary action is necessary will be few and far between. In such circumstances and in order to encourage people to take up the offer, it is advisable to lean in favour of giving people the safeguards they want. It would not be right if cases were heard in a court elsewhere which might not have the same set of values. The general purpose of the legislation in relation to negotiating such matters would be best met by providing the safeguards that people think they need.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7 between lines 43 and 44 to insert the following new sub-section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)&nbsp;For the purposes of proceedings against such a person under the Disciplinary Regulations or 1986 Act, those Regulations, that Act and this section shall, notwithstanding that the period of secondment has expired or been terminated and for as long as the person is a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, continue to apply in relation to the person as if he or she were a member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the purpose of this provision is quite simple. If, for whatever reason, the secondment of a PSNI officer to the Garda Síochána either expires or is terminated, this provision allows for the disciplinary regulations and the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act 1986, as described in section 6(2), to continue to apply. This allows for the continuation of a disciplinary process, or a commencement of a disciplinary process, in respect of a member of the PSNI who is on secondment as a result of an alleged breach of discipline while appointed to a rank in the Garda Síochána on secondment.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the regulations, the 1986 Act and this section will continue to apply &ldquo;for as long as the person is a member of the Police Service of Northern Ireland&rdquo;. The obvious reason for this provision is that if the person concerned is no longer a member of the PSNI, there is little point in pursuing disciplinary proceedings when the worst sanction that could be subsequently imposed is that he or she would be dismissed. This would be a pointless exercise if the person in question had already left the force. If a criminal matter arose relating to an incident which may have occurred during the secondment period, however, the fact that the person concerned may have subsequently left the PSNI would not prevent criminal law from applying in the normal manner. I propose that the amendment be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been something of a difficulty in the past, in my experience. People have avoided disciplinary action they were obliged to face by retiring on the grounds of ill health. There was some evidence of a degree of collusion by management in the matters at which I looked in order that a case could be removed from the books or a difficult employee could be <Col N="942" />removed. Does this amendment cover such matters? Does it mean that a person can escape all disciplinary action by submitting a resignation notice or by leaving on grounds of ill health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that a person can escape in such a manner, as far as I understand it. The worst sanction that can be taken against a person is that they can be dismissed from the force. If they have left the force, not only is the option of dismissal not available, but also other options, such as demotion, cannot be pursued. People who retire, with the collusion of management in many cases as Senator Maurice Hayes has correctly pointed out, are not those who are retiring voluntarily. They are retiring because they have no option &ndash; they are being pushed. I suppose that is regarded as sufficient sanction. The Garda can impose disciplinary sanctions on its members, but it cannot do so in relation to those who have left. When people are gone, they are gone.</P>

They do much better than others. If they are dismissed on disciplinary grounds, they do not receive the benefits I have mentioned.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is merit in what Senator Maurice Hayes has said. It is often the case that people leave employment, having been guilty of misconduct, with pension rights and gratuities. It is important that if the offence has the effect of impacting on those benefits while a person is still in service then it should equally have an impact if the person leaves an employment. I am not sure how that can be incorporated. That is the only situation I can envisage where there would be a pen<Col N="943" />alty other than dismissal.

      <P>We will bear that proposal in mind.</P>
      <P>In relation to the point made by Senator Tuffy, the position is that the Garda Síochána are doing the investigation here and they are the people who ultimately make the finding. The question of the imposition of sanctions is for the Chief Constable to decide. It is important that the Garda is allowed to continue with the investigation up to the point where a finding can be made and recommendations can be given to the Chief Constable. It is ultimately the Chief Constable's responsibility but I imagine a finding against an individual by the Garda Síochána which may recommend dismissal because of their activities while on secondment in this State, would have a powerful effect on the Chief Constable. The chances are that the Chief Constable would have to take some similar disciplinary action. The proposal is to enable the Garda to continue the investigation to the point where a finding can be made even if the person has returned to the North.</P>

      <P>Since I raised a few hares, I wish to offer the Minister of State an olive branch at this point. I do not think it is worth imperilling this Bill by getting into the wider questions of the negotiation of terms and conditions for gardaí. It strikes me that if one was seen to import some sort of special condition about not allowing people to retire or about the sickness benefits, the representative bodies North and South would take a poor view of it. It is something that the Minister of State might bear in mind when that is being done. It would be unfair to place a garda, who did the State the great benefit of volunteering to transfer, in a worse position in relation to some of these things than a person who did not.</P>

    <P>This amendment relates to personnel exchanges and it was discussed yesterday. Persons working under exchange would not have the powers of duty as described in other sections. The Bill proposes that the period of stay would not exceed one year. My amendment proposes that the period of time should be changed to three years in order to coincide with the other arrangements. One year is a very short time for a person to familiarise themselves with the situation. My amendment would allow a person to stay for more than one year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the agreement between the Government and the British Government done in Belfast on 29 April 2002. Like Senator Terry I have a similar difficulty in trying to interpret this provision. I notice that under Article 5 a programme shall be introduced to facilitate members to transfer and be placed within the other police force and therefore perhaps policing is not envisaged as part of that. I wonder if there is a general expectation that people who avail of the transfer will automatically serve beyond one year as under section 3. I envisage that people could transfer for periods of six or nine months and I believe they should also be involved in policing duties during that time.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State specifically mentioned training exchanges which have already taken place between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI. That is to be welcomed. The development of skills in areas such as detective work would be worthwhile in this context. I have a certain reservation. I appreciate that the intent of this article is very different for those participants as opposed to those on normal secondment. I ask the Minister of State to explain why we would not allow people who transfer to have the powers of policing in the jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I too regard this as a bit anomalous and I wonder why it turned out the way it is. The Schedule to the Bill is simply the recital of an agreement between the two Governments and it does not seem to me to be amenable to amendment by a motion in the House. It might be helpful and sensible in any case if the Minister of State, with the corresponding Minister in Northern Ireland and the Chief Constable and the Garda Commissioner, agreed to have in, say, three years' time a review of the working of the scheme and then bring forward amendments to which everyone could agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Maurice Hayes and Jim Walsh are correct. The agreement is already in <Col N="945" />place and we do not have the power to amend it. As I understand, there are three situations which are dealt with in the agreement. The first is lateral transfer. Those of superintendent rank can apply for a position in this country and <i>vice versa.</i> Second, people of ranks from inspector downwards can apply for secondment to this country or to Northern Ireland for a period of up to three years. They will, in effect, be a member of the police force in the jurisdiction to which they are seconded. Article 5 provides for people to come down here on a temporary basis or for people to go North on a temporary basis for a maximum of 12 months. What is envisaged is that people with specialist skills in certain areas will be able to share their expertise with people on the other side of the Border and <i>vice versa.</i>The question of people being able to do policing work is dealt with. People can be seconded to do policing work. The parties to the 2002 agreement envisaged that people would come and go for relatively short periods to give the benefit of their expertise to those on the other side. I will bear in mind what has been said. I will bear in mind also Senator Maurice Hayes's point about reviewing the provision in three years' time. The main issue is that the agreement is in place and we do not have the power to change it.</P>

      <P>I accept that we cannot make changes today. However, I would like the Minister of State to keep in mind my proposal because retaining the one year clause may exclude someone who has great skill and who would be of great benefit in either jurisdiction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My query relates to Article 1. I am sure there are good reasons why mobility has been decided at superintendent level rather than lower grades. Perhaps it is the toe in the water syndrome whereby one must wait to see how it works out. I would like to think that lower grades would have the opportunity to apply for permanent positions on a cross-Border basis. Perhaps the Minister will consider applying the measure to the rank of sergeant, assuming the system works well. Both police forces could benefit from this exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said during previous debates on crime, etc., in many instances the performance of gardaí in divisions, areas and towns relates directly to the quality of management. Obviously, <Col N="946" />opening up the system so that people of quality can be appointed to managerial positions within the Garda will be of benefit. The wider the scope the better, and this would be one way of achieving it.</P>

      <P>Lateral entry of experienced officers from other police forces or services, and secondments or recruitments from non-police organisations should be actively encouraged.</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The Patten report recommended that the community balance at more senior ranks in the Police Service should be redressed by lateral entry from other police services. The two Governments have committed themselves to taking all necessary steps to facilitate lateral entry to both services at ranks above inspector, including the bringing forward of any necessary legislation. Issues relating to equivalence of ranks and qualifications, selection procedures and administrative measures on entry need to be resolved in both jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>The Senator is correct. It is the beginning of something new which we will review in light of our experience.</P>

It is fair to say that we have had a good and engaging debate on this short but important Bill. I hope it will be of benefit to both the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It will increase confidence on both sides of the Border in both police forces, which is important. The police in all jurisdictions work in the interests of the community, often at personal risk to themselves. They provide an invaluable service. While we may from time to time criticise certain failures, we should acknowledge that in general police forces play a fundamental role in society.</P>

      <P>I do not want to cause too much distress by talking about things such as computers. It is important that there is an infrastructure behind this Bill's proposals and that the police forces, both North and South, are able to speak to each other and share information.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The regulation of the electrical contracting sector in Ireland has been the cause of considerable controversy for some years. Concerns over poor standards and the possibility of increased injury or damage to property caused by shoddy workmanship led to a voluntary initiative between the then Department of Energy, the Electricity Supply Board and the electrical contracting associations in the early 1990s. That resulted in the establishment of the Register of Electricity Contractors of Ireland, RECI, which carries out a regulatory function for its members. A second body, the Electrical Contractors' Safety and Standards Association, ECSSA, was established subsequently and also aims to regulate safety standards among such contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of safe electricity is a major issue in public safety. Between 1988 and 1999, 76 people <Col N="949" />were killed in Ireland as a result of accidents attributed to electricity. In 1998, nearly 5% of all fires were attributed to electrical causes &ndash; over 1,261 fires in Irish homes and businesses. Fires attributed to electrical causes were responsible for nearly 18% of deaths caused fires that year. Although not all those fires and fatalities can be solely attributed to the standard of work that contractors carry out, it is nonetheless alarming that the incidence of accidents is so high. There is no doubt that better regulation of the work of electrical contractors would have a positive impact and reduce the risk of death, damage or injury.</P>
    <P>The Government approach to the issue has been to pass the buck, shifting the regulation of electrical contractors from one Department to another &ndash; the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have all in the past absolved themselves of responsibility for the issue. The Health and Safety Authority has also claimed that it has no responsibility for the regulation of electrical contractors.</P>
    <P>The major impetus for change in the area has come from the Interdepartmental Review Group on Public Safety, whose report was published in July 2000. In the foreword, the group's chairman stressed the urgent need to address concerns about the regulation of electrical contractors. There is no doubt that, since the establishment of RECI and ECSSA, there has been an improvement in standards of safety and competence in the electrical contracting sector.</P>
    <P>The fact that electricity is such a potentially hazardous and widely used source of energy makes it vitally important to ensure that members of the public are not put at risk through everyday use. Substandard installations in homes have led to fires and electrocutions and resulted in substantial loss of life in recent years. There is widespread acceptance that the scheme established by the formation of RECI, whose members I welcome to the Gallery, has contributed positively to improving standards and protecting the public.</P>
    <P>There have been some shortcomings with the current system, and RECI and others have been endeavouring to raise those issues in recent years. In particular, there are concerns that the current system of regulation and supervision is voluntary and does not place enough of an onus on contractors or electricians to maintain high standards of public safety, adequate insurance and proper training. There is also a difficulty in enforcing the safety standards when electrical contractors or electricians registered with one regulatory body leave it and go to another such body before a disciplinary process against them has been concluded. That undermines the very essence of a regulatory regime for the electrical contracting sector. The Bill addresses that issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" />There are also difficulties with the inspection of contractors' work and situations where the owners of premises are not prepared to allow the regulatory organisations to carry out inspections. The Bill also addresses that. There is at present a ludicrous situation with different standards of safety applied for people in the home and in the workplace. The Bill addresses that issue too. Domestic customers currently have no statutory or regulatory protection against shoddy work, while those in the workplace have some protection from the Health and Safety Authority, as the Minister of State will know. There is therefore a need to equalise and regularise the regime.</P>
    <P>Some misgivings have also been expressed about consistency in the operation of the regulatory organisations. As I said, in July 2000, the Interdepartmental Review Group on Public Safety published a report dealing with all aspects of its remit. In the foreword, the chairman, Professor Danny O'Hare, highlighted the fact that issues affecting the regulation of the electrical contracting sector raised serious questions about public safety that needed to be urgently addressed. The Department of Public Enterprise led an initiative to involve the Commission for Electricity Regulation in dealing with issues of public safety affecting the electrical contracting sector. That process has not yet reached a conclusion, but the Commissioner for Electricity Regulation has held discussions with interested parties about issues of concern.</P>
    <P>There has been absolutely no indication from the Government as to when measures will be taken to address the shortcomings and concerns identified regarding public safety and the electrical contracting sector. There has been some suggestion that the matter may be addressed in the context of the forthcoming legislation to reform the Electricity Supply Board. A timescale of several years has been suggested by sources close to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>To address this issue, a Private Members' Bill has been prepared and brought by me before the House to deal with the concerns I have mentioned. It is based on correcting the shortcomings with the current system on a basis that would utilise existing skills, agencies and competencies and which would not place an additional drain on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to amend the Electricity Regulation Act by conferring additional responsibility on the Commission for Electricity Regulation to have a general overall supervisory function. The commission would exercise its supervisory functions by ensuring bodies such as the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland, the Electrical Contractors Safety and Standards Association or any regulatory body recognised as having competence in this area would operate to certain consistent standards.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" />The Bill would also oblige all electrical contractors and electricians to register with such bodies which, for the purpose of the Bill, are known as the electrical contracting supervisory bodies. The scheme envisaged under the Bill would make best use of existing resources and expertise and do a considerable amount to remedy the existing shortcomings within the system of regulation.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a number of key features which I will itemise. The Commission for Electricity Regulation, known as the commission, would be given the power to ensure the electrical contracting industry operated to the highest possible standard of public safety. All electricians, electrical contractors or employers engaging electricians for the purposes of carrying out electrical work in factories or plant would be obliged to register on an annual basis with an electrical contracting supervisory body. The Bill would provide that no person could be a member of more than one such body. This would correct a shortcoming with the current system of regulation where contractors have adopted what might be described as an <i>à la carte</i> approach or attitude to supervision and regulation. As there have been some concerns that any attempt to address this could fall foul of the Competition Act, the legislation seeks to address that matter head on. The measure would make good sense and stand up to scrutiny under the Competition Act.</P>
    <P>The legislation also seeks to impose criminal sanction where a person engages in electrical contracting work while not registered with one of the contracting supervisory bodies. It would also address an additional shortcoming with the current system. The supervisory bodies have been unable to enter premises to inspect work carried out by electricians or electrical contractors in circumstances where the owner of the premises has refused admission. In such circumstances, it is impossible for the contracting bodies to determine if the electrical installation has been completed to a satisfactory standard or if there is some deficiency from a safety perspective. Under this legislation, the Commission for Electricity Regulation could appoint an authorised officer to carry out an inspection, and where it was carried out in a house and the home owner refused admission, there would be a provision facilitating a court order to permit such an inspection.</P>
    <P>The legislation also contains a provision that would prohibit the Electricity Supply Board from permitting the connecting to its network of any premises unless the applicant could supply proof that the electrical installations and repair work at the premises had been carried out by a registered contractor, electrician or employer. The Bill also contains a provision that would allow the Commission for Electricity Regulation to direct the board to disconnect supply in certain limited circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="952" />The electrical contracting supervisory bodies should be licensed by the Commission for Electricity Regulation and have their functions as set out in section 8 of the Bill. In general terms, they should be solely concerned with the supervision of members and aim to maintain and improve the standards in the provision by them of such services for consumers. These supervisory bodies should not have any trade or commercial objective but be solely concerned with regulation and the interests of public safety.</P>
    <P>The Commission for Electricity Regulation would have a central role in the regulation of electrical contracting in Ireland under the proposed legislation and set out the technical codes of practice to which electricians, electrical contractors and registered employers would have to adhere in the performance of their functions. In most cases the commission would merely endorse or employ industry accepted standards and rules.</P>
    <P>The Commission for Electricity Regulation would also set out the rules that would apply for connection to the Electricity Supply Board network. It would also dictate the rules and regulations that would apply to the recognition, licensing operation and control of electrical contracting supervisory bodies. This is to address a perceived shortcoming with the existing system of regulation where there are no common rules for the operation, control, management or direction of electrical contracting supervisory bodies.</P>
    <P>There is no sustainable or convincing reason the Government should not accept the Bill. The structure and solution proposed are not controversial. There is widespread support from all the organisations associated with electricity safety, and the measures proposed in the Bill would utilise existing structures and resources without placing the burden of a single additional cent of funding on the Exchequer. The most compelling reason for accepting the Bill is that it would save lives. The sooner the Government accepts this, the more lives that will be saved. What more compelling reason could there be for accepting the legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt. In the previous Seanad he and I were accustomed to facing each other from these respective positions. He has graduated but I am glad to be a Member still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am honoured to have the opportunity of seconding the motion, &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This long overdue legislation seeks to establish a statutory regime for the regulation of the electrical contracting sector with the overall purpose of improving public safety. It aims to build on the existing regulatory regime that has been in operation since 1996 and address serious shortcomings in the current system identified in the report of the review group on public safety published in July 2000. The issue of better <Col N="953" />regulation in the electrical contracting sector has been of concern for some time to all organisations associated with electrical safety. The major impetus for change in this area came from the review group on public safety which stressed the urgent need to tackle certain inadequacies in the regulation of electrical contractors. The need for reform has also been acknowledged by all bodies associated with electricity such as the Register of Electrical Contractors in Ireland, RECI, the Electrical Contractors Safety and Standards Association, the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland, the ESB, the Health and Safety Authority and related Departments. The amount of support for change is a glaring indication of the urgency of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Electricity is one of the greatest forms of energy today and one cannot imagine how different our lives would be without it. However, if mismanaged, our silent servant can be deadly. In 2001, 17% of all fire fatalities were in fires attributed to electricity. In 2000 the figure was 9% but in 1999 the figure was 19%. It was 18% in 1998. In 2000 almost 1,500 fires were caused by electricity, one third of which were due to electrical wiring installations. The figures speak for themselves and it is a miracle that more lives have not been lost.</P>
    <P>While all these fires and fatalities cannot solely be attributed to the standard of work electrical contractors carry out, it is alarming that the incidence of accidents is at such a high level. We need an effective regulatory system for electrical contracting work in order that consumers have the best protection when hiring contractors. The legislation proposes to create a system where all qualified electrical contractors will need to register with a self-regulatory body which will ensure that standards are maintained and consumer safety is upheld.</P>
    <P>The current situation regarding regulation of electrical contracting is unsustainable. What we have at the moment are two self-regulating bodies for electrical contractors with no clear harmonisation of standards. Membership is voluntary and the enforcement of safety standards is difficult. At present, domestic customers have no statutory or regulatory protection against shoddy work. While people in the workplace have some protection from the Health and Safety Authority, there are difficulties with the inspection of contractors' work in situations where the owners of premises are not prepared to allow the regulatory authorities to carry out inspections. Difficulties have arisen where people who are not members of the current regulatory organisations carry out work and where forms are presented to the ESB on their behalf for unsupervised and uninspected work.</P>
    <P>The form of regulation in the Bill is uncomplicated. It is easily accomplished as it relies on the existing established structures but corrects the <Col N="954" />shortcomings in a statutory context. The process outlined utilises the skills and experience of RECI and ECSSA and involves the Commission for Electricity Regulation in a general supervisory scheme. It is a cost effective means of addressing a difficult and serious issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the CER be given the statutory power to oversee the sustained harmonisation of the safety and technical standards of the electrical contracting industry in Ireland. To ensure best consumer protection, the Bill proposes to make it an offence for an unregistered contractor to carry out any electrical work. All electricians and electrical contractors will be obliged to register with the supervisory bodies regardless of whether they work full-time or part-time as electricians. There is no reason why the standards of care or supervision for consumers using electrical contractors should differ depending on the type of contractor they hire. The standards should be consistent and should apply to all electricians and contractors.</P>
    <P>The reforms are inexpensive and therefore of minimal cost, if any, to the Exchequer as the annual registration fee payable by the electrical contractors to the self-regulatory bodies will fund the process of registration. This Bill will save lives. The measures proposed can only work to improve the current situation. The proposed legislation will ensure greater public safety, greater consumer confidence in the electrical contracting industry, a harmonisation of standards among the self-regulating bodies and obligatory registration for qualified electrical contractors with a self-regulatory body.</P>
    <P>It is almost three years since the report of the review group on public safety was published and the issues of concern have still not been addressed. This Bill aims to tackle those concerns and to put public safety at the forefront of the electrical contracting industry. Safety is the watchword which is and should be of paramount importance. I hope the Government will accept this Bill and, accordingly, I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this measure. The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 was the first step in the process of liberalisation of the electricity sector in this country. It is intended this process should continue and any discussion in this area is welcome.</P>
      <P>As someone who introduced a Private Members' Bill in Dáil Éireann, during my time as a Member of that House, I realise the amount of work involved in putting together such a measure. Accordingly, I commend Senator Higgins on the efforts he has made to bring this measure forward and to put it before us tonight. It is an honourable attempt to bring about improvements in the sector but I am not in a position to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" />This measure was first introduced in the Dáil in January 2002. A detailed consultation process has been in place since then in order to introduce comprehensive legislation in the area and this has perhaps superseded what is proposed here. Hopefully, Senator Higgins's efforts will expedite the publication and introduction of the new electricity Bill which I understand is to appear towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the legislation before us is to bring electrical contractors, for certain purposes, under the remit of the Commission for Electricity Regulation. The main functions of that body, at present, relate to electricity generation and competition within the sector. What is proposed appears to introduce another layer of bureaucracy which we could well do without. It requires businesses and industry to register on an annual basis. As public representatives, one of the biggest complaints we hear from small businesses in our constituencies regards the amount of red tape that the Oireachtas has created. In many ways it has helped to strangle many businesses and some decide it is not worth the effort. Electrical contractors, by and large, fall into this category as most of them are small operators.</P>
    <P>Electrical contractors must be fully qualified to operate as such and will not have RECI recognition if they are not competent to do the job. I accept the point made about safety, which must always be paramount, but the industry is instituting proper controls in this area. Therefore, I do not believe we need to impose by statutory regulation what is already happening in practice.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the definitions in section 2 are a little loose. For example,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Electrician&rdquo; means any person or undertaking engaging in the installation, repair, maintenance or construction of electrical installations in domestic, commercial, industrial, or other premises or public place.</P>
    <P>This seems to suggest that anybody can be an electrician. I know nothing about electricity except how to change a bulb or to wire a plug but if I attempted electrical work I would be classed as an electrician, according to my reading of the Bill. We cannot allow that to happen. We have a good system in place through RECI but that does not appear to be recognised in this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>We should remember that RECI, which is a self-regulatory body for the electrical contracting industry, was formed in 1992, at the request of the then Department of Energy, in order to improve the standards of electrical installation work. There are other regulatory bodies but RECI is the best known. Its aim is to promote and protect the interests of the public as users of an electrical service so that they can obtain an acceptable standard of workmanship and techni<Col N="956" />cal competence within the electrical contracting industry.</P>
    <P>RECI also provides a high level of assistance to the industry to achieve this standard. Anybody with experience of dealing with it knows this is true. The contractors recognised by RECI must possess technical qualifications not less than those of an electrician, have had on-site responsibility for electrical installation work for not less than three years, be engaged in the business of electrical contracting, be in possession of public liability and employer's liability insurance, and be in possession of equipment, including test equipment and tools and a copy of the wiring rules.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that all its members are up to date with current practice, RECI monitors the standard of their work. It also carries out an inspection service for non-registered contractors and runs training courses on the various aspects of the wiring rules. It has published a guide and video on testing and it provides technical information and assistance to registered contractors. In addition RECI also produces a quarterly news update in order to ensure that all of its members are kept up to date with best practice and that standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>There was a detailed consultation process from which shortcomings in the present system were identified. These included different criteria for membership of existing self-regulatory bodies, incompatibility in the penalty provision for non-compliance, and problems accessing premises for the purpose of inspection.</P>
    <P>I understand the CER is currently finalising the general criteria based on internationally recognised product certification and quality assistance standards which will apply to all contracting regulatory bodies that wish to be licensed by it. In the interim, the proposed approach is enforceable through the introduction of particular conditions within the distribution system operator, DSO, licence issued under section 14 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.</P>
    <P>In the short-term approach by the DSO, the receipt of a completion certificate becomes mandatory prior to connection and only those contractors who are members of approved self-regulatory bodies can submit a completion certificate to the DSO. It is hoped that statutory backing for this approach will be provided in the new electricity Bill.</P>
    <P>At present, connection of installations only covers about 60% of the completion certificates issued. DSO involvement is perceived to be insufficiently wide at present because the remaining 40% of certificates cover maintenance work, additions or changes to the electrical installation which have no impact on the electricity supply.</P>
    <P>There are also gaps in the criteria drawn up arising from a High Court case to comply with competition law. These criteria are not prescriptive enough, particularly in regard to admittance <Col N="957" />to membership, standards of workmanship and disciplinary procedures. Self-regulatory bodies are, in essence, operating to different standards, which undermines the promotion and implementation of best practice in the electrical contracting industry.</P>
    <P>Standards must be harmonised to achieve best practice. Statutory backing is required to achieve this and unfortunately this is another area that is not tackled properly in the Bill. I commend Senator Higgins for presenting us with the Bill and affording us the opportunity to discuss this important area. However, I cannot support it and would prefer to wait until more comprehensive legislation is introduced later in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am an engineer of sorts. There are many engineers who do not accept that chemical engineers are real engineers at all, but we can always say we are regarded more highly as engineers than software engineers. We are somewhere on the spectrum at least.</P>
      <P>I try to inculcate a sense of basic safety into students when they begin the course I teach in the CIT. One of the most rudimentary things one has to teach young people is that electricity is dangerous. The statement that familiarity breeds contempt may be a cliché, but it would probably be more correct to describe it as a truism. Some people are blissfully unaware of the dangers associated with electricity.</P>
      <P>One has to see electricity in this context to deal with the legislation. A dangerous or unsatisfactory job done by an electrical contractor is very different to an unsatisfactory job done by a plumber. A plumber may cause a huge amount of damage, but a bad job done by an electrical contractor puts lives at risk. I do not have statistics in this regard but I know we do not have a great on safety and it is not taken as seriously as it should be. We have genuine reason to be concerned about accident rates in many areas of activity.</P>
      <P>In this era of the establishment of various regulators, be it ComReg or the Commission for Electricity Regulation, I have always noticed that although the rhetoric before their establishment is full of concerns about consumers, they rapidly get tied up with huge issues such as facilitating or organising the large-scale introduction of new players into the market. Every time one considers these bodies, one gets the impression that the ordinary consumer is seen only as the recipient of the values of competition. None of the regulators of which I am aware has shown any willingness to bat with the same enthusiasm for individual consumers and their right to the decent, safe, appropriately priced service that they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My involvement in this area is with ComReg and I was also involved with its predecessor. The quality of service to the consumer was always assumed to be something that would follow auto<Col N="958" />matically from the generation of competition. This is a classic example of where competition between inadequately regulated electrical contractors, for example, will not provide consumers with the reasonably priced and safe service of sufficient quality that they want.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Senator Higgins has introduced the Bill and I watched his contribution on the monitor in my office. I welcome the fact that RECI and other bodies are enthusiastic supporters of this approach. The best way to bring about high-quality regulation of the service provided to consumers is to give legal authority to bodies that are technically skilled but which are not involved in the marketplace. I am wary of many such bodies because, to a degree, they tend to look after the interests of their members in the marketplace. As the recent report by the Competition Authority suggested, they do more than ensure that high standards are met because they make sure that high prices are charged as well. I am glad, therefore, that Senator Higgins has made it clear that the bodies to which the legislation refers would be precluded from getting involved in the marketplace. Their job would be to ensure that high standards are met.</P>
    <P>The legislation, apparently supported by those in the best position to know what is safe, is recognised by everybody to fill a gap in terms of consumer protection. I accept that there are certain matters to be addressed in respect of connection, but an enormous amount of domestic electrical work does not involve new connections. What satisfactory guarantee can a consumer have that existing regulations are being adhered to when he has an electric shower installed? This is a classic, high-risk case because it involves levels of electrical current that could do enormous damage. If the consumer uses an electrical contractor who is a participant in RECI, he has some guarantee. Otherwise he has no guarantee that the electrician who comes to his home is a member of a body that insists on minimum standards, nor has he any method or receiving recompense for shoddy workmanship. This is not simply a question of whether a washing machine or lawnmower works or whether a garage does a proper maintenance job on one's car. Safety, the primary motivating factor behind the Bill, is something people take too much for granted.</P>
    <P>Previous Governments did not always refuse to accept Private Members' Bills. I can list a significant number of exceptions to that rule in both Houses of the Oireachtas. If ever there was a case for at least acceptance, in principle, as a statement of future intent by a Government, this is it. It is not about the finer points of consumer rights but the safety of those not in a position to make proper judgments about the work being done on their behalf. In many cases the job may work, which is probably worse because there is a greater hazard involved when something works and the <Col N="959" />danger is not apparent. I do not understand the reason the Government cannot make a statement of intent and accept the Bill on Second Stage. What need does it have to vote down an idea which everybody agrees is a good one?</P>

      <P>We all have an interest in developing and maintaining an efficient and cost-effective electricity industry which is one which touches every home and business in the State. Electricity bills are a major item in everyone's household budget. Energy bills account for an even greater proportion of industrial and business costs. Furthermore, electricity production and consumption are accepted yardsticks of the vitality of a country's economy and it is hardly surprising that in recent years the electricity sector has grown by 6% annually. I hope it will continue to grow at its current rate to reflect our continued economic buoyancy.</P>
      <P>As legislators, we have a duty to ensure energy is generated and distributed as efficiently and safely as possible and that the consumer, whether a business or private household, is able to avail of electricity safely and at competitive rates. We must also be in a position to provide for the continued increase in consumption, with an equivalent increase in electricity production.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have witnessed a major endeavour by the Government to increase and regulate activity in the energy area. Some of the key milestones include the deregulation of the market; the tripartite agreement in February 2000 which set out the framework for the future of the electricity sector; the Electricity Regulation Act 1999; the establishment of the independent Commission for Electricity Regulation; the setting up of the ESB's national grid part as a separate independent company known as EirGrid; the joint decision to upgrade the main North-South electricity interconnector, and the plan that the electricity market will open fully to competition in 2005. These developments represent the most sustained series of decisions and activity since the days of rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House seeks to introduce more legislation in this area and, specifically, provide for the regulation of the electrical contracting sector. While I can see certain benefits to the industry contained in the Bill such as the proposal to extend the functions of the Com<Col N="960" />mission for Electricity Regulation, I also foresee a number of problems and difficulties with it.</P>
    <P>I have serious difficulty with the specific form of regulation proposed to apply to the electrical contracting sector. The Bill seeks to impose an obligation on all electrical contractors, electricians and employers of electricians operating in factory environments to register with an electrical contracting supervisory body which would ensure adherence with a selected list of technical codes. While I agree with this idea in principle, there are a number of problems arising from the proposed system. The Bill appears to propose a rigid, inflexible and restrictive system of regulation. It would restrict all electrical work to registered contractors, require businesses and industries to register with the proposed supervisory body on an annual basis. It proposes to restrict contractors to registering with only one authority. Surely such a system would be uncompetitive and potentially increase costs to the consumer.</P>
    <P>It also strikes me as unusual that the Bill should propose extending the functions of the Commission for Electricity Regulation, while at the same time not reflecting the stated policy and advice of the authority. If we consider that the commission was founded to review and improve the regulatory system in this sector, and in the process has assumed the role of supervisory regulator for the electrical contracting industry, surely we should look to it for advice when seeking to introduce legislation in this area?</P>
    <P>The CER views this Bill as untimely and overly restrictive and has devised an alternative approach which combines both interim proposals and long-term goals to achieve appropriate regulation of the sector. The Minister will outline this two-pronged approach. I hope to see that he has taken on board the worthwhile advice of the CER. In the short term the commission has already assumed the role of supervisory regulator for the proposed scheme and taken major steps towards establishing a balanced regulatory system. It has consulted extensively with all interests in the industry and is currently finalising the general criteria, based on internationally recognised quality system standards, which will apply to all electrical contracting regulatory bodies.</P>
    <P>Legislation, which is expected to be published at the end of this year, will give statutory support to this development, as well as providing for authorised officers to inspect electrical installations and impose fines and penalties for any substandard and hazardous work. This will be a fully comprehensive Bill which requires a certain amount of time to draft. It will consolidate existing electricity legislation while eliminating any unnecessary statutes currently in force. I appeal to all Members of the House to recognise the value of both the Department's and the commission's extensive work in this area and welcome that Bill when it comes before the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" />I am confident that the Government, through the commission, has provided a sound and comprehensive framework for the development and regulation of the industry at a balanced pace. By combining the many steps already taken in this area with the forthcoming legislation we will ensure sufficient regulation of the industry is established, while at the same time adequately and securely providing for the demands of a growing economy.</P>
    <P>Surely we can all agree that for development in this sector to be successful, safe and dependable we must proceed in this planned and balanced fashion. The Government is conscious that its actions must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate industrial and commercial developments, while at the same time legislating for the regulation of the sector to ensure the health and safety of both consumers of electricity and electrical contractors alike.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I oppose the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) Bill brought forward by Senator Higgins and again commend him for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue. I look forward to debating the forthcoming Electricity Bill at the end of this year. Once again, I thank the Minister for coming to discuss the issue. I also thank all those at the Commission for Electricity Regulation for their outstanding work in this area to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister and the representatives of RECI to the Visitors Gallery. I commend Senator Higgins for bringing forward this important Bill, which is long overdue. It is the Government's duty to bring about greater safety in this area but it has not done so.</P>
      <P>The Bill is to be strongly welcomed in the interests of public safety. It should be given unequivocal support from both sides of the House in order to promote the common good. I am disappointed with the comments of Senators Kenneally and MacSharry that the Government is not in a position to support the Bill which has to do with safety in the home, workplace and industry. Safety should be paramount in everyone's minds. The primary aim of the Bill is to promote safety in the technical standards of the electrical contracting sector while imposing an obligation on electrical contractors, electricians and others working in the sector to register with an electrical contracting supervisory body. These proposals are to be welcomed. I hope, with tighter controls, we can cut out the cowboys. Workers in the sector must conform to the highest standards of public safety and comply with all the relevant codes, rules and requirements. Substandard electrical work has caused loss of life and will continue to do so unless all of the loopholes are closed.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of regulation is intended to be self-<Col N="962" />financing and enforce no additional drain on the Exchequer. Does this mean that the costs of the electrical contractor will, in turn, be passed on to the public? The public has been asked repeatedly in recent times to make up for the shortfalls of the Exchequer. Such assurances that the public purse will be spared leaves me feeling a certain unease.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of points in the Bill that need clarification and explanation. The Bill would extend the functions of the Commission for Electricity Regulation and confer powers on it to inspect work on electrical installations. Who appoints the commission? It is important that it is appointed by an independent body. Perhaps my good friend, Senator Higgins, will enlighten me on this.</P>
    <P>A fine of &euro;1,961 would be imposed on those found guilty of an offence. I am deeply puzzled as to how this figure was reached. Would it not have been simpler to round it up to &euro;2,000, or am I perhaps missing something of significance? </P>
    <P>The installation of electrical systems is a matter of the utmost trust. The average person is completely ignorant of such matters and totally in the hands of the contractor. Unless we put the most stringent measures in place, people will fall victim to unqualified cowboys and lives and property will be lost, lives being the main concern as a life cannot be replaced. Failure to support the Bill would represent a gross neglect of our duty to protect citizens and ensure everyone has the benefit of a safe environment in which to live and work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I do not support the Bill proposed by the Senators. Like everyone in this House, I am aware of the importance of the issue. I share Senators' concerns about the issue of safety in the electrical contracting industry. However, I do not accept that this regulation Bill represents the right approach, for reasons I will now outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I start by setting out the background to this matter. On 20 June 2001 my predecessor, the present Leader of Seanad Éireann, Senator Mary O'Rourke, at the time Minister for Public Enterprise, was asked by means of a Dáil question for her views on the establishment of a statutory authority for the regulation of the electrical contracting industry. She indicated that she had always placed the highest priority on matters of public safety, a priority which I share. It was for this reason that she had, through the Department of Public Enterprise, as it was at the time, formally request the Commission for Electricity Regulation to advise her on the potential of a role for the commission in the regulation of the electrical contracting industry. She also asked how it could best approach the performance and over<Col N="963" />sight of such an additional function in the most cost effective and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>In the reply to the Dáil question the then Minister clarified that the commission had confirmed to her Department that it was agreeable, in principle, to assuming this additional function. It had initiated work on devising an appropriate scheme for the regulation of the industry and identifying the financial and human resource requirements as a basis for its recommendation to the Minister. Additional staff had been allocated to facilitate the carrying out of this task and the commission had assured the Department that work on devising an appropriate scheme would be given priority.</P>
    <P>My predecessor pointed out in the Dáil that legislative provisions for the assignment of this additional function to the commission could be included in the forthcoming Electricity Bill. She further indicated that she had recently received representations on behalf of the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland and that her officials had met with RECI to discuss its proposals in relation to the regulation of the electrical contracting industry. The Department had suggested that it would be useful for RECI to contact the commission with any proposals it might wish to make, including proposals for any interim non-statutory arrangements, in order that these could be taken into account by the commission in formulating its recommendations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In March 2002 my predecessor received the report of the Commission for Energy Regulation. The commission undertook a detailed and comprehensive approach to this, including widespread consultation with the industry, as is its well established practice in regulatory matters. Specifically, in drawing up its report the commission undertook a review of the current system for regulating electrical contractors which examined the respective roles of all interested parties, including present self-regulatory bodies within the sector, the Register of Electrical Contractors in Ireland, the Electrical Contractors Safety and Standards Association, the ESB, the distribution system operator, the Electrical Technical Council of Ireland and others who represent electrical contractors.</P>
    <P>Shortcomings in the present system were identified, including different criteria for membership of existing self-regulatory bodies, incompatibility in the penalty provisions for non-compliance and problems accessing premises for the purposes of inspection. Options to address the deficiencies in the present system were considered, taking account of the cost effectiveness, efficiency and impact on the quality and safety of electrical installations of each option. The proposed approach advocated by the Commission for Energy Regulation in its report involved two <Col N="964" />phases of implementation &ndash; a short-term and long-term approach.</P>
    <P>It proposed that the long-term approach be given statutory backing within the proposed new Electricity Bill which should contain specific reference to the following: statutory backing for a new role for the commission which authorises it to licence self-regulatory bodies within the sector in line with criteria submitted by the DSO; provision for access by authorised officers to premises to inspect electrical installations in respect of public safety requirements; and provision for penalties for breaches or misuse of the completion certificate system. This approach builds on the strengths and well-established roles of the main players.</P>
    <P>It further provides for a regulatory approach which recognises the diversity of work and skills in the electrical contracting industry while providing the necessary reassurance for customers and the public in respect of the safety of electrical installations. The key elements of the interim proposal are that the commission will assume the role of supervisory regulator for the proposed scheme and the distribution system operator will be required to assume responsibility for the day-to-day operation and monitoring of the scheme.</P>
    <P>My predecessor accepted the commission's report on 28 March 2002. She subsequently responded in April 2002 to representations she had received from Deputies and Senators, with which they had enclosed a letter from the general manager of RECI seeking support for a similar Private Members' Bill to the present one, proposed on 8 January 2002 by the then Deputy Jim Higgins in relation to regulation of the electrical contracting industry. The then Minister replied to these representations by enclosing a copy of her letter dated 16 April 2002 in response to the letter to her from the general manager of RECI in which she stated that she fully recognised the importance of this issue, both for the industry concerned and, more importantly, public safety reasons. She indicated in her response that she was pleased to say she had recently received the report of the commission and that she had accepted its recommendations in full. The report, which she made available on the Department's website, followed a review by the commission of current arrangements relating to the electrical contracting industry and took account of the views of those involved in the sector, including RECI. She added that she was pleased to be able to report on the positive progress achieved in the light of the report of the commission. She expressed confidence that it would consult fully with the industry and the public as matters progressed in line with its customary practice.</P>
    <P>In response to the then Minister's letter of 16 April 2002 the general manager of RECI wrote on 20 May 2002 noting that the then Minister had accepted the recommendations of the Com<Col N="965" />mission for Energy Regulation in full. The general manager stated he understood that the role of the commission would be undertaken on an interim basis pending the adoption of new legislation. He also stated RECI looked forward to engaging with the commission to ensure the system envisaged by it and approved by the then Minister could work effectively for the trade and, most importantly, consumers. He finished by stating that, on a personal note, he wished to thank the then Minister for her commitment to resolving this difficult but important issue. He expressed the hope the interim solution involving the commission would pave the way for a positive and constructive permanent statutory solution.</P>
    <P>Since my predecessor approved the new mechanism for the future regulation of the electrical contracting industry, work has been ongoing to implement the agreed interim measures. The Commission for Energy Regulation agreed and published an implementation timetable for the new approach in August 2002. The distribution system operator was tasked with developing new and more detailed criteria which, when the legislation is in place, applicants to the commission for a licence to act as an electrical contracting regulatory body will be obliged to meet. In this regard, the DSO held discussions on the proposed new approach with all interested parties and, in particular, the following: the Association of Electrical Contractors of Ireland; the Electrical Contractors' Safety and Standards Association; the Electrical Contractors' Association; the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland; and the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the interim approach is on a voluntary basis and is dependent on the agreement of all existing regulatory bodies to the criteria for the regulation of the industry. The draft criteria for the recognition of self-regulating bodies was published for public consultation by the Commission for Energy Regulation last November. The Commission for Energy Regulation, in consultation with the electrical contracting regulatory bodies and the DSO, is currently finalising the general criteria, based on internationally recognised product certification and quality systems standards, which will apply to all electrical contracting licensed regulatory bodies that wish to be licensed by the Commission for Energy Regulation.</P>
    <P>The finalised criteria will address the specific electrical contracting industry requirements and will ensure that the industry is operated in a manner which meets the highest possible standards of public safety. The objectives of these criteria are to ensure that installations on the customer side of the meter are safe, installed, tested, certified and maintained to the correct standards. Such installations should only be completed by competent and qualified contractors. I understand the commission is expecting sign-off by the bodies <Col N="966" />concerned within the coming days. It is expected that the phased introduction of the new approach will commence next month.</P>
    <P>Given the substantial progress that has been made, with which Members will agree, it is difficult to understand why the Private Members' Bill proposed is being brought forward at this time. Commenting on a similar Private Members' Bill of January 2002, to which I referred earlier, the Commission for Energy Regulation said that it proposed a rigid and inflexible system which would restrict electrical contracting work to registered contractors and electricians of the self-regulatory bodies and would require businesses and industries to register on an annual basis. That Private Members' Bill was inappropriate &ndash; as is the legislation before the House &ndash; particularly in light of the advice my Department has received from the Commission for Energy Regulation. It is also untimely in view of the substantial progress made by the commission at the request of my predecessor, with my support, and that of the industry.</P>
    <P>I refer to the electricity Bill, which is the means by which the commission's role as regulator of the electrical contracting industry will be given specific statutory footing. This is major legislation which will deal with a number of other issues and which my Department is currently drafting in conjunction with the office of the parliamentary counsel. The Bill will consolidate existing electricity legislation while eliminating any unnecessary statutes currently in force, resulting in comprehensive legislation which will be more user-friendly and accessible. In addition, it will deal with any remaining regulatory and restructuring issues in respect of the electricity industry.</P>
    <P>In framing the future legislation, consideration is being given to the proposed requirements of the current draft electricity directive. Senators will appreciate, therefore, that this is considerable legislation which requires a certain amount of time to draft. As already indicated, the draft heads include a provision to provide for the regulation of the electrical contracting industry.</P>
    <P>In keeping with best practice, my Department placed the Bill on its website in November 2002 and received a wide range of comment in response to this consultation process. Included among these comments was a submission from RECI which responded in a constructive manner by outlining issues it considered needed to be addressed in the Bill in the interests of consumer protection and public safety. These views, along with all other submissions on the Bill, are being given active consideration in my Department. The detail of the provision to deal with the regulation of the electrical contracting industry is currently being considered by the Department in consultation with the Commission for Energy Regulation. Once finalised, the text will be forwarded to the parliamentary counsel's office for inclusion in the electricity Bill, which is expected to be introduced in the Oireachtas by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="967" />There is every reason to believe that with the goodwill of all in the industry, the interim measures being introduced by the Commission for Energy Regulation will provide a satisfactory solution until such time as the regulation of the industry is placed on a permanent statutory footing through the forthcoming legislation. For all those reasons, the Bill before the House is untimely and I am not in favour of accepting it. However, I thank the Members who brought it forward so that I could put on record my views and those of my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan" hpid="Mr. J. Phelan Mr. J. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill introduced by Senator Higgins and I commend him on the efforts he has made in drafting it. I am somewhat disappointed by the Government's failure to take on board the provisions of the Bill. As has been outlined by previous speakers, it is not overly technical legislation; it simply tries to place a legal framework on a system which has no legal standing. Electrical contractors are very much self-regulated and, therefore, it is an opportune time for Senator Higgins to introduce the Bill. I listened to many of the previous contributions and Senator Coghlan spoke in detail about fires caused by faulty electrical work. I have personal experience of this in that my family experienced a fire caused by faulty electrical work.</P>
      <P>The Bill seeks to deal with electricity, which is a dangerous but essential tool in modern society. The system whereby electrical contractors are self-regulated is outdated and needs to revised. I take on board what the Minister said. He referred to the Commission for Energy Regulation, which specifically said the framework in this Bill is too rigid. We are dealing with what is potentially a lethal product. Surely, it is essential that whatever legal framework is put in place is rigid. It is a ridiculous comment for the commission to make because rigidity is important in regard to electricity, which is fatal if not dealt with correctly.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a considerable increase in construction, whether in terms of housing or buildings for commercial use. We have also seen a large increase in the number of people &ndash; builders, carpenters, electricians, etc. &ndash; employed in the construction industry. It is timely and essential that we put in place a legislative framework to deal with an area which has expanded in recent years in terms of the number of practitioners involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government has not come up with a firm reason that it cannot accept the Bill. The various Government speakers expressed the wish that legislation be brought forward in this area. It would have been opportune for them to accept and amend the Bill if they felt amendments were necessary. Each day the House takes the Committee and Report Stages of Bills, many of which are amended in some way. I have not heard an argument from the Government that the Bill is fatally flawed. If the Government has difficulties with the Bill, Senator Higgins <Col N="968" />would be more than open to amendments to it. The manner in which the Government has dismissed the Bill out of hand is not good enough.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a legislative framework in this area. The Government has promised it will introduce a Bill before the end of the year, but we have heard promises about other legislation which has never materialised. This is a missed opportunity. The Government will not accept what is basically a good Bill and propose &ndash; if there is a need to do so &ndash; amendment that would make it better. It has trotted out the usual party political line of the Government not accepting an Opposition Private Members' Bill. I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate Senator Higgins on introducing it. I urge Government Members to think before dismissing the Bill.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzgerald: I commend Senator Higgins for bringing the Bill before the House. The issues addressed are current in the electricity industry. The proposals the Senator has put forward for a system of regulation, as the Minister pointed out in great detail, are being taken up in ongoing consultations and dealings with the Minister's Department, the commission and the players in the industry. The issue of safety is of paramount importance in any industry, particularly in this industry which differs substantially in the area of safety even from related industries.</P>
    <P>The issues under discussion and the proposals put forward in the Bill are relevant to the debate and reflect the need for the updating of legislation in this area. It has been acknowledged that Senator Higgins has invested much time and research in this. I note from the Minister's speech that this Bill surfaced at the beginning of last year in the Dáil, of which I was not aware. Nevertheless, it is clear from the Minister's speech that considerable progress has been made since then. The consultative process initiated at the direct request of the then Minister for Public Enterprise, Senator O'Rourke, to the Commission for Energy Regulation, and the recommendations which it brought forward after that widespread consultation, were fully taken on board by the then Minister. The acceptance of those recommendations is acknowledged clearly in the Minister's speech and I am glad to hear of that.</P>
    <P>I have considered the report in some depth and have noted its recommendations. It is not true that little or nothing has been done since this Bill was first published in January 2002. A considerable amount of consultation and development have taken place; that may be on a non-statutory basis but it is very much in evidence. The exchange of letters between the players in the industry and the Minister, as noted in the Minister's speech, clearly confirms that this is so.</P>
    <P>While I very much welcome the intent in the principles regarding safety contained in the Bill and the opportunity to discuss this matter, I can understand why the Minister, involved as his Department is in the ongoing development <Col N="969" />towards a new electricity Bill, should see fit not to accept the Bill and that he would rather, having noted what is commendable about it in terms of safety within the industry, wait for the final evolution of the new Bill in the autumn of this year. My party is happy to support that. We have no doubt, given the evolutionary process in the ongoing discussions and the developments that have taken place, that the new Bill will be far more comprehensive than the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Commission for Energy Regulation for its report. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House and extend that welcome also to the Minister who preceded him this evening, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern. I pay tribute also to the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke. It is appropriate when talking about electricity regulation that we should note that it was she who laid the foundation stone with regard to regulation. Her Electricity Regulation Bill 1998 was groundbreaking legislation. It made history in that it signalled the beginning of a new era for the electricity industry.</P>
    <P>Had the Bill been brought in five to ten years previously, the Minister would have been a prime candidate for the electric chair because the ideologues would have rained fire, fury and, perhaps, electricity on top of her head. She would never have got away with it. It is amazing how times change. The passing of the Bill in 1999 demonstrated a very significant change in attitudes and a facing up to the realties. Market forces had changed and conditions had brought about the globalisation of markets and the unstoppable move towards liberalisation, which applied equally in the public and private sectors. That historic Bill introduced competition to the industry for the first time and provided a regulatory framework to oversee and manage competition. It was the most important legislation in regard to the electricity industry since the establishment of the ESB under the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the ESB for the tremendous work it has carried out at management and employee level. Although it enjoyed a monopoly position prior to the introduction of the 1998 Bill and, at times, caused much grief to individual customers, communities and industry, it has served the country and industry well, with some acknowledged hiccups. It has a proud record. I also pay tribute to the commissioner for energy regulation. The commissioner is very much a part of this Bill, the ongoing consultations between the players in the industry and what the Minister sees as part of the way forward for the development of more effective regulatory practices and, where appropriate, the placement of safeguards on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Reeves was appointed &ndash; I believe he is still the commissioner &ndash; he was to face a daunting task which I will briefly refer to because <Col N="970" />it is something we tend to forget in the rush to focus on a particular issue. While the commission was funded by the industry itself, the commissioner had to focus primarily on the protection of the interests of the final customers; he had to ensure non-discrimination between electricity undertakings and promote competition, safety &ndash; which was at the heart of his brief &ndash; security of supply, efficiency and economy, and this still applies today. The commissioner also had to take into account concerns about the protection of the environment as well as the licensing, generation and supply of electricity and the authorising of the building of electricity generating stations.</P>
    <P>When the commission drew up its report for the Minister in March 2002, it pointed out that all the parties consulted agreed that there was a compelling need to address the shortcomings in the existing system. However, there were different views as to the roles to be assigned to the various players in the industry. This is an important point in the context of the position the Minister is now in and where he intends to go. There are very differing views within the industry. Some call for an expanded role for themselves while others look to the commission to embrace the new safety role.</P>
    <P>In view of the points made by my colleagues and the Minister, while I welcome this Private Members' Bill and acknowledge the work invested in it by Senator Higgins, I do not believe it appropriate that the House should support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment and thank all of the Members who have participated in this debate. This is the first Private Members' Bill introduced to this Seanad and I feel it is one that should have been adopted unanimously. It is a life and death issue and the Government has shilly-shallied on it for far too long.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the inter-departmental group set up under the chairmanship of the former president of Dublin City University, Professor Danny O'Hare. The review group identified one issue in relation to which more immediate action is required &ndash; the regulation of the electrical contracting industry. That was 20 months ago and there has been no tangible or visible action since then. The comments could not have been more graphic or more challenging. If the situation was bad in July 2000, it is just as bad now.</P>
      <P>As we all know, houses are being built at an enormous rate by people without any qualifications. Some could almost be described as cardboard houses. All Members are aware that people without an apprenticeship, with six or nine months' experience of working with a building contractor, suddenly appear in a 2003 van marked &ldquo;John Murphy &ndash; Electrical Contractor&rdquo; and give an 087 telephone number. Such people know as much about electrical contracting as a pig knows about a clean shirt, as a man used to say. The fact that electricity can be lethal has been mentioned in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" />The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2003 is not perfect, just as legislation introduced by the Government, with all its drafting experience and resources, is not perfect. I remember having to bring forward 193 amendments to the Stock Exchange Bill 1994 when I was Minister of State at the Department of Finance. Many Bills have come through the Oireachtas, but I have never seen a Bill that did not need to be changed by amendments introduced by the Government. The essence of this Bill is sound and I wager that the Government's electricity regulation legislation, when it is eventually brought forward, will be built on the kind of pyramid model that I have proposed. In other words, the recognised supervisory bodies will operate under the Commission for Electricity Regulation and set criteria and standards will have to be enforced on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Kenneally, who said that this Bill will provide another layer of bureaucracy, for his comments. This legislation places the existing system on a statutory basis and compels electricians to register with RECI. Surely nobody can call RECI bureaucratic, as it performs its work in an efficient and non-bureaucratic manner, without red tape. I thank Senator Ryan for his contribution and I stress that I feel he is right. He spoke at length of his considerable professional experience of the lethal nature of electricity. As he said, the figures in that regard speak for themselves. I thank Senator MacSharry for his constructive comments. All Members on the Government side of the House were extremely complimentary at first, but they then sounded the death knell in the form of the word &ldquo;but&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I compliment Senator Bannon, who sought clarification in relation to when the Commission for Electricity Regulation will be appointed. As I have said, the commission has been in existence <Col N="972" />for a considerable time and performs excellent work. Mr. Tom Reeves is the commissioner. The Minister said that when the commissioner was consulted about my Bill this time last year, he said that it was too rigid and inflexible. I make no apology for introducing a rigid and inflexible Bill dealing with the control of electricity and electricity standards, as we cannot afford flexibility and loose standards in relation to such a lethal substance. I compliment and thank Senator John Paul Phelan for his supportive comments. Senator Fitzgerald was also very supportive.</P>
    <P>This legislation provides a stimulus for action. If it had not been published, I do not think we would be at the juncture we have reached. My party looks forward to the publication before the end of the year of the Government's Bill. I give this House a commitment, a promise and a pledge to watch the timetable of the Government Bill with great vigilance. It has been promised by the end of the year and I will watch to see whether it is delivered. If not, people will die in the meantime. This issue, which goes to the heart of what we discuss, is important. My party will harry, harass and press the Government on a regular basis to determine where it is at.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what has been said about the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2003 and the manner in which it has been drafted and constructed, I wager that the Government Bill, when it is eventually published, will be fundamentally modelled on it. It will have a pyramid approach, with the CER at the top and the regulatory bodies, ECSSA and RECI, as the second tier, carrying out the work on the ground in a non-cost manner. It will not cost the Exchequer anything. The consumer will be well-served by this legislation, which is long overdue. I hope that this legislative initiative has provided the necessary urgency, impetus and stimulus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to this important matter, namely, the urgent need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to expedite clause K of the State mining lease which would require the lessee, Mogul Ireland, to remediate a number of mining related sites at Silvermines outside Nenagh in County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>There have been mining operations in the area in question since Famine times. The earliest mining took place in the pre-Christian era and the scars are a legacy in the area. Unfortunately, pollution is one of the main legacies of this activity and toxic pollution in particular. In 1982,  Mogul Ireland completed mining in the Silvermines area and, in so doing, walked away from an area consisting of 147 acres of tailings, the residue from the mining of ore.</P>
      <P>In less than two years, the 147 acres of tailings had completely dried out because it consisted of residues which had once been of a liquid form. This caused clouds of black dust to blow from the tailings on to the N7. They were quite visible in 1982 and 1983. It took the local community, who were so badly affected by the matter, almost two years to get Mogul Ireland to rehabilitate the site to the extent of covering it with soil and compost and then growing grass on it. Until recently, that has been a fairly successful enterprise in that it stopped the dust blow and the grass has regenerated itself on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>In recent years, a considerable amount of erosion has taken place around the tailings area and the site generally. In 1999, the EPA was alerted by members of the community and me when animals were seen straying around the surface of the tailings pond. The EPA became involved immediately and expedited a report in a short period. This referred to the tailings area as a perpetual risk to human health and the environment. In conjunction with North Tipperary County Council, it instituted a programme of action to ensure no animals would in future stray on to the tailings, that the site was secured and that the whole issue of the remediation of the tailings was again raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 2000, a number of animal deaths took place on land owned by farmers adjacent to and around the tailings pond. This activated an inter-agency group, including the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Marine and Natural Resources, Teagasc, North Tipperary County Council, the Environmental Protection Agency and the local community, which produced a very valuable <Col N="973" /><Col N="974" />report on the future of the tailings pond and identifying four other toxic sites in the area, some of which were quite old. One of the sites identified, which is important in terms of the precedent established, is across the road from the local primary school in Silvermines village. It was discovered that a field contained very high levels of toxic waste material, going back a considerable period. The Department of Education and Science moved immediately to cover over the field because it was being used as a play area by children from the primary school.</P>
    <P>The inter-agency group made 39 recommendations, the majority of which related to the management of water, dust, farming, drainage and other related issues in the area. The most significant recommendation made by the inter-agency group was that clause K of the State mining lease should be used to require Mogul Ireland to rehabilitate not just the tailings pond but other sites. As a result of clause K of the mining lease, considerable legal advice was taken by the inter-agency group to establish the fact that the State could require Mogul Ireland to live up to its responsibility and rehabilitate the tailings pond.</P>
    <P>The inter-agency group also identified the need for independent experts to draw up an expert plan for the remediation of the tailings pond and other areas, particularly in view of the fact that these sites contain toxic material, including lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury and other substances. One of the sites leaks leachate into local streams. Another site is highly toxic, containing residues from mining, with which no human or animals should be in contact. Clearly expert advice was required.</P>
    <P>SRK Consultants from Britain recommended a whole list of remediation works for Mogul Ireland to undertake. That report was published a year ago today. A commitment was given to the local community that there would be no delay in expediting clause K; that as soon as the necessary legal framework was drawn up, a legal order would be served on Mogul Ireland requiring it to carry out the work. A year later, it appears we are no closer to seeing clause K of the mining lease being expedited. In other words, we are no nearer to seeing the tailings pond rehabilitated or the other sites cleaned up.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the recent dry weather has created a situation whereby dust is blowing from the tailings and lead, cadmium and mercury contained in the dusk is landing on fields and getting into people's houses. People who live locally say they can smell the substance. I have experienced this myself. There are major concerns in regard to human health and animal health. I spoke to a local farmer today who told me that one of his animals became ill a few days ago. He had the animal tested, the results came back today and the animal is suffering from lead poisoning as a result of dust from the tailings pond. Amazingly, the animal is recovering.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is carrying out ongoing monitoring of the air and water. I have been looking at the results of this and the acceptable limit for lead and cadmium, in particu<Col N="975" />lar, are being exceeded on a regular basis. This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister that it is now necessary to expedite clause K. I want to know why there is a delay, when this will happen and what the Department is doing to ensure that the resources necessary to make this happen are being made available. This matter will not go away. I intend, on behalf of the community, to continue to pursue it and to ensure the State and Mogul Ireland's obligations and responsibilities to the Silvermines area are lived up to. These people have been living with this problem for more than 20 years. I hope I will get a positive response and that the Minister of State will be able to tell me that things are happening in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. J. Browne Mr. J. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Meara for raising this important issue. Her colleague, Deputy Hoctor, has consistently criticised the Department for its slowness in dealing with this issue.</P>
      <P>Silvermines has a long history of mining, spanning more than a 1,000 years. Most of this activity took place under private leases or was undertaken by the mineral owners themselves. Mogul Ireland mined zinc and lead at Silvermines. These minerals were both privately and State-owned. The State-owned minerals were worked under a State mining lease which was valid for 33 years from 1965 to December 1998. However, production at the mine ceased in 1982.</P>
      <P>Its history of mining has left the Silvermines area with the typical residue of such activity, including old spoil dumps, mineshafts and derelict buildings. The most significant of these is Mogul's tailings management facility, TMF, at Gortmore, west of Silvermines village. This facility is a purpose-built ring dam designed to be a disposal site for the company's mining waste. Minerals were extracted from the mined ore by grinding the rock into fine particles at a processing plant and using chemical agents to release the metals. Most of the resulting residue, called tailings, was disposed of as slurry in the Gortmore TMF.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s, local residents reported contaminated dust blows coming from the surface of the Gortmore TMF as the tailings dried out. Mogul Ireland, as owners of the TMF, implemented a plan to develop grass on the tailings to prevent future dust blows. Despite spending as much as &euro;630,000 on remedial works since 1982, the company was not able to create a permanent self-sustaining grass cover on the facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public concern about the health hazard posed by the TMF peaked again in 1998, leading to an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency into the level of danger posed by the facility. The report published in January 1999 stated that the TMF represents a perpetual risk to human health and the environment. Shortly after, <Col N="976" />three cattle died from lead poisoning on a farm adjacent to the TMF.</P>
    <P>These events led to the establishment in June 1999 of an inter-agency group chaired by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development under the Askeaton protocol. The group included representatives of the then Department of Marine and Natural Resources and was tasked with investigating the presence and influence of lead in the Silvermines area. The group's report in June 2000 made 39 recommendations for the remediation and long-term management of former mine sites in the area.</P>
    <P>An implementation group under the chairmanship of the EPA was established that year to monitor the implementation of the inter-agency group's recommendations. To date, 36 of the 39 recommendations have been fully implemented. The three remaining recommendations relate to the implementation and management of rehabilitation plans for the former mining sites in the Silvermines area. In compliance with one of the inter-agency group's recommendations, the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources commissioned an integrated study of the remediation and management needs of the entire area. In March 2001 the Department appointed SRK Consulting to undertake the &euro;420,000 study. SRK presented its final report in May 2002.</P>
    <P>Under clause K of Mogul Ireland's state mining lease, the company has a contractual liability to rectify the lands affected by its working of State minerals. The Department has to specify what remedial works it requires Mogul to undertake. As part of its study, SRK was asked to examine what works would fall under Mogul's clause K responsibilities and integrate these into the overall recommended remediation programme. The Department's legal advice states it can make only one demand on Mogul to carry out specified remediation works. Therefore, the list of works must be comprehensive. The Department has been consulting with the Chief State Solicitor's office and using the SRK report to draft a notice to Mogul of the remedial works the company is being required to carry out under the terms of clause K. I am pleased to inform the Senator that this document has now been finalised and will be served on Mogul and its directors this week by the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
