      <P>I have received notice from Senator Mansergh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport to carry out an urgent review and step up safety on the Limerick-Rosslare railway line and other similar lines in view of the serious incident at Cahir, County Tipperary, yesterday.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a referral motion whereby the subject matter of motion No. 13 is being referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, the need for the motion arising out of Ireland's ratification of the Amsterdam treaty, which came into operation on 1 May 1999, one effect of the treaty being to add a new title IV to the EC treaty, which deals with certain matters in the area of justice and home affairs, to be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2.15 p.m., with speakers having 20 minutes each; No. 3, Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill 2001 &ndash; Second Stage, to be taken at 3.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 6 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other speakers not to exceed ten minutes, Members may share time and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; and No. 14, motion No. 38, to be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. There will be a sos from 2.15 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I asked the Leader yesterday to invite the Minister for Transport to the House as <Col N="70" />soon as possible to take questions about a number of public transport fiascos. We witnessed yesterday the absolute contempt Iarnród Éireann has for the travelling public in Dublin following its decision to belatedly inform commuters that it is making significant changes to its timetable as a result of works that will be carried out on weekends. Four days notice was given to the travelling public in Dublin and that is unacceptable. The Minister threw his hands in the air and said he knew nothing about the decision. However, he knew about this for months in advance. This is another example of the fiasco that is public transport in Dublin and if ever there was an argument for greater competition and the break-up of CIE, it is strengthened by the contempt shown for Dublin commuters yesterday. Will the Leader make time available before we break up tomorrow to debate this and other issues with the Minister for Transport?</P>
      <P>Does the Leader plan to take statements on Northern Ireland involving the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs over the next few weeks? We are at a delicate stage in the peace process and we all wish the Government well in its endeavours. The Cory report was handed over to both the British and Irish Governments yesterday. While publication of the report will be sought in the future, that needs to be tempered with the current sensitivities in the process. A statement on all these matters from the Government over the next two weeks would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal for a debate on transport. I raised the matter yesterday and I would like to gently remind the Leader that she did not say whether she is happy to have such a debate with the Minister for Transport. Regardless of the points that were made, which were not tongue in cheek, it is a serious issue.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention the plight of the families in north Mayo that were affected by the landslide there some weeks ago. There seems to be a &ldquo;Dublin-centrification&rdquo; of issues on this island at present. The traffic in Dublin is as it may be. As long as half the media personnel in Ireland live beside the DART line, there will be public comment about the fact that the well-off people who live near it are facing a problematic year and a half. I would like to know what the State will do to look after the families in north Mayo. If a couple of houses in Donnybrook were flooded, all sorts of movements would be made to ensure they were sorted out. People like those in County Mayo need to be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to come to the House to explain what he will do for the families in north Mayo. I have raised issues pertaining to rural Ireland time and time again. Senator MacSharry raised the issue of An Taisce on the Order of Business yesterday and Senator McDowell responded by asking what An Taisce <Col N="71" />is about. We need to examine this issue. Nobody favours the sale of sites for large profits or the construction of houses on top of the Burren. A proper balance should be struck between providing for an injection of houses and people in rural Ireland and recognising that there are decent people in An Taisce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Some people in An Taisce are completely deluded and misinformed, however. This matter needs to be examined and dealt with in a balanced way. Similarly, I mentioned the rail line between Sligo and Rosslare yesterday. I did not know at the time of the accident near Cahir. Despite the half-assurances provided by the Minister in the other House yesterday evening, I am terrified that the accident will be used as an excuse to do what Iarnród Éireann has been planning to do all along &ndash; to close the rail line between Limerick and Waterford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like an absolute assurance that there is no danger of the closure of the line. I am sure that public representatives from the constituencies in question will ensure that the matter is examined.</P>
      <P>I would like a debate on the Government's policy in respect of the development of rural Ireland. The Minister's positive statement on decentralisation stated that towns that will benefit from the national spatial strategy should not expect also to benefit from decentralisation. I approve of this statement, but we need to know more about it. We should have a debate on this general area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I ask the Leader if we can have a debate on the apparent near-collapse of public use of the Freedom of Information Act 1997? There has been a reduction of 53% in the number of applications made under the Act since the Government emasculated it, in effect, in these Houses earlier this year. It would be very appropriate for this House to examine the Act and to invite the Government to explain how it can be said to be working well if the number of applications made under it has decreased by approximately half.</P>
      <P>Can I remind the Members opposite, who seem to be under some pressure, that organisations representing the best part of 400,000 people will outline the positive aspects of the proposed smoking ban in a hotel near Leinster House at lunchtime today?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ensure that Senators are aware of the meeting in question.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in this House about the non-cost elements of competitiveness. Too many people in this country, particularly economists, get away with examining the price of labour, goods or anything else and making judgments about competitiveness on that basis. A report published last year suggested that Dublin is the slowest city of the 12 cities assessed in which to make a business delivery. The proportion of freight carried by rail in Ireland is the lowest in any of ten countries. The report mentioned a succession of similar statistics, all of which are critical to competitiveness. There is a fixation with wage costs in this country, as if such costs are the cause of our competitiveness problems. Our competitiveness problems are far more wide-ranging than wage costs. I would like a debate in the House at some stage on all aspects of competitiveness other than wage costs. I ask the Leader to arrange for the appropriate Minister, if such a person exists, to come to the House when we have more time than usual. There may not be an appropriate Minister for such a debate, however, as we do not know who is responsible for anything anymore. Nobody is prepared to accept responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that many Senators watched the recent RTE television programme about the shortcomings in the fish farming industry, especially along the west coast. I want to say at the outset that I am very supportive of the fish farming industry, which has provided many employment opportunities and a great deal of economic prosperity along the western seaboard. The RTE presentation identified many instances of serious shortcomings and neglect in the industry, however. These problems will undermine the industry and cause immense damage to the prospects of future development in the aquaculture sector. Can the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources come to the House to provide information about the investigations that are being conducted at present? What action does he propose to take to stamp out the practices that are damaging the industry, putting at risk the livelihoods of hundreds of people and damaging the prospects of long-term economic prosperity and further employment in this very valuable and important industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Daly raised the issue I intended to discuss. When the matter was mentioned at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, an urgent discussion on it was requested. The recent revelations are a matter of great concern for those involved in aquaculture, which is a growth industry in this country. Some people were identified in the course of the RTÉ programme and some of the issues that were identified were highly irregular. I am aware that the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is conducting an investigation into the matter. The revelations will damage the aquaculture industry. We need to ask if a standard of ethics applies when directors are appointed to committees that deal with the marine industry. I would like this matter to be examined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I would also like to express my views about the national car test. I know there is an emphasis on safety matters, but everybody is aware of the concerns that have been expressed about the high NCT failure rate since the introduction of the test. I am sure all Senators are aware that people pay a great deal of money to maintain their cars in order to ensure that they conform with the guidelines and pass the test. Having spent a great deal of money to prepare for the test, many people are bitterly disappointed when their cars fail for what appear to be very minor reasons.</P>

      <P>This issue should be examined and a sense of tolerance should prevail. I ask the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, to examine this issue. I am sure many Senators have encountered people who have concerns about this matter.</P>

      <P>When the Clerk of the Seanad originally distributed the legislative programme for this session, the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill and the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill were listed as Nos. 1 and 2. The Bills in question have now descended to Nos. 4 and 5. Given that they were discussed on Second Stage at least six months ago, I would like the Leader to let us know when it is hoped to take Committee Stage of the Bills. Like other Senators, I have tabled amendments to these very important Bills, which I hope can be taken without much further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Leader is aware of the comments of Mr. Paul Appleby, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, in a recent edition of <i>Public Affairs Ireland</i>. In the course of his comments about public officials who act as directors of companies, he made the point that many of them are operating at a sub-optimal level in protecting the interests of taxpayers. If Mr. <Col N="74" />Appleby's claim is true, it is a rather serious matter. What steps, if any, are being taken by the Government in the light of the claim, in order to rectify the situation?</P>
      <P>I forgot to thank the Leader yesterday for her interest and concern in Dinis. She visited it with me, the superintendent of the national park and the mayor of Killarney during the summer. I appeal to the Leader to maintain her interest and use her good offices to ensure&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I asked the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children when the Hanly report would be published. It is extremely relevant to the health service generally but particularly to small hospitals. Meanwhile, it has been drawn to my attention that a consultant at Limerick Regional Hospital has said that the implementation of the working time directive for junior doctors would have a &ldquo;lethal effect&rdquo; on small hospitals. In that regard the issue is very urgent and I appeal to the Leader to have the Minister come here as soon as possible and account for decision making on the future of our health services. The public needs and is entitled to know of this and we would like to give the Minister our considered thoughts on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider a debate on the UN role in Iraq? This matter came up for urgent debate in the Council of Europe last week. The reason for the urgency was the change in the emphasis of American involvement in Iraq and its reconstruction. During the Taoiseach's excellent address to the General Assembly of the United Nations he indicated that if a request were forthcoming from the United Nations and the triple lock mechanism of the approval of the Security Council, the Government and the Dáil were to come into play Ireland could consider sending troops. This raises serious questions because of the ongoing terrorist attacks on troops in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not terrorist attacks. The attackers are wrong but they are not terrorists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish troops would be going into a different environment from those they are used to, as is happening in Liberia. In that light it might be useful for colleagues on all sides of the House to have an opportunity of expressing their opinions and a debate would give Senator Ryan an opportunity to discuss with me whether the attacks are terrorist or not. People are being <Col N="75" />killed in a post-peace situation and there is an obvious need to look at the situation in Iraq.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the call for a debate on a UN role in Iraq. It would be a timely opportunity for us to debate a UN role. It is, perhaps, timely that there would be a strong UN role in Iraq.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader pass on my wish and that of many Members that the elections in Northern Ireland proceed and that a date for them be set as a matter of urgency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. For more than two decades Irish people have travelled all over the world to work as guest workers. That situation has changed and now many foreign nationals are working in various industries, such as meat and food processing, in this country. Many Brazilians are working in Roscommon town, in my county. Much good and successful work has been done through the VEC and the local partnership but there are many problems among the success stories. I invite the relevant Minister to the House to outline the procedures undertaken to ensure we will have the best possible conditions for our foreign workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of transport and the arrangements for work on the DART tracks and asked that the Minister for Transport attend the House to answer questions. I will put through the request but I do not have special powers of recall, unlike the voters of California. I can only put in a request and hope that the Minister will attend. Many requests have been received, including one from Senator O'Toole, for the Minister for Transport to attend the House. I have submitted a request and I am sure either he or the Minister of State at his Department will come.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland talks are at a particularly sensitive point and will be for the next ten days. We all hope the date for the election will be settled soon. When that happens it would be correct to have a debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole also raised the question of the families in north County Mayo and asked that the relevant Minister would come to the House to debate the matter. I will endeavour to have that happen. Senator Mansergh has submitted the matter of the Sligo to Rosslare railway line for debate on the Adjournment and the Cathaoirleach has agreed that it will be taken this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Did Senator Ryan say there was a drop of 53% <Col N="76" />in freedom of information requests from the public?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all bidden to the Shelbourne Hotel today to talk about non-smoking and I think we should attend.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked if any Minister is in charge of competitiveness and he talked about the non-cost element of competitiveness. I understand the Tánaiste is responsible for this area and I will put in a request for her to attend the Seanad. She is in Canada at present seeking to bring new industries to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senators Daly and Finucane raised the question of fish farming. The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on this subject was frightening. I will ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to come and talk about the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane also referred to the national car test. When the national car test was introduced it was stated that the test would become stricter as time went on. That is what appears to be happening and 60% of cars now fail the test compared with 40% when it started. The purpose of the test is to ensure safety on the roads and having cars in good condition.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry spoke about the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill and the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill. I have asked about those Bills because both have passed Second Stage. There appears to be grave difficulty with proceeding with the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill. I know that Senator Henry and others have submitted several amendments to the Bills and I will endeavour to have an answer regarding both of them by tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I have not heard of Mr. John Appleby's observation that many public servants are also directors of companies. Could Senator Coghlan tell me where he read about this so I can investigate it?</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara asked about the status of the Hanly report. I asked about the matter yesterday and I understand the report is before Cabinet but has not yet been cleared by it. The quicker this happens the better. All will then be out in the open and we can discuss the many issues arising out of the report.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney requested a debate on a UN role in Iraq. He referred to the Taoiseach's speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations when he spoke about the triple lock mechanism and what it might mean for our troops if that ensued.</P>
      <P>We had a debate on Iraq and the UN at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, but a debate in the House would be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hanafin raised the same issue and <Col N="77" />asked that the date of the election in Northern Ireland be set urgently. The point of the intense discussions between all the parties concerned, including those discussions we do not hear about, is to set a date. We wish the parties well in that quest.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan expressed legitimate concerns about how foreign nationals are treated in Ireland and sought clarification on this matter with regard to educational and social rights. I will certainly endeavour to organise that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. When discussing this issue yesterday, I referred to the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy. I joined the Minister in paying tribute to her for her work and I wished her very well in the future. I welcomed Mr. Seán Ryan, SC, as chairperson designate of the commission. He has gained a wealth of experience from his law practice and also because he chaired the compensation advisory committee and acted as counsel to the Ferns inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the Joint Committee on Education and Science that sat during the term of the last Dáil. It invited different associations to outline their views on setting up redress committees and investigative committees. I was impressed by the <Col N="78" />number of associations that took up the invitation, particularly Right of Place and Survivors of Child Abuse. It was quite significant that we had applications from associations and organisations in Great Britain, particularly London, which addressed the committee on a number of occasions. It obviously put them at a considerable disadvantage to have to travel over and outline their views on how they felt a commission should operate. It was very interesting to note that those organisations were, by and large, very anxious to have the right to speak to a committee or commission about their experiences. Some of them were anxious that we would have a timeframe whereby decisions would be made as quickly as possible. They pointed out that many of their members were elderly and did not want a decision to be made which would be too late for their purposes. Furthermore, they did not want an adversarial process, which would involve their having to go to court. They were anxious to tell their story and have closure on this very sad chapter of Irish life.</P>
    <P>There has been a very welcome response by the Government regarding a review of the commission. The Minister has spoken about amending legislation and I hope he will be able to give us further information on this and introduce to the House as soon as possible the amendments he considers necessary to alter the way the different committees operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs stated yesterday that the expected compensation figure would be in the region of &euro;508 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General estimated it would be approximately &euro;1 billion. Only time will tell which is correct. The contribution by the religious organisations was completely voluntary and, as the figures indicate, it would represent about one quarter of the total sum the State envisages it will have to pay in compensation. I will return to this issue later.</P>
    <P>We should concentrate on the fact that the Government, through the Taoiseach, issued an apology on behalf of the State. The then Minister, Deputy Woods, said that the State had to take responsibility because it was responsible for the fact that very young children had to enter institutions.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in correspondence I, and no doubt many other Members, received this morning from Mannix Flynn or James X as he describes himself. He was just one of many children admitted to institutions and his story is very interesting. He talks about going to Goldenbridge at the age of six. He was then transferred to St. Joseph's industrial school in Galway and later to St. Conleth's reform school in Daingean. From 1965 to 1972, he spent time in Marlborough House in Dublin, a place of detention for boys under 16 run by the Department of Education. He was also in Mountjoy Prison, St. Patrick's Institution and Dundrum Central Mental Hospital. Mr. Flynn's statement outlines his history of physical and sexual abuse in all those <Col N="79" />centres. His story shows that religious orders and Departments were involved. His history is that of just one person but it shows very clearly that the Government was correct in stating that various Government agencies and Departments put young people into institutions run by religious orders or run directly by Department staff.</P>
    <P>Let us return to the question of the timeframe about which the Minister spoke. In November 2002, the commission spoke about a timeframe of eight to 11 years on the basis of the existing caseload at the time. The report showed that the timeframe would be too long for many of those for whom the commission was established. It is important that the Minister quickly explains the current position to the Oireachtas and his proposals for addressing this aspect.</P>
    <P>On &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night, Fr. Seán Healy of CORI suggested that there should be an audit of the property and assets of CORI. This will put into context the sum of &euro;128 million agreed between the Government and the religious congregations. People have said the congregations got off lightly. Fr. Healy made clear he was not involved in the negotiations, but he spoke for many when he suggested there should be an audit. The results of a full audit could mean that the proportionate financial burden to be borne by the religious congregations may rise from what I understand is approximately 25% at present to 40% or 50%. In view of this, I hope the Government will again consult them.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Government consults with the various organisations who have spoken to the relevant Oireachtas committee and the commission. While they may hold different views, we all want to ensure that the Government's commitment to bring healing and closure to those who suffered abuse is honoured and that it is true to its word.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator John Paul Phelan for allowing me to speak in his slot and I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am glad this debate has been so thoughtful. Having been involved with many of those, both here and in England, who were subjected to both sexual and physical abuse in the past, it is good that speakers in this House have expressed such concern and been so compassionate in their response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently wrote to the Minister for Education and Science expressing the view that the section of the commission dealing with the vaccination trials should have been removed from its remit and dealt with separately. It was unfortunate that the commission began to assume the role of a catch-all for any problem that appeared to have arisen with children in the past. I also raised this matter when the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, decided to add to the remit of the commission the vaccination trials which had taken place in mother and baby homes but from which, to my knowledge, no harm was ever shown and nor was any harm described in <Col N="80" />the report of the Chief Medical Officer. While I understand why some of those involved in the trials feel that perhaps proper consent was not given, the matter should be dealt with separately. This might help the work of the commission.</P>
    <P>I am not the only one to hold this view. When Professor Meehan brought his case to the High Court and then to Supreme Court that he should not have to appear in person before the commission because of his age and, I believe, infirmity, at least two of the Supreme Court judges said they could not understand why this element of the commission had been included in its remit because they could not see how it involved the sexual or physical abuse of children. I hope, therefore, this aspect is looked at again.</P>
    <P>During the workings of the commission it is important to consider the lessons we can learn from what happened in the past, but I am not sure this is happening. Some years ago I spoke in the House about the care of unaccompanied minors who come here from abroad. I praised those involved in dealing with these minors because I considered they were given great care and consideration. However, while there were very few of them at that time, there are now hundreds coming into the country every year. I am not sure if the resources are in place to deal with them. We saw in the past how the lack of involvement by the State in the institutions caring for children left them very vulnerable and we now have another group of children who are in a similar position.</P>
    <P>When the Child Care and Children Bills were debated in the House I was critical of the lack of concern about the inspection of institutions caring for children placed with them because of neglect or because they were orphans and so on. I said they were not being inspected often enough and that there was insufficient attention paid to the kind of people working in them. The Children Act requires that there be six monthly inspections of institutions caring for children in the custody of the State because they have committed a crime. Such children may well have regular visitors seeking their release, whereas, by contrast, children placed in institutions because of neglect may never receive visits. Yet, these institutions need only be inspected periodically. When I expressed the view that this was unfair, the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children, Deputy Mary Hanafin, said there was not enough inspectors.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that institutions are being established to care for unaccompanied minors from sub-Saharan Africa, eastern Europe and other parts of the world which are not being inspected as regularly as they could be because there is difficulty getting child care workers. It must also be acknowledged that those working in these institutions may not be properly vetted. While I do not underestimate the problems in this area, I am very concerned when I hear that some children are in institutions with adults where &ndash; I <Col N="81" />can only tell the Minister of State what I am told &ndash; on some occasions, there is no staff on the premises between 5 p.m. and the following morning. That is most undesirable. While the health boards face great difficulties, I hope the Minister of State will look into this. If I can provide him with more details, I will do so.</P>

      <P>I will furnish the Minister of State with particulars. Some children are sent to this country in the hope they will be with other family members. In other cultures it is not unusual to send children to families who are considered to be in a better position. However, in some cases it is hard to know if they end up with these families. Some have gone missing. For example, a girl who had been taken into the care of the State was placed in Crumlin Hospital but she went missing. I do not know if the State has managed to locate her, but these situations are worrying. I can vouch for that incident because I know of it from the papers.</P>
      <P>This is an area where we do not want to say in five or ten years how we wished we had tried to do more. I realise how difficult it is for the State and the health boards, but we have a duty to these children given that they come into our care under international obligations. The fact that there is a shortage of staff and that we have said we have done the best we can, may appear pretty shabby in the long run. I am aware that the health boards are trying to do their best to get care for these children by advertising, even abroad. However, I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the grave shortage of workers in this area. I hope when what happened 20 or 30 years ago is examined, we remind ourselves that we do not want such children to accuse us in future of not having taken adequate care of them in the situation in which they now find themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been so much debate and publicity on this sad period of history that one wonders how one can make any worthwhile or helpful contribution at this stage. On the other hand, I believe that everyone accepts that, <Col N="82" />until there is final closure on this issue for all concerned, it will continue to haunt us, especially the victims who are our primary concern.</P>
      <P>I am especially disappointed by the direction the public debate has tended to take recently. I get the feeling that we are losing focus on who should be the subject of consideration on a day to day basis and are seeking other targets. This is not helpful to the victims because many of them are not young. They are pushing on in years and many of them have made the point that compensation is not their real concern. Obviously it is part of it, but their real concern is justice. Given the confusion created by the type of debate we are having at present, it is not possible in an urgent sense to bring together all the elements of this issue to try to find an adequate and satisfactory solution.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the Committee on Education and Science when the proposals of the former Minister, Deputy Woods, were being debated. Many of the organisations acting for the victims came before the committee and discussed them openly and, in the main, generously with us. One man whom I know made a particular impression on me. Even though he put a harrowing tale before the committee, he finished up by saying that he would deem it wrong to tar everyone with the same brush and that to do so would visit a further injustice on innocent members of the religious orders. He did not want that to happen. It is especially important that we bear this in mind. While I accept that not all the groups are of the one voice and that there can be divergence on the way forward for some of them, I noticed in their contributions that, in the main, there was general acceptance of what the Government put forward at the time. They are the people to whom we must listen.</P>
      <P>I took time out to meet some of these groups individually after that committee meeting because I felt it was important that we should listen a little more and lecture a little less, although lecturing appears to have been central to the public debate recently. As I watch television programmes, listen to radio programmes and read the extensive coverage in the press, I am beginning to realise that the people central to this issue are being sidelined in the main. I refer not just to the leadership but also the general body of victims who feel hurt and isolated. It is important for us at this stage to redirect ourselves in this regard.</P>
      <P>I have not read or heard it but it was referred to on television and I was concerned to hear that a certain well known public person said that, if necessary, we should bankrupt the religious orders. That is of great concern. I see that as an incitement to hatred. For any person to make such a statement without clarifying it is for him or her to take a serious stand. It is an incitement to hatred and I hope it is clarified. It is not helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for us to remember that, if we are to make progress on this issue, it should be <Col N="83" />borne in mind that the Government provided leadership through the issuing of the apology, the establishment of the commission and the consultation that took place with the relevant groups. It is not correct for anyone at this stage to endeavour to make political capital out of this issue.</P>
    <P>I am open to correction on this but there are elements of anti-Catholicism in the media. This is prevalent not only in Ireland, but also in many other countries. This anti-Catholicism which is creeping into a great deal of media coverage is being used for the wrong reasons. The victims of abuse will suffer through the confusion created.</P>
    <P>Can anyone genuinely suggest that every one of the people who gave of their time and services to care for the most vulnerable people in society when the State was not capable of doing so is now to be held responsible in some way for the terrible deeds of a minority? If one accepts that logic and takes it one step further, does that mean that all connected with people who betray a position of trust are to be held responsible, ridiculed, sidelined and demonised? I say with much consideration that, if we go down that road, we will do immense harm to society.</P>
    <P>We have seen instances of sexual abuse against children in many different sporting organisations. As a result of what happened and even though a tiny minority was at fault, many people have withdrawn from giving community service for fear that they may also be tarred with the same brush. If Members think I exaggerate, we should keep our ears a little closer to the ground and understand the way voluntarism has suffered in such a basic way. This is the case in rural and urban areas and the issue will continue to be erosive in the future. I suggest, therefore, that we refocus our attention on the victims, who are paramount, and the rights of the individuals responsible, which are also important. The idea of focusing only on religious orders and the suggestion that only people in religious life should be held accountable are not right.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to John Waters for his appearance on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night following his article in <i>The Irish Times </i>of the same day. Despite their claims to independence and incisive reporting, few mainstream journalists have even considered doing what John Waters did the other night, namely, broadening the debate and trying to put it into context. Many of us have been thinking about his point that the current debate, which concerns events of 60 and 70 years ago, is taking place in the context of the times in which we live. This does not make sense. For example, on the issue of deprivation, given that most of us suffered an element of deprivation during the period in question, there is no point suggesting we had three meals a day, three pairs of shoes or that we were relatively well off 40 or 50 years ago. We must not allow that issue to be mixed up with the basic issue of sexual abuse. To do so and then to throw <Col N="84" />them both at the church, the religious orders or even the State creates confusion.</P>
    <P>As a layman who does not understand all the legal intricacies involved, I suggest we listen to the individuals concerned and make sure their leaders are telling us what it is they want. I had the opportunity to have discussions with several such individuals in the House and have corresponded with many others. While I am not suggesting their leaders are out of step, I am suggesting that the saturation of publicity and the bent now being given to the issue has left the victims with a less potent voice than they once had. That voice was characterised by a sense of injustice and a demand that justice be done and be seen to be done urgently. My fear is that we may be sliding into a position in which the urgency sought by the Government will not materialise.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to see the eminent legal person stepping down from the Laffoy commission. I can understand that the task the person in question took up on her first day was not an easy one. We should be fair and point out that the process is organic, that is, just when we think we know everything, something else comes on stream which must be dealt with also. I have no doubt the new appointee will deal with the position in the same manner as his predecessor.</P>
    <P>We must get rid of hidden agendas being pushed by people who have reasons for creating a smokescreen. I appeal to all the victims to come together in an orchestrated, co-ordinated and focused fashion, of which they are capable. Nobody can tell the story as well as the hurt persons and no other person knows their wishes as well as they do. We should get rid of the smokescreen and deal directly with the victims.</P>
    <P>A new group of victims is emerging. I have heard the Order of the Christian Brothers being targeted by name in the House. The manner in which assets were liquidated has also been raised and it was argued that morality, rather than legality, should be the main consideration. As a former pupil of the Christian Brothers, I recall an event held about 30 years ago to celebrate the arrival of the order in Cashel. About 1,000 past pupils from all over the world attended the reunion out of gratitude to the Christian Brothers for providing us with education when we could not pay fees. By providing education denied in the past, they enabled people to reach positions of power. This is also true of the nuns and the other religious orders.</P>
    <P>We seem to be anxious in this debate to demonise every Christian Brother, nun and teacher from a religious order, which is uncalled for in this day and age. Are we creating a new group of victims which we will revisit in 20, 30 or 40 years once we have left behind the current politically correct environment? Will we then try to do justice to their memory and undo the damage we did to their families? Let us imagine a mother, father or grandparent of a completely innocent member of a religious order walking out into the community today in the knowledge that <Col N="85" />fingers are being pointed at them for the good work their family member did and the service he or she gave. We are no longer prepared to speak up for members of the religious orders. We need a partnership of morality and human concern which embraces everyone, the victims and those now embroiled in this issue.</P>
    <P>I make no case for those who perpetrated terrible crimes against young people not only because they were in a position of trust, but above all because they were dealing with the most vulnerable members of society. On the other hand, if we are to do what is correct in this instance, we must act urgently, in a focused manner and without political expediency. This must be done because it is right, society demands it and, above all, because if we do not correct and somehow compensate for the injustices which have taken place, they will revisit and haunt us again and again in the long run.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government well in this matter. I have no doubt the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, acted primarily in the best interests of the victims and that all those who contributed to the process did likewise. Ultimately, no political kudos will be won on this issue by anybody. Of paramount and primary concern are the victims. Let us focus on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan" hpid="Mr. J. Phelan Mr. J. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I listened to most of the contributions, some of which, not least the previous one, were very good. Nevertheless, I take issue with several of the points made by Senator Ó Murchú and will address them later.</P>
      <P>I, too, pay tribute to Ms Justice Laffoy who resigned from her position on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. In her letter of resignation she expressed many legitimate concerns which should be raised in every political forum. I object to being accused of playing politics with an issue for raising relevant concerns expressed elsewhere. I and other Members of the Opposition have a role to play in bringing these issues to the attention of the House. We would be in dereliction of our duty if we failed to do so.</P>
      <P>I am not a church basher, but a practising member of the Catholic Church who was educated at second level by the Augustinians in New Ross. I pay tribute to them, to the people who played a significant role through the years looking after people for whom the State was not in a position to care and to those who are involved in education and do tremendous work in that sector. We would not have an education system without the contribution of the religious orders over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the primary object of our concern must be the people who were abused. There is a danger that, in the course of this debate, we will lose track of the horrendous abuse that was inflicted on them in institutions throughout the country. They must remain central to this debate at all times. I join my colleague, Senator Ulick Burke, in expressing concern that the responsi<Col N="86" />bility for this commission rests with the Department of Education and Science. It is, in effect, a case of the Department investigating itself. Following the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy, there is a case to be made for responsibility being taken from the Department of Education and Science and the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and given to some other Minister and Department. That should be considered.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my concern and disappointment at the position in which Ms Justice Laffoy found herself and her decision to resign. In her letter of resignation she said that the main reason for her departure was the non-co-operation of the Department of Education and Science with the commission. This is a serious condemnation of the Department which has not been given sufficient attention in this debate to date. She also said in her letter that she was worn out by the approach of the Department. That is a damning indictment of the Department's relationship with the commission. It seems to have obstructed the commission by not allocating resources. That point has not been dealt with adequately in this debate either.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, spoke about the therapeutic importance for the victims of abuse of being able to tell their story. This is vital. Each individual has the right to tell his or her story and to be heard. The original plan for the commission envisaged the possibility of four committees sitting simultaneously in order that all the victims could tell their stories within a relatively short period of time. Nobody wants a commission that will drag on indefinitely into the future. If the four committees were fully operational, it would reduce the time required significantly.</P>
    <P>Other speakers yesterday, particularly Progressive Democrats Members, spoke about the delays associated with the legal procedure. They conveniently forgot to mention the delays associated with the non-provision of resources by the Department. I was particularly struck by the contribution of Senator Maurice Hayes, which was the best contribution I have heard in this House on any issue. I urge Senators from the Government parties to consider what he said. He outlined the moral obligation on the religious orders in this matter. A sum of &euro;127 million is being contributed by the orders but, although the deal has been done, there is a moral obligation on them to look again at the contribution they are making. I do not believe that the religious orders should be bankrupted. That was an outrageous statement. However, they must make a more realistic contribution to the overall cost of the commission.</P>
    <P>The recent publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report reveals conclusively what most of us have suspected for some time, that the Government botched its much hyped deal with the religious organisations. It is beyond belief that the Government withheld support from the Laffoy commission and dictated that additional staff be recruited on short-term con<Col N="87" />tracts while, at the same time, it indemnified religious orders at a cost to the taxpayer that could yet reach &euro;1 billion. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stated that the objective of the review of the commission was to address the issue of costs, with no mention of the need for the commission to work on behalf of the victims of abuse. Contrast this with the Government deal with the religious organisations that exposed the State to potentially enormous liability.</P>
    <P>We know from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that in February 2001 the Department of Education and Science estimated the upper liability at &euro;254 million. By April this had increased to &euro;381 million and by June it had increased again to &euro;508 million. At present, the Department estimates the liability at approximately &euro;772 million, which is still almost &euro;250 million less than the figure estimated by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This clearly shows that the estimates for liability are increasing rapidly. However, it is clear from the report that the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance agreed in April 2001, when liability was estimated at &euro;381 million and rising, to accept a contribution of &euro;127 million from the religious congregations. They knew this figure bore no relation to the actual liability faced by the State but they agreed the figure regardless.</P>
    <P>While the estimated liability was increasing, the Department stuck with the figure of &euro;127 million. Even when its calculations were showing liability could exceed &euro;0.5 billion, it did not revise this figure. The Comptroller and Auditor General has stated that as additional information comes to hand it would be reasonable to expect that the full range of potential costs would be revised. This has not been done. In fact, no revision of the lower estimate of the potential cost was made despite evidence that the number of claimants was rising rapidly.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the correspondence between Ms Justice Laffoy and the Government that the potential cost of the commission was of concern to the Government. This is in spite of the fact that the commission was established to bring justice to a large number of people who were the victims of horrendous abuse in institutions throughout the country. However, the Government felt able, without any qualms, to enter into a deal with the religious congregations which may cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of euro.</P>
    <P>Then there is the matter of the legal advice obtained before the signing of the agreement. The Government entered into an agreement potentially worth &euro;1 billion and failed to get adequate legal assistance. When the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced in January 2002 that an agreement in principle had been made with the religious organisations, the Office of the Attorney General sought information on the detailed negotiations, including the extent of the indemnity offered. This information was sought on 31 January and 1 <Col N="88" />February 2002. A full six weeks later, the Attorney General wrote again and stated that unless he was supplied with the requested information he could not give legal advice on the deal. One month later, and ten weeks after the initial communication from the Attorney General, the Minister finally responded.</P>
    <P>According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the talks were held in virtual secrecy. They were attended by the Minister and one colleague. The Office of the Attorney General was not represented at meetings with the congregations and had no contact with those negotiating on behalf of the State from October 2001 to April 2002, a critical period for the discussions and deal making. The Office of the Attorney General was represented until October 2001 but when talks ran into difficulty, legal advice appears to have been suspended. Like so much else in the Laffoy debacle, the review of the commission and the deal with the religious congregations, it is beyond belief that this deal, worth so much money and indemnifying so many, could come to pass without full legal advice being sought at every step.</P>
    <P>When the information was finally sent to the Attorney General it was based on what the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to as a &ldquo;retrospective memorandum&rdquo; which was drawn up after the negotiations as they had not been documented. It is not standard Department of Education and Science procedure to fail to minute important discussions and meetings, especially if their outcome could be a matter for later Cabinet approval. Yet when the Comptroller and Auditor General sought papers on the negotiations that took place between the Department of Education and Science and the religious congregations, he discovered that no contemporaneous records of them were available. That surely cannot be acceptable or standard procedure at meetings of any Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity for Members of the Seanad to discuss this important issue. I restate that in no way, shape or form do I wish to jump on the bandwagon and bash the religious congregations. However, a moral obligation rests with them. As Senator Maurice Hayes said yesterday, perhaps they should let down their legal books, take up the New Testament and read from that in their discussions with the Department regarding the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Too much of a legalistic approach has been taken and there has not been enough of a moral stance on the issue. Much responsibility rests there and I hope that a satisfactory outcome can be reached as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I too am very pleased to contribute to this debate. I have listened to many of the speeches and I will echo many of the points raised by others. Ultimately, in the contributions that came from the other side, it seemed that we were &ldquo;damned if we do and damned if we do not&rdquo;. I have never experienced such negative criticism. <Col N="89" />This Government was the first to take on the problem of abuse, which has been in our midst for 40 or 50 years. In the past, successive Governments, including coalition Governments of Fine Gael and Labour as well as Fianna Fáil, failed to take it on. However, this Government has faced up to its responsibilities regarding redress for the survivors and victims of abuse. I congratulate the Taoiseach who apologised on behalf of the State for wrongs done. The commission was set up with that in mind.</P>
      <P>I have read the history and it seems to me that the commission has two parts to it. There is an investigating committee and a confidential one. The problem arose that so many applicants were coming on stream that members realised it would take the committee between eight and 11 years, or perhaps longer, to fulfil its role. The Minister had to take responsibility and go back to the Government and say that it had to be examined again. We are here to examine how we can review the investigation committee to speed up the process and bring justice to those who have been wronged over the years.</P>
      <P>Where do we go from here? We are here to discuss how the committee will be reviewed, how best we can give redress and what compensation can be taken on board. It is in that area that concern has been expressed. We must come forward with new thinking on how the religious orders can face up to their responsibilities. The State has huge responsibility. As we know, in the past the State was responsible for removing such children from their homes and putting them into religious institutions. This was accepted. The agents of the State must have known that they were being physically and sexually abused there, yet nothing was done about it. The State, therefore, bears great responsibility and it has owned up to it. Religious congregations have likewise accepted that there is a responsibility on their part to become aware of the problem.</P>
      <P>I will not speak at length on the issue which has been thrashed out. I was at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science last session, where I listened to many of the victims. I came away feeling that it was the first time the Government had listened to the problem and tried to face up to it. It is the first time the Minister entered into a discussion. I compliment the former Minister, Deputy Woods, who dealt with it at the time and I compliment the current Minister for facing up to it. There are no fixed answers on how we can best go forward, so why are we criticising it? We are trying to find the best solution to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; the other night, I also felt that perhaps the religious institutions should look again at the question morally and consider coming forward again. I am not saying that they should &ndash; there were very fine people looking after many of the young people who had been deprived of their own families. Those few institutions caught up in scandal are the people to whom we must face up. <Col N="90" />They should come forward and make alternative suggestions to increase their contributions. Perhaps that is not possible and perhaps, as was said the other night, an audit of their assets might be analysed.</P>
    <P>However, ultimately we are here to discuss how we can best relieve the trauma endured by those children. There is no alternative to sitting down and trying to give them some recompense for their suffering over the years. Many will never get it. They have put their views forward time and time again. It is out of concern for them that we who are able should listen and produce a solution as quickly as possible &ndash; not 20 years down the road or through the courts. Let us find a way to make their situation easier rather than subjecting them to court cases, which would only traumatise people who have already suffered so much. I am here to put a few points across and speak on behalf of the victims. I ask the State to accept its responsibility, which it has done. I also ask the religious orders to sit down once again at talks to see how we can produce a solution to solve the problem once and for all, setting in motion new institutions that will ensure that such events never happen again in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for my late arrival. I had assumed that the Independent benches would be awash with people wishing to speak. I am reluctant, although I probably will be tempted, to accord political blame on this question. I remember when the issue of redress was being debated and the then Minister for Education and Science came into the House. In response to every question I asked him about things that were not as I might have wished in his proposals, I was told that it was what Ms Justice Laffoy wanted. I remember that being said on between three and five occasions in this House. I do not wish to appear to be suggesting that it was otherwise, but one has no alternative to accepting the Minister's word. I fully accept that he believed matters to be so. However, I now realise that there is every possibility that what the Minister, Deputy Woods, thought and, I feel, sincerely believed, Ms Justice Laffoy wanted was entirely different from what she said to him. Government Ministers have a capacity to filter opinions expressed to them to convince themselves that what people are saying to them is what they want to hear. I do not believe that Ms Justice Laffoy was one of those people who would have tempered her opinion. Her subsequent interim reports seem to give lie to any suggestion that the Department of Education and Science and the Minister were co-operating enthusiastically and efficiently with her investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the experience of my colleague, former Senator Pat Gallagher, in his endeavours to find out the history of a case of abuse by a teacher in his constituency. He could wax eloquent for an hour about the obstacles that were put in his way in the Department of Education and Science to <Col N="91" />stop him finding out what had happened, what complaints had been made and what had been done about the case. This struggle went on for quite a long time until eventually the then Minister, Deputy Martin, to his credit, agreed that progress would have to be made. It was agreed that the then Senator would be allowed access to the Department's records of this case on condition that he did not make copies. He could read the records but could not copy them. This was meant to be the atmosphere of open, honest dealing with parts of our history for which nobody in the existing Department had any reason to feel culpable; the events had happened a long time previously and there was probably nobody from that time left.</P>
    <P>The then Senator kept his word. He went in and did not photocopy anything but he wrote down in longhand large chunks of what he read and published those. The Department was not amused, saying it did not agree to him copying material. He said he did not copy in any technical sense but wrote down the relevant parts.</P>
    <P>What does that say about attitudes, values and sympathy when, on a specific case, a public representative &ndash; most people who knew him in the Seanad and the Dáil knew him to be a man of considerable passion and conviction &ndash; had to go through a series of hoops to deal with an incident from 30 or 40 years ago? The problem seems to be that every institution in the State, in confronting this horrible part of our history, has tried to delay, obfuscate and confuse people. We finally took our courage in our hands and I commend the Taoiseach on his eloquent, unequivocal apology on behalf of all of us. He was not just speaking for the Government but for the people of the country in general. Once that happened, as we all know with any sincere apology, the immediate follow-up had to be generous, efficient and consistent with the spirit of the apology. Without rehearsing all of the details, Ms Justice Laffoy had to reprimand the Department on numerous occasions for its slowness and her request for additional resources was dealt with equivocally, at the least, and was delayed. That request was subjected to reviews and reports with which she felt she was not properly involved. The immediate and unequivocal conclusion one comes to is that somewhere in the system there is a lack of the precise qualities needed to deal with an issue like this &ndash; qualities of generosity, understanding and a belief that the issue is important.</P>
    <P>It does not matter if the Department had 1 million or 500,000 documents. The Department decided that it did not believe that it should sufficiently prioritise these issues and provide sufficient staffing and other resources to meet the Laffoy commission's deadlines on these matters. I am reluctant to believe that people in the Department of Education and Science decided deliberately not to make this information available; I do not believe that. However, I believe they decided deliberately on the priorities in the <Col N="92" />organisation and the Minister of the time has a culpability here. This matter had to fit into the priorities and budgets of the Department along with other competing demands. The sort of issue we are dealing with here is so unspeakably cruel and reflects so negatively on our society that the Minister of a properly run Department should not have come to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another matter, namely that the Department of Education and Science should not have been expected to deal with this out of its existing allocation. That is either a cop-out from the Minister for Finance, and the Taoiseach by implication, by saying: &ldquo;We have to be generous but you have to be generous within your already constrained budget,&rdquo; or it means saying: &ldquo;We do not really want to be generous, we want to talk about being generous.&rdquo;  Whichever way it happened, it means handing over all this responsibility with the obvious scale of costs involved and then telling the Department of Education and Science: &ldquo;Tough. It is important but it is not that important. Other things are more important.&rdquo;  I could go into a silly populist comparison between issues on which money was spent and issues on which money was not spent or the matters for which extra allocations were made and for which they were not made.</P>
    <P>Judged in the context of a generous and what appeared to be a wholehearted apology, what happened was disgraceful because there was no serious follow-through. Everyone knows that a heartfelt apology, which is not followed by serious action is more hurtful than the absence of an apology because there is an implication of insincerity which runs with the lack of generosity afterwards.</P>
    <P>It was not just the Government that was less than generous. I have many good friends who are members of religious orders. I am still a quasi-Catholic and still put my foot inside the church, although one gets to a stage where the continual affronts to one's reason and generosity could push one in a different direction. Nevertheless, many of my good friends who are members of religious orders are among the most radical, genuine and committed people struggling for change in our society. Within all organisations, however, there seems to be an extraordinary capacity to separate what is done on the ground on a daily basis from the way they defend their own property and financial interests. It is worth repeating something my party leader has already said and which is a long-standing view of mine. The portrayal of Ireland in the 1950s which is behind many of the rationalisations for the low level of financial support from the religious orders is that the orders were doing the State's job and that the job would not have been done but for them. That is a true picture of the 19th century, when many of the Irish religious orders were set up, providing educational and other services for children who would otherwise have received no education. However, by the 1950s the dominant power institution in the State was not <Col N="93" />Oireachtas Éireann but the Roman Catholic Church. People know I am an admirer of both the 1937 Constitution and of Éamon de Valera and I have often said that the pressures de Valera resisted in the way he wrote that Constitution, given the demands of the Roman Catholic Church, were quite extraordinary. What he conceded to the church, he conceded knowingly and what he withheld, in terms of what the church wanted, was quite extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church was not a fan of freedom of expression or democracy in the 1930s and nor was it a fan of religious tolerance, as we now understand it. It was a fan of states that were identifiably denominational. It was extremely taken with Franco's Spain and it constructed a concordat with Mussolini in Italy which involved the dissolution, by the Vatican, of the most active Catholic political party. They dissolved a major political party to pacify Mussolini. That was the context in which there was a dominant and triumphant church which, in this country, did not want the State involved in anything to do with the education, welfare or protection of children. It wanted a quiet romantic view of the family in which the father's primary duty was to provide for his children, while the mother had to stay at home and look after them. It was a romantic, very authoritarian and extremely male view of society.</P>
    <P>It was in that context that provision for children who could not be brought up within a normal family was made. The Catholic Church was determined that no secular organisation would have the dominant position in that area. It was the religious orders who rallied to the cry to provide residential institutional care to prevent any possibility of State involvement. One should read the rhetoric of the Roman Catholic Church during the mother and child scheme which happened in the same era. The determination to prevent poor, vulnerable Irish women from getting advice about childbirth and related matters from doctors who would not be under its thumb was a singular and central concern of the Roman Catholic Church. To pretend that these were good generous religious reaching out to help a State that could not fulfil this need itself is a complete travesty of history. In terms of the argument now that the culpability is equally shared, as far as I am concerned, the institution which demanded the right to run and monopolise these institutions was the institution which was most culpable.</P>

      <P>My view of the role of religion in society is of service to society, not control, regulation or dominance. It corrupted both church and State. We are dealing today in these issues with the evidence of that corruption and its capacity to allow evil people access to the most vulnerable of our children to abuse them in an institutionalised fashion. I do not believe that all the institutions did it, but it was essentially institutionalised.</P>
      <P>Let us remember, in addition to what is under discussion, sexual abuse, there was a tolerance of physical violence in our education system. I do not mean total prohibitions on corporal punishment, but there was a tolerance of a level of physical violence in religious controlled schools which should have been a reproach to any Christian. The point I wish to stress is that in terms of redress and compensation&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Acting Chairman's considerable defensive skill assisting me, the point I wish to make is that the argument that somehow society in the 1950s was at best equally and perhaps slightly more culpable because these poor institutions or religious orders were invited in to do the job the State would not do is a complete travesty of the situation at the time. They insisted on total control and they got it. We did not have boards of management of primary schools because the parish priests wanted a total monopoly until less than 20 years ago. That is the situation. That is why I have no patience with the argument that the State's share of this burden reflects the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, because I believe many of the religious do an enormous amount of good, I accept that a level of settlement which would have bankrupted and closed down those religious <Col N="95" />orders, while perhaps ethically and morally justifiable, would have been wrong because of the harm it would do to society today and to many good people working in religious communities. However, I will not allow a suggestion to be made that somehow society handed over its responsibilities. They were taken from us.</P>
    <P>In terms of society's capacity for denial, about 15 years ago I attended a meeting in my home city of Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>About ten or 15 years ago, I attended a meeting and a question arose at the end about young people and their safety. A Garda chief superintendent was in attendance and he said that, in his view, most of the talk about child sex abuse that was heard in Ireland around 15 years ago was put about by people who wanted to undermine the family. That was the view of a huge section of society until brave people forced us to confront what had really happened. This was done by the victims without much assistance from the rest of society. As this was done by the victims and because of the lives that were ruined by all of this and the harm that was done to people, once we finally acknowledged there was a scandal that had been buried for 30 to 40 years, the response, to which they were entitled, was a speedy, generous one, based on protecting the victims from further suffering.</P>
      <P>The Government has made an extraordinary mess of Ms Justice Laffoy's investigation and the equivocation, delays and ambiguity have done the opposite. They have made the lives of victims more painful and the view of society and how we deal with our victims even more tainted. I hope that, from now on, the qualities of speed, generosity and justice will determine Government attitudes to this whole shameful event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing a difficult and painful issue, but we should at least give ourselves credit that we have the courage to address such an issue openly without fear or favour. In Northern Ireland, the Kincora scandal was a sort of hugger-mugger security investigation that was never properly aired. Admittedly, that was 20 years ago. Other types of residential institutions, catering more perhaps for the privileged than the underprivileged, boarding schools, public schools etc., have not perhaps even begun to confront the fairly endemic physical, not to mention, sexual abuse that took place in some of them. I am not only referring to institutions in this country but to those across the water. In the midst of all the pain this is causing, we should at least give ourselves some credit for the fact that we are trying, perhaps imperfectly and stumbling along the way, to address this issue, in as honest and as principled a way as we can, to try to make up to the <Col N="96" />victims for some of what happened in the best way possible.</P>
      <P>In the contribution of Senator Ó Murchú there has been some debate about the nature of society a generation or more ago. On the whole I would be more an admirer than a critic of what the Roman Catholic Church and various congregations did in terms of providing a range of social services. The key to such provision was that they provided the services at very much less than full cost in the sense that the people providing them were not paid in the way a secular person might have had to be. There was an ideal &ndash; it seems far removed now but there was some nobility about it &ndash; of establishing a model Catholic democracy here in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. As always, power considerations were intermingled with idealism, and it is very difficult sometimes to unpick the different factors. In regard to the type of society we are talking about, which was very different from society today and had very different norms, we need to separate the habit of corporal punishment from severe physical and sexual abuse, which left more lasting marks. That society, culture and administration were more authoritarian in character, much more so than today, and more secretive. It was not the case that problems were never dealt with when they arose; in many cases they were dealt with effectively, but that would have been done mostly without publicity. I am sure we are talking about a minority of abusers and abuse.</P>
      <P>This problem has been with us a long time. One need only refer to characters in literature such as Tom Jones, the novels of Dickens and Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>. It is only in this generation that we have begun to tackle the issue in a way that hopefully will prevent more such abuse occurring, but there are other influences, to which Senator Ó Murchú referred, of a much more secular kind. Abuse of children that is secular in nature is a problem, for example, in a certain sporting context, to which reference was made.</P>
      <P>The issues relating to the Laffoy commission &ndash; I regret Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation &ndash; raise wider matters relating to the tribunal method of dealing with and investigating problems, particularly when there is a large number of cases involved. We must reflect on this. Tribunals will be necessary in certain instances in the future as they have been in the past, but there is a need to think ahead and to draw their method of operation and terms of reference reasonably tightly in order that their work can be completed within a reasonable time. I accept that the work of some tribunals may take two or three years, but it is not acceptable, as seems to be the case with a number of the current tribunals, that they continue indefinitely with no end in sight. That does not create justice or closure for anybody. I hope that under the review that is currently taking place and having regard to the new chairman, ways will be sought to try to do this work within a reasonable and finite period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" />Having been a civil servant, I wish to point out that regarding the Department of Education and Science, people may have no concept of the vast quantities of papers and files that exist in Departments. It can be quite difficult to find papers from as recent a period as two or three years ago, let alone several decades ago. In theory, there are supposed to be good filing systems, but files were stored hugger-mugger in cellars and other places in the past. One could underestimate the amount of resources and personnel required to find particular pieces of paper from long ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of the contribution of the religious orders, basically two approaches could be adopted by society and the State. One could adopt the confrontational approach that the religious orders are guilty and should hand over the money. Such an approach would have led to endless legal processes. Some commentators and others are acting not only out of concern for victims but because they enjoy attacking the Roman Catholic Church and its institutions and are not prepared to give them credit for anything and would be quite happy to see the church bankrupted. They see this as a way of trying to sideline the church out of Irish life in ways with which I have little sympathy and could not agree.</P>
    <P>The alternative approach would be to recognise that the contribution had to be voluntary and negotiations took place. I regard a contribution of &euro;128 million as reasonably substantial. After all the controversies concerning haemophiliacs and hepatitis C sufferers where the State was accused of being excessively legalistic and excessively concerned with finance, this is perhaps one of the first times the State has taken the opposite approach, which is basically a humanitarian approach towards the victims, and it is being criticised of wasting taxpayers' money. I do not believe the worst case scenarios. Much of the media coverage of any subject is based on the worst case scenario. One needs to take that argument with a pinch of salt. The Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science was very adamant at the committee meeting last week that the figure was &euro;500 million or thereabouts and I accept that. The figure of &euro;128 million is not so disproportionate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea that the religious orders might again be examining their assets to see if there is anything more they can do. With the way property values have gone, particularly in the Dublin area, there is no doubt that in some instances the religious orders may be sitting on much more valuable assets than would have been the case even a few years ago. If we try to adopt a coercive approach, it will fail and we will be further back. I understand that to a degree this has happened in Canada, where religious orders were bankrupted and the State had to acquire, at vast cost, institutions that had been run by the Catholic Church. The taxpayer would be no better off in such an event.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the indemnity agreement as concluded by the Government the day before <Col N="98" />the new Government was formed was defective or that there was an absence of adequate legal advice. The Attorney General is in many ways one of the most powerful people sitting at the Cabinet table even though he is not formally a member of the Cabinet. He would have the right and the opportunity to intervene in practically anything. The agreement could not have been finalised without his participation. I reject the implication that a better deal would have been concluded if in some way or another the Attorney General had not been sidelined. We all know the personality involved and there is probably no one in public life today who would be more difficult to exclude or sideline than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and former Attorney General. That argument is something of a red herring.</P>
    <P>I hope we will manage to bring this whole matter forward and conclude it within a reasonable period with, rather than without, the co-operation of the religious orders. I hope they will do the best that, in conscience, they feel they ought to, bearing in mind the many responsibilities they exercise both for their members and the public at large. I would like to think that we would keep a very clear distinction in our minds between a small minority who took advantage of the ethos and structures of the time to abuse young people and children and the vast majority who acted conscientiously by the best lights of the day, which might not always have been the lights we would follow today. One has to make some allowance for the way in which Christian and public values develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I have been listening on the monitor yesterday and today to the debate. It has been a good debate and I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution.</P>
      <P>As a Christian Democrat, which I am first and foremost, I believe that the primary responsibility of the State is to protect children. Whether in the 1950s or today it is a responsibility we all must share and work towards. There is a great problem in this area when we look back and point the finger at the physical and sexual abuse that took place in the past in our institutions and elsewhere. There could be a smugness in thinking that since the protection of children today has advanced, there is currently no form of child abuse, which is not the case. I reiterate the point that we must always be vigilant in all sectors of society in terms of rooting out abuse and ensuring best practice in the protection of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I read in a Dublin newspaper an appeal by the Eastern Regional Health Authority for more foster care parents. It is a disgrace and a scandal in 2003 that, in the most built-up and populated part of this country, we do not have sufficient people to look after vulnerable children who need to be looked after and that would-be parents looking to adopt must go to eastern Europe to do so. In our community we have thou<Col N="99" />sands of children who need to be fostered. No one will foster them, yet when it comes to adoption it is virtually impossible to adopt a child in this country because of the demand. We have young Traveller children on the streets. It is another form of abuse, which is accepted today in our society, that people under the age of 18 live in appalling conditions on roads throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have cases of child labour. Children of 16 and 17 years of age are working all God's hours to make a few euro to get them through the week and no one bats an eyelid. They are not in school on Fridays or Mondays and no one seems to be concerned. If we are talking about child abuse and looking back at the 1940s and 1950s, we must also provoke ourselves into talking about child abuse today and the threats posed to children. We must be aware of these threats and do something about them, rather than simply looking back at times gone by and saying we now have all the wisdom of Solomon and consequently our hands are clean of this matter. We must force ourselves to deal with this difficult issue, to remember the children of today and to do everything in our power to ensure that no such abuse happens in any area of society.</P>
    <P>In this saga there has been much discussion about the victims. My great dilemma now in trying to work out where we can go forward is that many of the people involved will be dead in the near future. They have not received compensation and have not been able to tell their stories. It is incumbent on the Houses of the Oireachtas to work with the Government in trying to expedite a new framework which will allow these people to get some closure to the appalling abuse they suffered some years ago. I make that appeal today. This should not be a party political football. We all have a responsibility to move the debate forward and to work with the Government in trying to sort out this problem and get a framework that will work for the victims. That is the best possible solution.</P>
    <P>As a parliamentarian, I felt slighted over the summer when the letter from Ms Justice Laffoy to the Government was published in a Sunday newspaper. We are Members of the Oireachtas. It was the responsibility of both the Dáil and the Seanad to establish the commission chaired by Ms Justice Laffoy. We discovered the reasons for her resignation in a Sunday newspaper. Ms Justice Laffoy is not entirely blameless for that. When she decided to resign, as was her right, she had a responsibility to send her letter to every Member of the Oireachtas and not only to the Government. She was given substantial powers by this and the other House and she had a responsibility to tell us the reason she was resigning. I regret I learned of her resignation from a Sunday newspaper.</P>
    <P>The Government was wrong not to immediately circulate the letter. I would have had no difficulty with the Government receiving the letter, <Col N="100" />circulating it to all Members and stating it would reply in two, three or four months. That we learned about this from the Sunday newspapers shows a lack of respect for Parliament which established the commission. Ownership of the issue should rest with the Houses of the Oireachtas. The problem arises from the fact that tribunals and internal inquiries are seen ultimately as being in the ownership of the Government. We have to take control in that regard as we go forward and try to develop a better structure. Ms Justice Laffoy and the Government handled the matter badly. I do not make that point in defence of the Government but to state that members of the Judiciary appointed to particular positions have a responsibility to all Members of both Houses as well as to Government. Otherwise, this type of dumbing down of Parliament which constantly takes place through all Governments will continue. That is something of which we must be aware.</P>
    <P>A grave mistake was made in appointing the Department of Education and Science as the line Department with overall responsibility for the commission because many of the papers relating to the issue under investigation were held within that Department. The Government should have selected a more suitable line Department with overall responsibility for funding and progressing the issue. We ran into so much sand at the start because the Department of Education and Science, as a body, was being investigated. I did not hear in the contributions made yesterday or today, in particular by the Minister, anyone refute the arguments made by Ms Justice Laffoy. No Minister has adequately responded to the arguments she made in support of her resignation. Ms Justice Laffoy sought additional resources to expedite the entire inquiry but the Government took some time to reach a view on the matter. That is not acceptable. I have heard no Minister refute in stark detail the points made by Ms Justice Laffoy in her correspondence to Government during the summer. There were unacceptable delays by the Department of Education and Science in providing many of the documents and memoranda sought. I ask the Minister for Education and Science why a dedicated staff were not put in place to deal with this issue and expedite the requests. It is Ms Justice Laffoy's view that much of the work could have been completed by 2005 if the requests had been followed up and the money provided. It is shameful that we, as a State, put greater resources into tribunals relating to planning matters and personal funding of politicians than into the investigation of child abuse. The Government has made no adequate response to the points raised by Ms Justice Laffoy in her correspondence. I await a response in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the openness and honesty of Archbishop Martin in his remarks last week. I encourage other church leaders to break their silence and speak out on this subject. We need to hear the church's voice on this matter. While not all the 18 congregations were implicated in this <Col N="101" />regard it is important they speak out on the matter. We need more church leaders to do as Archbishop Martin did last week. I am not asking the church to defend its position. It needs to address this issue rather than run for cover. I ask the church to reconsider and renegotiate the deal between it and the Government. The potential for the church to increase the fund to well beyond &euro;128 million is real and possible. As my party leader stated in another place, the church has a moral responsibility to renegotiate this sum so that there is a greater fund to provide the victims' needs. The ability of the State to pick up the final amount owed remains questionable. The church has a responsibility to renegotiate the deal and I call on it to do so.</P>
    <P>The deal, from start to finish, was shambolic. I find it difficult to understand the points made by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, when speaking on this subject over the last couple of weeks. I am unable to grasp the points he is making. I do not wish to make an attack on Deputy Woods but it is difficult for him to justify many of the arguments he puts forward in relation to the deal. Many have referred to the fact that the deal was signed off late into the term of office of the last Government. It appears from the evidence presented to date that the role of the Attorney General and his office was sidelined in the context of the discussions taking place. There was, as others said, no assessment of the total wealth or asset base of the church at the time, which should have been done. Anybody in the private sector negotiating a deal involving millions of euro would bring in their lawyers. They are the people one needs to ensure clarity on all the issues. That did not happen in relation to this deal.</P>
    <P>The heart of the issue does not rest with the &euro;128 million total liability, it is the terms of the indemnity that matter. The former Attorney General was probably the most political Attorney General in the history of this State. He had views on national stadia, Europe and everything else so the notion that he was a shrinking violet does not wash with me. He believed, in regard to the terms of the indemnity, that it should apply only to those who came before the redress board and that the State should not indemnify itself against every member of the congregation who would come before the courts. The ultimate deal negotiated, which leaves the State with maximum exposure in the courts, is a <i>carte blanche</i> whereby everyone whether or not they go before the redress board is held liable and the State must pick up the cost involved. There will be other cases, of which there can be no doubt. It appears the Government got it wrong when negotiating the terms of the indemnity deal. Whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is seeking an escape clause now or whether this was flagged at the time is a matter on which I presume the Committee of Public Accounts will have to make a determination. His view was sidelined on the matter on the basis of the evidence presented to date <Col N="102" />and proper appreciation of the issues concerning total indemnity and its terms of reference were not taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> reported earlier this week that a request was made under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to the Department of Education and Science and the Attorney General's office regarding correspondence on this matter. Most of the letters were not released to the journalists involved, yet two of them were published in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. It is important that all the documentation is released now and I question the decision of both the Department of Education and Science and the Attorney General's office not to forward the letters to the journalists from a public interest perspective, particularly when two were published in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</P>
    <P>This is a horrible mess and it is the responsibility of the Opposition to work with the Government to sort it out, get to the bottom of what occurred during the dying days of the previous Administration and establish a proper legal framework in order that victims can achieve closure on these issues. That is the most vitally important issue we face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. Approximately 29,500 young people born after 1930 were committed by the courts to industrial and reformatory schools. In addition, a significant number, which cannot be accurately quantified by the Department of Education and Science, were committed by parents. Such committals were made because the parents were poor and could not afford to nourish their children. The children were committed at a time when sexual mores and property regulations in society were ruthless and cold. The majority of society was in a stranglehold of puritanism, sexual mores and property rights. The upper class kept children born outside marriage. Throughout history aristocratic young people born outside marriage received titles and honours. However, the Roman Catholic Church, under Archbishop John Charles McQuaid, determined and ruled our lives. I was born in 1944 and the church ruled my life morning, noon and night until I was in my mid-twenties.</P>
      <P>Many of the institutions were privately owned by the religious orders but they were regulated by the State. This cold and heartless system continued until 1975 when, eight years after the inquiry chaired by District Justice Eileen Kennedy was set up to deliver a report on reformatory and industrial schools, the last institution was closed. There was a suspicion at the time that this was done because Ireland wanted to present a good face to the rest of Europe. We did not want too close an inspection of this system by the EEC. Where would we be if Ireland had not joined? I had to give up my job in the Civil Service when I got married in 1969. It was not until 1973 that female civil servants who were married could keep their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support the Government's <Col N="103" />view on compensation. However, I refer to the cover-up that took place. The Christian Brothers commemorated the centenary of the death of its founder, Edmund Ignatius Rice, in 1944. John Cooney, a revered writer formerly employed by <i>The Irish Times</i>, wrote a biography of Archbishop John Charles McQuaid in which he referred to the commemoration. He stated:</P>
    <P>These celebrations took place as two senior gardaí at Dublin's Fitzgibbon St. station were prevented from pursuing allegations of abuse by two Christian Brothers of boys at Artane Industrial School. The Superior, the Rev Brother T. M. Lennane, and the school chaplain, Fr. William Kenny, succeeded in hushing up a potential scandal with the assistance of McQuaid and Justice Minister, Gerald Boland. In a climate of opinion hostile to prosecution of clergy the two gardaí were told not to proceed with the case.</P>
    <P>This is why the Taoiseach made his comprehensive apology on behalf of the Government and the State to these young people. Gardaí, judges, inspectors and departmental officials who regulated and inspected the schools did not have the courage of their convictions to speak out and identify what was happening. People know abuse was taking place in the schools and nobody had the courage to stand up.</P>
    <P>I was 59 yesterday. The older I become, the more I realise how many people are afraid to speak out because they are fearful or are in denial. As Senator Brian Hayes said, this is happening under our noses similar to the treatment of Travellers and young people. I would not like to have been born a Traveller, living on the side of the road. I would be dead and probably would not have lived past ten years of age. We are in denial about those who are incarcerated in our prisons. Only the poor are in prison. The middle classes buy the best legal aid and keep themselves out of prison. We are in denial that those who are in prison cannot afford to pay for legal help. I support Senator Hayes's comment that we are also in denial in regard to other issues in society.</P>
    <P>Following the Taoiseach's apology, he introduced two Bills to establish the commission and the residential institutions redress scheme. Subsequently, the Government decided to pay full compensation and the congregations were not requested by the Government to pay. However, the congregations agreed to a payment and many meetings took place involving officials of the Department of Education and Science and the Attorney General's office to hammer out a deal on how much they should pay.</P>
    <P>The Laffoy commission had two functions, investigative and therapeutic. Many of those who sought therapy at the commission felt somebody was listening to them at long last about their suffering. I heard a number of them on radio programmes and it was most moving. They were finally able to tell somebody who was open to believing them that they were physically and sex<Col N="104" />ually abused. This element of the commission worked well but the investigative stage opened many legal challenges. As they were accused, the Christian Brothers were entitled to bring in lawyers to defend themselves. In defence of the Government, it decided to review the commission's work because it was facing a bill of &euro;200 million for funding every aspect of the work. It was paying for the lawyers and barristers of the members of the clergy who were being accused.</P>
    <P>I agree, with the benefit of hindsight, that the Department of Education and Science should not have been asked to inquire into the abuse of young people in institutions that were under its jurisdiction. I am fascinated by the fact that the Hutton inquiry in the UK conducted its business in eight weeks. It was able to demand the Prime Minister's attendance. We all saw the reconstructions of the hearings on television. The fact that Irish tribunals of inquiry seem to go on for years is not the end of the world, however, as the more we learn from the tribunals of the behaviour of certain people, the greater the chance that other people will appreciate the need for a high standard of ethics in public life. It would have been better if the Department of Education and Science had not been involved.</P>
    <P>I received first class help from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science, Mr. John Dennehy, when I was chairwoman of Gaisce &ndash; The President's Award. He gave me tremendous personal assistance when I had the stressful experience of being involved with the council. I was asked by President McAleese to try to introduce the award in Northern Ireland and I achieved this, in conjunction with the Departments of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs. I sent a letter to an official in the Department of Education and Science as chairwoman of the organisation, but I did not receive a response. I assumed that he was making up his mind about what I had requested of him. I became impatient after about three months and arranged to meet the man to whom I had written. I realised at that point that my request was not being dealt with. My letter had been placed in a file. I had thought, innocently, that I had not received a response because a decision had not been made.</P>
    <P>One can understand that the Department of Education and Science may have been asked to deal with this issue because it was in possession of the documentation and other material, but another Department would have been more suitable, with hindsight. Senator Mansergh mentioned earlier that the Department has a mind-boggling workload.</P>
    <P>In my heart and soul, I believe the State was responsible for the abuse of young people. I have believed from the start of this process that it is right that the State should pay for its lack of vigilance in looking after young people in industrial and reformatory schools. I spoke about this matter at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Fin<Col N="105" />ance and the Public Service. There seems to be a vendetta on the part of the Opposition, especially the Labour Party, in respect of issues of costs and money. Given that their lives have been ruined, how must the victims of abuse feel when they hear all this talk about money and costs? Any young person who is physically or sexually abused is damaged for life. They may make a form of recovery, but they are damaged forever.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church has paid a large price for the actions of some of its members. The fact it is on its knees in Ireland and the United States &ndash; the Archbishop of Boston has resigned &ndash; is a big enough price to pay. There is no doubt that the religious congregations contain some very good people. The hospitals that were managed by nuns were brilliantly run. The ladies who were in charge of training colleges and hospitals did an outstanding job at a time when women in Ireland had little chance of being involved in management, organisation or business. It should be remembered that not everybody was an abuser. Senator Mansergh does not realise how many young people were abused. His contribution gave the impression that only a few people were abused. Some 2,900 complainants, not a small figure, have made themselves known to the investigation committee. The relatives of the complainants should also be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not want to omit any of the points I wished to make. It is sad that the church is on its knees. Why does Ireland top the poll when surveys list countries in terms of alcohol consumption? Ireland is the number one country for binge drinking. Young people have no moral authority. For all its faults, the Catholic Church established the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, for example, to encourage people not to drink. It is a tragedy that the church is on its knees because there is now a lack of moral authority. Anybody who believes that young people listen to their parents, or do what their parents tell them, must be living in Disneyland. An authority other than parents is needed. I know that the church was repressive, but aspects of it were extremely good for social stability, and its downfall is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is right to bankrupt the religious orders. The Government decided initially that the orders should not have to pay anything, but they came forward to make payments even though they were under no pressure to do so. I will never forget the moment I heard the Taoiseach's apology on behalf of the nation in 1999. Senator Ulick Burke was somewhat disingenuous yesterday when he said that the Taoiseach's apology rings hollow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>I am very sorry. Another reference was made yesterday &ndash; I will not mention the Senator in question &ndash; to a deal of &ldquo;madness&rdquo;. How can one speak of a deal of madness? I fully <Col N="106" />support the Taoiseach and the apology he made. I also support Deputy Woods, who spearheaded the deal in the presence of officials from the Department of Finance and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. Justice is being done in the interests of the human rights of people who were deprived. The people in question were seen only as a number. They were not loved and were deprived of the love of a parent. Can one imagine the coldness felt by one who is seen by the Department as a number in an institution? The most traumatic aspect of this matter is that nobody cared about, praised or encouraged the people in question. There was a lack of love in their lives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be afforded the opportunity to speak briefly on this subject. This has been an excellent debate and there have been some wonderful contributions.</P>
      <P>The abuse to which children were subjected in reformatories, industrial schools, orphanages and Magdalene homes is a national disgrace. It was acknowledged as such by the Taoiseach, who made an apology to the victims of abuse on behalf of the State. Every right-thinking person lauded the establishment of the Laffoy commission, which was charged with inquiring into cases of child abuse and giving the victims of abuse the opportunity to have their day in court. The stated intention of the inquiry seems to have been frustrated and hindered by the Department of Education and Science, in particular. This culminated in the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy. I cannot accept the view of a previous speaker, who said it is very difficult to locate specific documents in the Department of Education and Science when required, as there are so many papers in that Department.</P>
      <P>What can we do to give survivors a speedy recourse to justice, which was the purpose of the inquiry? A spokesman for Aisling said recently that the people who go through the investigation committee only want to look their abusers in the face and ask them why they did what they did.</P>
      <P>The handling of the issue by the Department of Education and Science has been disgraceful. The Government stated that its actions were largely motivated by concern that hearings would take up to 12 years, yet last November when the commission, in a document entitled Framework Procedures, sought resources to hold parallel hearings the Government agreed in principle to provide the extra resources, but failed to provide them on the basis requested. It has been estimated that if those resources had been provided, the commission could finish its hearings by July 2005. Instead of looking for review after review, the Minister should have provided those resources and let the commission do its job, finish its hearings in 2005 and produce its report in 2006. Reviews and reports are regularly called for by the Government. This is another way of delaying and postponing decisions. The Government's inability to act has resulted in the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="107" />It beggars belief that the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, went into discussions with religious orders without legal representation when the other side was represented. I will not dwell on this matter because it has been adequately dealt with by my colleagues, particularly by Senator Phelan, and in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of victims of child abuse. Some are old and frail. I make an appeal that these people be granted an immediate hearing. All victims would agree that those who are old and frail should have their say at this point. I hope this question will be addressed. The reasons for this inquiry must not be overlooked and the victims must not lose out in the morass of administrative procedure and detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I compliment all speakers on their detailed research and the preparation of their statements. I compliment the former Minister, Deputy Woods, and the Government and I compliment the Taoiseach on his full apology to the unfortunate people who were abused in institutions for which the State had responsibility.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the people of County Offaly, where there was an institution in Daingean, I apologise for the injustices done to people in that institution in my county. Daingean reformatory had football and hurling teams and I played alongside some of the boys from that institution. Some of the boys were very good hurlers and footballers and I recall one boy who hurled alongside me on the Offaly minor team. Some of the stories he relayed to me and others do not bear repeating.</P>
      <P>Certain members of the clergy, gardaí and school principals sought, for very little reason, to have young boys committed to institutions. Problems existed but the solution to those problems was not to put boys into reformatories. Responsibility rests on several such people for what happened. The guilty must put their hands up and apologise to those unfortunate people.</P>
      <P>I welcome the financial commitment made by the religious congregations, who bear no obligation. We had a responsibility to deal with problems we ourselves created in not properly supervising the institutions. The contribution of the religious congregations should not be treated lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall the stories told by the unfortunate young people from Daingean of having to work hard on farms when they were very young and hungry much of the time. One boy told me he was punished for eating a piece of one of the turnips he was pulling. The regime that existed in those days left much to be desired. It is a cause of sadness to me, as a practising Catholic, that those young people went to Mass every morning and some were abused every night. The Taoiseach was correct to make a full apology to those <Col N="108" />who were abused and I would have expected no less of a public representative or Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The young fellows from Daingean used to arrive on a cattle truck, already togged out, to play matches. They always played to the rules, although we often suspected they were over the age limit for the competitions in which they took part. I regret having lost contact with some of the boys I got to know particularly well at that time. The Offaly minor hurling team was not as well treated as teams nowadays. We did not have dinner after important matches but thought ourselves lucky to be given a cup of tea with sandwiches and buns. The buns were not even iced. We used to collect the cakes and give them to the young fellows who were going back to the institution. Their only worry was that the buns might be taken from them at the gate as they returned and that they would not be able to give them to the other young fellows. Those were tough times and we regret them. We must have the courage to admit our faults and apologise for what happened at that time.</P>
    <P>More than 3,000 complaints have been received. Many of the people who suffered in the institutions have passed on to their eternal reward and we must also apologise for what happened to them. We should thank Ms Justice Laffoy for the excellent work she did while she chaired the commission. I wish the board the very best in reaching a speedy conclusion to ensure that all the young people who suffered at the hands of people for whom the State was responsible are properly compensated. No matter what amount they get, it will not be sufficient to compensate for their sufferings.</P>
    <P>I could not put on record the stories I was told by some of the young people who were abused during the era in question. As a person from County Offaly, which had an institution wherein child abuse occurred, I regret that there were not better rules and inspection methods in place, perhaps at a local authority level. Visiting committees from local authorities should have visited the institutions, just as health boards established visiting committees for their institutions more recently. Any institution dealing with young people with any handicap should certainly have visiting committees of elected public representatives to see at first hand exactly what is happening.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to make some brief remarks. I thank the Minister of State for his presence and Deputy Woods and the Government for having taken the stand they have taken, and I hope this matter is resolved at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the previous speaker because he brought a human dimension to the debate. I remember growing up in Foynes, which was ten miles from Glin where there was an industrial school. When I was young in the early 1950s, industrial schools obviously presented themselves as a terrible pros<Col N="109" />pect because I remember that parents of young school-going children who misbehaved always threatened to send those children to the industrial school. &ldquo;We will send you to Glin,&rdquo; was a statement at the time. There was fear as early as the 1950s.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Moylan, I remember young people taking up employment with local farmers after leaving the industrial school. I remember socialising with one such person who was extremely friendly. Last summer, a museum was set up in Glin in an old Church of Ireland building and it contains memorabilia from the area and much memorabilia from the industrial school, including photographs. It brought a lump to my throat to enter the museum because it brought back memories of the days when the industrial school was in operation.</P>
      <P>I accept it was correct for the Taoiseach to apologise on behalf of the State for the abuse that took place. In many ways, the apology would have been influenced by reports on television and in books about the era in question, an era which many would want to forget.</P>
      <P>The issue of compensation does not involve a vendetta regarding money because even if victims received &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000 in compensation, it would not compensate for the abuse they suffered and for the loss of their childhood. Money is not the factor. For many of those concerned, the main issue is that they are getting a chance to express what took place when they were young and that there is somebody to listen. This is probably the most important factor because with listening will come the healing process.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that those on the Government side would congratulate Deputy Woods for the initiative he took as Minister, and all his officials. One has to realise that while the Opposition would like to see a consensus evolving in politics, it is important for it to look vigilantly at what is being done. I spent a year as Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and worked very closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General. He is one of the most principled people I have ever worked with. He is totally apolitical and is forensic in his analysis of different aspects of State spending. There has been much focus recently on his report, especially regarding excesses in Government spending. Much attention has been paid to his research in this area and his estimate that compensation may cost up to &euro;1 billion. It may cost that much &ndash; I believe it has been described as a guesstimate. This term is unfair because the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General does not go through a guesstimate-type process. One Minister criticised the Comptroller and Auditor General for entering the area of policy. One has to respect that we have an independent person producing this kind of analysis. In many cases, the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot defend himself, by virtue of his position, against those who may make political taunts or attack him in a hostile way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one says Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation <Col N="110" />is not about money, one should realise that the sequence of events prior to her resignation, when she asked for sufficient resources to try to conclude the process in a timeframe of four to five years, was about funding. There was agreement in principle to provide the resources but, because of funding problems, they were not provided. One might say that the financial resources may not have been available because of the decline of the Celtic tiger, etc.</P>
    <P>In that context, when the Taoiseach said that everything was not right and apologised to Ms Justice Laffoy, his actions were in complete contrast to those of the Department of Education and Science, under Deputy Noel Dempsey, who was quite defensive of the whole mechanism. There was no apology on his part and he obviously tried to put a different spin on the matter. It would have been far better had he put up his hand like the Taoiseach and said the issue was not handled perfectly. The spin that appeared afterwards suggested that if the process were to continue as it was progressing, it would take ten to 12 years to complete and that many of those involved would have passed away. In fairness to Ms Justice Laffoy, had she received the resources she requested the process could have been completed in four to five years. We should await the sequence of events that occurs under the new appointee to see how long it might take. It is important to establish finality in whatever time it takes, preferably in a short timeframe.</P>
    <P>I worked with Deputy Woods and opposed him when I was spokesperson on the marine. I found him very frustrating to oppose during Question Time in the Dáil. He gave such long-winded replies that one was tearing out one's hair when asking supplementary questions. One rarely got to ask a supplementary question and rarely got to the nub of the issue because many of his replies involved a process of obfuscation to put one off the scent.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt anybody and listened with great patience. Deputy Woods made a sterling defence of his stance on the issue recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Senator Mansergh decide that the issue of the Attorney General's intervention was a red herring. It was not. If one had listened to an eminent barrister on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday night, one would have heard her say it was absolutely amazing that the religious congregations attended one of the meetings armed with their legal advisers while the Government did not have its legal representatives in place. That would appear obvious. Mr. Boland, an official of Deputy Woods's in the Department of Education and Science, remarked that while the Department achieved agreement in principle with CORI, it would have to be fine-tuned with the Attorney General, which never happened. The then Attorney General, Michael McDowell, did not <Col N="111" />want to be left out on a limb regarding this issue. He felt he was left outside the loop regarding many of the meetings. He had external matters to deal with and there were preparations to be made for the election etc., and maybe he might have taken his eye off the ball. However, it was a mistake to resolve the issue just a day into an election campaign. Maybe it was just a chance to clear the decks.</P>
    <P>It was very important that the parameters were correctly set. On the question of the legal indemnity, the Secretary General, Mr. Dennehy, said indemnity had not been invoked, yet the following day he apologised saying it had already been invoked in view of a settlement of &euro;150,000 to &euro;200,000. It will be interesting to see if the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General will be borne out when the overall cost emerges. The work of the commission will be extended over many years. An examination of the sequence of events will show that matters were not handled correctly. I am pleased the Comptroller and Auditor General had access to information from the Department of Education and Science. When <i>The Irish Times</i> requested similar documentation under the Freedom of Information Act, it was not disclosed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Committee of Public Accounts will consider this issue further. It is not concerned totally with money but with ensuring that those who suffered recover their dignity. We must respect what the State has done in this regard, including the Taoiseach's apology. It is important for politicians, the Comptroller and Auditor General and other custodians of the public purse to ensure that State resources are expended effectively and well.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the view that there was no compunction on the church to provide compensation. Much of what happened occurred under the church's stewardship. If it did not offer compensation, it would find it very difficult to preach to its flock especially in view of its eroded moral authority. Senator White referred to binge drinking among the young. Senator Moylan and other Senators know of the tremendous respect people had for the church when we were growing up. There was also respect for those who decided to become a pioneer. Young pioneers today feel like pariahs when they socialise with their peers, which is regrettable. Some of the changes that have taken place in society are not for the better.</P>
    <P>While these events occurred under the stewardship of the church and were wrong, it must be acknowledged that the church has done a lot of good. When we were growing up, the church had greater moral authority and there was, perhaps, a justified fear of it which may have kept us on the right path. It is regrettable that has been eroded and has broken down.</P>
    <P>I wish Ms Justice Laffoy's successor well and I hope that over a short time period this matter will be brought to finality in the interests of those who have been abused in the past.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom teacht anseo i bhur measc agus páirt a ghlacadh ins an díospóireacht an-thábhachtach seo mar ionadaí ón Rialtas. Déanaim comhgairdeas le gach duine a labhair go croíúil, go cruinn agus go beacht ar an ábhar.</P>
      <P>I thank those who contributed to this debate. While I may not agree with the sentiments expressed by some Members of the Opposition, I accept Senators have spoken with the needs of the survivors of abuse at heart. I pay tribute to those I had the privilege to hear. Their contributions were open, heartfelt, sincere, humane and committed.</P>
      <P>The Government regards the need to bring some closure to survivors regarding their past experiences as being the primary factor in shaping its policy in this area. Its programme of measures began in May 1999, with the Taoiseach's apology to all victims of abuse on behalf of the people. These measures, comprising a nation-wide counselling service, a commission to inquire into child abuse and a redress board, remain in place. It is worth repeating that the only part of the Government's initiative in this area that is under review is the investigation committee of the commission to inquire into child abuse. The commission's other committee &ndash; the confidential committee &ndash; is working well and has heard over 700 witnesses.</P>
      <P>All other parts of the Government's response continue to operate. In particular, the redress board, which provides financial awards to survivors of abuse, is fully operational and is processing 30 claims per week. Some 97% of the offers made by the board have been accepted by claimants, so it is clearly working well. It is worth noting that it is open to claimants to appeal awards to an independent appeals board.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, I have been a Member of Oireachtas Éireann for 21 years. Over the last decade, many tribunals of inquiry have been established to inquire into many aspects of public life. It is worth comparing these with the work of the Hutton inquiry in the United Kingdom. Everybody asked and summonsed to appear before the Hutton inquiry did so, some in the absence of legal advisers, without obstruction or legal impediment. They submitted their reports and gave evidence without difficulty. The inquiry report will be accepted by the Government, the public and the media and will stand as the record, the <i>de facto</i> position. By contrast, in this country, the tribunals of inquiry that have been established have become complex and legal quagmires. They have been impeded and obstructed to the extent that even servants of the State who are paid by taxpayers are not prepared to give evidence before them. There is something wrong with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and the current Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and their teams are being lambasted because they did not have lawyers <Col N="113" />present every time they met the parties involved in the negotiations on this matter. Surely if we elect people and if Parliament appoints Ministers, they have a duty to do a job and execute a conclusion, no matter how complex or difficult. As the then custodian of the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Woods did an outstanding job in bringing this matter to finality. He had a professional lawyer within his Department to advise him on a daily basis and be present with him during the negotiations. In view of this, I do not understand those who say there was something wrong with the conclusions reached, especially when the negotiations were conducted in a sincere attempt to discharge professional standards and bring to a conclusion one of the saddest tales in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>It is planned to increase the number of redress board members from five to eight, which should allow for 40 cases a week to be processed. It is important to emphasise that the current review of the commission's investigation committee has no impact on the work of the redress board. It is the Government's intention that the review of the investigation committee would be completed as soon as possible. Where amending legislation is considered necessary, it will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas expeditiously. The overriding aim is that the committee should be empowered to complete its mandate within a reasonable period of time without incurring exorbitant costs.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that without the contribution of &euro;128 million from the religious congregations, to be provided under the terms of the indemnity agreement, the costs associated with the redress scheme would have been met entirely by the taxpayers. It has been said repeatedly, but it needs to be reiterated in order that people are properly informed on this issues, that the indemnity agreement is not costing the State money. The redress scheme, proposed by the Government and agreed by all sides of the House, will do so.</P>
    <P>The contribution of &euro;128 million from the religious congregations means the State does not have to fund the entire bill. It also means that the need for further actions in the courts is minimised. While it has been argued that the State should not have accepted a sum of &euro;128 million and should have insisted on a higher contribution and possibly a 50:50 split, it is my view and that of the Government that the agreement reached was the best that could have been achieved in the circumstances. In France, the state took on the churches on these issues and lost when it secured a discovery of documents order against them. That was appealed to the French Supreme Court which found that the documents had to be returned. The judges did not award a penny. Against this background, other international information, legal facts and common sense, a solid conclusion has been reached in our case.</P>
    <P>There comes a stage in all negotiating processes when an offer is made and there is a <Col N="114" />judgment call on whether it could be increased or should be accepted. In this case, the call was that &euro;128 million represented a meaningful contribution and should be accepted. Any right-thinking and fair-minded person should agree with this decision.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate. I welcome the fact that there is more informed comment about the improvements that need to be made. In May 1999 the Government apologised to the survivors of institutional childhood abuse and set about redressing the wrong. The Government has been true to its word and will fully adhere to its commitments.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill 2001: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to present to the House today the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill 2001. The purpose of the Bill is to provide a clearer legislative basis for the power of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to grant temporary release to a prisoner by amending the Criminal Justice Act 1960 and setting out the purposes for which temporary release may be granted, the circumstances in which it is to occur and the criteria which are to apply to the process.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 is the current legal basis for the power to grant temporary release and provides that the Minister may make rules for the temporary release of prisoners, subject to conditions which may be imposed in each particular case. Rules made under this section include provisions for the imposition of conditions applicable to temporary release and for procedural matters.</P>
      <P>Section 2 is a general provision and does not contain any guidance for the exercise of this power. The findings of the High Court in the Corish case, delivered early in 2000, pointed to the desirability to set out more clearly in legislation the criteria that should apply to the operation of the system of temporary release. The net point of the judgment in the Corish case was that there was no power to refuse to consider temporary release for categories of offenders because the 1960 Act did not specify that such a power existed. This arose from a position in which successive Ministers for Justice had specified certain categories of prisoners who are not considered for temporary release, save in exceptional circumstances. These categories included sex offenders, drug offenders and others where a risk to the community was significant or where public revulsion at the nature of such offences was particularly strong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" />Following the judgment in the Corish case, the operation of these broad exclusions for categories was discontinued and each case is now considered and decided on its individual circumstances, having regard to the safety of the public which is of the utmost importance. This new practice will continue and, in the context of circumstances in which the provision of extra prison places in recent years has largely addressed the problem of overcrowding and allows for the operation of a controlled and structured temporary release regime, I emphasise emphatically that it is not the intention in this Bill to reinstate powers to exclude categories of offenders from temporary release. Notwithstanding this, following the Corish case, action must still be taken to ensure that the criteria governing the operation of the temporary release system be set out more clearly.</P>
    <P>The Corish decision was a convincing argument that the 1960 provision was short on specifics and certainly not up to the standards of transparency that we now rightly expect to apply to the exercise of ministerial powers. It was for this reason that the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sought and obtained Government approval for this Bill. During the preparation of the Bill, the Supreme Court, in a non-binding comment in the case of the DPP <i>v.</i> Finn on 24 November 2000, suggested it was desirable that the system of temporary release be placed on a clearer and more transparent basis. We are acting in accordance with the judgment of the High Court and advice of the Supreme Court in introducing this legislation.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the details of the Bill, it is important to consider what is the purpose of a system of temporary release and how it operates and to realise that temporary release is our system of parole, which is an essential feature of prison systems worldwide. Senators will be aware that the reason systems of parole or temporary release exist is that it is generally recognised that in a modern prison system, a more proactive role is required than that of just locking up an offender until the entire sentence is served and then releasing that person into society unchanged or possibly even changed for the worse. The prison system must, in so far as possible, seek to ensure, both for the longer-term safety of the community and in the interests of rehabilitating the individual prisoner, that prisoners, when released, will not re-offend.</P>
    <P>The temporary release system can play an important role on a number of fronts. On the one hand, it can assist in the prevention of the commission of crime and safeguard the community while, on the other, seek, on a humanitarian basis, to help offenders to take the important step away from crime and into more positive and law abiding lives. Temporary release may be granted for various reasons to prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment. Short-term releases may be granted for different periods, ranging from a few hours to one or two days, and for a variety of <Col N="116" />reasons, including compassionate reasons such as the illness or death of a near relative. Efforts are also made, where possible, to plan structured temporary releases for re-socialisation purposes and to plan for the reintegration of offenders into the community.</P>
    <P>Pre-release preparation could include the following: transfer to a less secure institution; a programme of short-term releases which might progress from supervised to unsupervised outings. The purpose of such programmes would be to reduce the effects of institutionalisation by aiding, for example, familiarisation with the outside world or maintaining relationships with family or relatives; temporary release to attend work experience or training. For example, prisoners in the training unit who are deemed suitable may attend the workshops run by Prisoners Aid through Community Effort, a voluntary organisation for the care and education of offenders founded in 1969, which runs a training workshop at Santry where various skills can be acquired that increase the possibility of finding work. The Santry workshop is attended both by serving prisoners on day release programmes and some who have recently finished their sentences. Prisoners may also be granted weekly renewable temporary release after careful screening to take up employment or to continue education or vocational training courses; and, pre-release preparation often includes temporary release to attend residential treatment for alcohol or drug addiction.</P>
    <P>Decisions on pre-release programmes are made by the Minister or senior officials of the Irish Prison Service on his behalf. Review meetings are held regularly in each prison institution to facilitate the exchange of information and aid decision making in the management of offenders' sentences. Each meeting is chaired by the governor or deputy or assistant governor of the institution in question and is attended by senior prison management, probation and welfare service staff, chaplains, teachers, other prison staff and an official from the Irish Prison Service headquarters. Where an offender is engaging with other services in the prison, such as the psychology or psychiatry service or other medical services, the professional dealing with the specific offender will also be invited to attend when required.</P>
    <P>Issues concerning risk to the community and preparation for re-integration are much more complex regarding offenders serving long sentences. For this reason, the interim parole board, which replaced the sentence review group, was established in April 2001 by the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The principal function of the board is to advise the Minister on the administration of longer-term prison sentences, including the type of programmes which should be in place leading to release. The board reviews cases of prisoners sentenced to determinate sentences of eight years or more, but less than 14 years in circumstances where the prisoner has served half of the sentence. In the cases of <Col N="117" />prisoners sentenced to 14 years or more, including life sentences, the board will review after seven years of the sentence have been served. To be eligible for review a prisoner must have at least 12 months left to serve of his or her sentence at the time of the review.</P>
    <P>The interim parole board formally began its work in December 2001, having first received guidance from the Irish Prison Service, probation and welfare service and psychiatric service sources. The board also received instruction from training personnel attached to the English parole board on its methods and sat in on hearings of that board.</P>
    <P>It is important to be aware that in making its recommendations to the Minister, the board already has regard to the type of criteria provided for in this Bill. Enactment of the Bill will provide a statutory base for such criteria to which the Minister will have to have regard in dealing with recommendations from the board. The interim parole board has been set up on an administrative basis with a view to gaining experience of the issues of temporary release. The question of the establishment of the interim parole board on a statutory basis will be kept under review, taking into account the experience gained by the operation of the board.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the reasons for and importance of having a system of temporary release in operation. There are, however, conflicting issues which will always arise in such a situation. On the one hand, temporary release allows for processes of rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders into society while, on the other, and most importantly, concerns in relation to the safety of all citizens are addressed. It would be unrealistic to state there is never an element of risk involved in any system of parole or temporary release and, while the easy option might be to rule out any possibility of temporary release, such an approach would have serious consequences in establishing an inhumane penal regime. This would ultimately create greater risks for the public from prisoners whose only future prospects may be the continuation of a life of crime. None of us would favour such an approach and the Legislature, through the Criminal Justice Act 1960, has accepted that there is a need for a system of temporary release.</P>
    <P>Any Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must perform a difficult balancing act in operating a system of temporary release, weighing possible risks against possible benefits with the safety of the public always being of paramount concern. The prison modernisation programme in recent years is an important development in achieving this balance. The programme has largely resulted in the welcome closing of the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; system. With the pressure to relieve overcrowding in the prison system now gone, this allows for the operation of a controlled and structured system of temporary release. This Bill makes more transparent the criteria which should apply to the exercise of the power to grant <Col N="118" />temporary release and the considerations which must be taken into account in deciding on individual applications for temporary release.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill for the information of the House. The Bill is a short one which comprises only two sections, the second of which is a standard provision which contains the Short Title and commencement provision.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are contained in section 1 which amends the Criminal Justice Act 1960 by inserting a new section 2 into that Act. The new section 2(1) provides that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can direct the temporary release of a person serving a sentence of imprisonment. Subsection (11) makes it clear that imprisonment includes detention in St. Patrick's Institution and in detention centres provided for in the Prisons Act 1970.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) sets out the purposes for which temporary release may be granted by the Minister. These are to assess the person's ability to re-integrate into society upon such release; to prepare a person for release upon expiration of his or her sentence or upon his or her being discharged from prison; and, to enable a person to assist the Garda Síochána in the prevention, detection or investigation of offences or the apprehension of a person guilty of, or suspected of having committed, an offence. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) further provides that a person may be temporarily released where circumstances exist to justify the person's release on health grounds or on other humanitarian grounds. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that a person may be temporarily released where, in the opinion of the Minister, the release is necessary or expedient to ensure good government of the prison concerned or to maintain good order and the humane and just management of the prison concerned. Finally, paragraph (<i>d</i>) provides that a person may be temporarily released if the Minister is of the opinion that the person has been rehabilitated and would be capable of reintegrating into society.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) sets out the considerations which the Minister must take into account in deciding whether to grant temporary release. This subsection is intended to give a statutory basis to the considerations that have hitherto been taken into account in practice in reaching decisions on whether to grant temporary release and reflect internationally accepted practice. The considerations are: the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence being served by the person relates; the sentence concerned and any recommendations made by the court in relation to the sentence imposed; the period of the sentence served by the person; and the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released.</P>
    <P>This provision now also provides, following an amendment to the Bill in Dáil Éireann, that regard will be taken of the views of the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates; the per<Col N="119" />son's previous criminal record; the risk of the person failing to return to prison at the expiration of the period of temporary release; the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release; any report or recommendation made by the governor, the Garda Síochána, a probation and welfare officer or any other person whom the Minister considers may be of assistance in coming to a decision as to whether to grant temporary release; the risk that the person might commit an offence during any period of temporary release; the risk of the person failing to comply with any of the conditions of temporary release and the likelihood that a period of temporary release might accelerate the person's re-integration into society or improve his or her prospects of obtaining employment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) sets out the circumstances in which the Minister shall not give a direction for the temporary release of a person. These circumstances are where it would not be appropriate to give such a direction for persons connected with any one or more of the considerations listed in subsection (2). This simply means that the Minister must not grant temporary release where he or she is of the opinion that he or she should not do so on the basis of any or all of the criteria in subsection (2). If, when considering any of the criteria, the Minister is of the view that the person should not be granted temporary release, he or she cannot grant such release even if another of the criteria might suggest that temporary release would be beneficial. If, for example, the potential threat to the safety or security of the public is so great that he or she feels the prisoner should not be released, the fact that the release might improve the person's prospects of employment need not be considered.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) provides that temporary release may not be granted if it is prohibited by existing or future statutory prohibitions on temporary release. Such statutory prohibitions exist, with a saver for grave reasons of a humanitarian nature, in section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990 regarding persons convicted of treason or of certain murders and attempted murders, for example, the murder of a garda. Similarly, section 27 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended by section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, provides that temporary release cannot be granted to a person where the mandatory minimum penalty of ten years imprisonment for drug trafficking has been imposed under that section, except for grave reasons of a humanitarian nature. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) provides that temporary release may not be granted to prisoners serving sentence for one or more offences who are on remand for another offence or offences.</P>
    <P>Subsections (4) and (5) provide for the governor to be informed and to give effect to the Minister's decision. Subsection (5) now also provides, following an amendment to the Bill in the Dáil, that the governor shall make and keep a record in writing of that direction. Subsection (6) <Col N="120" />provides clarification that the granting of a period of temporary release does not create an entitlement to further periods of temporary release. Each and every release is a separate matter, having regard on each occasion to the criteria set down in this Bill. Subsection (7) provides that the Minister may make rules for the purpose of enabling this section to have full effect and that such rules may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as the Minister considers necessary or expedient.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) now also provides, following an amendment to the Bill in the Dáil, that such rules may specify conditions to which all persons released shall be subject or conditions to which all persons belonging to such classes of persons as are specified in the rules shall be subject. Clearly, conditions can be attached to temporary release. Subsection (8) provides that any rules made must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Subsection (9) provides that nothing in the Bill shall affect the operation of the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act 1998. This subsection is precautionary to ensure that the arrangements applying to temporary release of qualifying prisoners under the terms of the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Act 1998 cannot be adversely affected by anything in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in keeping with a view expressed by the Supreme Court in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v</i>. Finn that a clearer and more transparent basis for the system of temporary release is desirable. In the course of its judgment, the Supreme Court said it is extremely desirable that remission and sentence review should be placed on a clear and transparent basis but that it is ultimately a matter for the Oireachtas to decide whether to retain the present system, put it on a clearer and more transparent basis, devolve it to a parole board or confer it on the courts. This Bill, together with the interim parole board which advises the Minister on the sentence management of long-term prisoners, will provide the clear and transparent basis, which the Supreme Court has said is desirable, as well as the necessary safeguards required for the operation of the system of temporary release.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is clear and concise legislation which puts on a statutory footing the powers the Minister formerly exercised under statutory instrument. If this legislation is implemented wisely, with a couple of changes I intend to propose, it could have a good effect. Giving temporary release to prisoners should help their rehabilitation, something we all aim to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important when dealing with criminal justice legislation to strike a balance between the rights of the victim and the rights of the criminal. However, the balance is often tilted more towards the rights of the criminal than the rights of the victim. We have a responsibility to ensure that <Col N="121" />the rights of the victim are provided for and upheld in legislation. I am anxious to include a provision in this Bill which will allow the victim to be told when the criminal who perpetrated the crime against them is being temporarily released. There have been many instances where the victim of a crime bumps into his or her attacker, who is on temporary release from prison, when walking down the street. This causes great shock and upset for the victim. We should provide that the victim will be informed if his or her attacker is given temporary release. I will table an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Until recently, the powers of temporary release were exercised by the Minister under a statutory instrument. In the High Court decision in the Corish case, Mr. Justice O'Neill found that the power being exercised by the Minister, on foot of article 4 of Statutory Instrument 157 of 1998, to be <i>ultra vires</i>. Is this Bill being introduced to remedy the illegality of what was carried out heretofore? That could be described as the Minister breaking the law.</P>
    <P>It would not be the first time that the courts have found the Government to be on the wrong side of the law and I remind the Minister of the five-nil decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Vincent <i>v</i>. the Attorney General, which emphatically stated that the Government had been making regulation after regulation on fisheries without any legal basis. If nothing else, that highlights the fact that the Government is prepared to stretch its own laws to the limit until it is brought to book by the courts. The Progressive Democrats were very fast in coming forward to tell us that they would be the Government watchdog. It is not they but the courts who are the Government watchdog and we must thank them for it.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that the motivation behind the Bill is that, until now, by giving temporary release to prisoners, the State was exposing itself to potential liability where the criminal reoffended. The Bill aims to close off that possibility. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whom the Minister of State is representing today, has not been very candid in telling us that the Bill will help exonerate the State from any liability in that regard. I ask the Minister to address that point. Does the Bill seek to confer immunity on him? I would like the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to be present because in a 1994 <i>Irish Times</i> article, he expressed the view that, in the absence of legislation, there were strong grounds for victims of early release reoffenders holding the State liable. I would like the Minister to clarify whether those are the reasons behind the Bill. Will the Bill exonerate the State from liability where an offender on temporary release reoffends? The explanatory memorandum should reflect that and the Minister should be more open in telling us the real reasons for introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I dtosach báire, ba mhaith liom <Col N="122" />fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Seanad inniu chun an Bille um Cheartas Coiriúil (Scaoileadh Sealadach Príosúnach) 2001 a phlé. It is an interesting Bill, which goes to the core of how society regulates itself. A maxim has been enunciated in the House on similar subjects of debate, namely, that crime does not pay. We should judge any legislation that comes before us by that maxim. It is important that people who commit crimes make restitution for their offences. There is a perception &ndash; Senator Terry may have touched on it &ndash; that we tend, through various civil liberty and other groups, to take account of prisoners' conditions and so on. That is fundamental, but as Senator Terry rightly says, it is important to remember the victims of those offences too.</P>
      <P>That must all be judged against the background of how we deal with offenders. It would be fair to say that there has not always been consistency in sentencing by courts. It has always struck me as somewhat peculiar. While I fully subscribe to the principle that the courts must be absolutely independent of the Executive, it does not mean that they should be totally independent of any sort of assessment of their decisions. Ultimately, their actions and decisions reflect on society, how we abide by our laws and particularly how we perceive the actions of the State in administering them.</P>
      <P>We have debated the system of restorative justice, which has been tried in one or two areas, in the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. It would be nice to think that the Department would be at the forefront and perhaps much more prominent in pursuing that type of approach. Community service could be much more widely deployed as a means of dealing with offenders, very constructively enabling them to make restitution to society for their offences without putting them in prison. Custodial sentences should be the last resort, particularly if we are talking about crimes that we might not regard as very serious. It would be fair to say &ndash; I have seen examples &ndash; that people go to prisons which are higher institutions of crime. They come out much more proficient, becoming involved in the drug trade and various other things in which they were never involved before they were put in prison.</P>
      <P>There is a real onus on us to regulate this area sensibly to avoid the recurrence of crime committed by such individuals. There is a clear onus on the State, as far as practicable, to ensure that people do not graduate to more serious crime simply because they are serving a custodial sentence. A balance is needed. The rights of prisoners are often talked about and I have no difficulty in subscribing to part of that, but I hold the view that prisoners should be obliged to work to compensate the cost of their custody, at least in part. In its own way, that can be of value in getting them into meaningful employment when they emerge from prison. We should take any rehabilitative steps that we can in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="123" />The question of granting temporary release is clearly set out. The Minister has rightly said that it emanated from the Corish case. It seems very sensible, as he rightly said, in an era of absolute transparency on such issues that the criteria be set down clearly. I have gone through the criteria and obviously will support much of it. However, I have some reservations about some of it. The Minister may direct the temporary release of a person serving a sentence of imprisonment. It sets out the purposes, stressing the person's ability to reintegrate into society upon such release. That begs the question to what end. I have seen examples in some prisons, Castlerea among them, where there is accommodation of the sheltered kind within the prison precincts to enable people who may have become institutionalised while in prison to graduate to a more settled exterior existence. People often encounter difficulty, particularly if they have been incarcerated for a long time, reintegrating into society and I know that temporary release is in part designed to help them do that.</P>
    <P>It also prepares a person for release and enables a person to assist gardaí in the prevention, detection or investigation of offences. It is obviously and eminently sensible to allow releases in those circumstances. The Bill goes on to state that a person may be temporarily released when, in the opinion of the Minister, circumstances exist to justify release on health or humanitarian grounds and again it is appropriate to have such provisions. Any civilised society would do that.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations regarding paragraph (<i>c</i>), which states that the Minister may grant temporary release where he considers it necessary or expedient to ensure good government of the prison concerned or to maintain good order in and humane and just management of the prison concerned. A system should be in place to detain people to serve their sentences. I have some difficulty with a principle under which people could be granted temporary release simply because we do not have the necessary facilities. The Minister referred in his speech to the closure of what was euphemistically referred to as the &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo;, but I have come across cases in which it was not easy to accumulate evidence, despite gardaí being convinced that a suspect was responsible for a certain crime and therefore deserving his just desserts. It is not always easy to accumulate the evidence necessary to achieve a conviction but I have come across cases in which offenders are back walking around their towns less than a week afterwards and more or less jeering the gardaí who went to the trouble of putting them away in the first place. That is unacceptable and unfair to society and I have reservations about this provision. While I hope there are no such releases, if there are their number should be negligible.</P>
    <P>The criteria the Minister must consider before granting temporary release are clearly set out. <Col N="124" />The nature and gravity of the offence is obviously an essential criterion and so are any recommendations by the court in relation to the sentence which would obviously reflect on the crimes heard in the court and are very appropriate. The length of the sentence served by the person is another criterion and I understand from what the Minister said that a minimum period would have to be served before people would be considered for temporary release. Regarding the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released, we have seen high profile instances in the recent past of people re-offending. In this context there is an onus not just on the Minister, but on prison authorities and others who are part of the assessment process to be 100% sure that people will not re-offend. It would be unacceptable for innocent civilians to be subjected to crimes at the hands of people on temporary release. Some mechanism should be put in place to extend sentences if the terms of a temporary release are breached, particularly if the breach is serious.</P>
    <P>The person's previous criminal record is also a serious consideration. If a person has been in jail for minor offences, it begs the question why a sentence other than a custodial sentence was not applied. However, if a person re-offends he or she should only be released in exceptional circumstances. Other considerations include the risk of a person failing to return to prison and the conduct of a person while in custody, which are obviously worthwhile also.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy with the comments of Senator Terry under paragraph (<i>h</i>). There has been some interesting and constructive media coverage regarding the possibility of the legislative process and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform being too concerned with the offences and the offender and not being concerned enough with the victim. It strikes me that regarding certain crimes, though not all crimes, where serious physical injury is inflicted, for example, there should be a place in the consultation process for the victims involved. It is fine to get the recommendations of the prison governor, the gardaí and the probation and welfare officer, as they will all have considered views which will be helpful to the Minister. However, there is an ideal opportunity here for the Minister to stitch in a provision for consultation with victims in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Sometimes victims can become embittered, which is only human, and that consultation process does not have to be fully accepted by them, but the mere fact of consultation is recognition for the victims. In the past we have not done that and we should do more to put the victim centre stage. When we had discussions at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on the Nenagh project on restorative justice, it was interesting that the victim was a very important component of the process. It is good for the healing of the victim but it also helps to challenge the offender to come to terms <Col N="125" />with the nature and consequences of the offence. Often that is better than anything else done to rehabilitate a prisoner.</P>
    <P>This could be examined further but the other criteria are common sense. Obviously one has to consider whether a person will commit another offence, whether he or she will fail to comply with any of the conditions and whether temporary release will accelerate the person's reintegration into society. In general the principle behind the Bill is good and this is a welcome step forward. However, while no specific crimes are excluded other than those covered by the 1990 Act, those committing crimes such as serious drug offences, serious assault resulting in bodily injury, robbery with firearms and terrorist offences should serve their sentences full stop and should not be considered for temporary release. That is not to say that other mechanisms could not used to try to rehabilitate those offenders, but the message should be given that prison is not a place one will get out of quickly if one behaves oneself, regardless of the offence committed. Those who commit particularly serious crimes should serve serious sentences which will not be reduced for any reason. There may be temporary releases on humanitarian grounds &ndash; I would not exclude that &ndash; but those are the only grounds on which I would consider releases in that context.</P>
    <P>We must consider how to achieve a proper balance in this area, which is not always easy. There is a subjective element in that people, depending on where they stand, will take different views of rehabilitation and encouraging offenders to become good, constructive members of society as opposed to what those offenders may have done previously. Everyone deserves a second chance and that should be a hallmark of our society. However, on the other hand, people must pay the penalty for their crimes and make restitution to society in general and to their victims in particular. That might create more order in our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill, which is a good step forward. Senator Terry and Senator Walsh are right that we have to express our concerns for the victims of crime as they may have suffered grievously at the hands of the imprisoned person.</P>
      <P>I was cheered by a point made by the Minister of State that when taking into consideration matters regarding temporary release, the Minister would examine the potential threat to the safety and security of the public should the person be released. This provision also ensures, following an amendment to the Bill in Dáil Éireann, that regard be taken of the views of the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates. The only section of the Bill where the victim is mentioned is section 1(2)(d) where it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public (including the victim of the offence to which the sentence of impris<Col N="126" />onment being served by the person relates) should the person be released from prison.</P>
    <P>That is not the same as what the Minister of State said. He said that the views of the victim of the offence, to which the sentence of imprisonment being served relates, are to be taken into account. This does not tie in with what is in the Bill, which takes into account only the safety and security of a victim &ndash; if he or she is likely to be attacked. There is no provision in that section to the effect that the views of the victim are to be taken into account, unless that is provided in another section of the Bill which I have missed.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry's proposal that at least the victim should be given notice that the person concerned will be let out on temporary release is a good one which the Minister of State should consider, particularly, as Senator Walsh said, if the crime committed was serious. We hear sometimes of offenders being released on bail and the horror of a victim who was raped by an offender, or the horror a family member where another family member was murdered when that person saw the offender concerned walking down the road. We are aware that crimes are often committed by people who live adjacent to their victims.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh made an important point that we must try to ascertain if prisoners will address what they have done to their victims. This is the basis of restorative justice, which, as the Senator will be aware, has been extremely successful in the United States in particular where it was first introduced. It has been very useful in those cases here where prisoners have been made address exactly what they did and what it did to their victims. The victim must also agree to co-operate with this process. It is an area we should try to expand within the prisons because it is important for offenders to face up to what they did and, if possible, to try to show some recompense, but they at least should realise they did some wrong and caused great harm. I support Senator Terry and Senator Walsh on this point.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State made another extraordinarily important point. We do not want an offender to be released from prison unchanged or, worse still, changed for the worst and to return to society even more bitter and difficult to deal with than he or she was in the first instance. This is an area we need to address within the prisons.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of the voluntary commitment to programmes called Alternatives to Violence which are run in several prisons. They are available in both parts of Wheatfield, the midlands and in Mountjoy and they have been provided on a once off basis in Limerick and Castlerea. These programmes are extremely important also because offenders must be involved in taking responsibility for the crimes they committed, realise that they were seriously wrong and that they harmed people. They need to understand there are other ways of settling one's disputes rather than, as one woman was accused of, committing grievous bodily harm. She <Col N="127" />said to me at the time, &ldquo;I just gave her a bit of biff&rdquo;. I was present to plead for her because she was needed to mind various children. There is a method of trying to get across to offenders that we take seriously what they did to their victims and that as well as incarceration we require them to become involved in a programme to be set up, which we hope will make their lives better once they are released.</P>
    <P>The educational facilities within our prisons are excellent. When an amnesty was granted to a number of prisoners in Portlaoise to leave that prison following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, I recall that a colleague who is involved in the education of prisoners regretted very much that the agreement was signed in April. He said if only the negotiations could have continued until June many more of them would have completed their degrees or other courses.</P>
    <P>Some people find benefits in prison that they have not found elsewhere. Another friend, whose son dropped out of college and ended up in prison where he completed a degree, said to me that it was a great pity her son had to go to such lengths to finish his education. We make a great effort to involve prisoners in education within the Prison Service. I have the greatest respect for all those involved in education in the Prison Service because they try to do the best job they can. The more encouragement we can give prisoners within the Prison Service &ndash; perhaps initially only to become involved in learning to read and write, with which I have discovered a considerable number of them have a problem &ndash; the better. I have visited many prisons here, but I have not been an inmate. Sometimes when I say &ldquo;the last time I was in Mountjoy&rdquo; people ask me if I was in for shoplifting or for being around Burlington Road again.</P>
    <P>The efforts made by prison staff to try to rehabilitate prisoners is astonishing. One concrete effort to which I point is the play that takes place every year in Mountjoy. When that play started many years ago the authorities could not get prisoners to audition. They had to bring in actors from outside the prison, but now the prisoners nearly fight<i> mano a mano</i> to get a part. Last year was the first time that I ever saw the first names and surnames of all the characters and of all those who made the sets recorded in the programme. That was because they were all very proud of what they had managed to achieve. For some of them, it was the first concrete achievement for which they got great applause in their lives. One of the most moving sights I saw there was on the night of the main show when the prisoners' families came to see the play and following it I saw children rushing up to their fathers. Last year I saw two children, who had come over from England with their mothers especially for the play, rush up to their fathers and look at them with admiration in a way they probably had never looked at them previously.</P>
    <P>These sorts of events are extraordinary <Col N="128" />important within the Prison Service because, as the Minister of State said, we want offenders to come out of them changed for the better. This is why temporary release is very important because offenders become institutionalised very easily and they lose contact with their families, which is another disaster. If they lose contact with their families, it is difficult for them when they are released because they can be ostracised and not allowed to live with their families any more. These efforts are important.</P>
    <P>I would go even further in regard to some of these conditions and propose that not only humanitarian efforts should be taken into account, but some important days such as first holy communions, confirmations and other such occasions. They do not come under the heading of humanitarian &ndash; they are social occasions &ndash; but they are very important for a child who may not have said to schoolmates why his or her father or mother is not around. Such children will be asked why did their fathers or mothers not turn up for that special day. Therefore, temporary release for such occasions is extremely important.</P>
    <P>One element that is lacking within the Prison Service &ndash; although chaplains, psychologists and many prison officers, particularly the older ones, make a huge effort to fill this role &ndash; is the giving of more emotional support to prisoners. Many of them feel they have been badly done down by society. There is not much point in them coming out of prison even more bitter than they were before they went in. It would be helpful to reflect on how we could put a little more effort into that aspect, perhaps by way of more discussion with the chaplains in prisons, the parole workers and social workers to see what could be achieved. The objective is to try to get offenders to reintegrate into society in a better way.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State pointed out, and it is also made plain in the Bill, how extremely important it is for &ndash; I sometimes say patients at this point &ndash; prisoners to become involved in training outside prison. Some courses are only available outside prison. I praise FÁS for the incredible work it does in this area. Prisoners have to be released to take up these courses.</P>
    <P>I have met women prisoners who have gone out to learn to be beauticians or to be involved in fitness training centres and who have got jobs when they got out of prison. We must remember that it is extremely difficult for ex-prisoners to get jobs. They sometimes have to get training in such areas. It is hard to get back into a bank, for example, but an ex-prisoner could perhaps get a job in a fitness centre or as a beautician. All these things should be helped by this sort of legislation and I am delighted it is before the House.</P>
    <P>One issue is not mentioned in the Bill, although it is not excluded. That is the situation regarding &ldquo;lifers&rdquo;, those on life sentences, which, as the Minister of State is well aware, run to about 12 to 14 years, a very long time in prison. I sometimes wonder how many of the Judiciary have visited prisons; many more have done so now than would <Col N="129" />have done years ago. The Minister of State is well aware that law students are now brought on visits to prisons. That is an innovation which perhaps was not there when the Minister of State was in college. It is a very worthwhile innovation in that law students will now know exactly where prisoners are going. I would not like to spend even one night in prison. It would be far too long for me. It is not nearly as soft a treatment as it looks.</P>
    <P>The conditions in prisons have changed dramatically in recent years and this has been a major advantage for many of the people sent there. I remember when I first visited the former women's prison years ago. The thing that struck me was the appalling level of noise. There was clanging of gates all the time and people shrieking not because they were in pain or being tortured, but because they got involved in self harm because things were so bad. If one visits the women's prison now things are so much more constructive. Some of the best cooks in Ireland will probably come from that prison. They get cookery classes almost on a one to one basis. As the Minister of State noted, anything that would have people coming out changed for the better is worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Those serving life sentences should be judged on a one by one basis because it might be very important to allow some of them temporary or early release. After all, they are never free. Someone given a life sentence can always be called back to prison. I recognise that there have been occasions where people were released who had committed murder and then murdered again. Nothing is without risk in this life and I take that into consideration, but to give people a date to work towards is very important. Prisoners serving life sentences are not excluded in the Bill, so I do not know what exactly the thoughts of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the interim parole board and the possibility of putting it on a statutory basis. I would be glad to see that happen. I would have thought it possible that a board, rather than the Minister alone &ndash; being the one making the final decisions &ndash; might be in a position to make recommendations not because the Minister could do so in any worse or better way than the board, but because it will remove from that decision-making any notion of political influence. I wonder if it would be possible for the interim parole board to be made statutory and for it to undertake the function given under this Bill to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Along with Senator Walsh I am a little alarmed by section 1(2)(<i>c</i>)(i) and (ii) which allow for the possibility of prisoner release to &ldquo;ensure the good government of the prison concerned, or (ii) maintain good order in, and humane and just management of, the prison concerned&rdquo;. I would like some more explanation of that issue.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2)(i) states that the Minister can take into consideration &ldquo;the risk of the person committing an offence during any period of tempor<Col N="130" />ary release&rdquo;. That could be unconstitutional. It was a problem we encountered regarding bail. One could not take into account the fact that a person might have committed a crime while out on bail. The Minister of State would know more about this than I would &ndash; he is already shaking his head. He obviously has an answer to this, but this matter might have been looked at more carefully. I am not setting myself up as a constitutional lawyer. I always say to doctors that I am fed up getting medical advice from the legal profession, so I will try to refrain from giving legal advice to the legal profession.</P>
    <P>I wonder if applications for the release of prisoners could be made by a broader group of people. Section 2(2)(<i>h</i>)(iv) of the Bill refers to &ldquo;any other person whom the Minister considers would be of assistance in enabling him to make a decision as to whether to give a direction under subsection (1) that relates to the person concerned.&rdquo; It strikes me that under the terms of the Bill, unless a prisoner has an advocate in court or in prison it may become difficult for him or her to be considered for release. I wonder if there is any way in which applications could be invited, perhaps even from members of the public who know the person and who might write to say that the person was not so bad, or looked after the children and so on. In that way the people with the best advocates might not necessarily get the most preferential treatment, a state of affairs which occurs so often in this life, as Members are aware. Those who can pay for the best advice are the most likely to do best in the long run.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a big step forward and I am delighted it is before the House. Senator Terry's proposed amendment should be taken into account. It is a very serious matter if a victim encounters the perpetrator of a serious crime against that person coming down the road. Notification of the release would be a big help to the victim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the Bill but would also like to raise some concerns with it. I know that the Labour Party tabled a number of amendments on foot of which the Minister made amendments. I welcome the fact that the Government took on board some of the points that the Labour Party and my colleague, Deputy Costello, made when the Bill was going through the various Stages in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill deals with just one issue. Much legislation currently being introduced by the Government involves almost entire Bills being introduced by way of amendments. That is the wrong approach. Different issues should be dealt with appropriately in separate Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this Bill is the case mentioned by the Minister of State. I do not entirely agree with Senator Henry's statement that it introduces all the elements she would like to see, because it does not. It deals with the status quo, the position as it is without the legislation, and it <Col N="131" />is establishing a statutory basis for it. In part it is designed to bring back the element of discretion for the Minister to refuse release to certain prisoners for various reasons. I urge the Minister to be cautious in this regard and not to discriminate against prisoners on the basis of the crime. I know that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been very critical of the media, its role in society and the way in which it can single out people. Very often the media can make pariahs of prisoners because of their crimes. Political pressure can then be applied, which is not necessarily based on the sound reasoning, that the prisoner should not be released. It is very important that there are general principles that are generally applied in terms of temporary release. As the Minister of State noted, these should be open and transparent.</P>
    <P>I wanted to raise an issue with reference to the caution I expressed in relation to what Senator Henry said. There is a need for a Bill to deal with the whole sentencing area. Senator Henry mentioned that, for example, a broader group of people should be able to make a case for the release of a prisoner. A more holistic approach to the sentencing of prisoners is needed. The ultimate goal should be that the prisoner will not re-offend.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum recommended, in its report, a legislative basis for a more holistic approach to include such things as a sentence management plan, etc. We must have a more multifaceted approach to dealing with prisoners than currently exists. Sentencing should involve all stakeholders to ensure that when a prisoner is released, the local authorities become involved to deal with such issues as social welfare and housing. That is merely a summary of what was recommended by the National Economic and Social Forum. It is the type of legislation needed to bring about the kind of approach mentioned by Senator Henry.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of putting parole boards on a statutory basis. I note that the Minister mentioned the issue was under review and that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, during the Report Stage debate in the Dáil was much more specific in saying that legislation in that regard would come before us within 12 to 16 months.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points made regarding the importance of victims. I understand the Labour Party tabled an amendment to this legislation in that regard during its passage through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We need to examine the reason we rely so much on imprisonment in regard to small matters. Temporary release of prisoners leads to issues of more resources for the Garda, community policing and investment in communities. We must look at ways of preventing prisoners from re-offending, or from offending in the first instance. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and <Col N="132" />this amending legislation, the purpose of which is to amend the Criminal Justice Act 1960 to enable the Minister of the day to be more transparent in his judgments when granting temporary releases. We now know this came about following the Corish judgment in 2000 when it was deemed the Minister did not have the power to refuse to consider to grant temporary releases in certain situations. That obviously highlighted the shortcomings of the law as it existed. It is important &ndash; this point has been made by a number of speakers &ndash; when considering this legislation that we try to achieve a decent balance. Senator Terry made reference to the victims involved. We must also consider the person who has been incarcerated. We have an overriding obligation to the public at large to ensure that when making decisions about temporary releases we are mindful of the person's readiness to rejoin society.</P>
      <P>Apart from looking forward to having visitors, the next best thing a prisoner has to look forward to is the time when he or she will be considered for parole or temporary release. I am sure governors and prison officers are very conscious of that. I am certain they use the carrot of temporary release as a means of keeping order within the prisons. I assume that a person causing trouble within a prison would be disqualified from consideration for temporary release. We have to assume in that context that if the person causes trouble in prison, he or she will do the same upon release.</P>
      <P>There are two forms of release. The first relates to temporary release to attend a funeral, a christening or birth and so on and the second relates to an individual who has been incarcerated for up to ten or 20 years. There are much more serious consequences to be taken into account in the case of the latter. Will the Minister of State say if there is a type of education system in place to assist those released from prison to cope with the outside world? For example, a person currently serving a sentence of ten or 14 years will be faced with a currency change upon release. Are prisoners sent to places such as PACE in Santry for upskilling and re-integration into society? Do we resource such places sufficiently and should we look at providing them with greater access to resources to assist them in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of money is spent on the running of prisons. Our system is, by and large, a decent one. We have all seen on our televisions how people incarcerated in South America or Iraq are treated. That was something to behold. While there will always be shortcomings in our system, it is good. We need to examine our therapeutic, psychological and psychiatric services. More important is the treatment we provide for recurring drug offenders. I recently read an article relating to a situation in Portlaoise which, if true, is an indictment of us. The article stated there were two prisons and a psychiatric hospital in Portlaoise. A prisoner in Portlaoise has to travel with three prison officers to the mental institution in Dundrum to undergo psychiatric assessment. <Col N="133" />The reason given is that he or she does not come under the Midland Health Board area because they are not resident in Portlaoise. That is duplication at its worst and we must examine it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State say if statistics relating to re-offending have improved? We have had different levels of discussion in the past on how often prisoners re-offend. Has the situation improved? The type of crime being committed nowadays is more callous and vicious than ever before. This is blamed on the availability of drugs and the amounts of alcohol being consumed. If we in this House, as a result of legislation introduced, do nothing else in terms of justice, equality and law reform than to allow people to sleep easier in their beds or go out at night without fear of being mugged, then we will have done a good job. We have, during the last year, dealt with legislation on public order, illicit trafficking at sea and drug barons on land. All those issues are related and I am hopeful that during the next couple of years we will see a considerable improvement in our quality of life. I will be disappointed if that does not happen as a result of the various legislation we have introduced.</P>
    <P>Decisions taken by Government in recent times in terms of its commitment to the building of more prison places and the modernisation of current prisons has made things easier for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform when dealing with temporary release matters. He no longer has to consider the revolving door issue. He can make a more balanced judgment on who should be temporarily released. The easy thing to do would be, as the Minister of State said, to make no judgment at all. One could take the easy way out and grant pre-release to those who present no risk to society. However, to coin the Minister of State's words, we would be talking about an inhumane prison regime and that is not the answer.</P>
    <P>I commend the great work done in prisons by governors, prison officers and probation and welfare officers. I hope they are provided with sufficient resources to carry out their work efficiently and effectively. I welcome the Bill and look forward to its enactment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the legislation and I congratulate the Minister of State on the way in which he has brought the legislation forward. While we are not engaged in a wide-reaching review of the Prison Service, I would like the benchmark to be set a little higher than in Colombia or Iraq. Aspects of the Prison Service, which are not a reflection on the people working in it, need to be examined, including resourcing and the suitability of buildings and surroundings and so on. However, it is important to recognise the rehabilitative nature of imprisonment. Prisons are not simply places in which to lock people up. All of us live in the hope of amendment and restoration at the end of the day. It is important, in the circumstances, that prisoners have hope. The worse thing that could be done in terms of run<Col N="134" />ning prisons is to leave people without hope of amelioration. That is an important part of the discipline of the system.</P>
      <P>Implementing temporary release under a set of criteria on a statutory basis is welcome. The Minister of State or his successor could face a judicial review but that will help to develop a set of criteria for dealing with these issues. There is a strong argument for ensuring that prisoners in the second half of a long sentence, in particular, are helped in preparation for release. However, even for people in the early part of a sentence, &ldquo;hope deferred maketh the heart sick.&rdquo; Liberty is taken from prisoners under the law and nothing else. They are members of families, which suffer as a consequence, and children who have lost a parent through imprisonment should be helped. That is an important humanitarian reason for the exercise of discretion in these matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy referred to the classification of prisoners and this must be applied objectively, whether we like what people have done or whether they are fashionable or whether they engaged in white collar or other forms of crime. Reasonable judgments can be made on the criteria set out in the legislation such as being a danger to the community and the likelihood of re-offending. There should be no sense in which a prisoner should not be released if people dislike his or her politics. It is proper that when people are on temporary release, a condition should be built in that they do not engage in political activity.</P>
      <P>Equally, if people are imprisoned for sexual offences, they should not be locked up forever but the terms of their release should make it clear where they can go in order that children are safeguarded. As the Minister of State said, no regime is without risk but it is important to minimise the risk. There is a great deal to be said for putting more resources into the preparation of prisoners for release, as Senator Kett stated, so that they see it as part of a process, particularly if it can be linked to restorative justice if the victims and others want it.</P>
      <P>My reservations regarding the legislation centre on the victims. I had experience of a case in which a man was murdered and his murderer was quite properly released. However, his extended family was shocked at the release. Their rough and ready notion of justice was that the murderer should have remained in prison and that is particularly the case in small, closed communities in country areas where the victim and murderer often live cheek by jowl. Where possible, the victims should be informed about the release of the offender, particularly if they live in the same area and are likely to bump into each other. A veto on releasing an offender should not be provided but, nevertheless, victims should be informed and help should be provided to allow them to deal with the issues that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a forward looking and humane provision and the Minister of State will bear in mind the contributions of Members when <Col N="135" />implementing it. I support the legislation and wish the Minister of State well.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. This is interesting legislation as it strikes a chord with people in terms of how they feel about the justice system, offenders and the effort to ensure they do not enter prison to emerge as more committed criminals. The optimum benefit towards which one should work is that the person who is imprisoned should go through a restorative process so that when he or she emerges, he or she can make a meaningful contribution to society. That sounds lofty, particularly when one must consider how it can be ensured that a prisoner spends time in prison without hardening his or her criminal inclinations.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes referred to rough and ready justice. It is correct in many cases that an individual commits a crime and is sent to prison, getting what he or she deserves, particularly given the distress caused to victims. The notion that the person who commits a crime must serve his or her time is the yardstick for rough and ready justice. It is correct that he or she should get his or her due deserts in a non-beneficial way. However, at the same time, we are members of society and depend on one another in terms of displaying good conduct, developing good relationships and bettering the lives of others. It may sound like Mary Poppins stuff, but this Bill is concerned with temporary releases.</P>
      <P>We need to assess why provision needs to be made for temporary releases. As the Minister of State said, we have moved on from the time when the revolving door syndrome was a common feature of the justice system. We have better prisons, thankfully, as well as more prison spaces. The revolving door syndrome has been eliminated. Why, therefore, should there be temporary releases? They are needed so that people can become acclimatised and accustomed to society once more. Prisoners might need to be released temporarily to undergo a training regime that is suited to their abilities and that may give them better employment opportunities when they are released.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the notion of temporary release on humanitarian grounds. I have found all Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be most approachable in that regard since I became involved in public life. All Ministers, of whatever political party, have been most ready to accede to requests put forward when there is a genuine humanitarian aspect to the case, such as a death, severe illness or severe trauma in the family of a prisoner. That has always been the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wider picture in this regard needs to be considered. What is to become of a prisoner when he or she is released? There is a clear role for structured temporary releases with a particular purpose. Society will decide whether a prisoner <Col N="136" />should be moved to a more open type of prison where strictures and confinements are of a less excessive nature. The question of how well prisoners may accustom themselves in such an environment will be considered, bearing in mind how they are performing in terms of job opportunities or training.</P>
    <P>One often hears of infamous prisoners who have been in training units for a year or two ahead of their planned release. We are familiar with the case of a particular prisoner who excited great interest in the media when he was released in recent years. Such cases tend to be seen in black and white. People ask why he or she &ndash; it is usually a &ldquo;he&rdquo;, but it is a politically correct world so I will say &ldquo;he or she&rdquo;&ndash; should be released when he or she has committed such a heinous crime. The details of crimes are often retold in graphic language so that their horror is revealed to everybody once more. One may not have heard of the crime when it took place, or one's memory of it may have become dimmer as the years passed. The newspapers may remind the public of the details of the crime in graphic terms, with photographs, etc.</P>
    <P>The rough and ready aspects of the matter are considered by people who ask why the perpetrator of a crime should be allowed to avail of a training unit, receive job opportunities or attend a more open prison. Such provisions are inherent in the Bill before the House &ndash; that is life. We have to equate the steps we take as a society with the purpose of releasing a prisoner so that he or she can avail of certain opportunities. The purpose of the provisions we are putting in place is to ensure that prisoners are better able to reclaim a place in society when they leave prison. The person being released should be helped to form new relationships, for example, or to restart old relationships if they existed. It is important that they are able to accustom themselves to life on the outside. The days of heavy gates being opened and a blinking prisoner saying &ldquo;this is the first time I have been on the outside for 20 years&rdquo; are gone. Such scenes are found only in films and are not in line with the way life works.</P>
    <P>The belief that &ldquo;the quality of mercy is not strain'd&rdquo;&ndash; that it has to be for everybody &ndash; has been expressed by all Senators who have contributed to this debate. While the biblical tradition refers to &ldquo;an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&rdquo;, it is not a suitable model of justice for a modern society. Nobody believes that justice should be invoked for such a purpose. I strongly agree with this Bill, which places on a formal footing the existing views of the prisoner regime of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its Ministers. We are part of the society that used to assess what went wrong in a person's life to cause him or her to commit a crime. It was often the case that such a person's upbringing or background did not give him or her a chance in life. As I said at the start of my contri<Col N="137" />bution, I am glad to be able to speak about this interesting Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this informative and constructive debate. Before I deal with the specific points raised by speakers, I should reiterate that the main purpose of the Bill is to provide a clear legislative basis for the granting of temporary releases. The legislative device in question, therefore, is the amendment of section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960. This Bill lays out in much greater detail the criteria which govern the exercise of ministerial powers in this area. It is important to commence by stating that temporary release is not a right, but a privilege. This is a fundamental point of departure when considering this issue.</P>
      <P>I would like to respond to Senator Henry, who pointed out that this legislation expressly permits the Minister to take into account the risk of a person committing an offence during any period of temporary release. In the context of bail, however, one is dealing with a person who has not been convicted of an offence. A person who has been charged with an offence can seek bail. Before the amendment to the Constitution was approved by the people in 1996, courts were not permitted to take into account the risk of re-offending in the context of bail because the accused person had not been convicted at that stage. This Bill relates to a person who has been convicted and sentenced, however. The Minister is entitled under this Bill &ndash; the Oireachtas is entitled to legislate in this way &ndash; to take into account the risk of offending, which is a very material matter in the consideration of issues of this type.</P>
      <P>The Senator's query is well made, however, as it illustrates the nature of temporary release. As I said, temporary release is a privilege that the Executive is permitted to grant to an individual who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, but it is not a right for the prisoner. It cannot be a right, as the courts have laid down a definitive sentence. Experience of the administration of the prison system teaches us that temporary release arrangements are necessary for the humane administration of a prison. The arrangements do not relate only to humanitarian matters, in respect of which they have always been available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Houses have legislated that temporary release is not available in certain circumstances. Senator Jim Walsh seems to have a misapprehension in that regard. Certain legislative provisions exclude the possibility of temporary release, for example, in the context of a life sentence, a person who has been convicted of a serious drug trafficking offence and who has been sentenced for a period in excess of ten years or a person who is facing parallel charges. The Oireachtas has provided that temporary release should not be avail<Col N="138" />able in such instances, but humanitarian release is permissible.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons that temporary release may be necessary. I reassure Senator O'Rourke, who engaged in a general reflection on the penal system, that the concept of structured release is very much part of the Government's thinking in respect of temporary release. Most of those connected with the administration of prisons have advised us that temporary release is one of the key elements of rehabilitating the offender and preventing re-offence. Issues such as the structuring of the release stage, the discussions that take place and the placement of the prisoner after his or her release are absolutely crucial in the context of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the focus the Seanad has given to rehabilitation today as it is one of the key areas we have to examine. It is often the case that a prisoner emerges from a prison in a state of total disorientation from the wider community. His or her accommodation and employment arrangements may be uncertain. The very trap that we want to avoid &ndash; the risk of re-offending and going back to one's old ways &ndash; can often be created.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry raised a question that was central to the contributions of many speakers. She spoke of the need for victims to be protected in relation to this exercise of powers. An amendment was accepted by the Government on Committee Stage in the Dáil and I await with interest the proposal which I understand Senator Terry is formulating. I understand that she is proposing that a victim must be notified when an offender is out on temporary release. I assure Senators that the Minister is conscious of the plight of victims and of the devastating consequences of some offences.</P>
    <P>The current practice is that the Prison Service does not automatically inform all victims of such temporary releases. There are many sound reasons for this. Experience has shown that many victims of crime do not want to receive such information as it only brings back the hurt and pain they have experienced. However, a victim may ask the Prison Service, through the prison victim liaison officer, to be notified if an offender is to be given temporary release and such a request will be met. That is the current practice. In addition, the Prison Service will, if requested by the victim of a serious sexual or violent offence, notify the Garda prior to the release of the perpetrator from prison, either on temporary release or at the end of their sentence. Where the concerns of a victim or their family have been made known to the Minister, the Prison Service or the parole board, conditions may be imposed on the grant of temporary release if such temporary release is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>The amendment moved in the Dáil, which I outlined earlier to Senators, deals with the considerations the Minister must take into account in deciding whether to grant temporary release. The <Col N="139" />section has been amended to include a reference to the potential threat to the safety or security of the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served relates as a further consideration. Senators may wish to develop further ideas on this matter on Committee Stage and I will examine them with interest.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry struck a slightly contentious note in relation to the Minister's position. This legislation was formulated when Deputy O'Donoghue was Minister. It was he who brought this matter to the Government, in the form of heads of a Bill, for approval. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, has had a remote enough connection with this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell is the Minister, but the Bill was piloted through the other House by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and me and it seems fated to be piloted through this House by me.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion by Senator Terry that a grave abuse of ministerial power had been uncovered by the courts. However, in the Corish judgment &ndash; the decision of Mr. Justice O'Neill, to which Senator Terry, very fairly, referred &ndash; which was delivered on 13 January 2000, the Minister and the Department were faulted on a very technical point. The point at issue was that the Minister had drawn up regulations to exercise his powers under the 1960 Act and had expressly excluded certain offences. He had said he would never consider temporary release for certain offences. That is a reasonable step for a Minister to take but the view of the High Court was that the 1960 legislation, the parent Act, did not empower the Minister to impose that type of restriction by regulation and, hence, the regulation was invalid.</P>
      <P>Lawyers can be lawyers and jurists can make points and I do not question the correctness of that judgment. However, it is a technical point of statutory draftsmanship to fault the Minister for regulations drawn up on that basis where, clearly, successive Ministers of many different political colours acted in good faith in administering this system and did so for the protection of the public. The High Court was telling us &ndash; it is a fair point &ndash; that we should have dealt with this matter in primary legislation and that it was not an appropriate matter to be regulated in detail by ministerial regulation. Most speakers accepted that point today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Terry referred to an interesting Supreme Court decision on the general situation of statutory instruments. There are a number of court decisions which may have far reaching <Col N="140" />implications for the validity of our current collection of statutory instruments. However, that matter does not arise in this context.</P>
    <P>The courts have always served as watchdogs of the Oireachtas and we must have this dialogue with the courts as we hammer out the detail of this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to deal with that question and I am glad the Senator reminded me of it. It is my understanding that the State has never been exposed in damages from a person who objected to the temporary release of an individual. There has been no liability there and no clause in this Bill seeks to exonerate the State from any such liability. In any event, the State would not accept liability in such a remote contingency. The fact that I have reassured the House that there is not an exoneration clause in the Bill should not be taken as an indication that there is any liability on the part of the State in such circumstances in the first place.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh said there was a clear onus on the State to assist in the rehabilitation of offenders and I agree with him. He was concerned with the provision in the Bill relating to the government of prisons and to the fact that the Minister has retained power, under paragraph 1(1)(<i>c</i>), to grant temporary release to ensure the good government of a prison or to maintain good order in, or the humane and just management of a prison. As many Senators acknowledged, the problem of the revolving door in the penal system is no longer with us. Nevertheless, the Minister has retained this power should it be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many situations can develop in the administration of the prison system. A fire or a large scale riot could cause an entire prison to be destroyed and in those circumstances the Minister could not be expected to construct another prison in 24 hours, or in 24 months. Senator Tuffy has considerable experience of the reaction of the public when one seeks to establish a penal institution in a particular locality. The Minister must have this reserved power. In the past, temporary release was granted on the basis that there was overcrowding resulting from court decisions and releases were granted in an unstructured way. That is a feature of the past, due to the provision of additional places. Although the current system does not give rise to such requirement it would be short sighted not to provide, in primary legis<Col N="141" />lation governing temporary releases, for such circumstances in the future in case events were to occur, even if short term in character, which would require such a provision. Senator Walsh's point was a fair one but the Minister would maintain that he needs this power.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh was under the misapprehension that there are no categories which could not be considered for temporary release. Under paragraph 1(3)(<i>b</i>) the Minister may not give a direction granting temporary release where the release of that person from prison is prohibited by or under any enactment. The Oireachtas has provided for that prohibition in certain enactments.</P>
    <P>All Senators stressed the importance of rehabilitation. As Senator Tuffy pointed out, the Bill is only a legislative basis for temporary release. It provides the bones necessary for the purpose, but the flesh must be provided for in a range of educational facilities, rehabilitation and work training programmes.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that temporary release can form an integral part of a mechanism to prepare prisoners for eventual release back into society in a planned manner which will assist and encourage them to take up more positive and law-abiding lives and ensure they are not a risk to society.</P>
    <P>Pre-release preparation can include transfer to a less secure institution or an open prison, supervised outings, unsupervised outings, opportunities to attend work experience or training and residential treatment for alcohol or drug addiction. In addition, the Prison Service provides a wide range of rehabilitative programmes which provide prisoners with the opportunity to engage in useful and purposeful activity while serving their sentences and serve as an incentive for them to lead non-offending lives on release. In addition, most offenders will have had contact with the probation and welfare officers, the prison education service and other services within the prison to facilitate preparation for their return to the community.</P>
    <P>Voluntary after-care support is offered to all prisoners after their release through the probation and welfare service. Released offenders are encouraged and facilitated to link up with community based agencies dealing with educational and vocational training, alternative accommodation, job placement and substance abuse treatment. Many of these services are provided by voluntary bodies and community groups. Some operate under the aegis of the probation and welfare service and others accept referrals of offenders who are supported financially in their work by the Department through the probation and welfare service. The national development plan will also, through prison work programmes such as the Connect project, make a significant contribution to preparing offenders for employment. In addition, the Linkage programme advances employment placements.</P>
    <P>The Prison Service plans to establish halfway house type units near Cork and Limerick prisons <Col N="142" />for both men and women. I am not sure if I should be announcing this in the House this afternoon but that is the intention of the Prison Service.</P>
    <P>The Dóchas centre in Mountjoy women's prison already has a pre-release unit which accommodates up to seven prisoners who are generally nearing the end of medium-term to long-term sentences and are actively engaged in rehabilitative programmes such as education and work training.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke of the tremendous work being done by the Prison Service and I very much appreciated her contribution in that respect. Anybody who visits the Dóchas prison, where many of the State's female offenders are now held, will be very impressed by its facilities. As Senator O'Rourke pointed out, female offenders are not really as difficult to deal with as male offenders, but the facilities that have been put at the disposal of female offenders in the Dóchas prison serve as a tremendous tribute to the work of the prison staff.</P>
    <P>One point of Senator Henry's with which I disagree is that the Minister should be distanced from the issues regarding the parole board and the temporary release of prisoners. She questioned if decisions in this respect should be political in character. I know that politics in general is in bad odour at present, as are some parties. We give Ministers powers because they are accountable to Dáil Éireann but when we give boards important legal powers in areas touching upon the liberty of the citizen, we are giving powers to people who are not accountable to anybody. They produce a glossy annual report which we receive in our correspondence. Ultimately, Ministers can be called to account if they make an unsuitable temporary release. It is a very serious power for a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and one to be exercised with great care. Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are reminded only too often by their officials of the perils of exercising the power of temporary release. I am not sure if it is a bad thing that the Minister should have some final say in the exercise of such a power.</P>
    <P>On the question of educational facilities for prisoners, I am glad to inform the House that I, as Minister of State with responsibility for children, took a very close interest in the refurbishment of St. Patrick's Institution by the Prison Service, which is now complete. Many expressed concern when it was stated that the original purpose of this facility was to detain persons under 16 years of age. This was the original Government decision on the matter prior to the last general election. I am sure most Senators would agree that it is good that it changed its mind and that the facilities will now be put at the disposal of 16 and 17 year old offenders. I have sanctioned the engagement of a number of teachers for these offenders so we can at least start mirroring the proposal in the Children Act that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should establish dedicated facilities for offenders in this <Col N="143" />age group. We are still some way from this, but at least we now have an entire wing of St. Patrick's Institution, with a high educational emphasis, which will be dedicated to 16 and 17 year old offenders. This is an innovation in our penal system and I am very glad to be part of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes also raised the issue of the rehabilitation of offenders and the question of restorative justice. It is true that we need to engage in further development of restorative justice in our criminal justice system, as provided for in the Children Act.</P>
    <P>The Garda diversion scheme, which seeks to deal with those juvenile offenders who have not yet come before the courts but who are starting to offend, has been very successful. It has built on the old juvenile liaison scheme and has incorporated thinking on restorative justice. Many training sessions have taken place with the staff of the juvenile diversion scheme on restorative justice techniques.</P>
    <P>The restorative justice idea originated in New Zealand, where the Maoris used it in the settlement of their tribal differences. The idea is that the offender should be confronted by the victim. It is most appropriate in respect of juvenile offending and it is being extended in this area. I know the Garda has been extending it in its work on juvenile justice. Senator Hayes is correct in stating that we should examine restorative justice on a wider basis in the penal system.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett asked about reoffending. The Department does not have exact statistics on this but it is examining a project to establish with greater certitude the record of the penal system.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not always the most popular Department. It has a very difficult job to do in this area because, generally, those who are sentenced to prison are those in whom other Departments do not have a huge interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann resolves that payment of the remaining phases of benchmarking be suspended pending the implementation of a serious reform package which would yield improvements in the quality of services delivered to the public commensurate with the extra cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In just over three months, the Minister for Finance will arrange for the payment of the next instalment of the benchmarking award. The instalment was initially estimated to cost approxi<Col N="144" />mately &euro;500 million, but figures obtained by way of parliamentary question by the Fine Gael Party leader, Deputy Kenny, indicate that it will cost considerably more, approximately &euro;650 million. Huge as this payment will be, it forms only a small part of the overall package. The full cost of benchmarking will be a massive &euro;1.2 billion each year because it is a recurring cost.</P>
    <P>There is much to commend the concept of benchmarking. It is based on the principle of a <i>quid pro quo,</i> or a deal that in return for a substantial increase in pay for public servants, there would be a substantial increase in productivity by each of the sectors to benefit, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of public services and greater public service efficiency. However, there was no <i>quid pro quo</i> for this deal and no productivity arrangement was agreed. For example, there was no attempt to negotiate with individual unions or sectoral groups clearly defined objective or targets, where existing work practices would be critically examined and agreement reached as to how, in return for a generous wage increase, the public would benefit from better services and greater productivity and efficiency. The whole exorcise undertaken by the Government simply involved additional increases for teachers, gardaí, prison officers and civil servants with nothing secured in return.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate the Fine Gael position on this issue. The concept of benchmarking is sound, but the Government's management of it is deeply flawed. It is a bad deal for citizens and taxpayers. The cost is too high and the return is negligible. We do not call for the abandonment of the agreement but for the deferment of the payment of the next instalment until such time as detailed negotiations take place that will deliver genuine and measurable public sector and public service reforms and improvements. We want to see value for the money that is to be spent.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently attempted to defend the Government's benchmarking agreement in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> He may as well have stood on a butter box on the corner of St. Stephen's Green with a megaphone shouting, &ldquo;money for old rope&rdquo;. The former president of the ICTU said some time ago that the agreement was the equivalent to withdrawing money from an ATM. The Minister's attempted defence has only served to underline the correctness of Fine Gael's position on the issue.</P>
    <P>In his attempt to justify the deal, the Minister enumerated so-called reforms being, or to be, delivered by benchmarking. He linked benchmarking to the achievement of industrial peace within the public service. It has nothing to do with industrial peace, but is based on the concept of measurably improved productivity. Industrial peace forms part of the national wage or partnership agreements. The industrial relations peace of the last 15 or 16 years, which we all acknowledge to be a cornerstone of our economic recovery and success, was built into a succession of partnership <Col N="145" />agreements, starting with the rogramme for National Recovery and agreed in subsequent programmes, such as the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Government's conclusion of another, short-term partnership agreement with the unions. Industrial peace is an integral part of it, as it was with its predecessors. To suggest, therefore, that industrial peace in the public service is part and parcel of the benchmarking award is to suggest it must be paid for twice, once through benchmarking and once through a 7% pay increase across the board.</P>
    <P>In the same article the Minister justifies benchmarking because it will lead to improvements in promotional arrangements in the Civil Service with, in his own words, &ldquo;greater emphasis on merit&rdquo;. This is illuminating because the Minister is implying that the existing system of promotion within the Civil Service is not based on merit or ability. It also suggests that the Minister considers he must pay civil servants to get their agreement to achieve a &ldquo;greater emphasis on merit.&rdquo; A real benchmarking process would reward those who perform well and deliver better services, whether as individuals or as part of teams. It should not, as it is doing at present, prop up a promotion system which is based not on merit but on seniority.</P>
    <P>In his third justification of benchmarking, the Minister cites the example of teachers agreeing to hold half of parent-teacher meetings outside school hours. Has he a bad memory? Does he not recall that the Programme for Competitiveness and Work contained a clear commitment to achieve this? Does his argument mean that taxpayers again have to pay twice for this concession? If the Government believes that its so-called reforms are worth &euro;1.2 billion of taxpayers' money each year for the foreseeable future, it is high time that someone called &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In case anyone believes that Fine Gael's demand on 16 September for the suspension of the payment of benchmarking awards was an attempt to make controversial banner headlines during the autumn before either House resumed, I remind Members that on 1 July 2002 when the benchmarking report was released, we warned that the key to benchmarking was securing a value for money deal. We pointed out at the time that the cost of the deal was the equivalent of putting 2% onto the tax rate. We emphasised that the Government owed it to taxpayers and the public generally to ensure that the &euro;1.2 billion was accompanied by real, tangible and visible improvements in productivity and services.</P>
    <P>We highlighted the fact at that stage that the public was entitled to know exactly what it was getting in return for a recurring &euro;1.2 billion payout. We queried, without receiving a satisfactory answer, the reason the Government had failed to make public the analysis of the benchmarking body, pointing out that, in the absence of publication, it was extremely difficult and almost impossible for anyone to conduct an evaluation of the benefits and improvements that were sup<Col N="146" />posed to have been secured. We were left in a state of limbo waiting for the Government to publish the vital supporting material to justify to taxpayers the huge cost of the deal. We have made repeated calls in the interim but to no avail. I reiterate those calls in this debate &ndash; so much for Government accountability.</P>
    <P>The first phase of benchmarking has cost taxpayers &euro;600 million. This has had to be found somewhere and has been achieved by way of cutbacks. The surgical knife was used. These cutbacks have led to a queue of ambulances outside hospitals as they wait to retrieve their stretchers because there are not enough trolleys inside the hospitals to accommodate patients in the corridors or in the accident and emergency ward. These cutbacks have led to ward closures, to primary school children continuing to be condemned to sit daily in sub-standard, Dickensian hovels of primary schools, and a shortfall in revenue for the vocational education opportunities scheme which means that women hoping to re-enter the workforce cannot avail of the scheme because the child care allowance cannot be paid. I could continue to list areas that badly need services but where, unfortunately, cutbacks are the order of the day because &euro;1.2 billion must be found to pay the benchmarking deal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has already admitted that the opening Exchequer position for 2004 will be disastrous. We are talking about a &euro;4 billion deficit. Those who depend on public services will be the main casualties if a further &euro;650 million benchmarking instalment is paid in 2004. There is nothing wrong with the benchmarking process but, in the hands of the Government, it has become a gross parody of itself. I rest my case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan" hpid="Mr. J. Phelan Mr. J. Phelan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to formally second the motion. The Fine Gael position, as clearly outlined by my colleague, is focused solely on securing value for money in public services. The Government has clearly failed to secure through the benchmarking process a reform agenda in the public services.</P>
      <P>I read the budget speech last year of the Minister for Finance in which he outlined his view and vision on benchmarking. He said the key was that real change had to be brought about. It is obvious from what we have seen of benchmarking that it will not happen. Everyone knows that a deal has two sides, and there is an old saying that he who pays the piper calls the tune. What is the tune we are asking the piper to play? It is clear that the benchmarking deal was negotiated behind closed doors and that no clear discernible benefits or improvements in public services or value for money will arise from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure of &euro;1.2 billion is cited as the total payout for benchmarking when it comes on stream. That is twice the figure paid out by the Department of Agriculture and Food, twice the annual expenditure of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and three quarters the annual expenditure of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="147" />Reform. The Garda Síochána, Prison Service and courts system are run on &euro;1.6 billion annually.</P>
    <P>The full cost of benchmarking for each year after it is fully implemented will be &euro;1.2 billion and we will see no real benefits for that money. If the benchmarking payments for the Garda were not met, an extra 1,200 gardaí could be provided. The Government could go a long way towards fulfilling one of the promises it made in the previous general election and has since broken.</P>
    <P>As a result of benchmarking, local authorities will face a bill of about &euro;165 million. In Kilkenny, for example, this will mean a bill of &euro;3 million to &euro;4 million for the local authority. Why are local authorities being asked to meet benchmarking payments? The local authority in Kilkenny, among others, has been charged with drawing up a new list of development charges. Some authorities speak of development charges of up to &euro;10,000 per unit. Last year the Government abolished the first-time buyer's grant. It is now effectively introducing a first-time buyer's tax by stealth in all local authority areas.</P>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy Allen, has established that the figure of &euro;125 is the amount of money every residence in the country will have to pay to meet the &euro;1.2 billion cost of the full implementation of benchmarking. The special savings incentive scheme, which many regard as controversial, costs &euro;550 million annually whereas benchmarking will cost &euro;1.2 billion. It must also be borne in mind that, according to Government estimates, we could afford to pay for an underground in Dublin within three years if the &euro;1.2 billion for benchmarking were not spent.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by my colleague, Senator Higgins, Fine Gael is not opposed to benchmarking. The principle of real and discernible improvements in public services is a good one and something we all desire and need. To date, we have not seen visible or concrete improvements in public services. In the budget for 2003, the Minister for Finance increased the pay related elements by 12% while increasing the non-pay elements by only 1%.</P>
    <P>As Senator Higgins previously outlined, we are facing into a deficit of &euro;4 billion based on current figures. It could be much more or perhaps less by the time the Minister announces his budget. These figures do not include the benchmarking tranche due next year. It is astonishing to find ourselves in this position of facing a &euro;4 billion deficit when we had a &euro;5 billion surplus a few years ago. This is the crucial factor. Can the country afford this deal as it stands? Fine Gael does not propose that benchmarking be abandoned but that it be re-negotiated. That would be the right course to take.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking was devised in secret and has been largely kept secret until now. We have not been given clear indications of real improvements that will take place in the public services. It is timely to have this debate before the Book of Estimates is published and the budget is <Col N="148" />announced towards the end of the year. We find ourselves in a position in which serious choices have to be made. In recent years, the Minister for Finance has proven himself to be a good Minister in good times. He is now being asked to take some serious decisions for the first time.</P>
    <P>We must accept that changes have to be made. While it was possible, when benchmarking was being negotiated, to regard &euro;1.2 billion as insignificant in the context of a surplus of &euro;5 billion and to believe people would not notice the purpose for which it was being allocated, we are now facing tougher economic circumstances. Nobody on the Government side has outlined from where the money will come.</P>

      <P>Benchmarking has been agreed, is being implemented and is an integral part of the social partnership arrangements which have transformed the economy over the past 16 or 17 years. Needless to say, it will not be up-ended. Benchmarking is an alternative to traditional relativities which were not satisfactory from the perspective of industrial relations. It is, according to the PPF, a &ldquo;coherent and broadly based comparison with jobs and pay&rdquo; right across the economy and an integrated approach for the purposes of comparing work and reward.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the benchmarking award is contingent on four factors: Co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change; satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in section 26 of Sustaining Progress; maintenance of stable industrial relations; and, the absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement. The argument, therefore, that benchmarking has nothing to do with industrial peace is wrong. Figures I obtained from the Central Statistics Office show that in 2002 we had the greatest degree of industrial peace since 1970.</P>

      <P>In 2002 some 21,000 days were lost through industrial action which was the lowest figure in the past 32 years. The claim that the public is getting nothing in return for the benchmarking deal is not true. Verification groups have been set up and agreements relating to each sector have been made, for example, the standardisation of the school year has been agreed and the Revenue Commissioners have agreed to fully co-operate with the introduction of technology. The reduction of 5,000 in public service jobs announced by the Minister for Finance will not reduce services but will mean that the reduced number of public servants will have to do the work being undertaken at present by the public sector.</P>

      <P>The OECD was complimentary about the benchmarking process and urged wider use of it. It stated that the use of other market type instruments such as benchmarking and other choice schemes within the public sector is generally limited in Ireland. It also noted that benchmarking of Government agencies, which tend to be exempt from the pressures to perform more efficiently and effectively can be an effective means to exert such pressures in a constructive way. We need more benchmarking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to address IBEC on the issue of public service pay. Taking into account the increase in numbers last year, public service pay increased by 10%. While the following figures do not compare like with like with complete precision, figures from the CSO on average industrial earnings <Col N="150" />show they increased by 9.2% between June 2002 and June 2003. If one removes from the equation the number of additional numbers recruited in the public service last year, I calculate that average public sector pay, including benchmarking and general wage increases, rose by 6%. According to these figures, therefore, the notion that the public service is getting more than the private sector does not appear to have any basis.</P>
    <P>While I am aware that there has been criticism of the increase in public service numbers, the IMF and the OECD credited this increase as one factor, among others, which helped the economy to achieve a soft landing in 2001 and 2002. The IBEC position is not the same as that of the Fine Gael Party in that the former turned the coin on its head and argued that the award should not be paid unless the verification groups are satisfied that progress is being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his protection. Listening to the case in favour of the motion, I wished the proposers and those in the Fine Gael Party who dreamed it up had gone to the trouble of making a few telephone calls because it is based on false information and a complete lack of understanding of the benchmarking process. The consultants who produced the report sat down with every single union group in the public sector. They were formed into four groups &ndash; education, local authorities, health and Civil Service. Each group had to negotiate separate deals. They were then brought together and the deal was hammered out. It is not in any way general. A group of teachers asked me to put the following question to the Fine Gael Party: &ldquo;What more is it looking for? We have outlined exactly what we are going to do.&rdquo; That is just one group. I could do the same on behalf of others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What difference does this make? Up to seven times in the past year we have seen hundreds of <Col N="152" />thousands of public sector workers on the streets of Paris, Brussels and other European cities while Ireland has managed to achieve the best record for industrial relations peace of any country in Europe. Senator Mansergh referred to last year but it was not just that year. Last year was our best year but Ireland has been the best in Europe in this regard, with the exception of one year, for the past ten years. It has been a question of modernisation. The unions had to sit down with the Department of Finance and that Department brought to the side meetings personnel from the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and so forth. All of them were involved and all made their demands. The demands were hammered out during weeks of negotiations.</P>
    <P>This is all written down; there is nothing general about it. The deal has to be delivered step by step. To ensure it is delivered there is a quality assurance or verification group involving not just the unions and the Department but also interests such as parent groups, management groups in the education area and similar people in other areas. I do not have the time to go through the entire process but it is all on record. Much nonsense is spoken about the benchmarking process. I defy any of the proposers of this motion to explain what they know about the benchmarking process, apart from saying: &ldquo;We do not know; it is all behind closed doors.&rdquo; It is not. Every word presented by the union side in support of its claim is on the record, as is every word of the response to the union claim from the Department of Education and Science and the other Departments. The further response of the unions is on the record, as is the information compiled by independent consultants, by both sides and by the benchmarking body.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael wants to know why one group got 12% while another group got 11%. I do not know why the body made those decisions. It sat for months and listened to 100 days of presentations. It questioned every group and the people who ultimately made the decision were people who represented the different groups. They reached a conclusion. I do not know how they came to the conclusion, no more than I know how a judge listening to evidence finally comes to a conclusion. The body issued an explanatory statement and that was it.</P>
    <P>I listened to Judge Quirke, the chairman of the body. He was untouchable, clean, not subject to any pressure and did his job, as he said, as if he were sitting in the High Court. It is unacceptable to say that this happened behind closed doors. There was no deal involved. Look at the education sector. I can give an example of what has happened in Irish education over the last number of years. We have seen the introduction of science in the curriculum, information technology to every school, a full new curriculum, whole school inspection, new contracts for teachers and of social, personal and health education. I could mention more. No country in western Europe has <Col N="153" />managed to introduce, through negotiation, a new curriculum that has the support of teachers, parents, management and the political parties. That fact is on the record and it has been delivered. As proof of the pudding, the OECD in its latest report on education has shown that Irish schools are delivering.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to focus on schools but I only have seven minutes to speak. I could do the same with regard to the other areas. Whatever problems there are in other areas, it is not because of the people. Is somebody going to tell teachers, nurses, gardaí and so forth that they should not be paid? What about the pensioners who are now worried that they will not get their money? This threat to them is cruel.</P>
    <P>Relativities have been removed and we have moved the process forward. There is modernisation and we have the best industrial relations record of any public service in Europe. These things do not come easily. They are great prizes that anybody involved in public life should be seeking and should deliver. The fundamental issue demanded by this motion is that there be delivery. No money will be paid to any group if it does not measure up to and deliver on what it has promised. That is the view of the union side as well as the Government side.</P>
    <P>There have been hard arguments. Yes, we have knocked heads together, argued, called each other names and been offensive to each other over this. At 2 a.m., we finally shook hands on a deal that was not easily made. As the world knows, my back was lashed two years ago about it. Anybody with access to a microphone spoke of what a bad deal it was. That is now the attitude on the other side.</P>
    <P>A good benchmark of any deal is when neither side is happy. It means that people have had to make compromises. Somebody asked me if I was happy with the benchmarking deal. Of course I was not happy with it. Nobody is ever happy at the outcome of negotiations. The Minister for Finance was utterly unhappy at the time because he wanted to do other things. He had to make concessions, the unions had to make concessions and IBEC had to make concessions. At the end of the day one arrives at a deal, signs off on it in blood and delivers on it. One takes the public pain that goes with that. The benchmark of industrial relations in the Irish public service has been that people stick by their word and deliver on it.</P>
    <P>I will stand by the Minister if he comes to this House and says he will not pay a particular group because it was supposed to deliver something and did not do it. He will be right and he will have my support and the support of the union side. There will be no easy answers. There is pain for everybody in this but the prize is industrial peace and a better public service product, which is to the benefit of all the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment put forward by my colleague, Senator Mansergh. This issue was debated fully in the Lower House last week but I <Col N="154" />welcome the opportunity to outline the Government's position to Senators.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion asks the Government to break an agreement reached only last January with the social partners, with consequent effects on the continuation of Sustaining Progress and for the social partnership process that has served this country well since the late 1980s. I ask Senators to reflect on the consequences of such an action and on whether this would lead to industrial relations stability and an improvement in public services. What implications would it have for the partnership process? To do as suggested would lead to industrial relations disputes, undermine co-operation with the continuing changes in the public service and bring the social partnership process close to collapse.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion states we should re-negotiate the arrangement. What does this entail? Should the payment dates or the conditions attached to the payments be changed or both? What extra productivity should be required of public servants to receive the increase? If there are specific suggestions, I would be glad to hear them because in all the recent debate I have not heard specifics mentioned.</P>
      <P>There has been some confusion about the process of benchmarking. I will outline the background to the development of this process and the benefits that will come from it. Senators may recall that in the years prior to the establishment of the public service benchmarking body, the public service pay scene was very unsettled. They will recall a series of disputes, particularly the nurses' strike and the &ldquo;blue flu&rdquo;. The main cause of these disputes was rising wages in the private sector as the economy boomed and the labour market tightened. Unions wanted to catch up with the private sector as they felt the public service was being left behind. Without benchmarking, we would have faced a series of claims for increases.</P>
      <P>However, a large part of the cause also lay with the old pay determination system in the public service that was based on cross-sectoral relativities. This system had grown up because of the need to link groups for pay purposes in the public service to other groups because there was no obvious private sector comparator. The system became rigid and inflexible over the years. This meant it was difficult to deal with any one group when the employer had to take into account the knock-on effects on related groups. Even if an increase in pay was justified, perhaps by a change in work practices or new skills in one group, other groups would seek the increases without any justification other than that they had a traditional link. Previous Governments made attempts to break this. In the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, the use of local bargaining was proposed to allow local productivity packages to be negotiated. That approach did not work for a variety of reasons, but cross-sectoral relativities were one major reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All informed commentators knew that some better way had to be found to set public service <Col N="155" />pay. In 1998 the Taoiseach took the initiative by calling for a better way to manage public service pay. There followed detailed discussions between the public service employers and unions to find a better way forward. The outcome was benchmarking, a process set up under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in July 2000. A major advantage the Government saw was that the unions agreed that the old system of cross-sectoral relativities was dead, which was a fundamental change.</P>
    <P>The issue of cross-sectoral relativities and analogues right across the public service has bedevilled the system for the past 50 years. I was a member of a Government some years ago that thought it had finished with them. I remember the director of finance saying to the Cabinet that we would finish certain things before Christmas one year, pay out certain amounts of money and that the whole system was then finished. As Senator O'Toole will remember, we were so confident about that matter that we did not bother appointing the conciliator and arbitrator for some months. It was intended that we should not appoint one at all and that the system was finished. However, lo and behold, not very long after that we had to give into one group and that set off the whole process again. We tried it again in other agreements. The benchmarking body was when everyone agreed that cross-sectoral relativities were dead. If that was the only outcome of the benchmarking body, it would be well worth it as far as the Government, and any future Government, is concerned.</P>
    <P>As people who have been in Government well know, including all Ministers for Finance, if tonight I grant a small concession to any group in the public service, even an additional post or a small allowance for perhaps two people, by Friday week I will have knock-on effects throughout the public service. In some negotiations the line Minister would say that he or she had given only one concession only to be forced into others. We in the Department of Finance would point out that if we gave it to one group, we would have problems way down the line. In a few months we would have problems with all other sectors. That is the big difficulty with all public sector pay and anyone who has been involved in it knows that. One of the conditions of the benchmarking body was that we would deal with measuring and weighing people in the public sector against those in the private sector in that manner and that those relativities would be over. That is one of the things to which the unions and the Government have signed up.</P>
    <P>I became Minister for Finance some years ago. In my time in politics I have dealt mainly with economic matters. I had great interest in what happened in the Department of Finance and longed to be Minister. However, I never thought that so much of my time would be taken up with the pay element. Much of the Minister for Finance's time is taken up &ndash; to an extraordinary degree &ndash; with things that never came into my <Col N="156" />mind at all relating to pay and conditions, groups and knock-on effects in other areas. It takes up an extraordinary amount of time of the Minister and a panoply of officials. The field of cross-sectoral relativities was part of the benchmarking body and the report and was well worthwhile.</P>
    <P>As an interesting aside, it is said that early in the 1950s, after the end of the Second World War, each Department came up with a war plan.</P>

      <P>They were to make a list of what they would do in the event of the outbreak of war. In the Department of Finance, as Senator O'Toole should know, the number one item was to suspend the conciliation and arbitration scheme. That is part of the complexity of dealing with public sector pay. As Senator O'Toole, who has operated on behalf of teachers all his working life, would know, if some other group in the public sector got some small amount, his members would automatically say that they wanted the relativity with that group restored. That has been one of the great difficulties with public sector pay and the benchmarking body addressed it. For that alone it was worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>However, there is a limit in that regard. I remember Opposition politicians from 1999 onwards asking when the benchmarking body's report would come in for such and such a group and saying that it should be paid immediately. A Fine Gael Member of the other House, who was the spokesperson on education, wanted the award for teachers implemented immediately the benchmarking body had reported. Now they want it postponed. It must further be remembered that, after we set up the benchmarking body, from the time it first sat until it reported, most commentators, politicians and people in various groups expected the average increases to be much more, perhaps helped along by some of the utterances of the great Senator O'Toole, when the average cost across the public sector was only 8.9%.</P>
      <P>The process of benchmarking for public servants started in 1999 and the final instalment of the award will not be paid until 2005, which is a six year gap. The one thing we can learn from this process is that it has been possible to do it. We set up the benchmarking body in very good economic times and we are implementing it in times that are not so good, which has led to much of the debate now. However, the relativities and the measuring of the public against the private sector were done as everyone said that they should be done. Everyone on all sides of the House said that it was a good process.</P>

      <P>There are people who would question whether one can measure the private and public sectors against each other. Can one measure the work of a garda against that of anyone else? Can one measure the work of a teacher? Some people have an ideological and conceptual difficulty with that. Nevertheless, everyone is happy because the people we put on the body were above reproach. There were judges from the courts. The people who sat on it were qualified and independent of the Government and there was no interference from any side. They got information from the unions and the management and they went outside the public sector to get information from private sector employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are people who have difficulty with the process, but most people did not speak up. I do not remember anyone in this House speaking up against the concept at the time. If they did, it escaped me. There was the odd commentator outside who had difficulty with the concept, but there was no one inside the Houses of the Oireachtas. Now, following the report, for some reason some media commentators are going off at a tangent wanting us to break the deal. It is all right for a private sector employer to say that he or she will not honour a deal, but a Government cannot do that without very good reason because the whole basis of dealing with the Government would fall into disrepute and no group would ever make a deal with it again. One could never get a deal if the Government walked away from the report of an independent body to which it was party.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Toole has pointed out, we have fought right through the whole process of the agreements and the negotiations have been very tough. However, following the result of an agreed process which has been carried out independently, even if one does not like it, no sane Government can walk away, nor should it. What reason would one have? The measurements of those people's salaries were in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and that was done independently. There is a separate question about how public services should be paid for and so on, but surely all right thinking people would agree that what was signed up to and agreed must be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, the process measures the wages and salaries of workers in the public service and compares them to a similar job in the private sector. In making that comparison, allowance had to be made for the differences between the two sectors, such as job security and superannuation. The jobs were measured by a job scoring system, which is a common approach to measuring differing jobs. The body that carried out this work from mid-2000 to its report in mid-2002 was an independent body, chaired by a High Court judge, and not controlled by either the employers or the unions. Some have argued that the process was not transparent and that in some way the <Col N="158" />Government has deliberately hidden the evidence of the benchmarking process. The implication of this is that the benchmarking exercise was simply a &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; with the results preordained. This is far from the truth. The benchmarking body was set up as an independent body under a High Court judge and was comprised of individuals of high repute. Are critics saying that these people lent themselves to a rubber stamp exercise?</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the failure to produce the research of the body. The benchmarking body did publish an extensive description of the research it had carried out. What it did not publish was the raw data it collected on private sector earnings and there are a number of reasons for this. In the first instance, most of the data collected on private sector jobs and earnings was received on a very strictly confidential basis &ndash; it would not be possible to get it otherwise. In addition, even in the public service some data was collected on the basis that the individual responses would remain confidential. In any event publishing masses of raw data would only create scope for endless challenge and nit-picking. This would have delayed the process and moved it more to a negotiation process rather than a third party examination.</P>
    <P>The best approach was to appoint a suitable body of independent experts, whose judgment and fairness can be accepted by all, to oversee the research and reach conclusions. They sifted the evidence, listened to the oral arguments and considered and discussed the issues between themselves. Neither the Government nor the unions had any hand, act or part in the final recommendations of the body. Senators should note that the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, for example, which deals with top public service posts, including their own salaries, has operated on a similar basis for over 30 years.</P>
    <P>In any negotiations like these, does anyone really think that if the detail of comparing like with like came out we would not have endless nit-picking from those who did not get 24% that one group got? Anyone who knows the least amount about industrial relations or who ever went to a meeting on behalf of any group to negotiate pay or conditions at any level &ndash; in the workplace, the office or with the Department of Finance &ndash; would know that one could never conduct negotiations like that. If that happened, or if we were so stupid as to do something like that, the groups which got 4% and saw the reason for that award would be up in arms and would look for an independent industrial panel and independent renegotiation. The system being suggested would bring us straight back to the relativities from which we are trying to move. Various groups got 4%, 6%, 8%, 15% and so on and we would be negotiating again under the system being suggested.</P>

      <P>People have to understand that if we went down that particular route, the whole basis on which we set up this group would be set at naught.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the increases was negotiated with the unions in the context of the current national agreement. It had already been agreed under the PPF that one quarter would be paid with effect from December 2001. As part of the public service pay agreement under Sustaining Progress it was agreed that half of the increases would be paid on 1 January 2004 and the final quarter on 1 June 2005 provided certain important conditions are met. It is the payment of these two final phases and the general round increases that Fine Gael is seeking to change. It must be remembered that the conditions apply both to the benchmarking increases and the general round increases.</P>
      <P>Much is being made of the conditions for the payment of the increase and it is right that we as taxpayers should insist that in order to get these increases the public service observes the conditions attaching to them. The Government has made it clear that it will pay the increase on the basis of the conditions set down in the agreement. It cannot do otherwise without breaking the agreement so recently concluded by us. If the unions were to try to break their agreements would the same commentators not accuse them of bad faith and a lack of trustworthiness?</P>
      <P>The primary and most transparent condition is that there should be no industrial action such as we saw in recent years in our hospitals and in our schools. Any form of industrial action will be clear for all to see and would be a breach of the conditions of the agreement. Previous national pay agreements contained commitments to promoting industrial harmony and seeking to preclude industrial action. We all know that these had only a limited effect in preventing industrial action. The provisions in Sustaining Progress are stronger and clearer. There are procedures for eliminating the causes of disputes so they will not arise. To date we have had no disputes and I hope that continues. However, if it does not it will be clear to all and the breach of the agreement will be clear.</P>
      <P>The other conditions relate to changes in how the public services operate and there are commitments by the unions to specific changes and to more general co-operation with ongoing change. Some of the changes will be obvious for all to see while others, by no means less important, will not, but all will contribute to improving and modernising our public services to give better customer service and improved value to the taxpayer. The requirement to co-operate generally with modernisation and change will help managers to improve services either through technology or otherwise and so improve public services. I will take some examples from the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time ever there will be some open recruitment to middle and senior management posts in the Civil Service. At the same time there will be improvements in internal promotion <Col N="160" />arrangements. While in the past promotions were on the basis of merit not all were competitive and the emphasis going forward will be on greater competition for posts and away from promotion by management decision, with a heavy weight being given to seniority.</P>
    <P>There is to be legislation to modernise the recruitment and employment status of civil servants and the Government is legislating to modernise Civil Service recruitment practices. The Civil Service Commission will be overhauled, new commissioners will set recruitment standards and license office holders to carry out recruitment. A new public appointment service will be established to carry out recruitment and private sector agencies may be nominated by the commissioners to carry out recruitment on behalf of licence holders.</P>
    <P>The Government is also making significant changes to the management of staff in Government Departments. A new Bill on regulation will give Secretaries General and heads of office the power to dismiss civil servants below principal officer level. As part of the same initiative, wider powers will be given to heads of office to deal with underperformance by staff. To ensure fair procedure, the Bill also provides that the existing unfair dismissals legislation will apply to civil servants.</P>
    <P>These important changes in the law will bring about significant improvements in the way civil servants are recruited and in the way staff in Departments are managed. The framework is being laid for an efficient and flexible approach to the management of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Senators should also note that the change agenda in each sector is not a new initiative seeking to change a system that is unchanging. Rather it builds on previous modernisation changes that have been a feature of the public service in recent years. This is why in some cases the wording in some of the action plans is not clear to the general reader. This is something we will need to look at again and explain the changes being made in clear language and the context of those changes. The performance verification groups might take this on board in their reports.</P>
    <P>As I said, change in public services has been a feature in recent years. Our hospitals continue to adapt to new technologies and medical advances. New medicines, new procedures and new technology are a fact of life in the health sector and the workers in that sector are continually adapting to changes. In the Civil Service there have been initiatives to make services more easily accessible to the public.</P>
    <P>Through the use of new technology and an emphasis on customer relations, the service provided by Revenue has improved from what it was. In the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs there have been various initiatives which again have emphasised customer service. This process of improvement in public service and the delivery of services will continue under Sustaining Progress with, for example, an empha<Col N="161" />sis on longer office opening hours and technological initiatives.</P>
    <P>The agreement sets out the process to be followed for verification of achievement of the conditions. Central to the process are the performance verification groups or PVGs. These comprise an equal number of management, trade union and independent members, together with an independent chairperson. The process involves the preparation of and reporting on action plans and verification of progress by the performance verification groups. Each PVG will make a recommendation one month in advance of each of the five payment dates specified in the agreement. The PVG will maintain close contact with each of the organisations under its remit throughout the reporting period so it is a continuous process and not just a one-off assessment. In order to ensure transparency, the performance verification groups will become scheduled bodies under the Freedom of Information Act and the necessary legal provisions will be made shortly. In the meantime all action plans and associated priorities in respect of Departments have been published on the Department of Finance's website.</P>
    <P>Benchmarking as a system is a better way to determine public service pay. We could not have continued with the old system. Through this mechanism we have moved the settlement of pay to a new plane. To have continued with the old system would have led to more disruption of service, continued leapfrogging of claims and settlements that were sometimes irrational. To do nothing was not an option. This new system will give benefits not only because of the improvements brought about by the fulfilment of the conditions attaching to payments but also because of the long term impact of breaking cross-sectoral relativities.</P>
    <P>The onus is on the public service unions and their members to deliver on their commitments in the agreement. The conditions have been set and the verification process established. All that remains is the fulfilment of the conditions. The Government will pay the increases but only if all the conditions are met. I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party does not agree with the Fine Gael motion and we will support the Government amendment. I always come <Col N="162" />over a little funny when I utter those words and I take some consolation from the fact that I know it has a similarly disconcerting effect on the Minister. I suspect that whenever we get up to endorse what he has done, he knows he must have done something wrong along the way.</P>
      <P>In fairness to Fine Gael, it has touched a few nerves and raised important issues which have to be dealt with, specifically in relation to the delivery of public services and to modernisation and flexibility within the public service. This is a hugely important issue, which is becoming all the more important as we spend more money while looking back over the past three or four years when a huge amount of money was wasted in the public sector. I will return to that topic which, although not germane to the issue of benchmarking, is important.</P>
      <P>We must remember, as the Minister and others pointed out, from where the benchmarking process came. It arose out of an era of serious industrial unrest within the public sector. Virtually all the major bodies within the public sector had issues in the late 1990s. For example, teachers had been on strike, or had taken industrial action, gardaí had a bout of flu and nurses had been on a strike which, let us remember, had a great deal of public support on the basis that their pay was traditionally low and the lack of promotional opportunities in the grade. There were huge problems in the public sector which had to be addressed. At the time, on behalf of the Labour Party, the then leader Deputy Ruairí Quinn and I endorsed the process then undertaken, which became known as benchmarking.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, the relativity system was absurd, incoherent and bedevilled the service. For many years, when there was not a large amount of money around, it did not make a huge amount of difference, although it was frustrating for Ministers and did not make a great deal of sense. By the late 1990s, when we were trying to bring about improvements and incentivise particular people and grades in the sector, it simply could not be made to work any more. It was hugely important that we moved away from a system which tried to compare and link grades which had nothing in common whatsoever and which were doing entirely different jobs, requiring an entirely different form of expertise. I agree with the Minister that if we have succeeded in doing that and nothing else, it is a significant achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have to think back to when the process started to various other problems which were then, and still are largely, in the service. We were finding it very difficult to hold on to professional grades and that is still the case. For example, it was almost impossible to hold on to architects or people with town planning qualifications within county or city councils. We had to import them from abroad. The architects were going to the private sector because they could make more money there. That was true of a large number of <Col N="163" />professional grades within the Civil Service, but it was also true at the other end of the sector.</P>
    <P>People in low grades, such as clerical officers and those who were working part-time within the sector, frequently qualified for family income supplement, which is unconscionable. In the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children in particular, the pay of many people was below the minimum wage introduced by the Government. This situation could not be allowed to continue. There was a need to break that log-jam, but it could not have been done without breaking the relativities, which led to benchmarking. The fact that it succeeded in doing that &ndash; I listened to what Senator O'Toole said earlier &ndash; is a major achievement and it has been delivered against the background of relative industrial peace in recent years. To that extent, the Labour Party endorses it and it has been an important move forward.</P>
    <P>However, this is not to say that it is a brilliant or perfect deal. The impression was created at a very early stage that it was somehow out there in the universe and was not linked to anything, that it was money for nothing for public servants. The impression was given to the public, most of whom are not public servants, that this was a sweetheart deal done by Senator O'Toole and his mates with the Minister and his colleagues in Government Buildings which was not based on any logical assessment of facts. To use Senator O'Toole's unfortunate phrase, the impression was that it was an ATM. Understandably, that created a certain cynicism among people, other than public servants, which is still there to this day. It is that general cynicism, or lack of understanding, that Fine Gael is looking to capitalise on in making its points now.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that modernisation was included at the start of the benchmarking process, but it was only one of a number of different factors. It was never seen as a straightforward deal of modernisation for money. It is true that the benchmarking body, when it reported, linked the two by suggesting that the money should only be paid over in the event that flexibility and modernisation in the service was delivered. It is right that this should be the case. It is also right that the verification process should be very open. I welcome what the Minister said concerning the Freedom of Information Act. It is good that we will be able to oversee the verification process. We will know that this process is real because, undoubtedly, cynicism exists. People do not think that the verification process will be real. They think that the money is guaranteed and will be given anyway.</P>
    <P>It is important that Senator O'Toole, on behalf of ICTU, said this evening that in the event that the modernisation and flexibility that has been agreed is not delivered, the money should not be paid. I agree that should be the case. Those of us who argue for more public spending and who want to improve public services must look hard <Col N="164" />at the experience of the past two or three years when more money has been spent with little verifiable impact in terms of the improvement of services. The fact that the verification process will be more open is hugely important.</P>
    <P>Although it is an important issue for public servants, benchmarking is not only an issue for public servants. It is also an issue for consumers and those who use public services. This is essentially the point that Fine Gael is trying to make and I very much agree with it in that regard. However, it may have gone too far in making some linkages which should not have been made by suggesting that because the Government wasted money over the past two or three years, public servants must be punished. That is not a linkage that we would make and it is not a conclusion that I would seek to reach.</P>
    <P>We need to benchmark the process against the aims it set for itself, which were to improve the way in which we set pay and reward people within the public service. The fact that we are now contemplating doing it again is a useful indicator that those who are party to the deal thought it was a good one. Ultimately, whether one feels the deal was good or bad, it is a done deal. It is inconceivable that we should call on any of the parties to break the deal at this stage. Senators from other parties would find it very strange if the Labour Party called on the trade union to walk away from the deal. We have not done that and we will we do it. Likewise, we expect the Government to pay its part of the deal.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment moved by Senator Mansergh. The Progressive Democrats accept that the benchmarking agreement is a solemn, binding contract between the Government and the social partners. If we were to walk away from the deal at this stage, we would be inviting the unions which represent thousands of public and civil servants to hold the Government in breach of contract and we would have to take the consequences of social unrest. We cannot unilaterally walk away from such an agreement. What would we say if the unions decided to walk away? Agreements are made by two parties and this agreement will be honoured by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in honouring this agreement, the Government is well aware of the fundamentals on which it was established, namely reform, modernisation and productivity. Some 75% of the benchmarking award is conditional on reform, pro<Col N="165" />ductivity and modernisation taking place over the lifetime of the agreement. In confirming its obligation, the Government has no doubt that the public sector unions understand that there is a strict element of conditionality attached to this and that such reform and productivity must be verifiable. When this happens, we will have achieved what was intended, which is a public service which is matched to the market economy with a system of market linked computation for public pay based on merit and skill. There are thousands of hard-working public servants who look to the benchmarking system as their avenue for career advancement based on skill and merit rather than length of service.</P>
    <P>Despite some media comment, the economy is still performing very well when compared to our EU partners. We have a falling unemployment rate and continue to experience increased employment. This is not to deny that the economy has suffered from the winds of rural trade. Now more than ever we require the delivery of our public services to be lean and efficient. One only has to consider the experience of Aer Lingus when the hand of Government was taken off its back. Willie Walsh and the Aer Lingus unions rose to the challenge of the market economy. Aer Lingus survived and is now a thriving airline, something that was unthinkable only three years ago.</P>
    <P>However, the key to benchmarking must be to differentiate between the job and the employee, as is the case in the private sector. Recruitment, motivation and retention in the public service must be addressed under this agreement in order that people can see a career path, which is rewarded as in the private sector. This agreement calls on the unions to ensure that work practices change. Public sector unions must also enter into a binding agreement with the Government and the taxpayer to ensure that we get real value for money under this agreement.</P>
    <P>Approximately 40% of the people who are to receive benchmarking awards work in the Department of Health and Children. The need for reform of our health services is agreed by all in this House. Surely we are not expecting this reform to take place with the Government reneging on the benchmarking agreement, one of the tools to deliver such reform. While realising we are a small open economy operating in a global marketplace, reform of our systems and methods of doing business, whether it be in the public or private sector, is now more important than ever. I am sure Members will agree that continuing as we are is no longer sustainable. In that event and in the absence of any alternative, benchmarking must be honoured by all sides for the benefit of the economy. All parties to this agreement understand and realise that 75% of the balance of benchmarking comes with the price tag of conditionality firmly attached.</P>

      <P>If we are to have the best public service, and we need the best in Europe if we are to continue to grow as a country, I fully appreciate that we must pay top class salaries to employ top class people. The question we are asking and that must be asked of Government and of the social partners is what value for money are we securing for this large increase in public expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Minister let the cat out of the bag. He spoke about industrial relations and a pay agreement. That is what this issue is about. It is a pay agreement. It is the buying of industrial peace. It is couched as benchmarking, but as Members of the Oirechtas, and this also applies to members of the public, we find it difficult to ascertain what the taxpayer and the public will get as a result of the payment of these increases.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes that we must take stock of the value of money increases. We must demand a clear explanation of what exactly is on offer and when this offer will be delivered from the point of view of improving public services. From the point of view of local authority services, as a former member of a local authority, I am aware that every local authority across the country will find it impossible to make the books balance when their estimates come up for discussion in the next few months. Local authorities cannot afford these increases unless they are bailed out by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but he has already said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to such a proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, the Minister for Finance gave details of the 5,000 jobs which will be shed across the public service. That is one the costs of benchmarking. Some 5,000 public servants will be let go. There will be a major challenge in every Department as a result of arbitrarily paying these increases unless there is some indication of an improvement in services. Fine Gael wants this country to have the finest public servants and the finest public service but, as the leader of another party said at his party's conference some months ago, the whole issue of public service is an issue for the public and an issue about the public as much as it is about public servants. We want to know exactly what is on offer. We want to know what improvements will be made as a result of this deal. From the point of view of my constituents who deal with a local authority or a Department on a daily basis, they are demanding to <Col N="167" />know how services will improve. There appears to be little evidence to date of any of those improvements. The figure of &euro;1.2 billion is an extraordinary sum of money by anybody's standards. Who would believe ten to 20 years ago that we could afford those increases? The economy has grown and the Government will argue that it is affordable, but when one considers what else could be done with &euro;1.2 billion in terms of providing social and economic services for the public, it is vital that before we rush to pay these moneys, we know what will be a result of that investment and how the public will get a better response. If public service increases are to be fair and proper, surely they must result in a better service for the public, but no indication is available that they will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Bradford for sharing time with me.</P>
      <P>The concept that benchmarking payments to the public sector are in return for improved services ignores the fact that those outside this sector, who give value for money and enhance their particular workplaces, are not eligible for these awards, although ironically they will end up paying for them at local taxation level, in the ensuing job losses, escalating property prices, decreased services and reduced pension rights.</P>
      <P>With local authorities employing almost 13% of the 235,000 employees covered by benchmarking, how are local authorities throughout the country to find funds to pay this award? There are no prizes for the answer. The money will come out of the rapidly emptying pockets of our citizens. Citizens who are already being asked to pay refuse charges by their local authorities will see unprecedented stealth taxes in the guise of a wide range of new local charges. The local authority in my county of Longford, which has a population of 31,000, will have to raise between &euro;1.5 million and &euro;2 million from local taxation such as increased water and other service charges, including planning charges, which will particularly affect young house buyers, in order to pay benchmarking. With eight out of nine taxpayers not covered by the benchmarking process, we are in a strange position, where the increase to the one will be subsidised by many.</P>
      <P>Job losses will increase dramatically, with projections putting the expected losses by the end of the year at 45,000. With the cutback in community employment schemes, it will be difficult for the unemployed or those who are displaced from these schemes to get other job opportunities in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's determination to resist all calls for the suspension of the benchmarking scheme for public sector employees highlights the blatant recklessness of the Government in its handling of our national finances. At a time when the economy is in a critical state, we are expected to approve the spending of &euro;1.2 billion &ndash; the pro<Col N="168" />jected deficit for this year is estimated to be approximately the same figure.</P>
    <P>One of the Taoiseach's more extraordinary claims about the benchmarking agreement is that currently we are seeing more efficiencies throughout the health services. Is that wishful thinking or a figment of his imagination, something we have seen much of during the summer months? At a time when essential acute and non-acute medical services are being withdrawn or drastically curtailed, it is patent nonsense to speak of increased efficiencies in the health services. While recognising the work being done by the hard-pressed medical personnel who are victims of under-staffing, I suggest that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and, indeed, Senator Mansergh try to discuss this matter with people queuing in an A&amp;E department in any of our hospitals.</P>
    <P>The benchmarking will cost &euro;188.94 million in payments to health administrators and so on, who go a long way towards righting the inadequacy and inequality in health care in this country. I fully understand Senator O'Toole's concerns as nearly half of next year's benchmarking costs will go to the education sector, which will receive &euro;300 million. This money could be effectively used to double the school building programme which he has called for time and time again.</P>
    <P>Asking that the benchmarking payments be postponed pending a review is not in any way anti-Civil Service. It is merely a logical, economy-driven attempt at rationalisation and effective governance of this country.</P>
    <P>Weary of bearing the brunt of economic mismanagement by the Government, the public will be wearier still when elderly people are forced to work until they are 75 years of age to make up for the lack of their pension rights. Force-fed on the rapidly broken promises in the lead-up to the last general election, they will surely not be as easily hoodwinked by the blatant pre-election Government spin machine revving up at the moment. It is in their interest to remember that the Government promises, and the general public pays.</P>
    <P>The benchmarking deal is a bad deal for the taxpayers of this country as it siphons off resources from other important areas. This was brought home to me this afternoon when seven constituents of mine telephoned me.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am happy to speak in support of the Government amendment. After many years of social partnership which have brought this coun<Col N="169" />try from the dire straits it was in during the 1970s and 1980s to its current position as one of the leading economic success stories in Europe and indeed the world, the benchmarking process which this Administration and the previous one have entered into will continue to improve the lives of ordinary people in this country, and keep us on the path which has proven to be so successful over the past ten or 15 years. I was glad to hear the opening speaker for Fine Gael concede that point.</P>
      <P>The Irish public service to a great extent has made us what we are today. The December 2000 agreement, which is the basis for benchmarking, is a recognition of that fact. To quote the Minister for Finance at the time, this was the first time any attempt had been made to assess appropriate pay for all key public service grades by reference to pay for equivalent jobs in the private sector. This process was not entered into lightly. As has been pointed out, discussions have been taking place since 1998. The benchmarking body's report is a comprehensive analysis of the whole of our public sector in comparison to the private sector. After more than two years of intensive consultation and discussion with all the stakeholders, its conclusions have to be taken as a solid basis from which the future direction of our public service can be guaranteed for all our benefit.</P>
      <P>The integrated approach adopted by the benchmarking body in comparing work and reward had among its main criteria &ldquo;public service, modernisation, efficiency and effectiveness&rdquo;. There was all-party agreement on a commitment to development and modernisation frameworks. The benchmarking body also made it clear that any awards given, apart from those in the first quarter, were conditional on genuine output being delivered, and this was agreed by all parties involved in the negotiations. It was also made clear that an appropriate validation process had to be established to ensure issues such as change, flexibility and modernisation were fully implemented.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the performance management and development system in the Civil Service and the linking of this system to any pay increases under any of the agreements, PPF or Sustaining Progress, will ensure the effectiveness of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Since the establishment of the strategic management initiative within the Civil Service, huge strides have been made.</P>

      <P>The pragmatic decision taken in the year 2000 to progress the agreement, along with the excellent work of the benchmarking board, have resulted in a strong framework within which the public services can and will improve to a level which is appropriate to a modern progressive State.</P>
      <P>This Government is committed to following through on the commitments given by all parties to the agreement and to ensuring they are delivered on. For many years we have listened to complaints about the state of our public service. Some 20% of our workforce, the 235,000 people in the public service, have through their representative bodies signed up to this agreement and they fully realise that with the agreement come expectations. Under a succession of national agreements, including PPF and Sustaining Progress and, as was pointed out earlier, one of the agreements negotiated by Fine Gael, the link between public service pay awards and the delivery of improvements and modernisation programmes has been a key element in negotiations. All sides accept that in order to justify any awards, change is inevitable.</P>
      <P>An even more important element of any agreement must be the verification process. This must be rigorous and transparent. The method of quality control that this will provide will benefit all sides &ndash; the consumer, the taxpayer, the Government and indeed the service providers, in that they will not have to constantly try to justify themselves or the value of their work.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the Fine Gael motion baffles me. We listen almost daily to moans about the lack of services and investment yet Fine Gael wants to undermine the very people who provide us with these services. It says something about the flawed logic that exists in Fine Gael that the party does not see the public service as worth investing in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather struck by the unanimous view inherent in the use of a phrase used by Senator Brady, which ought to be punctured before it is allowed to go any further. The phrase is used by politicians and economists and those reading scripts &ndash; which is against the rules &ndash; in this House from time to time. It is the mantra that social partnership is the basis of our economic boom. There is absolutely no evidence for this and I challenge anyone to produce such evidence. That mantra has gained ground because social partnership and the economic boom have coincided. It is like saying that when the sun rises in the morning, we have a particularly good economy.</P>
      <P>It is not necessarily true that social partnership has been the basis of our economic boom. The evidence I would point to is that social partnership agreements had very little to do with that boom. However, Government policy, as practised by the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil, and indeed by Fine Gael and Labour when they were in office, had a great deal to do with it. Government policy, and a low corporate tax rate, has fostered a large number of multinationals in this country which are undoubtedly one of the bases of the economic boom.</P>
      <P>I point out to those who use this mantra that the people who brought so much foreign investment, employment and a buzz into our economy are not practitioners of social partnership. Let us not accept this. Senator Brady may be correct in what he says and there may be an element of truth in it but let us not state it as proven fact, as it is not, never was and never will be. It is unprovable.</P>
      <P>I welcome Fine Gael's late conversion through this particular motion. Some of us have been belly-aching <i>ad nauseum</i> about benchmarking ever since the idea was introduced.</P>

      <P>I choose my subjects. This subject has been difficult for political parties for good political reasons. It has also been an easy one for us, as Independents, to tackle for good political reasons. It has been difficult to tackle because of the power of the social partners to which Senator Brady referred. The public service unions have wielded incredible power in this country. The most powerful group outside the Houses of the Oireachtas is the public service unions. Benchmarking is one more concession to their enormous power. It is difficult for politicians to resist that power because in that group are extremely sensitive and powerful lobbies such as nurses, gardaí and teachers who can place immense pressure on them. It is my contention that the almost unanimous support for benchmarking &ndash;<Col N="172" />it was unanimous in both Houses for a while &ndash; came about as a result of that pressure. I applaud that Fine Gael has taken the courage to resist that pressure. They will pay a price for that but it may not be a price without benefits because the polls show a large minority taking the same position as them on this. It is a difficult road to go and I applaud them for taking it.</P>
      <P>It is my contention, perhaps because I am more cynical and do not have the same ties and constraints or pressures on me, that benchmarking was, from day one, a bit of a ready-up. It was the insiders deciding something which was inevitable. It took them an extraordinarily long time to reach their conclusions, conclusions which many had predicted within 1% in its original form before it was set up. I accept some of what the Minister said about the members of that body being people of integrity although it is a bit rich to say that because a High Court judge was in charge everything is all right. I do not accept that. High Court judges are not perfect people without prejudices. The benchmarking body was not, as the Minister stated, an independent committee. It was full of social partnership junkies, people who were committed to it in the first place. It was stuffed with IBEC, trade union officials and, in particular, public service trade unionists. What conclusion could they have reached other than an agreement which suited the public service? </P>

The disappearance of the data discredited the findings, to which the Minister referred. I see no reason the data on which they based their findings could not have been released. The establishment of this body was flawed. Its findings were predestined and I agree fully with the Fine Gael demand that these payments be suspended until the implementation of productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" />I do not accept that the verification groups are impartial bodies. The chair of one of the verification groups was also a member of the benchmarking body. It is an extraordinary coincidence that someone so embroiled in the whole process, who has a vested interest in pushing it through and who recommended the report to the House is chairing one of the verification groups. Political appointees to semi-State bodies are chairing other verification groups. What does that mean? It means they are beholden and are not independent. Others on the verification groups are almost inevitably trade unionists who will vote to push this through as will members of IBEC.</P>

      <P>Yes, but he is omnipresent. I was so overcome by Senator Ross's productivity I thought there were two Senators speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is utility in social partnership. No one wishes to go back to the trench warfare of long strikes. That is the measurement of social partnership. I agree it carries some of the dangers outlined. My only concern is if one engages in a process of bargaining and negotiation, it is difficult for one party to withdraw while maintaining the credibility of the process and leaving open the possibility of picking up the bits and pieces again. It can be argued that the deal was negotiated during the good times when the State could afford it but it cannot now. A private company would open its books, inform its workers it cannot <Col N="174" />afford the deal and ask them to sit down. That means the pain is shared all around and it is not all visited on the workers. A major can of worms would be opened by getting into that. It is precious to think that industrial relations, pay and conditions, remuneration and productivity can be discussed as if they are entirely separate and discrete. They interact with each other and the purpose of the deal is to enable the recruitment, motivation and retention of workers and certain actions must be taken to do so.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the productivity aspect of benchmarking. I have been engaged in similar negotiations for most of my life and I know a disguised pay rise when I see one. It is only too easy to say, &ldquo;That is productivity and we will work it out afterwards&rdquo;. It is a great achievement to have abolished relativities and the embedded practices that were in place so the public service can move forward. That was worth doing because relativities were a killer. I like money to be invested in low paid workers. One of the difficulties in the past was when an award was made to the lowest paid workers, workers in the next grade said they were always X% ahead of them and the scales were adjusted accordingly. It is good to have moved away from that.</P>
    <P>However, productivity is difficult to measure in the public service. For example, I recall that for every £5 invested in the health service, there was a £1 improvement in services. Issues such as this need to be tackled. People must be faced with the prospect that if an agreement is based on productivity, it has to be measurable, achievable and policed. It is difficult to do so in regard to certain jobs. Senator Ross pointed out the embarrassment of the Seanad and I must put up my hands and acknowledge that was an own goal.</P>
    <P>During the last Seanad, I was a member of the strategic management initiative, which dealt with Mickey Mouse issues such as the types of letters sent out by civil servants and whether civil servants were courteous when they answered the telephone. While I would like this to happen, we did not deal with major issues such as discussing business plans with Departments and asking them what they had done. That committee should be resuscitated and refocus on issues such as that so that officials could appear before it and outline how they implemented modernisation and improved productivity and how they proposed to measure it so that there is a sense that productivity and modernisation are being monitored. The worst thing that could happen is a lack of modernisation, flexibility and improvement in services following such expenditure, which, at the end day, is what will benefit the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Senator Finucane. Fine Gael's demand for the renegotiation of the benchmarking agreement has a number of origins. Its cost of &euro;1.2 billion will not be matched with commensurate improvement in public services. There will not be a value or return to the taxpayer for the money expended. The Government and the Minister have not <Col N="175" />addressed the value for money issue. A serious deficit in the public finances has emerged and the resources are not available to meet it. An accelerated pattern of stealth taxes, service charges and so on will emerge in the coming months as the Government will tax everything that moves in order to recoup money. Public servants will find that the extra money will filter out of their pockets in the form of various new charges before they even receive it.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about addressing serious issues surrounding the nature of the deal, the way it was put together, how the shortfall will be addressed and who will pay for it. Benchmarking was intended to end historical relativities and the extra payments were to be based on hard evidence of recruitment difficulties experienced in the public service and gaps in pay and performance requirements between the private and public sectors. Three quarters of the award was conditional on outputs that achieved delivery of improved public services as a result of the reform agenda. This was a radical departure and it was a process with potential. It was about striving to achieve best practice and rewarding those involved in its achievement and it was to be extremely exciting by providing a great opportunity for the State to radically reform public services.</P>
      <P>However, the Government has completely blown this opportunity. The hard evidence that was supposed to be the basis of the award was not released and it has been shredded and buried. No taxpayer, who will pay for the process, will see a shred of evidence to support it. The Government completely reneged on its responsibility to put in place a serious reform agenda and there was no effort to advocate reform. No group in the negotiations was pushed beyond its established position.</P>
      <P>The Government pulled back in respect of its responsibility because it did not want to rock the boat and all of us will pay for it. It completely capitulated on the principle that co-operation with change in moderation should be the justification for pay awards. Instead of honouring the principle, it agreed a hollow list of minor changes dressed up as so-called action plans full of pious hopes and offering objectives for every existing activity but not involving serious change or commitment that there would be differences in the delivery of health and education services, which would realise value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Value for money was supposed to be the hallmark of the benchmarking process. Ministers have commented in the media on endemic overtime in the Prison Service. There was not a word about that issue when benchmarking was discussed and Ministers are now scurrying for reform when there is no money in the kitty. They have blown the opportunity that benchmarking offered. Last year 90% of the extra resources that the Minister for Finance had available on budget day were expended on public pay, if social welfare increases are excluded. Only 10% remained <Col N="176" />for non-pay elements. Bureaucracy pre-empted the money and, therefore, there were cuts in the home help and respite care services and grants for people with disabilities and beds were closed. However, public servants continued to be paid. There was an inability to deliver services because of the way in which the last budget was framed and there will be greater evidence of this next year. We do not mean to undermine social partnership by questioning the benchmarking deal and the returns that are being made on it. Our ideas may challenge social partnership, which will be worthwhile only if it can face such challenges and emerge with a deal that better serves the people and delivers improved services. Social partnership should make the public service more rewarding and ambitious. People should be able to have dynamic public sector careers, in which they can demonstrate the professional expertise for which they were trained. That is where Fine Gael stands on benchmarking.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I would like to read into the record a fairly self-explanatory letter. I do not need to add anything to the letter, which was given the title &ldquo;Exposing Civil Service from within&rdquo; when it was chosen as the letter of the week in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday. The letter read as follows:</P>
      <P>I am a senior civil servant working in one of the biggest government departments. I have received a significant increase in salary under the guise of benchmarking. I can, however, confirm that the process constitutes a major fraud on the taxpayer. The notion that there will be, or has been, some improvement in productivity or in delivery or quality of services or performance accruing for the State is totally erroneous. My department is overstaffed, there is no check or interest in under-performance (or no performance) on either an individual or collective basis &ndash; whatever the grade from Clerical Officer to Assistant Secretary. If I, within my area, were to take some initiative to address the situation I would receive no support and would in fact harm any chance of advancement &ndash; I know this through personal experience. There is in place a culture of hear no evil . etc., and this is widely tacitly understood across most of the Civil Service. Those commentators who have identified and commented on the obvious flaws in the process have only erred in seriously underestimating the scale of the con-job being perpetrated on the taxpayer. Finally, I should add that the blame for the above lies squarely with the absence of real management skills at the highest levels of the Civil Service. The doctrine is if in doubt do nothing &ndash; and most important of all upset nobody.</P>
      <P>I did not make up the letter, which was written by a civil servant. I do not need to say any more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" />It is important that we outline the background to this debate. The benchmarking process commenced in October 2000. An increase of 21.5% was awarded between that date and October 2002, under the programme at the time. The benchmarking body was established, at a time when there was a certain amount of industrial unrest, to buy peace and harmony. The body was charged with comparing public sector wages to those in the private sector at a time of economic boom.</P>
    <P>Secondary school teachers were complaining at that time because they felt that IT workers, who were educated by them, were earning much more than them in the private sector. I would like to point out what is happening in the IT sector at present. Two people are qualified to do every IT job that is available in this country. Most IT workers have taken a drop in income because the sad reality of the private marketplace is prevailing. I assure the House that the public service is cocooned in terms of wage increases and pensions. The private sector is a harsh world now that the economy has changed dramatically. The benchmarking process bought peace and harmony until its findings were released in May 2002, just after the general election was called. It guaranteed political stability until the election was called. I am sure the Government had been very conscious for some time that the election was going to take place in May, as everything seems to have been geared in that direction.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, announced that he intends to seek 5,000 voluntary redundancies in the public service. It is interesting to note that 21,000 people were recruited to the public service in the year preceding the general election.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will be aware that between 4,500 and 5,000 people were recruited to the Department of Agriculture and Food at a time when the numbers involved in farming were declining. That seems like a contradiction. A colleague of the Minister of State in another body, the ICMSA, queried that aspect of the matter recently. The benchmarking document is neither quantifiable nor tangible, but it contains a large amount of wishes. Senator Maurice Hayes asked what it means to say that &ldquo;we will improve customer relations&rdquo;. One would imagine that public servants would have been providing good customer relations all the time. Anyone who analyses the benchmarking document will find that it contains many such pious platitudes. The people involved in the benchmarking process were within the loop, so they knew what was going to emerge from it.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael's announcement that it intends to abandon the payment of benchmarking awards to public service workers, on the grounds that the country cannot afford it, is reckless. Its logic is flawed, given that it promised that it would reimburse Eircom shareholders and compensate taxi drivers, at a massive cost to the taxpayer, if it was elected. Fine Gael Deputies were elected on this mandate. The latest rush of blood to the head proves beyond doubt that Fine Gael has lost the plot. The party announced in January 2002 that, if elected, it would compensate small investors who lost out after purchasing Eircom shares that subsequently decreased in value. It was discovered between the announcement and the general election that the cost of this policy could have been more than &euro;100 million. The combined cost of the deals with the taxi drivers and the Eircom shareholders could have been well in excess of &euro;400 million. This is money that we cannot afford, according to Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>I do not think Fine Gael can decide what is best for the economy. Does it prefer benchmarking, which is an incentive for hard-working nurses, teachers and gardaí, or compensating Eircom investors? In its general election manifesto last year, Fine Gael predicted that it would deliver on tax cuts, increase spending on services, fund the national development plan and pay into the national pensions reserve fund. It said that it would start a new general contingency fund and stay in the black as far as Brussels is concerned. I remind the House that I intend to share time with Senator White.</P>

      <P>If well-off people like myself were the issue, Fine Gael would propose that we pay 50% tax on large parts of our income. However, if they did so a large number of Fine Gael supporters would drop dead with fright. People on incomes such as mine are not paying half enough income tax. I did not support the cuts in the top rate of income tax. They achieved nothing. They <Col N="182" />did not make me or anyone else work any harder. The problem has always been that people on low incomes were in the wrong tax band, not that the top rate of income tax was too high. People on high incomes can afford to pay higher taxes. That is not the issue.</P>
      <P>The issue is the distortion of the public perception of what is the public service. I do not dispute Senator Finucane's truthfulness. The mythological civil servant sits in a mythological Department doing nothing. There may be a few of them about, but anyone who is familiar with large private sector organisations will also know that the problem of individuals in back-offices of large private organisations is also a reality. It is easy to keep a check on everyone in a small firm where there are only six people. In a big organisation where 95% of the people are doing their job properly, the problem is how to deal with the other 5%.</P>
      <P>In journals of the engineering profession, of which I am a member, I read about the problem of under-performance in, for example, large US chemical engineering consultancies. The worst possible thing to do is to sack those who are under-performing. Regarding the mythological public servant of whom he spoke, if Senator Finucane thinks the solution is to sack the people in the Department he thinks are not doing their job, he is inviting serious industrial relations problems. It is a management issue to manage such people. The fundamental problem in parts of the public service is the unwillingness of people in management to do what they are entitled to do and take responsibility where there is a problem. The myth is that these are all civil servants. They are actually nurses, doctors, teachers and their ilk.</P>
      <P>In the sector in which I work, where I am told we are not sufficiently flexible, I am required to teach at any hour of the day between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. I am required to work at night if my managers decide I should. I am paid time-and-a-half for working at night. How much more flexibility does anyone want from people like that?</P>
      <P>I was not a Member of this House between 1993 and 1997. I was involved in a research project at the time. The third level colleges throughout Europe that were involved in the project communicated by electronic mail. We were researching with private sector organisations, none of which had got around to even thinking about electronic communication. We had to drive technological change in the private sector and lead the question of new technology. The Internet and the world wide web were invented in the public sector and were used in the public sector before the private sector even noticed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was entertained by Senator Ross's view. In the middle of the 1990s, I began to send press releases to various newspapers by e-mail, to be told by all of the newspapers that e-mails could not be accepted because they did not have an agreement on the use of new technology. I am tired of the idea that there is a thrusting private sector using all the weapons of modern tech<Col N="183" />nology when, in terms of the developments such as the Internet, the private sector had to be dragged reluctantly into the use of what many people in the public sector had been using as the normal method of communication without any negotiation about extra payment.</P>
    <P>The public sector is not a homogenous body. It consists of nurses and doctors in the accident and emergency service and of teachers who, according to the OECD, work longer average hours than teachers in any other OECD country. One could quote many other examples.</P>
    <P>Does Fine Gael propose that we walk away in the middle of a deal and say to all those people, &ldquo;Tough. We want more.&rdquo;? Why is it acceptable to break an agreement on public service pay while paying out between &euro;500 million and &euro;700 million a year on an idiotic special savings scheme which will benefit no one in this country and is an enormous drain on the public resources? Why not break that agreement and tell people something different? The money will produce nothing in terms of the provision of public services.</P>

If the award is to be paid from 1 January next year and beyond, it will be paid on the back of stealth taxes and increased charges in the economy. It will also be paid on the back of cuts in education and health. I am not prepared to accept an increase in our salaries on the back of health cuts. Senator Ryan can afford health cuts because he has two salaries, whereas I do not.</P>
      <P>This country needs to take a grip of the economy and the difficulties we face. If we show wise counsel over the next two years, if people show moderate expectations in pay and if we start to reduce the huge sums we are spending, we can turn the economy around for the good times ahead. That is the kind of leadership this motion espouses and which this House should be showing.</P>

It involves going back to the negotiating table, sitting down with the unions, working out a productivity deal and publishing it in order that we can measure productivity on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of services getting better but they have worsened. The Luas has to be placed on stilts, the port tunnel cannot take the vehicles it was supposed to take and trains are running late. The Minister mentioned walking away from the deal. We do not expect anybody to do this. We advocate sticking with it but going back to the negotiating table and re-negotiating it. He said it is impossible to do another deal, with which we agree.</P>
      <P>Consider the figures pertaining to what the Minister is paying out this year through his Department on benchmarking: Enterprise Trade and Employment, &euro;12.9 million; Department of Defence, &euro;22 million; Department of Agriculture and Food, &euro;10.8 million; Department of Finance, &euro;21.398 million; Department of Education and Science, &euro;300 million; Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, &euro;1.670 million; Department of Health and Children, &euro;188 million. Where is the productivity for this money?</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Morrissey for his contribution. I am surprised by the Progressive Democrats. We thought its members were the kind of people that would espouse our proposal. He spoke of three things that were to be delivered, namely, reform, modernisation and productivity. We agree that these should be delivered, but it is not being done.</P>
      <P>Senator John Phelan was exceptionally good. Had the benchmarking deal been re-negotiated properly, we would have had 1,200 new gardaí. He spoke of local charges being increased this year because development charges will be imposed. He asked all the right questions.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh spoke about our being altruistic, a point taken up by Senator White. We are not, we are being pragmatic and we will be thanked for it. We did the same thing in respect of the Tallaght strategy. People said it was daft but in the election which followed, we won nine seats.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the verification groups and we agreed with him. However, why not publish their results? Why should they be secret? Where is the evidence of the measurability of productivity and increased services? It should be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly agreed with Senator Ross. He has been barraging us over the summer with letters in respect of taking up this issue and we have done so. However, I take issue with the Senator <Col N="185" />in that we are not late converts to our way of thinking. In my opening address, I said that when the deal was first published in 2002 and when the idea of benchmarking came to the surface, we needed to see productivity.</P>
    <P>We had a good debate but, unfortunately, our message did not circulate. The deal is bad, wasteful, and extravagant. There was no reform agenda. Evidence of private sector comparisons and recruitment bottlenecks was never revealed <Col N="186" />to the public sector. Awards were set out with no matching agenda of service improvement. No such improvement was or will be delivered. We make no apology for our stand. We are for the concept of benchmarking. It is good, but under the aegis of the Government it has been totally mismanaged. It is an extravagant, non-productive give-away.</P>

      <P>I am thankful, as are we all, that the serious, even spectacular, rail accident in Cahir involved no loss of life or injuries. In that respect it was better than the previous accident in the same place in 1955, details of which are recorded in photograph books in County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>It is a busy line, despite impressions given to the contrary, and it is especially so at this time of the year with the transportation of beet. The train in question was a cement train which was running in the early hours of the morning. They run on a 24 hour basis. The line is important rather than expendable.</P>
      <P>This incident underlines the importance of the rail safety programme introduced by Senator O'Rourke when she was the Minister for Public Enterprise. It is essential for the health and safety of train drivers that the programme is completed. The rail safety programme was never purely a question of economics. It was a matter of safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A strengthened bridge that is capable of carrying the heavy freight traffic on the line needs to be put in place as expeditiously as possible. It is not just a minor passenger line. I travelled it twice in the past 15 months and the bridge was probably the weakest place on it. If a strengthened bridge is put in place, it may enable the capacity to be improved. I presume the Waterford to Rosslare part of the line will continue to operate. It has some commuter traffic, but obviously the beet traffic will be disrupted. A recent container <Col N="187" />contract was announced between Cork and Waterford and that obviously will be disrupted.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has clarified that there is no question of using this incident to close the line. I cannot stress more strongly, and the Minister of State will have seen this when he went to Sligo, that the people want a joined up transport system and railway network. This line is a key part of the network, especially from the point of view of freight and, in the longer term, the corridor from the south-east through to the west. It is important that the Minister uses this opportunity.</P>
    <P>The accident is a salutary warning. The Rosslare-Waterford-Limerick junction line is not the only such one in the country. For example, there is the line through north Tipperary. The second phase of the rail safety programme needs to be undertaken and completed. I hope the line in question will be repaired and put back into service on a long-term basis over the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the Minister for Transport, who is unable to attend. The derailment at Cahir yesterday morning is a matter of concern to us all. I am thankful that, despite the seriousness of the incident, nobody was injured. The circumstances surrounding the derailment are being investigated by Iarnród Éireann to ascertain the cause or causes of the derailment. The Minister was informed today that the company has appointed an independent expert from the United Kingdom to act as chairman of the Iarnród Éireann inquiry board.</P>
      <P>Owing to the damage to the track and viaduct, the line has been closed. However, the Minister has asked Iarnród Éireann to examine the possibility of opening up other parts of the line pending completion of the necessary repairs. The company has undertaken to revert to him on this aspect. The Minister has been assured that Iarnród Éireann will repair the viaduct as quickly as possible, but the latest indications are that it will take six months to carry out the necessary works. Iarnród Éireann is, however, endeavouring to try to reduce this timeframe. In the meantime, the Minister understands that the company is examining all similar bridges on its network as a precautionary measure. He has also been informed that alternative arrangements have already been put in place to cater for passengers and freight customers on this route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief railway inspecting officer of the Department of Transport attended the scene of the incident yesterday. The Minister has asked that he report to him on his observations. The Minister will then decide if he should direct that a statutory inquiry be carried out in accordance with section 7 of the Regulation of Railways Act <Col N="188" />1871. The Minister has already asked Iarnród Éireann to furnish him with the findings of its inquiry board when its investigation is completed.</P>
    <P>We cannot be complacent about safety, whether it is on roads, railways, in the air or at sea. The Minister, having responsibility for roads and railways, has striven to ensure that transport safety remains at the top of his agenda. The Railway Safety Bill, which is before the Dáil, will establish an independent railway safety commission with a wide-ranging remit and powers to monitor and enforce railway safety. The Bill also establishes a functionally separate railway incident investigation unit within the railway safety commission with powers to investigate railway incidents such as that at Cahir yesterday. The Minister hopes to be in a position to progress the Bill through the Dáil during the current session.</P>
    <P>As regards reviewing the safety of the railway, a wide-ranging review of railway safety was carried out by independent consultants led by International Risk Management Services in 1998 on behalf of the Department of Transport. A high level task force was established to prepare a report with prioritised recommendations to address the issues identified in the IRMS report.</P>
    <P>Following the recommendations of the task force, the Government in 1999 approved the first railway safety programme to cover the period 1999 to 2003. Total investment under the programme in 2003 will be in the region of &euro;136 million. Over the full period of the programme, some &euro;650 million will have been invested in improving Iarnród Éireann's infrastructure and safety management systems by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>By the end of the programme some 400 miles of track will have been renewed and more than 440 level crossings will have been improved or closed altogether. In addition, many miles of new fencing will have been erected and new bridges and coastal defence structures built or improved. Safety management systems have also been greatly enhanced over this period.</P>
    <P>The high level task force was reconvened in March of this year and is in the process of preparing recommendations for Government for the next five year programme. The work of the task force is expected to be completed by the end of 2003.</P>
    <P>The incident at Cahir yesterday serves as a warning that we can never take safety for granted. The current high level of investment in railway safety is making a difference. The Minister is committed to ensuring that investment continues into improving railway safety further into the future.</P>
