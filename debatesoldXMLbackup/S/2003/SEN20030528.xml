      <P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to conduct an audit of property owned by his Department to ascertain if there is any surplus to requirements that could be sold specifically to raise money to build a new hospital for the patients in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Higgins of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Defence to make a statement on the failure of his Department to make available the necessary funding for the refurbishment and upgrading of the military barracks in Castlebar, with the result that the summer training programme for the FCA cannot now go ahead.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, report of the Joint Committee on The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charters Amendment) Bill 2002, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders relative to Private Business, to be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business; No. 2, Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1 and conclude not later than 1.15 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and on which Members may share time, the Minister to be called on to reply not later than 15 minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage at approximately 1 p.m.; No. 3, Local Government Bill 2003 <Col N="318" />[<i>Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil</i>] &ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 1.15 p.m. and conclude not later than 2 p.m. &ndash;  this is a technical drafting amendment regarding the collective citation of the Bill which will become the Local Government (No. 2) Act when passed, although published as the Local Government (No. 1) Bill, because the Local Government (No. 2) Bill was passed and enacted first; No. 4, Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 &ndash; Committee Stage, to be taken from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. and, if not previously concluded, to resume at 8 p.m. at the conclusion of Private Members' Business and conclude not later than 10 p.m.; and No. 12, motion No. 31, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. There will be a sos from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Leader is aware that on 20 June the Convention on the Future of Europe will make its final report under the chairmanship of the former French President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing. I ask that on the following Tuesday we spend the entire day debating the outcome of the convention, given the fact that the House led the way through the initiative of the Leader in inviting members of the convention to contribute during the course of the debate. The Leader will doubtless agree that there is a great deal of concern within Europe, among all the political families, and among the governments of Europe concerning the outcome that seems to be coming from the discussions. I understand that in excess of 1,000 amendments were tabled by convention members and not even considered by the Praesidium in its latest two draft reports.</P>
      <P>There is great concern among convention members that their voices are not being heard, particularly in regard to the rights and responsibilities of small countries when compared to those awarded to larger countries. There is a sense that the report was written even before the convention met. When it makes its report, given the role we have played in regard to it, the House should debate it in the fullest possible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a separate matter, the Leader is no doubt aware that yesterday at the Court of Criminal Appeal the father of a murder victim asked the eminent judges to consider that a judge should specify a minimum sentence when a life sentence for murder is handed down. Mr. Justice Hardiman rightly said it was not a matter for the court and that it should be debated elsewhere. I contend that &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; is the Houses of the Oireachtas. This House would serve a very useful function if it had a full debate on the issue of minimum sentencing. The subject has recently been broached by the Home Secretary in Britain, given the concern about the lack of consistency in sentencing policy in murder cases. I ask that the Leader provide the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with an opportunity to address the matter of minimum sentencing and take contributions from the House. It is clear from yesterday's case that eminent members of the Judiciary believe the matter should be <Col N="319" />debated. It must be debated in the Oireachtas because this is where the laws of the country are made. The Leader might consider a debate at some point between now and the recess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful for the House to note the nomination of the new Garda Commissioner, Mr. Noel Conroy, and offer him our congratulations and every support on his appointment. I have no doubt that a man born and reared with the taste of salt in his mouth in Blacksod on the Mullet Peninsula, with all the good sense possessed by people from that part of the country, will make a huge impression on the job. He has an extraordinary record, being a Scott medal holder and having been in the news many years ago when seen in the film shots during the famous arrest made at the Attorney General's apartment. He has since moved on and is a man who has shown determination right through his career. I wish him well, as I am sure the House will.</P>
      <P>About two months ago I raised the issue of an ombudsman for children and the commitments given to the House in that regard. Some time ago the then Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Hanafin, now Chief Whip, rejected an amendment from this side of the House to fix a commencement date for appointment of an ombudsman to within about one year &ndash; I cannot recall the exact period. She gave the House a clear assurance that there was no need for the amendment because it was her intention and that of the Government that the appointment would be made as soon as was possible after the signing of the Act. She stated the only delays would be those regarding advertising, appointment etc.</P>
      <P>This is all on the record of the House from about two years ago, though I cannot recall the exact date. However, the Bill was certainly introduced in 2001. It was welcomed and the Government received great kudos for bringing it forward. Those of us who had been shouting about the matter for years welcomed and supported the Bill, and praised the Minister and the Government. This is the reason people talk of broken promises. Perhaps, when we get to read the 15 page document, we might see a good reason this has not been done. However, many are appalled. Many working with vulnerable children feel let down.</P>
      <P>It would be useful for the Chief Whip, who deals with legislation, to come to the House to explain the delay. Members on the Government side of the House supported the Bill with the same energy as me. While I am not taking this as a political matter, it is appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note in media reports that the issue of rip-off Ireland was raised in the House yesterday when I did a back-of-an-envelope calculation regarding the price of petrol. Two years ago a barrel of oil cost &euro;20 because of the valuation of the euro and the dollar; today on the world mar<Col N="320" />ket it costs &euro;22, even though there is a different valuation on the dollar. Two years ago the price of a litre of petrol was about 65 cent to 70 cent, yet in most places it is now closer to 90 cent, even though the price of oil in euros is only 10% dearer than two years ago.</P>
      <P>Another example of rip-off Ireland is raised in a letter in the <i>Irish Times</i> today in which a man quotes Stena Sealink as stating that if one booked a ferry ticket from Ireland to Britain, the price was £84 sterling but &euro;240. He asked the reason this was the case and was told it was because of market forces.</P>
      <P>This country needs to take a serious look not at the wage increases of working people but at the practices and presumptions of the business community. The biggest issue is not that there are gradual price increases but the perception that there is a rip-off culture, to which people have become inured.</P>
      <P>It is time the House had a debate on foreign affairs with particular emphasis on Iraq. Donald Rumsfeld is reported this morning as having said he thinks Iraq perhaps destroyed all of its weapons of mass destruction in the period of the invasion. He was asked the reason the Iraqis had not used their weapons and replied that because the war had lasted such a short time, they did not get around to using them. However, they did get around to destroying them.</P>
      <P>This is extremely important. If there are no weapons of mass destruction, the war was fought on a lie told by the President of the United States&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who, to my great embarrassment, is a member of Socialist International. It was fought on a lie which should not be forgotten because of some idea that we should leave the past behind us. If it was fought on a lie, it had no basis. Therefore, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on foreign affairs with particular emphasis on Iraq. The truth is central to this debate &ndash; the one thing we are not getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred yesterday to the need to debate the report of the Convention on the Future of Europe. While I do not disagree with what Senator Brian Hayes has said with regard to having the debate after the final report is drafted, it might be more useful to have it in the interim, before the final report is drafted. There would then still be an opportunity to have an input into the final outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday I commended the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, on the work he has carried out. It is important to note that, as consensus is what is to emerge from the report, Ireland has done well in achieving an alliance of smaller countries which see things in a unified way. There was a very useful meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on <Col N="321" />European Affairs with the relevant French Minister on this issue. There seemed to be an identification of interests and argument in regard to how the convention should be dealt with. Last night the President of the European Parliament addressed the Institute of European Affairs on the matter.</P>
    <P>Some of the big issues include the institutional balance, the number of Commissioners, how the President of the Council might be elected and whether the President might take office for a five year period or whether there should be a continuation of the present system of rotating presidencies where countries hold the position for six months. Important issues are involved. It would be useful, therefore, if at all possible, if the Leader could arrange a debate in the House before the final report is drafted, possibly with the presence of one or other of our members of the convention. We have had a useful interchange with them and to have them in the House again would provide continuity.</P>
    <P>I join Senator O'Toole in extending good wishes to the Garda Commissioner designate, Mr. Noel Conroy. I hope he has a successful term of office.</P>
    <P>A point was raised concerning legislation. It is notable that 15 Bills on the Seanad Order Paper are still with the Dáil. I know you, a Chathaoirligh, would stop me if I told the Dáil how to do its business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It might help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of some concern. The Leader has done a good job in having legislation initiated in this House. I note that today and tomorrow both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have Bills on the Order Paper that will be initiated in the House. That is to be welcomed. If we want to have as many Bills as possible initiated here, it is important that they pass through the Houses rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to the House for a debate on planning regulations. She is probably aware that we need to speed up and improve the planning process in respect of both private and public developments. The debate should also include the matter of pre-planning discussion, provided for in the recent Planning and Development Act. Facilities are not in place in many local authorities for such discussions. This is something that needs to be reviewed nationally, as well as the whole issue of the enforcement of planning regulations. There are serious problems with regard to staff shortages in most local authorities. If we adopt and pass Bills here, it is the citizens' right to see them properly enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Members of the House will have noticed a prominently displayed <Col N="322" />advertisement in recent days for a well-known paint product. Whatever about the quality of the product, the sensitivity of the advertisement leaves much to be desired. It presents an elderly person in a most negative fashion. By extension, it engenders negativity towards all old people. It is a cheap shot at the most vulnerable section of society. The body dealing with age and opportunity has severely criticised it, rightly so. It behoves the House to have a discussion on the area of advertising. I know people get publicity from this type of reaction when we raise a matter but it is not right that the elderly should be used and abused in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues who have asked for a debate on Iraq. It is significant that Mr. Rumsfeld, who I believe stands convicted of being a war criminal, should have made such a point as reported at 7 a.m. on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;. It was a virtual admission that there were no weapons of mass destruction. It was the lead item in the news headlines but by 9 a.m. had dropped to third or fourth place. There was no analysis of what was the most significant item. I find this astonishing and regrettable.</P>
      <P>It also indicates President Bush violated the US Constitution because the only excuse for war is a clear and present danger. He said categorically there was a clear and present danger in Iraq. It is now obvious there was not. However, they probably knew that to begin with. Mr. Rumsfeld, not abashed by any of this, went on to intimate that he was within an ace of declaring war on Iran also. Where is this lunacy going to end? Surely we are going to protest against it. I strongly support Senator Ryan in what he said.</P>
      <P>I ask that in any motion passed by the Seanad we include the terms of the resolution passed unanimously by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. It would assist our very able Minister for Foreign Affairs if he had resolutions from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Seanad. This could be done quickly. There are five motions on Iraq on the Order Paper in the names of Independent Members, Nos. 17, 25, 27, 28 and 29. Members from all sides of the House still feel this is an important issue.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader about the appointment of an ombudsman for children. It is regrettable that, despite the fact we have made legislative provisions for this, it does not seem to have happened. Will the Leader confirm my worrying suspicions on this matter? Senator Ryan and I inserted an extra section in the Children Act providing for the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> to protect the rights of children. There has been no appointment to this post either. Can we have an appointment for both the ombudsman for children and the guardian <i>ad litem</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in the call for an update briefing on the Convention on the Future for Europe for which I asked the Leader two weeks ago. There are still sensitive areas <Col N="323" />within the consensus of opinion on areas such as the future of the Union's institutions and taxation policies. There was an interesting meeting yesterday with the French foreign affairs delegation when many of these points were raised. It is important that we have a debate before the final verdict of the convention is made known.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Bannon's call for a debate on planning regulations, for which I have looked before as there are many anomalies in planning legislation. A debate would serve to highlight them and can see how we could rectify them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator O'Toole and other Members in congratulating Mr. Noel Conroy on his appointment as Commissioner designate of the Garda Síochána and wish him well on what is undoubtedly a tough and challenging task. Never before in the history of the Garda Síochána, from issues of management to morale, has strong leadership been needed.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to organise a debate on the Ombudsman's report for 2002 which has been published for some time. As we know, it is always good from the point of view of analysis and recommendations. It is particularly timely by virtue of the fact that the new Ombudsman is taking up her appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House ask both the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance to arrange for the three major reports on the health service &ndash; the Hanly, Brennan and Prospectus reports &ndash; to be published as soon as possible? It would also be helpful if they were published in advance of Government decisions on the service. It is clear that they are widely available to the media, yet Members of both Houses do not have access to them. I ask that they be placed in the Oireachtas Library as soon as possible. The Government could then, in its own time, get on with decision-making with regard to the recommendations made in the reports. It happened in the case of the rail review also. These reports are widely available in the media long before they are made available to us.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to arrange for last night's &ldquo;True Lives&rdquo; programme on the horrific effects of car accidents to be made available in schools, particularly in transition year and leaving certificate classes? The horrific effects of speeding and alcohol, particularly on the families of young men, should be brought home to the greatest possible extent to young people and this programme would play a very useful role in doing that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically recall the debate on the Bill because I had a group here from a school in Nenagh and they were hugely impressed with the idea of an ombudsman for children. Those students have left school at this stage and moved on to third level and it is not acceptable that the Government should drag its heels on this important appointment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not often happen but as someone who has more than a passing interest in sport and the media, I want to congratulate the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on an initiative that worked from the time he took it on last year to its eventual fruition yesterday when the Football Association of Ireland concluded an agreement with RTE, the State broadcaster, for the provision of free to air international football matches. This is the first fruits of the legislation that came through this House, <Col N="325" />initiated by the Minister. The former Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, once said he will probably not be remembered for bringing down the rate of inflation but he will be remembered for other matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant that in a positive light. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, deserves the congratulations of this House on seeing an extremely difficult initiative through to its final conclusion.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader once again to consider providing some time for either statements or a debate on the annual International Fund for Ireland report. It has been a tradition in this House over the past ten years that the Leader has made time available for such a debate, particularly for those of us from the Border counties and the west who benefit greatly from this fund. In light of the severe criticisms levelled at it by a financial watchdog in the United States, it is timely that we would have an opportunity to rebut those inaccuracies and support Willie McCarter and the board of the IFI in the excellent work they do.</P>

      <P>I support Senators Brian Hayes, Dardis and Ormonde in their calls for a debate on the report on the Convention on the Future of Europe. There are many issues in the report of huge concern to small countries and it is timely that we should address them.</P>
      <P>On the question of increasing prices, and rip-off Ireland was referred to again today, we are all concerned about the impact on competitiveness of fuel and service costs.</P>

      <P>I support the call made by Senator Terry yesterday for a debate on facilities for people with a disability because it will give us the opportunity to reflect on the many fine initiatives taken over the past six years in terms of residential care, day care facilities and special needs assistants, to mention but a few. As the Minister finalises the disability Bill, it would also give us the opportunity to make our own input into the final stages of that legislation in terms of what needs to be done. Senator Terry is right. More needs to be done.</P>
      <P>In respect of what Senator O'Meara said about the programme last night, I believe a tape of the programme should be sent to every school in the country.</P>

      <P>Late last year in this House we initiated the National Tourism Development Authority Bill, which paved the way to allow CERT and Bord Fáilte to merge. This week, the Minister is due to officially sign the order to allow the merger to take place, but an industrial dispute is ongoing. I stressed in the debate on the Bill in the House that after the merger nobody in any organisation should be less well off in terms of pay and conditions. Negotiations on that issue have failed to reach a successful conclusion and on that basis I appeal to the Minister to suspend the merger process until such time as this issue has been sorted out.</P>
      <P>I subscribe to the sentiments expressed by my colleagues, Senators O'Meara and Kett, on the &ldquo;True Lives&rdquo; documentary screened last night. I pay tribute to the courage and the bravery of the families of victims of road carnage&mdash;</P>

      <P>Mr. Padraic White appeared before the committee on transport this morning to discuss the Rail Procurement Agency. I have called previously for a debate on the arbitration process, and the importance of this issue was brought home to me again today. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government &ndash; this impacts on local authorities &ndash; to address the outrageous situation regarding arbitration.</P>
      <P>Mr. Padraic White explained that in the case of Luas, the arbitration process has resulted in the costs of land acquisition increasing fourfold because people can put a completely false price on land and pretend it will be part of an elaborate development scheme which has no chance in reality of getting planning permission. They can make that case when the land is being acquired. Also, they are entitled to get a 9% top-up for reinvestment.</P>

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of the Opposition, indicated that 20 June was the date for the ratification of the convention and called for an all-day discussion on the convention on the following Tuesday, 24 June. The effects of the convention are huge and they will affect us all for years to come. I fully agree, therefore, that we should have an all-day debate on the issue prior to the publication of the final report. Following previous requests by Senator Ormonde and other Senators to have a debate in the House, I made a proposal to that effect. I hope we can have the debate when we return after next week's break. Senator Brian Hayes stated the Praesidium has not yet considered 1,000 amendments tabled to the draft report. As it is a draft report, I hope it will be amended before the final version is published.</P>
      <P>The Senator also asked for a debate on minimum sentences. I am loath to intervene in the work of the courts as their jurisdiction and the jurisdiction of the Oireachtas are distinct. I will read the comments of Mr. Justice Hardiman to which he referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill amends the Maternity Protection Act 1994 by making a number of improvements to its provisions which protect employees who are pregnant, or who have recently given birth. The Bill implements the recommendations made by the working group on the review and improvement of the maternity protection legislation. The working group, which reported in January 2001, was set up in accordance with commitments in the Government action programme for the millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fair<Col N="332" />ness. It was chaired by my Department and included representatives from all pillars of social partnership, relevant Departments and the Equality Authority, etc.</P>
      <P>The previous Government had no hesitation in accepting the recommendations of the working group in full and the principal recommendations to extend the duration of maternity and additional maternity leave were immediately implemented in 2001. The remaining recommendations which require primary legislation to amend the Maternity Protection Act 1994 will be implemented by the enactment of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The latest social partnership agreement contains a package of legislation, codes and programmes in relation to workplace relations and environment. This package of measures aims to protect employee rights, ensure greater equality, promote health and safety and bring about a better work-life balance. The improvements to the maternity protection legislation now proposed are clearly consistent with each of these aims and provide clear evidence of the Government's commitment to fully implement the new partnership agreement.</P>
      <P>Work-life balance initiatives are important, not only in the context of assisting employees in combining employment and personal responsibilities, but also in underpinning social and equality objectives. It is imperative, therefore, that we meet the challenge of developing innovative measures which reflect the reality of today's workplace and the personal and social responsibilities which employees encounter.</P>
      <P>The increased number of women in the labour force has been one of the main contributory factors in our economic growth which allowed the economy to expand without being stifled by major skill shortages. In 1994, the female labour force participation rate was 39%. According to the latest CSO figures, it is now almost 49%. Furthermore, the EU Presidency conclusions on equal opportunities and social inclusion in Lisbon and Nice in 2000 set a target of 60% employment for women by 2010, and an interim target of 57% by 2005. Complying with these targets will mean a further increase in the number of women of childbearing years in the labour force.</P>
      <P>Our economic climate is, in itself, a driving force in addressing obstacles to women's participation in the labour force, particularly in skilled employment. Employers do not want to lose trained and skilled women and are looking at ways of retaining them in employment. The need to ensure continued economic growth is putting the employment and the retention of women in the workforce at centre stage. This is not only an equality issue but also an economic one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent statistics show that of the number of women currently in Irish employment, over 62% are aged between 15 and 45 &ndash; the ages roughly corresponding to childbearing age. There were 29,042 maternity benefit payments awarded to employed or self-employed women in 2002. In all, 60,521 children were born in 2002. It is imperative <Col N="333" />that our legislation recognises the valuable contribution made by working mothers and provides support for them in the workplace.</P>
    <P>Maternity protection is a fundamental right of any pregnant employee and one which has been enshrined in our legislation since 1981. It is somewhat disappointing therefore that over 20 years later, pregnancy discrimination, and in particular pregnancy related dismissals, remain a significant issue in the workplace. In the Labour Court last year, there were five determinations issued in 2002 where pregnancy was cited and the court found that discrimination had occurred in all five cases. Employers were ordered to pay substantial financial compensation and this should act as a deterrent to pregnancy related discrimination, particularly in its more subtle forms. This sends an unequivocal message to employers that such discrimination will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that an employee who is absent from work on additional maternity leave shall benefit from all employment rights associated with the employment &ndash; except remuneration and superannuation benefits &ndash; such as seniority and annual leave entitlements. In addition, all employment rights shall be unaffected during an employee's paid absence from work to avail of new entitlements under this Bill to paid time off from work to attend ante-natal classes and to breastfeed. I shall detail these new entitlements later, which incidentally will require regulations to be put in place after the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains new entitlements for breastfeeding mothers, who often experience particular difficulty in returning to work after the birth of a child. It is internationally recognised that breastfeeding is the most beneficial method of infant feeding. In their global strategy on infant and young child feeding, the World Health Organisation states, &ldquo;Breastfeeding is an unequalled way of providing ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants.&rdquo; The strategy cites paid maternity leave, part-time work arrangements, on-site crèches, facilities for expressing and storing breast milk, and breastfeeding breaks as enabling conditions for women in paid employment to continue breastfeeding.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings Ireland closer to international provisions for breastfeeding mothers. Section 8 provides that an employee who is breastfeeding, and who has informed her employer that she is doing so, shall be entitled until the child is four months old either to breastfeeding breaks, where facilities for breastfeeding are provided in the workplace, or a reduction of working hours, without loss of pay in either case. This important and new statutory entitlement will facilitate breastfeeding mothers on their return to employment.</P>
    <P>The important health advantages of breastfeeding more than justify the introduction of these provisions. These advantages are maximised when breastfeeding is sustained for longer per<Col N="334" />iods. Research commissioned by a number of health boards shows that returning to work can influence the decision of Irish women to cease breastfeeding. For example, in a study commissioned by the Midland Health Board in 2000, 30% of respondents gave &ldquo;returning to work&rdquo; as the reason for ceasing breastfeeding.</P>
    <P>Although the research evidence on the value of breastfeeding, for both mothers and babies, is compelling, the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland continues to be among the lowest in Europe. The Government recognises that breastfeeding of infants and young children provides one of the best opportunities to give children a good start in life. The national health strategy aims to strengthen measures to promote and support breastfeeding and identifies key areas for action in order to re-establish a breastfeeding culture in Ireland. One key action is to promote, support and protect breastfeeding in homes, schools, workplaces and in society generally.</P>
    <P>Research from other EU countries which provide similar facilities is encouraging. In Sweden, rates of exclusive breastfeeding at four months have climbed from a low of less than 20% in the mid 1970s to almost 70% in 1997. An additional 15% are partially breastfed at this stage. These figures are high by international standards, despite significant female participation in the workforce. This has been attributed to, among other family friendly initiatives, the provision of paid breastfeeding breaks during a working day for all breastfeeding mothers.</P>
    <P>During the course of the review, the working group examined work-related barriers to breastfeeding. It concluded that the length of leave available at that time to mothers who wished to breastfeed was restrictive and there was a very short time period in which to establish an effective breastfeeding pattern. Shortly after the conclusion of the working group's deliberations, the recommendation to increase both the period of maternity leave and additional maternity leave was implemented by means of secondary legislation. Both the entitlement to maternity leave attracting a payment, and the optional unpaid additional maternity leave, increased by four weeks, bringing the overall entitlement to 18 weeks maternity leave and eight weeks additional maternity leave. This Bill incorporates the increased leave entitlements which offer mothers the option of up to 22 weeks post-confinement maternity leave and the chance to establish an effective breastfeeding pattern.</P>
    <P>Provision of paid time off for attendance at ante-natal classes was also considered by the working group. The Institute of Obstetrics, which was consulted on the matter, was of the opinion that a pregnant woman needs to attend one complete set of ante-natal classes in the interest of her health and safety during the course of pregnancy. Ante-natal classes form an intrinsic part of the ante-natal care package, particularly in a woman's first pregnancy. The 1994 Act provides, in accordance with regulations, for time off without <Col N="335" />loss of pay for ante-natal and post-natal care. The current definition of ante-natal care does not include ante-natal classes. In line with one of the recommendations of the working group, section 7 of this Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>During the pre-confinement stage, fathers can offer invaluable support to expectant mothers. Therefore, we are introducing a section which gives expectant fathers a once off entitlement to time off work, without loss of pay, to attend the last two ante-natal classes in a set of such classes.</P>
    <P>While the overriding purpose of the review was to enhance the protections available to employees who are pregnant or who have recently given birth, the working group took account of the costs to employers of its recommendations. The recommendation to increase the maternity leave periods, which was implemented in March 2001, would have incurred the most cost for employers and the Exchequer. Some of the other provisions of the Bill will have minor cost implications for employers. Employer costs will be incurred in the provision of paid time off to attend ante-natal classes, the provision of either breastfeeding breaks where breastfeeding facilities are provided or a reduction of working hours and the preservation of certain employment rights while on additional maternity leave. The benefits of the recommendations, not only to employers but to the economy in general, were also considered. As I mentioned earlier, incentives which can assist in keeping women in the labour force are beneficial to employers and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>The working group also considered the concerns, as expressed by female employees themselves, in relation to combining pregnancy and caring for new-born babies with work commitments. In particular, they consulted a report, New Mothers at Work, commissioned by the Employment Equality Agency and published in 1999, which documents the difficulties experienced by 30 women in combining motherhood and the demands of the workplace. A strong theme which emerged from this research was that women interviewed wanted to stay in the labour force, but felt inadequately supported by legislative and other measures in exercising their preferred choice. It is hoped that the provisions of this Bill can help alleviate this problem by providing the necessary support to mothers returning to work after childbirth.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is a standard provision dealing with interpretation. Sections 2 and 4 incorporate Statutory Instrument No. 29 of 2001 which gave effect to the working group's recommendation to increase the periods of maternity leave and additional maternity leave. The implementation of the recommendation to increase both the period of maternity leave and additional maternity leave, as mentioned earlier, has been in effect since March 2001. The implementation of this recommendation was fast-tracked ahead of the implementation of the other recommendations to <Col N="336" />ensure that the benefits of the increased leave entitlement would be realised as soon as possible. It is a widely held view, supported by leave arrangements in several other countries, that the best interests of infants under 12 months old are served where they remain in the direct care of their parents. The provision of 18 weeks paid leave entitlement with the option of four weeks additional unpaid leave means that Ireland is now in a favourable position when compared with many other EU member states. Sections 2 and 4 of the Bill provide that the Minister may by order extend the periods of maternity and/or additional maternity leave.</P>
    <P>Section 3 safeguards an employee's entitlement to the extended minimum period of 18 weeks maternity leave where premature births are concerned. Section 5 provides that in the event of the sickness of the employee, an employer may agree to the employee's request to terminate her period of additional maternity leave. Once terminated, the employee shall not be entitled to take the remainder of the additional maternity leave at a later date. Any absence from work due to sickness following the termination of the period of additional maternity leave shall be treated in the same manner as any absence from work of the employee due to sickness.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that in the event of the hospitalisation of the child, an employer may agree to an employee's request to postpone her maternity leave and/or additional maternity leave and allow her to return to work on an agreed date. It will only be possible to postpone maternity leave where the employee has taken at least 14 weeks maternity leave, four of which are after the end of the week of the birth. This may appear to be overly restrictive, but we are constrained by the Pregnant Workers Directive which provides for a continuous period of 14 weeks maternity leave. Where the employer agrees to a postponement of maternity leave and/or additional maternity leave and where the employee has adhered to certain notification requirements, the employee shall be entitled to take her postponed leave in one continuous block, which will be known as resumed leave. The resumed leave must commence not later than seven days after the discharge of the child from hospital. In the case of the employee's absence from work due to sickness during the period of the postponement, the employee is deemed to have commenced their resumed leave unless they opt to forfeit the right to resumed leave. The absence from work due to sickness shall be treated in the same manner as any absence from work due to sickness.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill applies similar provisions to fathers in certain circumstances. It should be noted that a father's right to leave under our maternity protection legislation is not constrained by the directive, which did not refer to fathers. Therefore, in the event of the hospitalisation of his child, a father may apply to his employer to postpone the commencement of his leave or <Col N="337" />where he has already commenced such leave, he may apply at any time to postpone such leave and temporarily return to work. Upon enactment of the Bill, regulations will be put in place to govern the detailed operation of the postponement provisions with respect to the maximum period of postponement of leave and the evidence to be furnished to the employer of the hospitalisation and the discharge from hospital of the child.</P>
    <P>I have already given a broad outline of the provisions included in section 7, which deals with the issue of attendance at ante-natal classes, and section 8, which provides for entitlements for breastfeeding mothers. Entitlement to paid time off from work to attend one complete set of ante-natal classes does not include the last three classes in such a set as ordinarily these are attended during the employee's pre-confinement maternity leave.</P>
    <P>It can sometimes be the case that a pregnancy does not go to full term because of premature birth. In such cases, the mother may not have availed of her entitlement to attend a complete set of classes and hence section 7 provides that the set of classes may be attended during one or more pregnancies. In other words, she can carry them forward to future pregnancies.</P>
    <P>The entitlement provided in section 8 of the Bill to facilitate breastfeeding mothers in the workplace is in line with the recommendation of the working group. The Bill provides that employees are entitled until the child is four months old either to breastfeeding breaks in the workplace or a reduction of working hours, without loss of pay. Employers shall not be required to provide facilities for breastfeeding breaks in the workplace where the provision of such facilities would give rise to more than a nominal cost. Where breastfeeding breaks are not provided, the employer shall be required to agree a reduction of working hours with the employee without reducing pay. As with the entitlement to attend ante-natal classes, it is necessary to balance the rights and obligations of both employees and employers. In this case, a workable statutory entitlement for breastfeeding mothers in employment has been framed. The detailed arrangements will be introduced shortly by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 9 incorporates the father's existing statutory entitlement to leave where the mother dies during the period of her maternity leave. Consequential amendments are provided to deal with a situation where the father's leave under section 16 of the 1994 Act is postponed or terminated or where the mother's leave was postponed or terminated prior to her death.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to sections 10 and 11 which apply corresponding provisions to fathers as provided to mothers under sections 5 and 6, which deal with the termination and postponement provisions, respectively. Section 12 amends the definition of protective leave in the 1994 Act and provides that the period of leave taken prior to postponement and the period of <Col N="338" />resumed leave after postponement shall be treated as separate periods of protective leave. Protective leave encompasses maternity leave, additional maternity leave, leave to which a father is entitled under section 16 of the principal Act, whether or not any of such leave types are postponed under this Bill, and leave granted in respect of health and safety considerations and night work.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is primarily concerned with employment rights and provides an amendment to the 1994 Act to provide that employees absent from work on additional maternity leave will be treated for the purposes of all employment rights, other than remuneration and superannuation benefits, as if they remained at work. This provision also applies to employees absent from work for the purposes of attending ante-natal classes or breastfeeding in accordance with this Bill. In effect, this means that time spent on such leave will be counted as service for the purposes of calculating increments, annual leave and seniority.</P>
    <P>Employees who avail of the new entitlements in relation to ante-natal classes and breastfeeding are afforded protection under sections 14 and 15 with respect to the termination or suspension of their employment. Section 16 is a technical amendment to clarify that the provisions of the 1994 Act regarding periods of probation, training and apprenticeship apply to both female and male employees who are absent from work on protective leave. Section 17 strengthens the provisions relating to the return to work of an employee who was on protective leave to give effect to the 2002 Gender Equal Treatment Directive. An employee returning to work from protective leave will have a statutory entitlement to any improvement in the terms or conditions of the employment to which she or he would have been entitled if she or he had not been absent on protective leave.</P>
    <P>Section 18 applies to employees who return to work on the expiry of protective leave and are offered suitable alternative work, as the resumption of the work which they carried out before their protective leave is not practicable. In such a case, the terms or conditions of the alternative work shall not be less favourable to the employee than those of her contract of employment immediately before protective leave. Employees in this position are also entitled to any improvement in the terms or conditions of the employment to which she or he would have been entitled if she or he had not been absent on protective leave. This section gives effect to the 2002 Gender Equal Treatment Directive. The remaining sections in the Bill deal with technical amendments to the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a wider package of statutory worklife balance measures to which my Department is committed under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. Yesterday, the Government approved the drafting of amendments to the Adoptive Leave Act which will apply the appro<Col N="339" />priate outstanding recommendations of the maternity protection review group to the adoptive leave legislation. It is the Government's intention to incorporate the necessary amendments to the adoptive leave legislation into the Bill once it passes to Committee Stage. Furthermore, the parental leave legislation is also due to be amended in line with the agreed recommendations of the working group on the review of that Act.</P>
    <P>The Government has also provided a financial commitment of more than &euro;436 million funding for my Department's Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme 2000-2006 to facilitate the development of a well structured and high quality child care service to help parents to meet their child care needs and to enable them to remain in or return to employment, training and education. The increased maternity leave entitlement applied in 2001 alleviates, to a degree, the demand for high quality affordable child care for babies under the age of 12 months. This complemented the equal opportunities child care programme which aims to increase the supply of child care places by 50% over the seven years of the programme and early indications show that these targets will be met.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the contributions of the Senators on this legislation which will improve the rights of expectant parents, employees who have recently given birth and breastfeeding employees. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to discuss this important Bill, which aims to improve maternity protection for employees. The Minister of State acknowledged the large number of women who have contributed, and who continue to contribute, to our economy. However, he has missed a valuable opportunity to improve the position of working parents. Ireland is far behind other countries in terms of maternity protection provision and the Bill fails to address many problems in this area.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains a number of worthwhile provisions. Section 6 provides for the postponement of additional maternity leave if a child is hospitalised, while, under section 7, expectant mothers can attend one set of ante-natal classes without loss of pay. It also provides fathers with the right to attend the final two ante-natal classes with paid leave. The legislation also provides that an employee's absence from work on additional maternity leave will count for all employment rights associated with the employment, seniority and annual leave. These provisions are necessary and welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am concerned about a number of aspects of the legislation. Section 5 relates to the determination of additional maternity leave if the mother falls ill but it may be in breach of Directive 92/85 on pregnant workers. The section provides that where a woman falls ill on maternity leave, such leave will be terminated and her ill<Col N="340" />ness will be treated as sick leave, as would be the case with other employees. This is as it should be but a difficulty arises in that when the mother recovers, section 5(4)(<i>b</i>) states, &ldquo;The employee shall not be entitled to the additional maternity leave or the part of it not taken by her at the date of such termination.&rdquo; This is illogical and absolutely unjust. There is no reason to prevent an employee from availing of the balance of her maternity leave, which had been suspended because of her sickness. It is an unfair provision, which I hope the Minister will address. I will table an amendment in this regard on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 8 relates to breastfeeding breaks. While I welcome the recognition of the benefits of breastfeeding and that facilities should be provided for mothers who breastfeed, the legislation falls short in terms of what should be provided. Giving legislative backing to breastfeeding-lactation breaks to mothers in the workplace for four months after giving birth will have little impact. As the Minister of State said, the vast majority of women will still be on maternity leave four months after giving birth. This provision will never come into effect because most parents will take maternity, paternal and unpaid leave.</P>
    <P>The legislation addresses the recommendations in the report of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation, which was published in January 2001. At the time, maternity leave entitlement was 14 weeks paid leave and four weeks unpaid leave. The Department of Health and Children's national breastfeeding policy recommended that all women should be encouraged to breastfeed for at least four months but, in the intervening period, maternity leave entitlement has been extended to 18 weeks paid leave and eight weeks unpaid leave. The Department's optimal infant and young child nutrition policy has changed and mothers are recommended to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months and continue breastfeeding thereafter in combination with solids for up to two years and beyond. The legislation will be outdated even before it is passed into law because these changes are not taken into account.</P>
    <P>As we attempt to promote breastfeeding and provide for it in legislation, we need to examine what has happened in other countries and learn from them. Ireland's breastfeeding rate is among the lowest in Europe. We could look to other European countries for good practice. For example, the breastfeeding rate in the UK is 69%; Switzerland, 92%; Norway, 99%; Sweden, 98%; Austria, 96.4%; Spain, 85%; and Italy, 85%. Ireland is way behind in terms of the number of mothers who are breastfeeding. We are not doing enough to promote breastfeeding and the results are obvious.</P>
    <P>I refer to the legislative cover for breastfeeding-lactation breaks in European countries. Ireland is also well behind in this regard and the Bill will not improve the position. The breastfeeding rate in Austria is 96.4% and mothers are <Col N="341" />entitled to one 45 minute break for every four hours worked. In Norway, where 99% of mothers breastfeed, two hour long breaks are provided daily and in Italy, where 85% of mothers breastfeed, two one hour breaks are provided for up to seven months following childbirth. The breastfeeding rate in Spain is 85% and a one hour break is provided for each day or the working day is shortened by 30 minutes up to nine months following childbirth. The legislation does not address the issues faced by mothers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, greater provision should be extended to all mothers, whether they are breastfeeding. For example, there could be two working women in an office, one of whom breastfeeds her child while the other bottle feeds. It would be grossly unfair if the breastfeeding mother was entitled to leave the office to feed her child or to work a shorter day while the bottle feeding mother would have to remain in the office. All mothers and babies must be treated equally. It must be recognised that some women have difficulty breastfeeding. What about mothers who adopt children? The broader picture must be examined.</P>
    <P>I have great difficulty with the lack of obligation on employers to provide facilities for mothers and their babies. When will this issue be addressed? The Bill is too light on employers. If more women are to be encouraged into the workplace, this issue must be addressed. Family friendly policies must be adopted. There is no serious intent in the legislation to make it mandatory on employers to provide breastfeeding facilities in the workplace. The reduction in working hours is not defined and, therefore, it is virtually meaningless. How much time should be provided for mothers to breastfeed? How many times a day can they breastfeed? If they are to take shorter working hours because there is no facility for the baby in the building or its vicinity, what is the extent of the shorter working hours the Minister is suggesting? What constitutes a reduction in working hours? If this is not included in the Bill, employers will decide for themselves what they should provide for mothers.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed with this Bill. The Government had a great opportunity to make changes, to move forward, to try to come into line with some of our European partners. We have missed that opportunity and the problems have not been addressed. While there are some provisions that I support, the nuts and bolts are not in place and the Government has not moved forward to provide for working mothers and fathers. Therefore I will not support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I was interested to hear some of Senator Terry's comments, which I will address at the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope today, 28 May, will be an historic day for maternity protection in this country. We have moved considerably from Ireland of the past. In the times of the Vikings and Norsemen there were invaders who killed and raped our fathers, <Col N="342" />sons and mothers. During the Famine, mothers starved themselves to feed the family first. In the &ldquo;modern Ireland&rdquo; up to 1972 there was a marriage bar. Contraception was not available and it was necessary to get on a train and travel to Northern Ireland to buy a packet of condoms. Then we made some great changes and it was possible to go to a doctor and get them on prescription. We did not have equal pay until the 1970s. Although some people are beginning to break through it, the glass ceiling still exists. In 1984 maternity leave was introduced.</P>
    <P>With due respect to the Minister of State, I listened with some amusement to his speech. To measure the value of women in terms of their contribution to the economy and the need to facilitate them sometimes concerns me. This represents one of the difficulties I have with Government policy in this area. There was a car bumper sticker, which stated: &ldquo;Be nice to your kids because they pick your nursing home.&rdquo; It is time for us to ensure we provide the best type of facilities for mothers bearing the children who will look after the future of our country.</P>
    <P>When the maternity legislation was introduced in 1984, a very different scenario pertained. No other regulations existed to protect pregnant women then and things have changed greatly now. At that time there was probably some wise old man in the Department of Justice who felt it was important to oblige women to take at least four weeks off before having their babies in order to protect them as much as possible. A woman entitled to 14 weeks maternity leave must take four weeks before having the baby. Nobody thought about the fact that many babies do not arrive on time and can come two weeks late.</P>
    <P>It is possible to imagine a scenario where a woman goes on maternity leave four weeks before her confinement date because she has to. If her pregnancy goes to 42 weeks she will have been sitting at home &ndash; perhaps twiddling her thumbs because it might be her first baby &ndash; for six weeks. When the baby comes, she finds she has to go back to work much sooner than she intended. She would have preferred to have had all that time after the birth. Some people have said that to change that would take away women's rights.</P>
    <P>When this was reviewed in 1991, an amendment was put to the then Minister whose response was as follows:</P>
    <P>Under the existing 1981 maternity legislation, the minimum period specified is four weeks before and after the birth. The general wisdom is that to remove this requirement before birth would be a reduction in protection and contrary to the directive.</P>
    <P>The directive in question was 92/85/EEC, the pregnant workers' directive. The working group report stated:</P>
    <P>Arguments in favour of a reduction of a pre-confinement period to two weeks were supported by the number of queries on the subject <Col N="343" />received from the Employment Equality Agency and the Equality Authority. In the light of the pregnant workers' directive, some members of the group felt that a two-week compulsory period before the confinement would generally serve the needs of pregnant women. It was considered that there is ample evidence of this, both in terms of queries dealt with by the Employment Equality Agency and particularly in view of anecdotal evidence that many women submit medical certificates with incorrect confinement dates, which means that in effect they only take two weeks before their confinement.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that this anecdotal evidence is factual. The majority of women applying for maternity benefit put false dates on their application forms because they want the time off after the baby is born.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that in 2002, some 29,700 women made applications for maternity leave. The majority of those women wanted to have the time available to them afterwards and they want the right to choose. I am being told that someone in the EU has decided that to change this would remove a right from Irish women and that they must take four weeks before confinement date. Do they not understand we are the mothers and we are talking about our bodies and our babies? Do they not understand we are the best people in association with our doctors to decide when we will take that maternity leave? The only right that has been taken from us is the right to choose.</P>
    <P>I will continue to make the case that the four weeks is not a defined right but a frustrating regulation. We only need to ask the women what they want to do. Anybody here can ask his wife, sister or mother what she put on her application form. What do the officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform put on their application forms? I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not here, because I had this discussion with him when he was Attorney General. He accepted this is what the women are doing, but he felt it could not be changed. However, we can change it and I sincerely hope we will not allow this opportunity to pass.</P>
    <P>If women are healthy enough, should we not be allowed the right to choose whether we want to take two, three, four or 14 weeks before having a baby? Our system is forcing expectant mothers to put unusual dates on their maternity leave benefit forms. Did it never strike anybody that Ireland might have the highest rate of premature babies in the world? All our babies come two weeks early, based on the social welfare certificates, because women are declaring confinement dates two weeks later than the expected date.</P>
    <P>We have the right to choose. We need to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Europe. We should get the faceless European bureaucrat to come here and listen to what the women of Ireland want and let us determine whether it is safe for us to continue to work. <Col N="344" />If the compulsory four week period before the confinement date were eliminated, I know of no employer who would put pressure on a woman, 36 to 38 weeks pregnant, to work longer. The most important thing for a woman having a baby is the health and safety of that child. Even if the employer is putting her under pressure, the woman will stand up for the health of her baby.</P>
    <P>I accept that the advice of the Attorney General was sought and it was to the effect that we should not take away a right. However, we want to enhance the right. We want to recognise and regulate for what is happening. The Minister can do so within this legislation. I do not want to tell the women of Ireland that Europe says nothing has changed since 1984, that they must take the four weeks, that it is their right and that Europe does not want to take that right away from them. The message is that we want the right to make the choice. Tell the Attorney General's office we need to go back to the EU and tell it what we want. We want the right to choose, which we have sought through history. I hope the Minister of State will look at this issue. He is responsible for equality and he should decide this is correct.</P>
    <P>Things have changed and we have new health and safety protections in place. If someone is in danger while pregnant, the health and safety legislation for maternity protection comes into effect. The situation has changed since this legislation was introduced in 1984. We can make this happen because it is common sense and it is what people want.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State returns on Committee Stage with an amendment that removes the pre-confinement regulation and allows this to be a matter of choice. Two weeks appear to be what most people want. Over 29,000 women, partners and doctors are filling in forms that do not tell the truth. We want the right to choose. I hope the Minister takes up this battle on all fronts and comes back to the House to tell us the change people sought has been made.</P>
    <P>I want to paint a picture for the House. It might be a stretch for Members but they should imagine a female Taoiseach of 37 who is having a baby. If the baby comes in the middle of a confidence vote or during deliberations on the Finance Bill, what is that female Taoiseach to tell the country? What will she say to her doctors? &ldquo;Hurry up, I have to get back to Leinster House to vote&rdquo; or &ldquo;Doctor, you have to come to Leinster House to deliver my baby there&rdquo;. Oireachtas Members and paid local councillors have no right to maternity leave. What are we saying to the women of Ireland? All political parties come out with claptrap about wanting more young people and more women involved. However, we do not even provide the basics such as breastfeeding breaks &ndash; what a laugh.</P>
    <P>I brought my two babies from Galway to Dublin on a daily basis to feed them. I took a hotel room in Buswell's Hotel and stole offices from people here to breastfeed them. Why? It was not <Col N="345" />because I would not have been generously paired by the Opposition, as I would have &ndash; it was the principle. I had no right to stay at home with my baby in Galway. Breastfeed for 20 weeks &ndash; what a joke. If one is a Government Member one's place is here and one is expected to vote. If a woman is a member of a local authority and it comes to Estimates, nobody will have much sympathy if she says she cannot vote because she is in hospital having her baby.</P>
    <P>This is another challenge for the Minister of State. Where can we insert a provision in the legislation dealing with this issue? It is not a political issue but an equality issue and I hope we can deal with it. Let us think of that female Taoiseach having a baby and let us make sure the facilities are in place to ensure she does not have to leave the delivery room to come back to vote in Leinster House. We must create a mechanism which allows her vote to be registered in those special circumstances.</P>
    <P>Politics is a difficult game and if we want to encourage more people into it we must do something about this. This is our first time to examine this legislation in some years. Though I do not know the technicalities of drafting the Bill, it should be possible to provide a simple regulation to cover a situation where a female Member of the Oireachtas or local authority member is entitled to register their vote and take appropriate maternity leave.</P>
    <P>I sometimes find it difficult to look critically at legislation which seeks to create a better balance between work and life. I accept Senator Terry's point about creating divisions between women who are breastfeeding and those bottle feeding but her suggestion will not work from an employment point of view. I run a business with many female employees and I know how difficult it is. Providing breaks for people who are bottle feeding as well as those who are breastfeeding may not be practicable or workable but perhaps we should think about it.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to be critical of the Minister of State but I take grave exception to one of his comments: &ldquo;The increased maternity leave entitlement applied in 2001 alleviates to a degree the demand for high quality affordable child care for babies under the age of 12 months.&rdquo; That is not the case. It has certainly helped but as soon as one becomes pregnant in Ireland, one must go on a waiting list for a crèche place unless one has other supports. We need to do more in this area. I accept all that has been done, including the fine contribution of the Minister of State and his Department. However, no one in the Department should think that the need for high quality affordable child care for babies has been alleviated to a degree, as it has not.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is timely. Many different groups in society have negotiated on this issue and I have always felt that we are behind the game regarding maternity provisions. In particular we have been behind Europe. One of the solid reasons for the support of the trade union movement for the second Nice treaty referendum was the feeling that many groups, particularly women, were looked after better by governments reacting to the demands of European directives than acting of their own volition. That goes back to the equality legislation of 1977 and all that has happened since.</P>
      <P>I support the case Senator Cox made and her final point is the real issue. Every time I am at a meeting where maternity issues are discussed, the meeting quickly goes on to child care. The Government takes the wrong perspective on this, looking on it as either a cost or a support. Anyone looking at the whole structure of employment in society recognises we need more women in the workforce. That is not a feminist view but the view of anyone taking a clear view of society. The importance of having women at decision-making levels in society is hugely important. They lose out because of the natural consequences of childbirth and there are aspects of that which cannot be addressed or compensated for in any way, but we must look at this issue in other ways.</P>
      <P>The lack of progress in making available affordable child care is appalling. There should be choice in that area, with a combination of nurseries, preschools, crèches and other facilities open to parents. Parents should feel they have made safe, secure arrangements for their children. When they drop their babies off in the morning at crèches, nurseries, playgroups, preschools or primary nursery schools, they should feel those are safe environments for their children, with all the proper supports. That is true of recognised establishments. I regularly meet people who have to make compromise arrangements with which they are not completely satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue to which I wish to refer &ndash; I raised it on each occasion the House has discussed maternity protection since I became a Member and prior to that in the context of earlier maternity legislation &ndash; is the idea which some, obviously male, bureaucrats have that women can produce babies like boxes of chocolates at Christmas and on the correct date. It is absolutely appalling. These people are definitely not living in the real world. I wonder if their spouses or partners have ever had children, if they have ever been present at the birth of a child or if they know what is involved in terms of the delivery of <Col N="347" />children, who can be up to a fortnight or more late in arriving or who can be born prematurely. All sorts of things may happen.</P>
    <P>The idea to which I refer is ridiculous and is based on the ignorance of people who believe that women can produce babies to a set timetable. It forces people to be dishonest. People applying for maternity leave pick a date &ndash; which they may not believe to be correct, but which is later than the due date and which suits them &ndash; in order to ensure that they do not have to leave work too early. It does not make any sense. It is a small matter and it should be changed.</P>
    <P>I generally support the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the provisions of the Bill, I agree with Senator Terry. It is our position that the Bill does not go far enough and, therefore, we will not support it on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State pointed to the advances that have been made in this area, but it is worth recalling that, to a large extent and until the onset of Celtic tiger economy, this country had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into the world of social protection, particularly for women employees. I refer here not only to maternity protection, but also to equal pay and a range of social protection measures in that regard. While these were welcome improvements, as Senator O'Toole and I have stated &ndash; particularly in respect of the Nice treaty, etc. &ndash; women voters are aware that many of the benefits that were gained in recent years came about by virtue of our participation in the European Union. As already stated, however, we had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into line with the European model.</P>
      <P>The Bill shows that the Government is still very much in the mode of minimalism. Quite minimal provisions are contained in this legislation and when one compares the situation here to that in the rest of Europe, one can see that we still have a long way to go with regard to time off and parental leave. Breastfeeding is an obvious example and the provision contained in the legislation allows for four months. However, the Department of Health and Children recommends that the minimum period for breastfeeding should be six months. If a working mother wants to return to work and is breastfeeding, the Department of Health and Children states that she should breastfeed for six months. However, the legislation states that she will only be allowed to do so for four months. This is another example of disjointed Government. The Minister of State should extend the period to six months. We will propose that he does so by way of amendment, to which I hope he will give serious consideration, on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State said that female labour force participation now stands at 49%. In recent years, in particular, there has been a spectacular increase in the number of women in the work<Col N="348" />force. That only happened because women are needed in the workforce. There was rarely any real encouragement for women to join the workforce until such time as employers needed them. The result has been the introduction of individualisation into the tax regime and the paying of much lip-service to female labour force participation. I clearly recall that in the 1980s, when women were fighting for much better social protection and provision, few people were calling for women to leave the home and join the workforce. We would never have seen anything like tax individualisation emerging at that stage.</P>
    <P>Another issue I wish to raise, to which other Members referred, is child care. The slow manner in which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has responsibility for this area, has come on board is indicative of the lip-service the Government pays to issues of this nature. On one hand, it wants women in the workforce, but, on the other, it makes matters really difficult for parents. The problems really start when children go to school. It is easier to have a child in a crèche from morning until evening. It is when children finish school each day at 1.30 p.m., 2.30 p.m. or 3.30 p.m., or have days off, half days, etc., that difficulties arise. Parents need access to a flexi-time system such as that which operates successfully in the public service. More widespread flexi-time is needed and parents need access to high quality affordable child care which has within it flexible arrangements such as an after-school service.</P>
    <P>The majority of parents make their own arrangements. They have to do so because public provision is minimal. It continues to be minimal because the Government has the same attitude to child care that it has to care of the elderly, namely, that one should make one's own arrangements. Although the Government wants women in the workforce, it is not really concerned about assisting them to negotiate the difficult early years or about recognising that there are times in child rearing when flexi-time and parental time are needed for a variety of reasons. I refer, for example, to years when children are obliged to sit State examinations. My son sat his leaving certificate last year and a parent needs to be present when the examinations are taking place. They also need flexibility. I am sure the Minister of State will say that what I am seeking is only possible in an ideal world, but if we do not aim for it, we will never achieve it.</P>
    <P>The principle underlining our public policy should be family friendly. I was interested in what Senator Cox said in regard to female public representatives and maternity leave. I am sure Senator Cox and other parents, particularly mothers, will agree that ours is the most family unfriendly professions in which to be. The political establishment has absolutely no intention of making it anything other than that. I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response <Col N="349" />to the query raised by Senator Cox, which was valuable and which gets to the core of the issue.</P>
    <P>If we want women in politics, we must recognise that there are particular issues which need to be addressed head on. I have discussed this briefly with Senator Cox in the past. I congratulate her on her commitment to this issue and to being a politician and a parent. I know about the difficulties involved, although my children are not as young as those of Senator Cox. Politics is a most family unfriendly profession because of the hours worked, the times of meetings, etc. One is expected to put aside one's role as a parent or as a member of a family for the public good. Let us face it, there are times when one asks oneself why one does so.</P>
    <P>A minimalist approach has been taken in the Bill. We will table an amendment in regard to the breastfeeding provision, in particular, because far more needs to be done than simply paying lip-service and taking a minimalist approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KateWalsh" hpid="Ms K. Walsh Ms K. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Ms K. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to give my support to this important Bill and I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill amends the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to give effect to the outstanding recommendations of the working group on the maternity protection legislation which were published in February 2001. When it is signed into law, Ireland will have some of the most progressive legislation governing maternity and parental leave in the EU. The Minister of State and his Department must be congratulated on bringing forward this important and timely legislation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is a culture of fear among some women when it comes to informing their employers that they are pregnant and of their rights in respect of maternity leave. Even more shocking is the fact that some employers believe that they can sack a pregnant employee &ndash; simply because they are expecting a baby &ndash; and get away with it. We were reminded of this only a few months ago when a brave teenager in my constituency took her employer to the Labour Court for unfair dismissal. She was dismissed after informing her employer that she was pregnant. I am delighted that she won her case but it is unfortunate that she was forced to take it to the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>Ireland has had legislation in place for many years governing the protection of the rights of pregnant women in the workplace and guaranteeing maternity leave. Unfortunately, there is still a small number of employers who believe they can flout the law and dismiss their employees at will. I hope the new Bill will further strengthen our maternity legislation and send out a strong message to employers that the rights of expectant mothers and new parents are protected by law and must be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" />I hope the legislation will give pregnant women in the workplace a greater sense of security. The aforementioned case of the Kildare teenager is certainly not an isolated one. Half of all queries made to the Equality Authority last year concerned pregnancy. Many women are frightened of informing their employers that they are pregnant because they fear dismissal and forced changes to their job descriptions and that it might negatively affect their promotional opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Bill deserves the support of all political parties. It recognises that both parents in most households work outside the home and the need for new mothers to return to the workplace as soon as their period of maternity leave expires. It recognises that pregnant women at work and new mothers returning to work need support, accommodation and flexibility from employers with, most importantly, no consequent loss of pay.</P>
    <P>The legislation is timely given that the latest studies show the number of births is hitting a 15 year high, with 60,500 babies born last year. Significantly, 40% of births were to first-time mothers, which represents the highest rate since statistics were first compiled. The Bill recognises the pressures facing parents in the workplace and provides that expectant mothers can attend one set of ante-natal classes without loss of pay. It recognises the need to give fathers flexibility and gives them the once-off right to paid time off to attend the two ante-natal classes immediately prior to birth. The Bill also recognises the increasing number of women who choose to breastfeed and the need for employers to be flexible and accommodating in this respect by allowing for either an adjustment in working hours or breastfeeding breaks.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Bill, when enacted, will enhance our maternity protection. It leaves employers in no doubt as to the protection afforded to pregnant women and new mothers under the law. It copperfastens and strengthens the rights of employees. I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I was delighted to hear Senator O'Toole comment on the Bill because I wanted to get a male perspective on it. I found myself out of my depth. I welcome the legislation. As Senator Kate Walsh stated, it amends the 1994 legislation and affords new protections to those in employment, women in particular. That has to be good. I know there have been some negative comments on the extent to which it affords such protections but any improvements in the protection of employees in the workplace have to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation was formulated as a result of a commitment given by the Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review published indicated that there was a broad base of contributors involved in finalising the legislation, not least the social partners. We prob<Col N="351" />ably felt the Bill would get the seal of approval in the workplace because they were involved. I am sure they would not have signed off on it if they had not been satisfied that it would bring about better conditions for employees.</P>
    <P>Without doubt, the provisions of the Bill allow for greater flexibility, better planning and less hardship for those husbands and wives starting families. Those of us who reared our families in the 1970s and 1980s, without any legislative protection, good, bad or indifferent, know the hardships suffered in those decades. There is no doubt in my mind that many good people, women in particular, were lost to the workforce and the economy because they had to leave their jobs prematurely. The most noteworthy example of this, to which Senator Cox referred, was that women had to leave the Civil Service when they married, often long before they decided to start a family. My wife suffered in this respect. It led to one less pay packet entering the household and an additional mouth to feed. Those were tough times. We have made much progress since. In some people's eyes, progress may be slow but, nonetheless, we are moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The legislation will afford benefits and protection to employees who wish to start their families and will allow them to do so in a structured way, thus ensuring they will not find themselves worse off financially. Ideally, there should be more crèches, especially in public places. The fact that there is none in Leinster House is probably an indictment in itself. I am told one has been promised for some years but I am not sure what progress has been made on it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that workplaces with crèche facilities are attractive for those who want to return to work or those already at work who experience difficulties in having children cared for in crèches outside their workplaces or who depend on grandmothers or grandfathers to do so. Employers with crèches are in a position to encourage past employees to return to work or encourage others into the workplace whom they might not be able to employ otherwise.</P>
    <P>I read that an EU member state has a target of attaining 60% female participation in the workplace by 2010. It is so confident that it will achieve this target that it has an interim target of 57%, to be attained by 2005. This constitutes a fundamental transformation in social roles. The Government, through the changes proposed in the Bill, has obviously recognised the need for a more family-friendly employment policy to enable working husbands and wives to reconcile their working lives with their family lives.</P>
    <P>It is only in recent times that we were lamenting that we did not have enough people in the workforce. I recall the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, saying we needed approximately 100,000 additional employees. We had to go as far as the Philippines when there was a scarcity of nurses. I <Col N="352" />once worked in the Central Remedial Clinic in Clontarf. Three years ago it would have been hard-pressed to find employees from outside Ireland, with the possible exception of England or Wales. Now it has employees from Canada, South Africa, Australia, Sweden, America, Croatia and Spain, to mention but a few. This has happened within the past three years or so. Any improvements that release more people into the workplace have got to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is excellent. It allows for the postponement of maternity leave or additional maternity leave in the event of hospitalisation of a child. There is probably nothing more harrowing for a woman, having availed of maternity leave, additional and otherwise, than to find herself unable to look after a child who may have gone into hospital towards the end of her additional maternity leave. The fact that leave can be postponed at some point when the mother receives an indication of the need to do so is good.</P>
    <P>Is the entire Bill binding on all employers, big and small? Small businesses, especially specialised businesses where a husband and wife might be involved, might find great difficulty if both maternity and parental leave was being allowed for. In a business with five or six employees the absence of a woman for 22 weeks could create quite a problem.</P>
    <P>Senators Cox and Terry referred to the provision for four weeks ante-natal leave. I know of very few women who leave work four weeks prior to giving birth. I know of a young woman who left her employment last Friday and had her baby that night. Section 7, which suggests that employers allow time for one set of ante-natal classes and that a woman attend the others during her maternity leave, cannot be adhered to in most cases. Must an employer inisist on a woman taking four weeks leave? If she remains at work and something happens during that four week period, could her employer be sued?</P>
    <P>In what circumstances would a woman need additional time off for breastfeeding? As the legislation allows 22 weeks leave, a woman will have 18 weeks left after her baby is born. If, as I am led to believe, a woman breastfeeds for four to six months, then time for breastfeeding is allowed within the framework of her entitlement. Even allowing for breastfeeding after that period, how can one regulate for breastfeeding breaks? I do not think one can legislate for when a child is hungry. If a baby is breastfed at 7 a.m. and needs to be fed again at 10 a.m., 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. how can this be provided for? One cannot block breastfeed.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the loss of superannuation benefit. Does maternity leave constitute a break in service? I presume it would be dealt with on the same basis as someone going on a year's leave of absence when one is still an employee and service is not broken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" />I wish the Bill well. It is a decent Bill, one which legislates in the right direction for women in the workplace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everyone who contributed to the debate and welcome their contributions. Senator Terry raised a question about section 5 regarding additional maternity leave being terminated in the event of illness. My advice is that the provision to allow an employee to transfer, with the consent of the employer, from additional maternity leave to sick leave in the event of the woman's illness does not contravene the pregnant workers directive. The mother remains fully entitled to 18 paid weeks maternity leave. This cannot be terminated. The Bill proposes that the employee may choose to transfer from unpaid additional maternity leave to sick leave and that choice will, obviously, be made when it is to her own advantage. That is the intention of the section.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry and others raised the question of the four month period given for breastfeeding. At the time of the review of the 1994 Act the working group recommended a period of four months. We are going on that recommendation. However, a resolution on infant and young children's nutrition was adopted at the World Health Assembly in May 2002. It approved the World Health Organisation's global strategy on infant and young child feeding which recommends, &ldquo;As a global public health recommendation infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimum growth, development and health.&rdquo; In the light of this recommendation the Department of Health and Children is reviewing its breastfeeding strategy which may well have implications for amending the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry also said there was nothing in the Bill to oblige employers to provide breastfeeding facilities. The legal position is that an employer is obliged to provide a breastfeeding facility where that will impose no more than a nominal cost on him or her. That is not the Government's decision. It is a decision taken by the Supreme Court under Article 43 of the Constitution which protects private property. The Supreme Court has ruled that one can only place social obligations in the public interest on private property owners where no more than nominal cost will be incurred. I can get details of the judgment for the Senator if she wishes.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry is right when she points out that the reduction of working hours is not defined. It will be defined in the regulations which will shortly follow the Bill. This is one of those matters which must be provided for in some detail by way of regulation. The regulations will be complex and it is in them that the nuances will be worked out.</P>

      <P>With regard to Senator Cox's point about the pre-confinement period being fixed at four weeks, I agree with Senators O'Toole and Kett and everyone else who has made this point. However, the Attorney General's advice is that to reduce the period of four weeks would be contrary to Article 1.3 of the relevant European directive. We are members of the European Union, from which we have derived many benefits. Much of our social progress is due to our EU membership. We have derived huge economic benefits. We are subject to European directives and cannot pick and choose among them. All I can say is that I will have the matter looked at again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators O'Toole and O'Meara dealt with the provision of child care facilities. The Government fully recognises the need for an increased number of affordable child care places and has committed &euro;436 million to the equal opportunities child care programme. This commitment was renewed in the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, under which a partnership sub-committee was provided for to consider recommendations on how to improve the availability of quality child care services for working parents, and how the supply of pre-school and after-school child care places could be accelerated. Rather than not doing enough with regard to child care, the Government has committed an enormous amount of taxpayer's money to the area. Over the period of the Government plan, we are talking <Col N="355" />about &euro;436 million to fill a certain number of places. It looks like the target will be met.</P>
    <P>I live in the real world and I am aware that one could provide many more places with that amount of money. The difficulty is that one cannot have corner shop arrangements whereby someone is free for a couple of hours in an afternoon to provide child care, with someone else coming in at other times. There must be appropriate safeguards. If parents are going out to work, their children, the future of the country, are entrusted to people to look after their welfare. One cannot do this on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. I decry the fact that child care does not seem to be sufficiently flexible. I would like more flexibility. Unfortunately, because of the situation mentioned, there is a limit to flexibility in this area. We hope the relevant working group will come up with recommendations to enable us to provide more child care places for the money we are spending.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry claimed that the Government had missed the opportunity to greatly improve workplace rights for working mothers. The Government put in place a review board comprising members from all interested parties, including the trade unions, the National Women's Council of Ireland and others. The board made a series of recommendations to improve the Maternity Protection Act 1994. The Government has accepted each and every one of them, as worded. The most significant improvements, increasing periods of <Col N="356" />paid maternity leave and unpaid leave by four weeks, were immediately implemented, even before the legislation was brought forward.</P>
    <P>With regard to the length of paid and unpaid maternity leave, we compare very favourably with most of our European partners, to the best of my knowledge. The figures are evident. It is not rocket science.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate. We may be in a position to amend the breast-feeding provisions on Committee Stage. The Department of Health and Children is reviewing its initial recommendations in the light of the World Health Organisation report.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pre-confinement period of four weeks, it seems ludicrous that this should be forced on people. Rights are there to be enjoyed. One enshrines them in legislation and the Constitution. With regard to the pre-confinement period, we seem to be forcing rights on people who do not want them in that form. The legal advice from the Attorney General, however, is that to do otherwise in that area would be to contravene the relevant EU directive, which is law and which the Government has to obey. I will have it looked at again. We will get legal opinion, and if the situation can be eased, I will be happy to table the appropriate amendment.</P>
    <P>There will no doubt be a detailed Committee Stage debate on this entire matter, to which I look forward. I thank all those who contributed to the debate and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendment to the Seanad. The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendment made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of this amendment. I remind Members that they may only speak once on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who is meeting the British Minister for Energy this afternoon to discuss a matter of interest to everyone, namely, Sellafield. He is also obliged to appear before the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government with regard to the Estimates today.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Bill 2003 was initiated in the Seanad last February and was passed by it on 25 March. It was then sent to the Dáil for consideration and was passed with a single amendment. This was to cater for the fact that the Bill had been overtaken by the Local Government (No. 2) Bill 2003, which dealt with bridge orders. The latter, although published after the Bill with which we are dealing, was enacted on 10 April 2003 as the Local Government Act of 2003. Dáil Éireann, therefore, amended section 8 of the Local Government Bill so that, when enacted, it will be titled the Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003. A small, consequential, technical adjustment was also required to the collective citation as set out in section 8(2).</P>
      <P>I appreciate that this may be somewhat confusing because of the technical nature of the matter. I understand that Members have received a copy of both the original section 8 and the new version, as contained in the Bill before us, set out on a single page for their information, which I hope will clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is normal practice, the Bill is being returned to the House to consider the amendment made <Col N="357" /><Col N="358" />by the Dáil. The sole issue is the Title and the collective citation. I ask the House to accept this necessary revision as made by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I did not think that he would be returning because the Bill was the subject of much previous discussion and examination in the House. As the Minister of State indicated, there has been much confusion with regard to it because there was no great demand, from the general public, from public representatives from all sides of this House or from members of local authorities, etc., for the abolition of the dual mandate.</P>
      <P>One of the principal areas of concern among elected public representatives is the lack of real powers being vested in them and also the failure to deal with the important issue of time off to allow them to deal with council matters and attend meetings of local authorities. One of the major issues of concern is the devolvement of powers to local authorities, but that is not addressed in the Bill. There are several other anomalies that should have, but were not, addressed in the Bill which would have led to the real reform of local government.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Bill and I am delighted to get a second opportunity to highlight the fact that there is no substance to it in terms of real reform of local government. I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell us when we will see the real reform of local government. The electorate and public representatives were promised that there would be real reform before the next local elections, which are due to take place in May 2004.</P>
      <P>A facility should be put in place to allow Members of the Oireachtas to link up with activities in their local authorities. That is something we were promised in the corridors of power, but there has been no hint of regulations being introduced to give us some powers in terms of gaining access to information, county development plans, annual reports, the minutes of local authority meetings, etc., all of which are very important. I call on the Minister of State to establish a members' service unit in each local authority so that Oireachtas Members and councillors will automatically receive information from any committee or sub-committee or reports directly affecting their counties or constituencies.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of controversy about the Bill and we opposed it on Second and Committee Stages. Under our Constitution, the President can refer Bills to the Supreme Court. I would like to ask that&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the separation of powers, power under the Constitution ultimately rests with the people. The Houses have a duty to protect that power and to ensure the constitutionality of legislation. I have argued that the legislation is unconstitutional and we should not pass such legislation. Whatever about the President referring the Bill to the Supreme Court, the issue has been raised and I hope she does do so because it relates to the fundamental power of the people. Our mandate comes from the people and it is for them to decide who they elect. When they elect a councillor who is subsequently elected to the Dáil, it is wrong to take away that mandate through legislation of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is about entrenching the Government's position in terms of its power. The Government received a derogation in respect of the dual mandate at European Parliament level so that its Deputies can run for the European elections next year. As a result, they will be able to retain their European Parliament and Dáil <Col N="361" />seats until the next general election. It will be sickening if people from the Seanad and the Dáil are allowed to run for the next European elections while we, at local government level, are being deprived of holding a much lesser dual mandate.</P>

      <P>I understood this to be a simple matter. The Local Government Bill 2003, which abolishes the dual mandate, was superseded by another local government Bill dealing with bridge orders. For this reason, we must now return to the issue in order to put the Bills in the correct order.</P>
      <P>I was delighted for the people of the south-east for whom technical legislation in the Dáil resolved the matter of a bridge. We now have to sort out the Titles of the two Bills. As we have already had a lengthy discussion on the dual mandate, there is no point revisiting the issue, except to note that the question of its constitutionality is not a matter for the House, but for the President, the Council of State or the court dealing with the case taken by Deputy Ring. Our role is to deal with the technical amendment before us and to place the two Bills which deal, respectively, with the bridge orders and the dual mandate in the correct order. Once the Bill is passed, I hope we will get clarification on its constitutional position.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I share the concerns about the failure to abolish the dual mandate for Oireachtas Members who run for European elections. While I have no difficulty with the fact that a member of Údarás na Gaeltachta is currently a member of the European Parliament &ndash; more power to him &ndash; this is also a dual mandate of sorts. If we decide to abolish dual mandates, we should consider abolishing them across the board rather than solely for councillors who are also Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon raised the important issue of the level of access to local authorities for Oireachtas Members who have to give up their seats on local authorities. This issue has not yet been clarified. While I do not wish to address it in detail because it has already been discussed, I hope it will be resolved satisfactorily if the Local Government Bill 2003 becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join Senators Bannon, Tuffy and Leyden in requesting that the President consider referring the abolition of the dual mandate to the Supreme Court. While I do not wish to get involved in a debate on specifics, there is merit in the proposal that the President ask the Supreme Court to rule on whether the legislation is constitutional. I agree with Senator Tuffy that we should not pass unconstitutional legislation. Certain members of <Col N="363" />the Government who voted in favour of the Bill also believe it to be unconstitutional, which is a highly hypocritical and unsatisfactory position to hold. However, I respect their right to&mdash;</P>

With regard to its constitutionality, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has drafted it in accordance with the legal opinion available to him. Everyone agrees that the Bill is necessary and that it has been improved on previous Stages. Nevertheless, I share the concerns expressed by other speakers concerning the basic right of a person to hold a seat on a local authority. I am sure many people, including members of the Council of State and the President, will have listened to the contributions of Members of the Houses. Doubts concerning the constitutionality of the Bill should be tested through the various options available at national level as opposed to individuals bringing cases to court to uphold the basic rights of the people.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill. As one who has served on a local authority for 27 years, I accept that times change and that we must move on. I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the proposed new section 237A which provides that the Minister shall make regulations which will include provisions in relation to the &ldquo;supply, without charge, of notice, agenda and minutes of local authority meetings&rdquo; to Members of either House. While the provision is fine, it is does not specify when Members will be supplied with such information. Will they, for example, receive it at the end of the year? The regulations should prescribe when Members receive information, particularly as standing orders would prescribe when local authority <Col N="364" />members would receive it. Oireachtas Members must receive the same notice as local authority members. Will the Minister of State ensure that this occurs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened carefully to the Acting Chairman's ruling, I do not wish to stray into Second Stage debate. Given the opportunity, however, I would be delighted to debate the issue and respond to a number of the questions asked by Senators. When I used the word &ldquo;confusion&rdquo;, I was referring to the difficulties that might arise from having the Local Government (No. 2) Bill 2003 become the Local Government Act 2003 and the Bill before us become the Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003. I did not mean that there is any confusion about the contents of the Bill with which we are dealing.</P>
      <P>The Bill abolishing the dual mandate, which was originally the Local Government Bill 2003, was published prior to the Local Government (No. 2) Bill 2003, which deals with bridge orders. As already stated, the latter was passed prior to the Bill before the House. Through this simple amendment, the Bill before us, when passed, will become the Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003, while the legislation dealing with bridge orders is entitled the Local Government Act 2003.</P>
      <P>I was asked when certain facilities will be made available to Members of the Oireachtas. This will occur around the time the Minister signs the regulations, which will possibly be in the third quarter. The information made available to councillors will be made available to Oireachtas Members at the same time. The Minister gave that important assurance. I served in local government for many years. A lot of our work as Oireachtas Members involves local authorities. It is important, therefore, that information is made available to us. Members can be assured that the Minister intends to ensure this.</P>
      <P>The amendment dealing with section 8(2) is consequential on the original amendment and one on which there is no need to go into detail. I am committed to the Bill. What is important is that Members, who represent the people and electoral areas at all levels, receive the information relevant to them to ensure that, as Members of the Oireachtas, they can provide a service for constituents. The Minister was always committed to this and never needed convincing on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate on the Bill and facilitating its quick passage through the House. Everyone must agree when I say local government can only benefit from such debates. The diverse range of views aired during the passage of the Bill through this House can only be beneficial. Local government is a subject close to our hearts and informed lively debate reflects our commitment in this regard. This commitment will, no doubt, endure long after the ending of the dual mandate. It is difficult <Col N="365" />to imagine the disappearance of parliamentary questions on local issues.</P>
    <P>I thank the Acting Chairman, Seanad staff, my officials and Senators for their appreciation of the urgency of the amendment. The Bill cannot go further without being amended by this House. It will go to the President for her signature shortly and will, I hope, be enacted shortly afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether I should make this point on section 1. Why was this sweeping and complex legislation not subjected to regulatory impact assessment, of which I was not aware until recently? The OECD report on regulation, published in March 2000, strongly recommended that all Irish legislation and regulations should be subjected to regulatory impact assessment before being enacted. That conclusion, with which I and I am sure everyone else agrees, was endorsed by the Department of the Taoiseach this time last year when the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste declared they would publish a consultation paper on better regulation. If we want to remain a competitive economy which will attract industry and be good for business, we should ensure we do not take steps to hinder this. I understand the reason the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste said something should be done about it. If the Bill had been subjected to regulatory impact assessment, the costs, problems and complications involved, to which we have not given enough attention, would have come to light. It would not have been necessary for me and at least 25 others who made submissions to the Minister to table amendments in an attempt to mitigate some of the difficulties. I hope the Minister of State can tell me the reason this was not done as it appears to have been identified as Government policy. Will consideration be given to carrying out a regulatory impact assessment in accordance with Government policy? Will he consider delaying further progress of the Bill until that is done? I hope I have raised this point under the relevant section.</P>

      <P>In my 16 years here I have not seen a Bill break new ground in terms of early consultation like this one. I would welcome an assurance from other Members of the House who have experience of this in both this and the other House. This Bill was published in draft form. The <Col N="366" />heads of the Bill were published and circulated to every group with an interest in it. It has been on the website of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for more than seven or eight months against the advice of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the will of many members of the Government. Prior to that, every regulatory authority in the country was asked for its views on the issues involved before drafting began and both during and after drafting. It was done on the basis of European regulations. This may not allay the fears of Senator Quinn but it is the first time I have seen the draft heads of a Bill made available prior to the deliberations of the Cabinet. It was an example of openness and transparency which I have not seen in any Department in my 16 years as a Member of this House.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole has explained what has happened in recent months. The Bill was drafted on foot of the report of the review group on auditing, a substantial tome. More correspondence has been received from different sectors of industry, including accountancy bodies, individual accountants, directors, associations and the company law review group. This will be considered while we are discussing the Bill and we will listen to the points made by Senators on different sections. We will then bring it through the other House and any changes made following the views expressed will be brought back before this House. It will be given considerable consideration before being finalised.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Minister of State or Senator O'Toole to think I was suggesting that a lot of work had not been put into the Bill. I accept that Senator O'Toole has put a huge amount of work into it. However, last year the Taoiseach launched a consultation paper on better regulation and said all laws in the future should be subjected to a regulatory impact analysis. That criticism was levelled at us in 2000 by the OECD. The Government and the Taoiseach responded by saying that in future we would have a regulatory impact analysis. This is the most definitive regulatory Bill we have had since. The OECD criticised us because there was a danger that Ireland would become over-regulated. It seemed logical that when the State heard this criticism, it decided to do something about it by having a regulatory impact analysis in the future. However, that has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State and Senator O'Toole have said the Bill has been on the Department's website and people have had an opportunity to express their views. However, that is the case with most Bills. I am sure Senator O'Toole is correct that this process is longer and more open but we have always had the chance to make submissions. Some 25 submissions have been made on this Bill in recent weeks because we did not do a regulat<Col N="367" />ory impact analysis. If we want our nation to compete with other countries, we cannot place ourselves at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I made an error when I spoke on Second Stage by assuming that all the large international companies in this country would have to set up an Irish company and that this Bill would apply to them. I was incorrect. Many of the large international companies which operate in Ireland do not set up a separate Irish company. The Bill does not apply to many of those large companies. This means it will apply only to an established Irish company competing with a foreign company in Ireland, not to a foreign based company. There are large costs involved.</P>
    <P>This will make it attractive for companies to move their head offices to the North, Scotland or elsewhere to avoid the regulations being introduced here. While the legislation will have serious costs implications for Irish registered companies, it will not apply to non-Irish registered companies. A regulatory impact assessment has not been conducted of the legislation which will act against the interests of Irish-based companies which compete with companies based abroad.</P>

All the professions affected by the legislation made a submission earlier to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. Senator O'Toole is like the 16th member of the Government and has played an important role. He is president of the ICTU and an excellent public official. He was involved in the preparation of the report of the review group, which led to this legislation.</P>
      <P>Companies generating a turnover less than &euro;315,000 should not be audited. The threshold should be increased to &euro;4.5 million. I hope the Minister of State will address this anomaly as companies will be put at a disadvantage as against companies in the North and Europe. It is unusual that both the Minister of State and Senator O'Toole have had an input into the legislation. I would like to hear their views on this issue.</P>

      <P>The US Securities and Exchange Commission is the leading financial regulator and authority in the world. I stated on Second Stage that what was happening in Ireland was also happening in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe and the United Kingdom. The SEC is a God-like body in this field, to which every American and foreign firm is beholden. Yesterday it held a public meeting, which is unusual. A report on the meeting stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a move that gives investors more information, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted 5 to 0 in a public meeting for chief executives to disclose their conclusions about the effectiveness of their companies' internal controls and procedures for reliable <Col N="368" />financial reporting . While the new rule holds corporate executives' feet to the fire, it also forces the accounting firm that audited the company's financial statements to attest to the adequacy of the internal controls.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear a Member say over the next three hours that we are doing something that has not been done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I met representatives of the auditing standards board in the United Kingdom last week. They are framing legislation very much along this line and the same is happening in Europe. It is misleading to state we are introducing regulations that will raise the bar for Irish companies and put them at a competitive disadvantage with foreign direct investors. That is not the case and I have plenty of evidence to prove this. The American Congress has issued directives on the surveying of the Act and the SEC has taken a decision in the past 24 hours. The commission will make many more decisions like it in the next period. That is where we are going.</P>

      <P>I will bow to Senator O'Toole's knowledge and experience. However, he is incorrect in regard to one issue. In all other countries these regulations apply to companies quoted on the Stock Exchange in which the public can invest. They provide protection for investors. However, this is the first time these stipulations will have been placed on private companies, whatever their size. I will address this in a later amendment. There is a significant difference between a family business or a private company and a public company in which outsiders invest. Perhaps Senator O'Toole has information that I do not posses but I am not aware of such regulations being applied to private companies anywhere. The Senator, therefore, is incorrect to state the bar is not being raised higher for Irish companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>5.&ndash;(1) Subject to <i>subsection (2)</i>, unless a person is a qualified person, he shall not:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) describe himself as an accountant, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) so hold himself out so as to indicate, or be reasonably understood to indicate, that he is an accountant.</P>
      <P>(2) <i>Subsection (1)</i> shall not prevent any person who is:&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) a turf accountant, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) a legal cost accountant, or</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) within a category of persons prescribed by regulations made by the Minister,</P>
      <P>describing himself as, or holding himself out to be, as the case may be, a turf accountant, a legal cost accountant, or within the relevant category of prescribed persons.</P>
      <P>(3) In this section &lsquo;qualified person' means a person who is:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) a member of a prescribed accountancy body who is entitled, by the constitution or bye-laws of that prescribed accountancy body, to call himself an accountant,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) qualified in accordance with section 187 of the Companies Act 1990 to be an auditor of a company or a public auditor of an industrial and provident society or a friendly society,</P>
      <P>(<i>c</i>) within a category of persons prescribed by regulations made by the Supervisory Authority as being entitled to use the name accountant, or</P>
      <P>(<i>d</i>) otherwise certified by the Supervisory Authority as being a suitable person to use the name accountant.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I recognise the valuable work done by the review group on auditing, ably chaired by our colleague, Senator O'Toole. I hope the Minister of State will approach this debate in a spirit of giving. I delayed addressing the issue raised earlier until we reached my amendment. This issue is of para<Col N="370" />mount importance as, given his background, the Minister of State will appreciate. The public must be properly protected by ensuring all persons acting as accountants fall under the scope of a supervisory authority, as intended by the review group.</P>
    <P>The review group acknowledged that business and consumers would benefit from being able to distinguish between those professionally qualified and those who were not. It did not recommend that the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; be defined due to legal complexity and costs associated with enforcement. However, these arguments are not of such magnitude that they override the public interest. The ability of persons to act as accountants outside the new regulatory framework is a matter of concern, as it will mislead the public and create an unfair advantage for those persons who are not members of professional bodies. These persons will not be subject to supervision and will, therefore, be in a position to provide services for the public without the need to comply with appropriate standards, including ethics.</P>
    <P>I am surprised this issue is not addressed in the legislation. There is little point in establishing this new supervisory mechanism if it provides both an incentive and a capacity to operate outside it. Confidence will only be restored in the profession and financial services by ensuring everybody operates on a level playing field. This is an essential development from the consumer's perspective. The consumer should be entitled to know that when he or she walks into a so-called accountant's office, the person is what he or she says. The Bill will lose a key part of its effectiveness if it is not amended to provide recognition for the title &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An opportunity to improve protection for the consumers of accountancy services will be lost if this issue is not addressed. That is the reason I strongly urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment. Anyone can call himself or herself an accountant. We know there is no restriction. We went through this argument before when I referred to it on Second Stage. It is an issue that needs to be addressed. I tabled the amendment in that spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the views of Senator Coghlan on this issue, on which the audit review group spent some considerable time. The consumer would be protected if we could protect the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. I am concerned that I could put up a plate outside my office saying, &ldquo;Joe O'Toole, Accountant&rdquo; without being attached to any body or subject to any regulation. When I tried to do something about this issue, I failed to find a form of language acceptable to the lawyers. I would be very happy to support Senator Coghlan's great idea. It would be brilliant if we could do it. The title &ldquo;solicitor&rdquo; is protected by legislation. That word seems more open to <i>double entendre</i> than the title &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. If it was possible in that case, it should be possible in this case. While I have not been able to do it, <Col N="371" />I support the proposal of Senator Coghlan, if it is possible to accept it legally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be possible for the Minister of State to accept the amendment at this stage and I would not recommend him to do so. A Bill is in preparation which will provide for the registration of architects, quantity surveyors and other professions. There are constitutional issues affecting such legislation. Although I did not discuss this with the Minister of State and did not get advice from the Department, I have read the draft of that Bill and there is no control over the word &ldquo;architect&rdquo;. Anybody can legally call himself or herself an architect, an engineer or a quantity surveyor. The Department of the Environment and Local Government is preparing the legislation.</P>
      <P>I recognise that Senator Coghlan has good intentions and is moving in the right direction but on the wrong Bill. Accepting the amendment could delay the Bill considerably. We generally know what chartered accountants are and what their qualifications are. However, this is a separate issue. Amending the Bill could leave it open to constitutional challenge. Even though they do not have the written qualifications, there are people practising with a number of years' experience who might be as good as any chartered accountant. The amendment is not practical. Although it is possible the Minister of State will have a different view, this is an issue for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Leyden; this is a critical point in the Bill. As it is about regulating accountants, if we do not define the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;, at the very least the Bill can be evaded simply by erecting a plaque declaring a person to be an accountant without being a member of one of the prescribed bodies in the Bill. There are several ways to do this. The most difficult, as others have mentioned, is to describe the job of an accountant and define it in a way that can be inserted into the Bill. It is not necessary to go down that road. It can be described by either academic or post-academic qualifications.</P>
      <P>The easiest and most sensible approach is to prescribe that only members of particular organisations can call themselves accountants. There are many other powers in the Bill that allow the Minister to make regulations that govern the way in which those bodies work. If the Bill stated a person must be a member of one of six organisations governed by regulation in order to be called an accountant, this would catch everybody affected by it. That is what the Minister of State should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the point made by Senator O'Toole who has been actively involved in this. It is not appropriate to have a Bill called the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill without defining the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. When <Col N="372" />Senator Coghlan said a turf accountant could be regarded as an accountant, I realised the intricacies of this. Some 40 years ago the State determined an establishment could not be called a hotel without meeting certain stipulations. In the 1960s there were people operating as chemists, even though they had no qualifications. Senator McDowell is correct in saying it would be wrong to pass this Bill without establishing safeguards against such vague legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give power to Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority to supervise the regulatory functions of the recognised accountancy bodies as well as other prescribed accountancy bodies. It provides for the supervision of the area of auditing and auditors. Having spent too many years studying to become an accountant, I was often upset about people without such qualifications sticking up the name &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; and perhaps taking business away from me.</P>
      <P>The effect of Senator Coghlan's amendment would be to give statutory protection to the term &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. This was considered in some detail in the audit review group report which forms the basis for the Bill and of which paragraph 11.4 sets out the arguments for and against protecting the title by statute. The review group concluded that, on balance, there was no compelling case in favour of recommending statutory protection for the title at the time. It went on to recommend that the matter be kept under review and that the supervisory authority should make recommendations, if appropriate, to the Minister in the light of such a review.</P>
      <P>Arising from submissions received from a number of accountancy bodies late last year, I sought the views of the interim board of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority which was of the opinion that it would be premature to re-examine the question of statutory protection for the title &ldquo;accountant&rdquo;. However, it stated that when the new supervisory regime had been fully introduced and its effects measured, this could be revisited. It must be revisited. This will happen if I have anything to do with it when that body is established. I will be unable to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am glad to hear some of those comments, with respect, this matter should be at the root of the Bill. Every day in this House we preach and argue about the rights of and protecting the consumer. How can we establish a new regulatory body, which I fully support, as do Members on both sides of the House, to deal with the supervision of the members of the bodies concerned when the Bill does nothing to protect consumers from unqualified people? The amendment offers a very simple solution by providing that only those who are members of the bodies in question can call themselves accountants, which is very reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of the Minister of State's <Col N="373" />remarks in saying he wants to revisit the issue. I would prefer to deal with it now and believe that is the way the Minister of State's heart is inclined. With respect, this is the way his head should also go. I must press this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Senator O'Toole and not having been a member of the audit review group, I still do not understand the cogent argument against simply requiring a person to be a member of one of the groups in order to be called an accountant. Can the Minister of State indicate the number calling themselves accountants who are not qualified in what we consider to be the normal way? I know of some myself and it is fairly commonplace. It would be helpful if the Minister of State indicated the number of accountants, or people we understand to be accountants, who are members of this group and the numbers operating outside the group.</P>
      <P>The real difficulty is that if we go through an investigation or disciplinary process, with all the standards in this Bill being imposed, if someone falls foul of that process he or she can simply opt out of the prescribed body and continue to operate. The situation is different for solicitors or medical practitioners; if they fall foul of ethics, the rules of the profession or the law, they are effectively debarred from practising. That will not happen if the elaborate disciplinary procedure in the Bill is transgressed, as people can simply opt out and continue to practise as if nothing had happened. That is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (2), line 8, to delete paragraph (<i>e</i>) and substitute the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) the Institute of Directors;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The authority is very heavily weighted in favour of the public sector and non-business members. With the exception of the two IBEC nominations, there is no place here for company directors, despite the fact that sections 26, 40 and 43 will have a very important impact on companies and their directors.</P>
      <P>There are better solutions but my solution removes the Pensions Board, since its remit will be well covered by the Irish Association of Investment Managers and the Irish Stock Exchange. I also propose to remove the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Corporate Enforcement, as both bodies have extensive powers of initiative and enforcement. They do not need to be involved in any further level of oversight in this area. In their place I propose membership and places for the Institute of Directors, though the IMI may be better, for Forfás, for the Small Firms Association and for ISME. The intention is that experienced company directors, executive and non-executive, be nominated by these boards. The Government amendment increases the number of accountant places, though two of those places should be filled by accountants who are not involved in audit practice but who are either executive finance directors or non-executive directors.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment out of concern that this Bill will have serious implications for boards. It will make it very difficult for some boards to operate with the same degree of attention to ensuring their businesses survive. I therefore do not want to see a lack of balance among board members in the authority. I am not sure if my proposals are accurate or ideal but there are concerns about this and the Minister of State should accept the principle of my argument, even if he has difficulties with some of my suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, section 6 sets out the membership of the company, because this is a company limited by guarantee. There are a dozen or so bodies, mostly commercial bodies or State bodies, which are members of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other section we are dealing with sets out the membership of the board. Is it the Minister of State's intention that the two be coterminous &ndash; that bodies such as the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and so on, which are members of the company, should also be rep<Col N="375" />resented on the board? As far as I can see that is not explicitly stated here.</P>
    <P>On a separate point, the Minister of State is correctly proposing that the new independent regulator should be represented as a member of the company. It is right that this should be the case but I urge him to ensure that it is the consumer element of the IFSRA which is represented. Individual consumers, as opposed to corporate consumers, are not specifically or directly members of the board or represented as members of the company, when that should be the case.</P>

      <P>To understand my opposition to amendment No. 2 it is necessary for me to explain the more substantive changes I am introducing through the amendments being discussed as part of this grouping.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of amendments Nos. 6, 8, 9 and 10 is to increase the total number of directors of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority from 12 to 14. The two additional directors will be nominated by the accountancy bodies and the Law Society of Ireland. It will also raise the maximum permitted number of accountants in the supervisory authority from two to four and it requires designated bodies, as set out in section 6(2), to consult with each other when any one of them wishes to nominate an accountant for appointment to the board of the authority.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 to paragraph (<i>f</i>) arises from the recent establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority on a statutory basis and is therefore purely technical in nature. Amendments Nos. 23 and 25 also derive from this. The addition of the Law Society of Ireland to the list of designated bodies which are entitled to nominate a director to the supervisory authority, through amendment No. 6, is an acknowledgement of the contribution their nominee would be likely to make, in particular to ensuring disciplinary procedures operate in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Quinn's suggestion about directors being put on the board, sub-committees will be set up and the supervisory authority will be allowed to bring in any number of accountants, directors and people of whatever expertise is deemed necessary for any exercise. There will accordingly be an opportunity to bring in expertise for particular occasions.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister of State's comments and I know his intentions are correct, but I must not have made my case or else it has been misunderstood. Senator McDowell talked about consumers and a very high portion of consumers are board members, yet board members are likely only to be represented by the two IBEC nominees. If this is to be driven by users of the system, surely board members who will be seriously affected by it should be guaranteed not <Col N="376" />only two places when so many State organisations do not have to show a bottom line to survive. We do not hear too often of State companies going out of business but we hear of commercial companies going out of business. We are establishing a statutory body to influence and to have a say, but we are not allowing consumers any more than two token places and perhaps membership if invited on to some sub-committee. I am concerned about this imbalance.</P>
      <P>Maybe the names I picked, the Institution of Directors, ISME or Forfás, are not the correct ones. Although consumers are to be board members, we do not seem to be allocating them anything other than a token two seats.</P>

      <P>While I understand the amendments tabled by Senator Quinn to add nominees from the Institute of Directors, Forfás, the Small Firms Association or the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association as designated bodies entitled to nominate directors to the supervisory authority in substitution for certain bodies set out in the Bill, I confirm to the Senator that arising from representations from various interested parties, I have already given consideration to these. I see such bodies as having the potential to contribute more to the authority's functions in relation to the review of accounts. As a result of amendment No. 24, which we will discuss later, the authority will be able to call upon any requisite external expertise in respect of that facet of its work. In addition, subsection (1) allows the Minister to prescribe additional bodies by regulation. Equally, the Minister can, under section 46, provide that a designated body ceases to be so designated. A Minister can make changes.</P>
      <P>For the reasons I have already given in relation to the composition of the board, Senator Coghlan will understand that I am not prepared to accept his amendment No. 7 which would increase the accountancy representation beyond that which I have proposed.</P>

      <P>I am genuinely confused about the relationship between sections 6 and 11. Section 6 sets out the eight designated bodies and then there is a catch-all which refers to the prescribed bodies which are basically the accountancy bodies. Section 11 sets out the composition of the board, which is two persons nominated jointly by agreement by the prescribed accountancy bodies, two persons nominated by the Minister and one each nominated by the designated bodies, which is a reference back to section 6 or to the eight bodies set out in that section. That, on the face of it, appears to add up to 12.</P>

      <P>I wish to reiterate the earlier point I made. The consumer protection element of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFRSA, should be represented on the board. While it is right to say that most clients of accountancy are likely to be corporate bodies and represented by one of the designated bodies in section 6, there are also individuals who might require separate representation. The consumer element of the IFRSA, which was recently established by the Houses of the Oireachtas, should be represented on the board as opposed to the Central Bank element which is already separately represented as far as I can tell. I hope that makes sense and is not too complicated.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State pointed out that a future Minister is &ldquo;empowered&rdquo;. The members listed include the Irish Business and <Col N="378" />Employers Federation, the ICTU, the Irish Association of Investment Managers, and the Irish Stock Exchange. Those I have highlighted include the Pensions Board, the Central Bank of Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Corporate Enforcement. It is heavily laden with State organisations, only one of which represents directors of companies. That is unbalanced. The Minister of State said that under section 24, the supervisory authority may delegate some or all its functions and powers to a committee established. It may delegate them but it does not have to do so. When they are so biased in favour of State organisations, which do not have to make a profit to survive, it may never get around to doing that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State's heart is in the right place but a future Minister may not have the same approach. Can we not make this change now to ensure a better balance than at present? Of nine bodies, only one is representative of directors. The imbalance is heavily against not only the private sector, but against those who have to make a profit to survive. The Minister of State should give serious thought to this matter.</P>

If he cannot accept the Senator's amendment, perhaps he could guarantee it will be addressed in the near future, as in the case of the earlier amendment regarding the title of accountant and the definition. It seems that not only is the Minister of State sympathetic, but that matters are under constant review.</P>

      <P>As a director of a company, I am affected by this. There should be some voice for directors, who, in many ways, are being made subject to much of the regulatory activity. I strongly support Senator McDowell in acknowledging individual consumers. Now that there are consumer protection bodies, it would be reasonable to suggest that they be included. It is not necessary to make changes in this regard at this stage, but it would be useful if the Minister of State would consider the possibility of making them in the near future. Once one sets up committees, it is quite difficult to change their personnel and their makeup. Things tend to become set in stone and it is often some years before changes are made.</P>

I know that the Institute of Chartered Accountants, which is the largest of the accountancy bodies, has an elaborate disciplinary procedure.

      <P>The question of what exactly is meant by the word, &ldquo;standards&rdquo; has been causing some grief to the accountancy bodies. It is used in section 9(2)<i>(f) </i>which lists one of the functions of the supervisory authority as &ldquo;to undertake under <i>section 24</i> investigations into possible breaches of the standards of a prescribed accountancy body&rdquo;. It is later defined as ethics, codes of conduct and so on. This seems to encompass a corpus of possible legislation and codes.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister in mind to be more specific about this and to put a general requirement on accountants to behave according to set standards? At the moment the Bill does not do that. It is imposing, potentially, an extremely wide onus of responsibility on accountants.</P>
      <P>I have some experience of the disciplinary procedures of the Law Society. There are certain things solicitors are obliged to do. These range from the most basic, such as returning telephone calls from clients, to complying with various accountancy requirements. Nowhere in this Bill are such requirements set out in relation to accountants. Perhaps they should not be set out in this Bill. However, there should be at least one codified set of rules which accountants are obliged to observe and which would be referred to in the Bill, even if not set out in full.</P>

      <P>This section sets out the funding mechanism for the authority, 40% of which will be paid for by the State through a grant from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the remainder apportioned by the supervisory authorities between the various prescribed bodies. I am not clear as to the distinction between that and the reserve fund. There seems to be a distinction between what one can spend the annual budget on and what one retains the reserved fund for. I am not clear about this and I ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The justification given for having a reserve fund is that it may be necessary, at short notice, for the authority to go to court or to incur a substantial legal cost and that its ability to act needs to be underpinned by having a reserve fund. I do not understand why that cannot be done through the annual budget and why it is necessary to have <Col N="385" />a reserve fund specifically for that, if the reserve fund is exclusively reserved for something of that kind. Is the distinction between the two clearly defined or is it merely extra money which can be used as needs be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 15(1)<i>(a)</i> the supervisory authority shall, subject to any limit that the Minister may specify, establish and maintain a reserve fund to be used only for the purposes of performing its functions and exercising its powers under sections 24 and 26. Section 24 refers to the investigation of possible breaches of standards of prescribed accountancy bodies and section 26 to a review of whether accounts comply with Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>The fund is intended to deal with those situations, if they arise. No one knows how many such situations may arise in the course of a year. That is the reason for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

      <P>Perhaps my confusion arises out of the fact that I do not totally understand the distinction between section 23 and section 24. No doubt we will come to that in due course. Since the funding mechanism is linked to it maybe the Minister of State could help me at this stage.  </P>
      <P>As I read it, section 23 allows the supervisory authority to determine whether the appropriate procedures have been gone through or whether the procedures of a particular body are right, whereas section 24 allows the investigation of a particular case where a complaint is made specifically to the supervisory authority. The distinction between the two is not clear cut and there is not a case for a different funding mechanism.</P>

      <P>In the normal way in which the IASA will carry out its duties, it will not actually be investigating cases, but will simply apply the rule, as it were, to ensure that the bodies are investigating cases properly. The Bill allows the authority to undertake the investigation itself in certain cases, and in such situations it would incur costs. It is unlikely that would happen very often. It is clearly stated that the IASA will not be in a position, for instance, to second-guess a properly structured and undertaken investigation. The IASA is not supposed to be there as a court of appeal. In the event of there being an objection against the way in which an accountancy body did its work, and the view was taken for example that due process was not followed, or that the proper steps were not taken, or that the case was dealt with incorrectly, then the legislation allows for the IASA in such exceptional circumstances to conduct its own investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A famous or infamous case, depending on one's point of view, is currently being investigated by one of the accountancy bodies. It is an investigation into the practices of one of its own members. I refer to the Blaney case, which has being going on for a number of years. It has already cost something in the order of &euro;2 million. <Col N="386" />The legislation is designed to avoid a situation where the IASA itself could not undertake an investigation if it needed to. If the structures work properly, it should never have to undertake an investigation itself. It was a combination of that issue and other unanticipated issues that gave rise to this area of the legislation. There is also the question of potential court challenges to the authority itself, and the need for the authority to be able to defend itself in such situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Senator O'Toole. I know what it is like to be part of an investigatory body when a case comes up and one has to go back to the sponsoring bodies to seek funding. It is proper that the authority should not have to face such a situation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the limit that the Minister may specify, does the Minister anticipate specifying a set limit or reviewing it year by year? Authorities such as the IASA are not meant to be savings banks. They should not be taking money from people. The Minister might specify a sum of &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million, but how would he decide? I find Senator O'Toole's justification of the authority otherwise acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the clarification by Senator O'Toole. It is sensible. I am not sure that, on the face of it, the Bill is clear in this area. Section 24 requires that there should be a public interest element in it. It also says that on its own initiative or following a complaint from just about anybody, the supervisory authority can undertake an investigation into the work of a member of an accountancy body. I accept it is not intended this should happen regularly, and that there is a requirement of public interest, but the public interest is not defined, and it is left up to the authority to decide if there is a public interest or not. In those circumstances, the distinction between section 23 and section 24 is not as clear-cut as it might be.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole said the authority was not an appeals body. I accept it is not intended to be such, but in effect it is being given the paraphernalia of powers to act as an appeals body if it wishes to do so. There is a danger of which we must all be conscious, that by setting out those powers, people are encouraged to use them. People will be encouraged to use the authority as an appeals mechanism to decide issues on the facts or merits rather than on the basis of due process, which is clearly what is intended. I am not sure that those two critical sections are sufficiently tightly drawn to ensure that the distinction remains real. We are discussing this issue in the context of the funding mechanism. I am not sure that the funding mechanism should be defined in such a blunt fashion, allowing for the reserve fund to be used only in relation to section 24, and not section 23.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 21, lines 3 and 4, to delete paragraph<i> (a) </i>and substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) appealing the decision of that body relating to that matter that was the subject of the enquiry to the High Court,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section deals with the intervention powers of the supervisory authority. This amendment has been tabled to ensure that due process is followed in seeking to reverse the decisions of disciplinary committees. The supervisory authority will have the power to approve the regulations governing the professional bodies' disciplinary arrangements. It will also have the authority to supervise the application of these regulations. In addition, it has been granted the power to annul the decisions of the disciplinary committees. This ability ignores due process and is, I submit, a contravention of the right of the individual member. It is unfair to subject an individual to a lengthy disciplinary process, as a result of which the member is obliged to accept that something can be wiped away with a stroke of a pen.</P>
      <P>I accept, however, that the supervisory authority has a role in this, particularly if there are reasons why it is unsatisfied with the outcome of a disciplinary procedure. I propose that rather than having the power to annul a decision of the accountancy bodies, if the supervisory authority, having reviewed the bodies' procedures, concludes that the proper procedures have not been followed, it should be empowered to appeal the decision to the High Court. This is in line with the recommendation of the auditing review group, as Senator O'Toole, who chaired it, will attest.</P>

      <P>This is a point about which the accountancy bodies are agitated. I understand their point as I referred to it some minutes ago. We may unwittingly leave the supervisory authority open to becoming a court of appeal, which is not intended. The intention, as I understand it, is that the authority should simply review the procedures to ensure they are properly dealt with. In practice, if somebody is investigated and an investigation comes out in a particular fashion, if it is open to the supervisory authority in effect to nullify the decision of the earlier disciplinary procedure, then it becomes a court of appeal.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Senator Coghlan, which has the agreement of at least one of the accountancy bodies, is reasonable. The accountancy bodies came to the conclusion that they should be entitled to appeal to the High Court, rather than simply wiping the slate clean, and either demand that a further investigation occur or substitute their own decision. I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>The accountancy bodies are concerned with the definition of &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo; and with the discretion of the supervisory authority, which seems unlimited, to determine that it should carry out an investigation in the public interest. They are anxious that some effort should be made to spell out what the phrase means or at least to include an objective test; in other words, to require that a matter should be in the public interest rather than its being the opinion of the supervisory authority that it is in the public interest.</P>
      <P>They are also concerned that the investigatory procedures of the bodies should have been completed so that if the supervisory authority receives a complaint from a member of the public &ndash; from a client, for the sake of argument &ndash; he or she should, in the first instance, refer it to the accountancy body so that its internal disciplinary procedures or investigation should take place first. If necessary, an investigation should then be carried out by the authority but it would not, in the first instance, carry out an investigation simply because it has received a complaint and deems it to be in the public interest.</P>

      <P>One of the problems in putting legislation together is that one can either go through the detail and prescribe as much as possible or else leave it to the authority. I agree with the clear and relevant points made by Senator McDowell. I know it to be the intention of the supervisory authority unanimously to follow the procedure outlined by Senator McDowell &ndash; in other words, it should always go to the body itself. It would be the intention that this be indicated in the protocol of activities or in regard to the work of the body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must take some responsibility regarding the question of the public interest as I was insistent on its inclusion. However, I could not come up with an objective test for it. The only example I could give was to say that if a matter which was not anticipated and should be investigated was raised in the Dáil or Seanad &ndash; for example, that an elephant walked into the chief executive officer's office and disturbed the auditor &ndash; and if that matter was not covered by the legislation in any objective way, there should be some subjective way of dealing with it. There is a gap in <Col N="392" />the legislation, as Senator McDowell rightly indicated.</P>
    <P>I do not know how to define &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; because it changes over time. The tribunals brought up matters of public interest which were also interesting to the public, and everybody was confused as to which definition they were talking about. All Members know what we mean by &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;, though it is like the old saying, &ldquo; I couldn't describe it to you but I will know it when I see it.&rdquo; I accept that is not a very objective way of doing business but it is, of its nature, subjective. I do not know if we can come up with words to describe the public interest, which means it may be possible for somebody to define &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; as something which is not in the public interest. That is the issue which has been raised and I cannot answer it. We will have to rely on the good sense of the people sitting around the table, although I am not sure that is possible.</P>

      <P>It is our opinion that we would not put it into the Bill and that they would have to consult.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection allows the supervisory authority, on its own initiative or following a complaint, to start an investigation without any requirement that there should a prior investigation by the accountancy bodies. There is not even a requirement for the authority, based on what it believes is in the public interest, to speak to the accountancy bodies in the first instance. I can understand that the Minister of State would say that the supervisory authority will be comprised of good people, appointed by him, and that it will not make any decision that will trample on the interests of the accountancy bodies. On the other hand, however, the accountancy bodies would require &ndash; they are entitled to do so &ndash; some sort of solace in terms of their being consulted. If not, then they should be assured that their investigative procedures will be exhausted before the authority begins an investigation. In fairness, we should make provision for them in this regard.</P>

      <P>In all legislation relating to ombudsmen there is a presumption that people will exhaust domestic remedies. If there was a presumption that people making a complaint should have used the normal processes of the organisations, power could then be reserved to the supervisory body. On occasion, there might be an appalling case where people recognise that there was no point in sending them back down that road. When it is necessary for the authority to act in the public interest, it should state the reasons for doing so.</P>

      <P>If the Minister of State does not come any distance towards us on this point, I will signal my intention to put down a Report Stage amendment on this matter. The basic prin<Col N="394" />ciple is that this is an oversight authority; that we are preserving the self-regulation of the accountancy bodies, but that this oversight body will ensure that this is done properly. This is a power of first instance, under which someone can complain to the authority and, on the face of it, totally bypass the accountancy bodies. The authority will then be in a position to investigate if it decides it is in the public interest to do so. If the basic self-regulation principle is being maintained, there should, at least, be some linkage back to the internal disciplinary procedures of the accountancy bodies. The Minister of State is correct to say that there is a need to have a power, in the first instance, to investigate in exceptional circumstances. However, there should be some linkage between the two, rather than giving blanket power to the authority to bypass the internal disciplinary procedures if it believes that is the correct route to take. The formulation used by Senator Maurice Hayes seems reasonable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 25, subsection (3)(<i>b</i>), lines 24 and 25 to delete &ldquo;, or may be,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I suggest the deletion of the words &ldquo;may be&rdquo; and &ldquo;may arise&rdquo; in the subsections to which the amendments refer. It seems astonishing that the supervisory authority will be given power to act if it thinks there may be a problem. It is stronger than that because the term &ldquo;appears&rdquo; is used. A citizen, or in this case a company, is entitled to some protection against what might be no more than an opinion or a suspicious mind. Subsection (3) states that &ldquo;the Supervisory Authority may give notice to the directors of a relevant undertaking concerning its annual accounts where . it appears to the Supervisory Authority that there is, or may be, a question whether the annual accounts comply with the Companies Acts.&rdquo; That seems logical, but the term &ldquo;it appears to the Supervisory Authority that there is, or may be&rdquo; is used. It is over the top, unnecessary and almost tautology to state this or stretch it way beyond where it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment relates to subsection (4)<i>(a)</i> in which reference is made to &ldquo;the matters in respect of which it appears to the Supervisory Authority that the question of compliance with the Companies Acts arises or may arise&rdquo;. I hope the Minister of State understands the point I am <Col N="395" />making. It is over-the-top to use the term &ldquo;appears&rdquo; and then add the phrase &ldquo;arises or may arise&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing text offers flexibility to the supervisory authority in assessing the question of compliance of company accounts with the obligations under the Companies Act. It is my view that the Senator's amendments will unduly restrict the scope of the supervisory authority in making such amendments. Accordingly, I regret that I am unable to accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister of State feels that way, because I believe the terms used in the Bill are over the top. It would be different if the term &ldquo;appears&rdquo; was not used in the first line of both subsections. I would have thought it correct to use the term &ldquo;it appears to the Supervisory Authority that there is a question of whether the annual accounts comply with the Companies Act&rdquo;. However, the term &ldquo;or may be&rdquo; is used further on. Companies and citizens are entitled to some protection against someone's opinion or the fact that a person may be suspicious by nature. The Minister of State should reconsider the position.</P>
      <P>If it appears to the supervisory authority that something has gone wrong, then it should investigate. I hope the Minister of State will indicate that he will consider changing the position.</P>

      <P>It might be helpful, in order to avoid the appearance of an illusion, if we were to use the term &ldquo;if the Supervisory Authority forms the view that there is or may be&rdquo;. It is the use of the terms &ldquo;appearing&rdquo; and &ldquo;or may be&rdquo; with which Senator Quinn and several other Members find difficult to come to terms. If the authority forms a view that there is a problem with a company, it shows that it has examined the matter carefully. If it has a suspicion that there still might be a problem, that is covered by the form already used.</P>

I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes's suggested wording. If the authority formed the opinion that it, may arise, I would be satisfied. The current wording seems far too extreme and it raises the possibility that someone with a suspicious mind, who would not have to prove anything, could cause action to be taken by the supervisory authority against a company. In my opinion, the wording used is over the top.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 35, to delete lines 18 to 51 and in page 36 to delete lines 1 to 13.</P>
      <P>Section 35 deals with the statutory backing for the disciplinary arrangements of the prescribed accountancy bodies. I propose these deletions to ensure that the disciplinary procedures are efficient, not subject to undue administrative delay and that evidence can be compelled from persons other than members. This point has received little public discussion thus far, but I am aware from my research and consultations that it is critically important to the accounting bodies. They believe it undermines the new principle of supervisory self-regulation and will damage existing disciplinary procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group recommended statutory backing for the disciplinary arrangements of the <Col N="400" />accountancy bodies to assist the bodies in processing cases and thus increase efficiency. The area of weakness in an already robust system concerned the lack of ability of the bodies to compel evidence from third parties who were not members of a professional body. Section 35(2) and (5), which introduced compellability, are, therefore, welcome.</P>
    <P>There is a rider attached to the Bill, however &ndash; perhaps to compensate for the new powers afforded to the accountancy bodies in section 35(6) and (10) &ndash; that necessitates any monetary sanction imposed by the accountancy bodies' internal disciplinary procedures to be confirmed by the High Court. The effect of this will be to delay and undermine the internal disciplinary process which the Bill aims to support.</P>
    <P>Many sanctions imposed by the accountancy bodies are done by way of consent, but who would now accept a consensual order when the matter, irrespective of the size of the monetary penalty involved, has to be referred to the courts? I suggest that we will see an unwillingness to have cases, however trivial, determined in this fashion. The effect will be to undermine the respective institutes' capacity to resolve even minor difficulties. The Minister will appreciate that from his own membership in the past. The courts are already busy and this measure will only serve to tie them up even further. The measure is unnecessary and counter-productive.</P>
    <P>To be fair, the Government's concern is no doubt to ensure there can be no claim that the new statutory backing afforded by the Bill to the procedures of the accountancy bodies is similar to that of the court &ndash; hence, the perceived need to refer all decisions to the court. This is a mistaken view. Even with their enhanced powers of compellability, there are fundamental differences between the respective powers of the disciplinary procedures under discussion and those of the courts. The relationship between the accountancy bodies and their members is governed by a contractual relationship, on which any sanction which arises is based. The accountancy bodies will never impose a sanction on a non-member, for instance. Comparisons with the power of the courts are, therefore, misplaced. This means further provisions are unnecessary and will have the effect of causing additional expense, delay and administrative burden. For these reasons, it would be reasonable to make the deletions prescribed in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a genuine problem in this respect. The accountancy bodies currently impose fines on errant members. I understand such fines are not high and are imposed in most cases following an internal disciplinary procedure. In many cases, these fines or monetary sanctions are imposed following a consensual procedure in which, I understand, the complaint is admitted and the fine paid. The risk in insisting that this be backed up by a court order is that <Col N="401" />one will destroy any possibility of addressing the matter in a simple, straightforward fashion.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, there is an argument that if somebody does wrong, the courts are the appropriate forum for imposing penalties, if necessary, in the full glare of publicity. This ignores the fact that there are venial and mortal sins and that the former are best dealt with efficiently. The use of internal disciplinary procedures should not be discouraged. I suspect that the legal argument will be made that if one sets out the disciplinary procedures in statute and gives them statutory backing, one must inevitably insist that the courts back up by court order any penalty imposed, whether it be the removal of the capacity to practice or simply a small monetary fine.</P>
      <P>The argument is about balance. If somebody is about to be effectively expelled from a professional body, such a step should be backed up by a court order. However, in the event that a &euro;500 fine is imposed, it is hardly necessary to require the accountancy bodies to seek sanction for it in the High Court. Perhaps the most sensible way to deal with the matter would be to set a level of fine above which fines would have to be confirmed and below which, by implication, they would not have to be confirmed.</P>

      <P>Recommendation 10.21 of the report of the review group on auditing recommended that statutory support be given to the investigation and disciplinary regimes of recognised accountancy bodies. Section 35, which inserts a new section 192A into the Companies Act 1990, is designed to achieve this. In the construction of the section the same principles were brought to bear as regards the circumstances in which a supervisory authority has to apply to the court to impose sanctions as would now apply to the prescribed accountancy bodies. I am aware that at least some of the recognised accountancy bodies have expressed reservations about this structure in much the same terms as Senators Coghlan and McDowell.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to ascertain the broadest possible spread of views on the matter in order to be in a position to take an informed decision on it. I have asked my officials to liaise further with the accountancy bodies to elicit the information to enable me to do this. In the meantime, I am reluctant to make the change provided for by the Senator's amendment. Furthermore, the provisions of section 25(2)<i>(c)</i> are interrelated and any amendment to section 35 could have consequential knock-on effects which would have to be considered as an element of any decisions. In the circumstances, I am unable to accept the amendment. Senator Coghlan will note, however, that I am having the matter reviewed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 43, to delete lines 15 to 53 and in page 44, to delete lines 1 to 46 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Subject to subsection (3) and subsection (14) the board of directors of a public limited company shall establish a committee of directors to be known as the Audit Committee. The responsibilities of audit committees shall be determined by a Code of Practice as operated by listed public companies and approved by the Irish Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>(3) Subject to subsection (14) the board of directors of each unlisted public limited company shall either:</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) establish an audit committee that meets the requirements of this section,</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) state in their report under section 158 of the Principal Act that they have not done so and explain the reasons for their decision.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I return to a point I made at the beginning of the debate. Audit committees are almost universal features of listed public companies. They have a sensible role and provide a measure of protection and reassurance for outside shareholders who have little or no contact with the company in question. Many larger companies have a significant number of such shareholders. The role of audit committees is to act as a watchdog on behalf of the hundreds or thousands of outside shareholders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in private companies is completely different. In the great majority, the share<Col N="403" />holders form part of the management, the companies are tightly controlled and there is little danger of undue distance between shareholders and management. The need for a body to specifically represent shareholders does not arise.</P>
    <P>The gist of the amendment is to remove from private companies the requirement to establish audit committees. Imposing audit committees on private companies would add little, if anything, to their controls. It would, however, make it necessary to hire, as described here, non-executive directors specifically for the purpose of establishing and consulting an audit committee. This is an extraordinary requirement. If companies wanted non-executive directors, they would appoint them. Bringing in non-executive directors would be of little benefit and add significant new costs to a private company's business. Accordingly, I propose excluding private companies from the requirement to establish an audit committee.</P>
    <P>In regard to the specific responsibility of directors or audit committees, I propose the more flexible option of introducing a code of practice rather than laying down specific duties in legislation. This is, I understand, in line with practice in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. I also propose fewer restrictions on who qualifies as a non-executive director. This would ease the difficulty of finding sufficient numbers of qualified non-executive directors.</P>
    <P>On the issue of cost, the private companies covered by the section are often family businesses which have selected board members for various purposes, as required. While they may not fit into this category, they do not have outside shareholders. The new section stipulates that companies of a certain size must comply with the requirement to establish an audit committee and seek non-executive directors who fit into this category, whether one wants them. The only reason they must be appointed is for the purposes of establishing an audit committee. Compliance with this requirement would add considerable costs for companies as it would not be easy to find non-executive directors who would act in the manner stipulated in the Bill because it would impose a burden on them.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of this section is that many private companies of the size described compete with companies based outside Ireland, which trade here in competition with Irish companies. This means Irish companies will have to bear the additional cost of this provision, while having to compete with companies free of it. I do not understand the reason for introducing legislation and applying it to private companies, often family businesses, which have to compete with companies registered elsewhere and are thus not obliged to comply with the legislation.</P>

      <P>Yes. As a State, we are saying we want to protect shareholders, which are probably family businesses. I do not understand it and believe it is unfair, particularly to Irish based companies. I can think of a number of companies to which it applies. It should not apply to family businesses or private companies.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that I had said on Second Stage that I understood that many of the big international listed companies would have established Irish bases in order to operate in Ireland. I understand now that is not so and that they do not have to operate here or establish an Irish company. The provision does not apply to companies based outside the State, even if they are competing with Irish companies. I urge the Minister of State to give serious consideration to accepting my amendments which are clearly aimed at large family businesses which must often compete with non-Irish companies.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy with Senator Quinn's submission which has a lot of merit. It seems logical. The legislation is becoming cumbersome and will be difficult to operate. Does the Minister of State envisage having a separate professional group for the professional directors of 30, 40 or 50 companies? There is no restriction confining them to that role in only one company. One possibility is that a separate group could create the profession of roving director, auditor or assistant for these committees.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State on his openness. It reminds me of my time in a similar position when I always listened to the views expressed in the Houses, particularly the Seanad. Many Bills I brought through the Houses were amended in detail in the Seanad which has broad views on issues. The points expressed today may bring radical change to the Bill. I also like the views of Senator O'Toole who was present at the creation of the Bill. Senator Quinn has made logical points which should be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>I totally agree with Senator Quinn. Many of us mentioned this issue on Second Stage. Although the Minister of State was, and perhaps still is, sympathetic, the compliance statement should only apply to large companies with hundreds or thousands of shareholders. In such instances it may be necessary. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. Everybody must obey it. Senator Quinn has advanced the issue of this unnecessary requirement in the case of family businesses which increases bureaucracy and red tape. I support him on the issue.</P>

      <P>If amendment No. 32 was accepted, Government amendments Nos. 33 to 39, inclusive, would be redundant. Amendment No. 44 is linked to amendment No. 32. I am unable to accept the Senator's amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" />The effect of amendment No. 32 would be to restrict the scope of the mandatory requirement to establish an audit committee to listed public limited companies. It would leave it optional for unlisted public limited companies to establish an audit committee. If they decided not to, they would merely have to explain the reason. It would remove any requirement on any private company to establish an audit committee or explain the reason. It would also eliminate any laying down in legislation of a set of responsibilities to be discharged by audit committees.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 44 would mean that failure to establish an audit committee, by even the more limited category of companies that Senator Quinn proposes, would not be an offence. I would not be prepared to remove this sanction under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 13.1 of the report of the review group on auditing recommended that boards of directors of public limited companies, financial institutions and public interest companies should be required by legislation to establish audit committees, the membership of which should be made up of non-executive directors. Other recommendations in the report elaborated on various aspects of what an audit committee should be required to do.</P>
    <P>Section 40, as drafted, applies the mandatory obligation to establish an audit committee to all public limited companies. In the case of public interest companies, the obligation which the legislation imposes is either that an audit committee be established by a private company, or by virtue of section 40(3)(<i>b</i>), to which a clearly technical amendment is being tabled by me in amendment No. 38, that they explain the reason they have decided not to establish such a committee. In the circumstances I am not prepared to accept the limitations inherent in amendment No. 32. However, in the light of various submissions and representations, I consider it necessary to make a number of minor adjustments to the text of subsection (2) as published. Amendment No. 33 will place an onus on a company to provide adequate resources for an audit committee to enable it to properly discharge its responsibilities. This is a reasonable requirement.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 34 makes it clear that the directors of a holding company have no responsibility for determining whether subsidiary companies have kept proper books of account. This obligation is for the directors of the subsidiary companies. Amendment No. 35 clarifies that the recommendation of the audit committee as to who should be appointed as auditor is made to the main board of directors which, in turn, makes the recommendation to shareholders in the matter.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 substitutes the term &ldquo;satisfying itself&rdquo; for the obligation entailed in the text, as published, which was considered onerous. Amendment No. 37 is designed to allow the Minister prescribe by regulations any additional functions that should require to be performed by <Col N="406" />audit committees. This will allow the requirements to be updated as circumstances change.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 38 removes the negative connotations of the term &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, as contained in the published text and substitutes the term &ldquo;decision&rdquo;. Amendment No. 39 makes a similar change to subsection (3)(<i>b</i>), as achieved under the previous amendment in terms of greater precision in terminology. It also specifies the subsection to which it refers.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept amendment No. 32 and commend my amendments, Nos. 33 to 39 inclusive, to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the issue of the private family company. The issues raised by Senator Quinn are serious. Attempts have been made to do something in that regard but no doubt not enough from his point of view. Unfortunately, one of the reasons this arose is the various meetings between a family supermarket &ndash; certainly not Senator Quinn's &ndash; and a former Taoiseach. This was one of the issues. In submissions I received it was said we must include private companies for that reason. That is the reason there is a requirement to do so. It was a clear instruction from both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Committee of Public Accounts. When the Committee of Public Accounts looked at the report of the audit review group, it was just about satisfied with the part concerning this issue. It was not quite what it wanted as it wanted to raise the bar a lot more in the case of private companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have sympathy for the points raised by Senator Quinn, I remind the House of how this issue arose. It did not arise from the audit review group but from a direct instruction in the report of the Committee of Public Accounts. I had the job of explaining the issue to the committee. The late Deputy Jim Mitchell, who chaired the committee, was less than enthusiastic about this aspect of the report and said it did not go far enough. The others central to the debate were Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Durkan and former Deputy Seán Doherty. If one reads the report and the discussions on it, one will see that they reluctantly accepted this issue and the compliance statement, on which I do not want to anticipate discussion. I want people to understand that is where it came from and that it was not dreamed <Col N="407" />up. It was a clear direction in the recommended report accepted by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse what Senator O'Toole said. It is always a little difficult to insert sections into Acts. My understanding of this section is that it only applies to large private companies where the balance sheet is more than &euro;25 million or the turnover is more than &euro;50 million. We are talking about substantial companies. There are undoubtedly family companies in this country which exceed those limits but there are not many of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the committee is in place to protect the public and shareholders. However, private companies deal and trade and the people with whom they deal and trade need some protection. I know the committee provides at least one of the elements of protection this Bill is looking to put in place. I am inclined to agree with Senator O'Toole. I would have lowered the bar rather than eliminating it altogether. Do we know how many large companies are involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know but can picture many of them. The review committee on auditing referred to public interest companies, not private companies. That is different and adds a cost. The Minister of State's amendment No. 33 includes the words &ldquo;establish and adequately resource&rdquo;. That cost will be imposed on the private company competing with other companies not subject to such a stipulation. We are doing this because of one case ten or 12 years ago, to which Senator O'Toole referred, where one large private company was found in the eyes of the Committee of Public Accounts to have done something incorrect, which it did. It seems we are passing a law which will hinder and shackle every private company in Ireland over a certain size, even if they are competing with other companies not subject to this stipulation.</P>
      <P>I read an article in a magazine a few days ago which stated similar legislation was being introduced in many countries. However, I could not find one case where a private company was covered. This will be unique. We are now back to where I started today when I spoke about a regulatory impact assessment which we do not have. The Minister of State did not answer my query in that regard. The Government has a policy of saying we should have such an assessment. However, we have not done that in this case. We will now set standards which other countries in the world have not thought of setting. We will impose costs and regulations on private companies which do not have outside shareholders. That is wrong. The Minister of State must rethink this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" />The businesses I know and in which I am involved are competing with other companies not subject to this regulation because they are based outside the State. We are saying that, although we do not have any regulatory impact assessment, we will set up something which other countries in the world have not done or are not thinking of doing. That will hinder Irish companies competing with other companies. The Minister of State is wrong to do this. My amendment seeks to remove private companies from it. I am thinking of family businesses which start small, as Senator O'Toole said, and succeed. If they do not succeed and they stay small, it will not affect them. That means we are encouraging them to stay small, not thrive and grow.</P>
    <P>This is bad law because it is based on the only one instance given by Senator O'Toole which happened ten or 12 years ago. It is not in the interests of the State, its citizens or those companies competing with others. It is a mistake to say we will introduce a new law because of one instance which happened ten or 12 years ago and hinder Irish companies competing with non-Irish companies. I urge the Minister of State to rethink this issue.</P>

      <P>It would be incorrect to present this as a knee-jerk reaction. I gave one example. I remind the House that the Legislature and everyone in both Houses were criticised by commentators, the public and everyone involved in the tribunals over the reason that and other such cases could have happened. That led to a huge inquiry, which produced two tomes, by the Committee of Public Accounts. It went through in detail the possibilities and the difficulties arising from this matter and came to strong conclusions. The audit review group diluted those conclusions to a certain extent and the Bill dilutes them further by raising the bar, as Senator McDowell said. Whatever else it is, it is not a knee-jerk reaction to only one case. Much consideration has been given to it. The Houses demanded that legislation be introduced to ensure this could not happen again. The issue was discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts. Whatever our decision, the issue has been given a lot of concentrated thought. It came as a direction from the tribunals set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

We are passing a law which will apply to those 100 companies, <Col N="409" />each one of which is competing with others which are not subject to this regulation. We are setting a standard which does not apply in any other part of the world and which other countries do not intend to introduce. We are saying it will apply to Ireland because we want to be whiter than white. However, we are doing this without a regulatory impact assessment which the State and the Government declared they would introduce. This is an impossible step for the State to take if it wants to be able to compete in businesses where there are competitors to whom this does not apply. It will apply only to Irish companies, not non-Irish companies. Some 100 Irish companies must now add resources which other companies will not have to do. We are doing this because of one instance which happened ten years ago. It is bad to make decisions on that basis. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider.</P>

That is the same as making it mandatory. Why are we setting standards in Ireland which are higher than anywhere else in the world without a regulatory impact assessment? This will affect 100 Irish companies competing with non-Irish companies. I do not understand it. I do not remember such legislation passing through the House on previous occasions.</P>

There is no way of knowing whether it happened previously. The Committee of Public Accounts responded that the Oireachtas had a duty to ensure legislation was put in place to make sure this could not happen in the future. A number of clauses have been proposed, which Senator Quinn feels do not go far enough. However, it must be recognised that while the bar has been raised, there is an opt out clause and an opportunity to give an explanation is provided. I do not know that the provision can be diluted more than that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) is, or was at any time during the year preceding appointment to the committee, an employee of the company concerned, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) is an executive chairperson of the board of directors.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I refer to the difficulty faced by companies, particularly if compliance legislation is enacted, in recruiting non-executive directors. For example, it is regarded as good policy to appoint a non-executive chairman. Such a person should be a member of an audit committee. On that basis, the word &ldquo;executive&rdquo; should be deleted. An executive chairman of a board would not be suitable but a non-executive chairman should be a member of the audit committee. It would be unhealthy if a non-executive chairman was not a member.</P>
      <P>An individual who has left an executive position is a suitable candidate to work on an audit committee but barring him or her from taking up such a position for five years is excessive. While I propose that this should be amended to one year, I would be happy if an amendment was tabled to reduce the period to between one and five years. Executives have left their posts having held them for less than five years and they would be suitable to serve on audit committees.</P>

      <P>Would it help if a distinction was made between private and public companies? I can see difficulties in this regard in a private company but, generally, public companies would be large enough to cast the play. It probably is preferable in such cases that a person other than the chairman should serve on the audit committee. There is no great problem in a private company and I presume that the audit committee would be treated in the same way as an internal audit unit, which is meant to skip line management and report to the top brass. The restriction on the chairman could be applied to public companies but flexibility could be adopted for private companies.</P>

      <P>Private companies do not have to set up audit committees and it would not be best practice to amend the composition and terms of reference for the membership of an audit committee. The effect of Senator Quinn's amendment would be to allow an employee to be appointed to an audit committee one year after ceasing to be employed by the company and it would only debar an executive chairman from being a mem<Col N="412" />ber. This relaxation of the criteria set out in the legislation would dilute the intended effect of the requirement. Accordingly, I am not prepared to accept the amendment. I commend my amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 51, to delete lines 9 to 15 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) Irish Companies Acts, and</P>
      <P>(b) Irish tax law;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section relates to directors' compliance and related statements, about which all of us got worked up on Second Stage. The reason I have tabled the amendment is to simplify the relevant obligations, allow the report to acknowledge if a report has been made to another regulatory authority and confine the compliance statement to large companies. Everyone acknowledges companies, accountants and auditors should comply with the law. Accountants and auditors are subject to significant whistle-blowing obligations. They are operating those legal provisions, as attested to in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>
      <P>This section, however, requires public disclosure of problems, even if they have been reported to the relevant authority for investigation. This requirement for public reporting will have serious consequences for all companies and directors as it could effectively result in self-incrimination. If a breach has previously been reported to the appropriate regulatory authority, further disclosure should be unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The scope and complexity of the compliance statements proposed in the Bill will have a significant impact on Irish businesses. The Bill places an onerous requirement on the directors of all companies to make a positive statement that the company has complied with all tax, company and other relevant law and disclose the nature of the breaches, regardless of whether they have previously reported them. Given that the relevant obligations as stated are extremely wide, potential breaches of foreign tax and company law relating to subsidiaries and potential breaches of competition law, environmental law, etc. will require disclosure. Auditors and accountants without the necessary expertise will be asked to adjudicate on these areas, which will involve significant additional costs and go considerably further than comparative legislation in the United Kingdom and the United States. As the primary concern of the State is compliance with Irish tax and company law, the relevant obligations should be defined as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement to prepare a compliance statement extends to small and medium companies. As it does not apply to branches of foreign companies, sole traders or partnerships, it could place small and medium-sized companies in Ireland at a serious disadvantage. As I said on <Col N="414" />the Order of Business, I am concerned about our competitiveness across the board. This provision could put us at a serious competitive disadvantage. As this appears to be contrary to the recommendations of the task force on small business, small and medium-sized companies, as already defined in the Companies Act, should be exempt from these requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Government amendments have been tabled that ease the position of subsidiary companies in relation to audit committees and others. I wonder if the same applies here, as it would make a big difference. I am a director of three organisations, one of which is a large international company while the others are a regulatory body and a charity. As I stated on Second Stage, I would encourage the Minister of State to keep charities out of the ambit of this legislation and the Companies Act. This type of legislation is not suitable for charities and placing such requirements on them creates considerable trouble for them.</P>
      <P>As a non-executive director, I welcome the thrust and intention of the Bill. I would find it difficult to make the declaration on areas other than those covered by the Companies Acts and tax law. While Senator O'Toole has explained the reasoning, this will make it difficult for people to be non-executive directors and deter them from taking up such positions. A few months ago I dealt with a company document which had to be done very conscientiously. With a 52 page document we received an 80 page document from legal advisers. I would be afraid we might create a cottage industry in which directors would feel the need to always be advised on these matters.</P>
      <P>Obligations under the Companies Acts and tax law present no difficulty. However, paragraph (<i>c</i>) in the new proposal states: &ldquo;any other enactments that provide a legal framework within which the company operates and that may materially affect the company's financial statements&rdquo;. This would cover areas such as health and safety, and equality law, not only in this country but also elsewhere. If there is a contingency that would affect the financial standing of the company, that should be picked up by accounting standards. There is an element of social engineering in this and trying to ensure compliance with equality, health and safety, environmental protection, etc., which are not strictly financial matters and could be dealt with elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The declaration at section 4(<i>d</i>) appears to be a belt and braces provision. The job of the non-executive director is to ensure systems are in place, applied and reviewed. I have no difficulty in making a declaration about the existence, operation and reviewability of systems. However, to be asked to express a view as to whether these systems are broken down in a particular place is either self-inculpatory or unnecessary. I ask the Minister of State to consider whether this is absolutely necessary. The combination of these provisions could well deter the very sorts of <Col N="415" />people we want. While they will not inhibit non-conscientious persons, the more conscientious people are about the job they are doing, the more concerned they will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Speakers have raised some very relevant issues. Senator Maurice Hayes has probably pinpointed what the legislation is trying to achieve and what it is trying not to do. Perhaps it would be easier if the Bill indicated in more precise terms what was required of the directors in a checklist format. Over the past two years the accountancy bodies have consistently advised that it should not be excessively prescriptive. In order that people can be absolutely clear, I would like this to be written down. A protocol of interpretation should be agreed which might be in place by regulation. I do not know if this is possible. Even it if is not, it is logical to recommend dropping paragraph (<i>c</i>) and limiting the requirements to the Companies Acts and tax law. Many arguments could be made for doing so.</P>
      <P>All the advice I have seen suggests that it is almost as if the legislation offers an interpretation to people that they do not have to comply with other legislation. In order to try to balance this, the &ldquo;materially affect&rdquo; issue was included. It has been interpreted in this way:</P>
      <P>This means, for example, that a company which avoids putting in a fire door is deemed to have made a profit to the extent that it has saved the cash on the door and that therefore the person is criminally liable.</P>
      <P>That is an accountant's interpretation but it is the kind of nonsense we are trying to avoid.</P>
      <P>The points made by Senators Coghlan and Maurice Hayes are very focused and should be dealt with. I have been saying to accountants and others who have talked about the Bill that it is not a matter of people saying their company needs to look at every legislative measure that might affect company law in any way, checking off those which affect the company's balance sheet. It is the other way round: people should look at their company's balance sheet, work out what might affect their company and how that applies to the law, including extraneous, non-taxation and non-company laws. What do I mean? Let us take a pro and con example.</P>
      <P>If a company's directors become aware that their company is spewing all sorts of dirt into the Shannon without passing through the filtration systems required by law, thereby being absolutely uncompetitive with other companies as well as destroying the environment, this materially affects the balance sheet and they will be required to ensure that, having become aware of it, they disclose it. However, the step beforehand is this &ndash; how did they become aware of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two things could happen. They might not become aware of it. They might be the most diligent directors &ndash; executive, non-executive, independent or whatever &ndash; but they might not <Col N="416" />become aware of it because others further down the line might be playing games or engaging in nefarious activities. On the other hand, if the company directors became aware that the chief executive determinedly appointed a woman as opposed to a man to a position, that would be a clear breach of the equality legislation but it would not have a material impact on the balance sheet. There would be no requirement to disclose this, apart from a certain moral compulsion, and it would not come under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The accountancy bodies must be reassured on this issue. They must be confident that what is happening is reasonable, practicable and doable. People will generally agree with the views expressed by accountancy bodies, once one gets past the first paragraph.</P>
    <P>Where does this come from? It comes from the argument made time and again at the tribunals, where directors said they did not know what was going on. There is a requirement for people to ensure they try to find out. Senator Maurice Hayes put his finger on how this should be done &ndash; the directors should satisfy themselves, not by going to every corner of the company, but by asking about the compliance procedures in place in their company and whether there is an internal checklist to see if those procedures work. The directors can be required to do no more than this. They should have the responsibility of ensuring this is done and should be accountable if it is not. However, if it is done but there are still breaches of the law, the directors should not be held responsible, and could not be if they had discharged their functions under the existing terms. Terms such as &ldquo;materially affect&rdquo; and others are an attempt to do this.</P>
    <P>Genuine issues have been raised and the only way to address them is if people can be assured this will be done through agreement and discussion. Auditors and accountants rather than company directors would be best equipped to advise on this matter, though that does not really matter. There should be some form of understood protocol for operating this. That is the way forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>In our last debate I, as co-founder of a small business, told the Minister of State that directors really had to earn their money. Every penny spent by small companies is critical. From talking to others in business there seem to be serious problems with the compliance statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community-based and non-profit companies should be excluded from this provision. Those doing voluntary work may become directors of companies and though they are not paid, they will be responsible if the company does not act properly. Also, as co-owner of a small business, I know there are hundreds of laws on compliance. If the Minister of State could define the number, directors would know which laws were which and what they must be responsible for. The auditing and financing laws are straightforward but directors must inform themselves about others such as <Col N="417" />health and safety laws. If directors do not brief themselves, they can end up in the courts and one may find eventually that people will not take up directorships as it is not worth the money.</P>
    <P>There should be a limited or at least precise number of laws in this area, while directors of non-profit and voluntary organisations should be excluded and there should be a threshold for companies required to comply with section 43. It should be set initially at a high level such as &euro;100 million in sales, though Senator Leyden did not suggest that high a figure in the last debate, until there is experience of the operation of the provision.</P>
    <P>I understand where Senator O'Toole is coming from and that this may appear heavy-handed. We do not want to put good people off. From my experience with a small company, a good director is worth gold.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister of State's amendment. For far too long there have been too many golden circle directors who seem to go from one boardroom to another for a glass of brandy and a chat. Look at the AIB. It did not seem to care what was happening in America and none of its directors resigned or took responsibility for it, yet when I go to that bank, it is overcharging me for services. I am tired of this golden circle and will not support it. It consists of professional directors who go from one boardroom to another. They do not care if the companies concerned are involved with the Mafia in New York or pollution in Colombia. They wash their hands of the matter and are not interested. This provision will make them very interested. If they do not like the responsibilities, they should not take on the job. Most are very well remunerated &ndash; too well in most instances. I got no offers to become a director when, as a former Minister of State, I was out in the wilderness.</P>

      <P>I would have scrutinised their affairs honestly. I got one offer from an organisation and perhaps I was wrong but I was too conscientious to get involved with it. I would not take responsibility for its activities. If one saw a full list of directors, there are about ten people in ten different companies in Dublin. They should do their jobs and resign from five or six of the companies concerned in compliance with the rules and regulations. They should be responsible for the activities of their companies and sign off on them. If they do not want to do so, they should not get involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted this measure has been included. It is about time somebody accepted responsibility and a few directors resigned. Do the directors of the AIB have any shame? Despite the loss of $670 million in America, nobody shouted, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;. Not one director fell on his or her sword or even apologised to hard pressed customers. <Col N="418" />Let directors read this Bill and realise that once it is passed, they will have to ensure the companies from which they get their soft money must comply with all the rules and regulations, and the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with anything Senator Leyden said which was all perfectly fair and reasonable. On the face of it, the requirement in the Bill is very simple. It simply states directors must sign off on a statement that the company has complied with the law, or at least some of it, that is, those elements which could impact on its accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One wonders what all the fuss is about. Why is there a problem with this? As Senator White identified, the real reason there is a problem is that many directors do not ask questions. They <Col N="419" />go to a meeting once a month &ndash; perhaps less frequently &ndash; and may get a report, listen with one ear, do not ask questions and to all intents and purposes sign off on it. If this requirement encourages or obliges them to ask questions &ndash; nothing more than that &ndash; it will do a good job.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan made a couple of interesting points which bear scrutiny. One was whether this requirement should be limited to smaller companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Family businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On face value, one would be inclined to say, &ldquo;Maybe so.&rdquo; Although I do not have any evidence, I suspect that in smaller companies and family business the board, as such, works less effectively in that there may not be many meetings, the directors do not ask any questions or, in the case of a family company, are likely to be members of the same family and simply do not ask questions. I am not sure that by limiting it to larger companies, it would have the desired effect.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes made a point about whether we should exclude non-profit companies or charities. I am a director of only one company &ndash; one of the partnership companies, obviously a non-profit one. However, it employs 25 people and uses a lot of money, almost all of which is State money. Should there be an obligation on me, as a public representative, as on other directors to ask those questions? There probably should be, notwithstanding the fact that it is not a profiting making company.</P>
      <P>Let us face it, some of the financial practices of charities would not bear much scrutiny. It is perhaps no harm&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not proposing to exclude charities from regulation because they need to be regulated. While there should be a charities regulation body, they should be removed from the ambit of this form of&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the difficulty that charities, in particular, go for high profile directors, big names, men and women who are well known and which they only really want as a rubber-stamp? They do not want them as directors who will ask questions. Perhaps that is too general a statement to make but I can think of examples in which that is the case and where there are well known directors of charities who, I suspect, do not ask many questions about the fundraising or accounting practices or financing of the charity concerned. I am not sure there is a case for excluding them. I do not think one could exclude them all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point Senator Coghlan made with which I have more sympathy was that a breach of health and safety legislation, for example, might have been reported to the Health and Safety Authority or the relevant regulatory authority. Where a matter is already under investigation by <Col N="420" />a State regulatory authority, there is perhaps a case to be made that it should not necessarily have to be reported on an annual basis or separately signed off on by the directors. That case, on the face of it, seems to be a good one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great difficulty with this. I was delighted to hear Senator O'Toole's argument and what he was trying to achieve. What we are all trying to achieve is something with which nobody could disagree. I strongly believe this compliance statement will be cumbersome, costly and, in most cases, ineffective. Directors will be required, under threat of a statutory offence, to certify that their company is in compliance with every aspect of the law.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan suggested we should limit it to tax laws, which is correct. Directors will have to be able to certify that their company is compliant, not only with company and tax laws but also with environment, health and safety and employment laws. They will have to become policemen and detectives in their own companies. There is only one way they can do so which is by engaging expensive new internal audit or consultancy measures to check out every possible breach of the law before they certify compliance. That is what I understand this measure to mean. Apart from any other consideration, it will become extremely difficult to hire non-executive directors, as has been said by a number of speakers, willing to take on this burden of responsibility because it would be an offence if they failed to comply.</P>
      <P>The most damaging aspect of the compliance statement is that it will distract directors from the very task for which they have been taken on. Most Members who have spoken did not talk about the need to make a company successful. The jobs which come from a thriving successful company in a highly competitive business mean having to focus one's attention on making sure the company succeeds, manages to compete and survive in the marketplace with others. That is the reason one takes on directors. Their main task is to help a company succeed in a very competitive marketplace. If one says directors must do this but that they must also become policemen, one will distract them from that very task. Their eyes will be taken off the ball in companies which must thrive and grow in the interests of shareholders, employees and the business as a whole. They will end up becoming detectives, policemen or watchdogs and will be scared if they do not do so.</P>

    <P>Placing such a requirement on directors is bound to change their priorities. They are bound to say their main priority &ndash; we have heard most of this today &ndash; is to make sure they do not break the law. That should not be their main priority but one of them. Their main priority should be to make sure the company succeeds, thrives, creates jobs and is successful. That is what has made this nation successful in recent years. This provision will turn <Col N="421" />directors into investigators rather than entrepreneurs whose main job is to focus on making a business succeed. It will prove seriously counterproductive to that very objective, the strength of Irish business and, therefore, the whole economy.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Seanad Éireann, seeking to ensure trust and confidence in the process of auctioneering, calls on the Government to establish a group, predominantly comprising non-auctioneers, for the special purpose of drawing up a Code of Ethics and Professional Standards applicable to auctioneers in the course of their professional work. Such Code to be implemented by order, regulation or legislation and to include, <i>inter alia:</i>&ndash;&nbsp;a requirement that, prior to undertaking any auctioneering transaction auctioneers be required to make a declaration of interest if they themselves, fellow employees or family members have any beneficial interest in the transaction either as vendor or purchaser;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;an entitlement by bidders or their representatives to be present at the opening of all sealed bids;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;a requirement that all properties have a published guide price;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;an insistence that no property be withdrawn in the event that a bid exceeds the guide price;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;a requirement that all auctioneers maintain for inspection by an approved authority a record of all bids and bidders; and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;an appropriate system to facilitate the investigation of complaints by bidders who believe that they have not been fairly treated in the course of an auctioneering transaction.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the House, I will speak for ten minutes, followed by Senator O'Toole, who will speak for ten minutes. Is it possible to allow Senator O'Toole to reply to the debate as I will be absent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This serious motion, which is long overdue for debate, concerns the auctioneering profession. It is appropriate that it should come so soon after the previous debate on this subject. It concerns the self-regulation of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does one need to be in order to be an auctioneer? The answer is that one does not need to be anything. All one needs in order to qualify and practise is to lodge a &euro;12,700 bond in the District Court. Some of the auctioneering bodies <Col N="422" />insist that they have greater qualifications than this and that they have professional qualifications. However, these are not necessarily required.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two cases concerning auctioneers which caused me a great deal of grief and which indicate the need for regulation from outside and for greater transparency. Is there any reason a profession such as auctioneering should ever have to handle money? I see no need for it to handle, hold and give money on behalf of its clients and it is extraordinary that it feels the need to do so. Auctioneers take booking deposits from people. In the first case to which I will refer, a vendor was selling his house for a considerable sum of money and a very reputable auctioneer from this country carried out the transaction on this behalf. Without the permission, request or knowledge of the vendor, he took a very large so-called booking deposit from the purchaser, who &ndash; as he or she might rightly do &ndash; handed it over thinking that it had some sort of legal standing. A large booking deposit &ndash; I believe it was £25,000 or £30,000 in this case &ndash; has no legal standing at all and gives the purchaser no rights whatsoever. It is taken without permission and without request by the auctioneer and it is held by him normally until the sale is completed.</P>
    <P>Why is this money taken by an auctioneer if it has no legal standing whatsoever? It is taken to protect his commission from the vendor, a point which many auctioneers have made to me in the interim. The auctioneer is giving the buyer the impression that he has some sort of right to the purchase, but he has none because it is not a deposit in the legal sense. He is taking money for himself, which he has absolutely no right to hold, and the vendor is not getting the benefit of that money either. In the case in question, it required extreme measures on the part of the vendor to get the auctioneer to hand over the booking deposit to his lawyer. Why should auctioneers give the particularly false impression that booking deposits have some sort of legal standing when that is clearly not the case?</P>
    <P>The second case, which came to my notice recently, is more serious and involves what must be a common occurrence. It concerns a highly reputable firm of auctioneers, if there is such a thing, and involved a house that was up for auction in south Dublin. I understand the property was withdrawn. One set of bidders went to the auctioneer to buy it. Bidding, as it normally does, took place behind closed doors, with another set of bidders of whose identity the members of the first group were unaware. They were bidding against each other for a long time. Eventually the auctioneer said that unless they had the money up-front by 5 p.m. that day, the house would go to the other bidder. The house was worth over £500,000. The money was made available by 5 p.m., within two hours of the auctioneer's request. However, the auctioneer stated that matters had become ridiculous and that there would be a process of sealed bids. This was agreed to by <Col N="423" />those present. The bidders to whom I am referring asked if they could be present at the opening of the sealed bids and were told they could not. They asked if they could have an independent person present and again were refused. When the sealed bids were opened they had submitted the highest bid but the property was sold to the underbidder.</P>
    <P>Could someone please tell me what is going on in this extraordinary industry where they do not let anyone see what is happening, they take money they are not entitled to, they give the impression that the people who give them money are entitled to something to which they are not and they sell to the underbidder at the end? This industry is self-regulating and the incident I have described is not an isolated one. It is typical of the practices in this industry.</P>
    <P>One only has to look at the numbers of disciplinary actions taken by the bodies involved to realise how little is being done. Let us acknowledge that they are beginning to wake up to the fact that something is happening which is not acceptable and about with there is a great deal of public unease. The industry has been left alone to look after itself and has betrayed public trust for the period during which it has done so.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary coincidence about guide prices. Guide prices published day after day in the newspapers inevitable come in below the price at which the property is sold. These guide prices are, apparently, set by people who have an expertise in this area. Their only expertise is in continually ensuring that the prices set to give a gullible public a guide are, inevitably, pitched well below the prices at which these houses sell. Why is this? The reason is quite simple. It sucks people in, makes them borrow more and makes them do more valuations and architectural inspections. Inevitably, people are disappointed and spend more money and the property is sold for much more than the guide price, sometimes twice as much. How can valuers make mistakes like that?</P>
    <P>I have spoken to auctioneers who have told me, quite openly, that a vendor should pitch the price very low to get a few suckers in. That is how this profession, if that is what it is, behaves. It behaves in a way which continually fools the public and is designed to do so. That is why it needs, at the very least a code of ethics, more likely a supervisory body, and finally regulation from outside. I do not believe in self-regulation for any professional body. I do not believe in it for the stock exchange, for auditors, for lawyers or for anyone else because there is incontrovertible evidence that it has been abused by most of those professions which have had that privilege.</P>
    <P>Scaled fees are an abomination. They do not reflect the work done on properties of any sort. The idea that fees should be scaled so that tens of thousands of pounds are paid for very limited, unskilled work by people who, in some cases, have no professional qualifications, whether in <Col N="424" />valuation or anything else, is one that needs serious examination.</P>
    <P>This industry is one about which there are so many bad stories and over which there is so little regulation that there is a case for the Oireachtas to intervene and insist upon better ethics within it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to continue the discussion on this issue. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I ask him to consider the following reasons for bringing this issue forward.</P>
      <P>Last year more than 50,000 new houses were sold in this country. At an average price of &euro;200,000 each that represents &euro;10 billion spent on new houses alone. If one includes the second-hand market one can, at least, double that figure. We are talking about approximately &euro;25 billion worth of transactions which are not regulated in a way other transactions of that type would be.</P>
      <P>When we tabled this motion there was a general view that our purpose was to put the boot into auctioneers. Actioneering groups have, in fact, been supportive of this motion. Senators Coghlan, Ross and I met with Mr. Aodán Ó hÓgáin of the IAVI and, while he did not agree with everything we were saying, he was very supportive of the approach we were taking. I have also had responses from groups such as REMAX, which have encouraged us to do this. The intention is not to have a go at auctioneers but to further professionalise the work they do and to give it an authority to which auctioneers are entitled and which the general public requires with regard to transactions of this size. Buying or selling a house is a transaction which places huge emotional pressures on people.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment is a positive one. I would like a reassurance from the Government that the proposed review will not take place in the dark recesses of the Department of Jusice, Equality and Law Reform where we might never find out what is going on. Such a review should be undertaken by a broader group than people within the Department and it should involve the main auctioneering groups as well as consumers and independent people. I ask the Minister of State to make this clear.</P>
      <P>Our motion asks for a code of ethics and professional standards applicable to all auctioneers. Some groups already have such a code and I would like to give them the force of regulation and law so that they will have the trust and confidence of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, auctioneers do not enjoy the trust and confidence of the public. Why is this? Let me make three references. In the course of one of the tribunals we saw one of the highest profile auctioneers in the State, a man of huge reputation, who was not only the auctioneer and agent in charge of selling a property but was also a buyer. He was acting on behalf of an order of nuns who trusted him implicitly because he was a daily Massgoer etc. and they could not believe he <Col N="425" />would do any wrong. That was a shock to all of us.</P>
    <P>Another case involved a couple in County Kildare who had scrimped and saved to put together the deposit on a house at the furthest limit of their financial possibilities with support from family and everyone else. They placed the deposit and organised a loan but when they went back to close the sale they were told the price of the property had been raised. They went to court and won their case and I think we all cheered that day. It was the first time we had seen such a thing happening.</P>
    <P>In another court case it emerged that auctioneers did not have the slightest difficulty in sending colleagues into an auction to bump up the prices from the back of the room. If an auction is to be a fair and open procedure, that cannot be allowed to happen. Those are unacceptable practices.</P>
    <P>I will balance that by referring to a public decision taken by an auctioneer in County Meath at some stage in the past five years. A firm of auctioneers was dealing with the sale of a large estate, which it had advertised in local and national newspapers. When it had attracted potential buyers, the developers of the property decided to increase the price. The auctioneer said that was not fair, but the developers would not back down. The auctioneer then refused to handle the sale. I refer to Pottertons, the auctioneers in County Meath. I do not know that company, but its gesture has always stuck in my mind as one of high and extraordinary principle.</P>
    <P>I say this to provide an element of balance. I would trust fully the auctioneers I know, but there are issues we need to look at. We need a qualification and a course content for auctioneers. There are superb courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology in Bolton Street and other places, which are supported by all the auctioneers I know. We should expect auctioneers in the future to have such a qualification, though we cannot ask those currently practising as auctioneers to obtain it.</P>
    <P>We are talking of legal transactions. From the moment the vendor meets the auctioneer or agent, there is a contract in place. There is also protection for vendor, agent and purchaser. Senator Ross has mentioned sealed bids. If there are to be sealed bids for property, then a third party must be present, perhaps some honest broker who would oversee the process. There are times when it might not be appropriate to sell a property to the highest bidder, but people must know why.</P>
    <P>I know the difference between a guide price and a reserve price. I have considered how the reserve price might at some point be made known. Whatever the reserve price is, the guide price must be real. If the Minister were selling a house on my behalf and put down the guide price, then that must be a price at which I am prepared to sell. It might be well above the reserve price, but one cannot put a property up for sale with a guide price and then refuse to sell it for that price. <Col N="426" />If a bid is made above the guide price, the property must be on the market. In terms of a contract, that is reasonable.</P>
    <P>There are various points of view involving the different parties to a sale, but there must be certain elements we can all depend on. There must also be a system of investigation, if someone has a complaint. It must be an open investigation. I recognise that the IAVI has good practices in place. I am impressed by what it is doing, but it needs more power and authority, as well as more openness and transparency in how it goes about its work, so that if I make a complaint, I can check that it is being looked at.</P>
    <P>All properties should have published guide prices. I recognise such prices need not be the same as the reserve prices. The reserve price might well be below the guide price, but if it is above it, then that is dishonest.</P>
    <P>The point is to professionalise the business of auctioneering, to give trust and confidence to people involved in sales transactions, and also to engender proper respect for auctioneers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon" hpid="Mr. Scanlon Mr. Scanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&ndash;&nbsp;notes that the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973 provide a regulatory framework for the manner in which auctioneers and house agents must act in the performance of their professional work;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;recognises that the regular review of the adequacy of regulatory legislation is desirable;</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;invites the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to arrange for a review of the regulatory framework for the auctioneering industry, including an examination of the need for the introduction of a code of ethics and professional standards for the auctioneering profession.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am a member of the IPAV. It is a pity that Senator Ross has left, because he said that the auctioneering profession is not regulated. All auctioneers and estate agents have to apply annually to renew their licences. It is open to any member of the public to register an objection to the renewal of that licence, provided he or she can support their grounds for objection. To have one's licence renewed, one must advertise in a local or national newspaper and go before a court of law. Anyone who has reason to object to the granting of that licence can make a case, and the licence may be revoked. It is wrong to say the industry is not regulated. I do not know of any profession in this country which has such regulations applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All auctioneers must furnish a tax clearance certificate annually, along with a certificate from his or her own accountant to confirm that they have conducted all financial transactions in <Col N="427" />relation to clients' funds in a proper fashion. Under accountability and transparency procedures, the IPAV appoints external members to its disciplinary committee. Both the IPAV and the IAVI have long recognised that the current legal requirement of a minimum bond of &euro;12,700 is entirely inadequate and unrealistic and have put in place substantial deposit protection funds. The limits of these funds are kept under ongoing review.</P>
    <P>While there are no educational requirements for an auctioneer's licence, both the IPAV and the IAVI run a wide range of courses, which are subject to strict examination standards, set and monitored by suitably qualified personnel. An estimated 90% of auctioneers and estate agents are members of one or other of the institutes, although membership is not obligatory in order to run a practice.</P>
    <P>All agents have a legal contractual obligation to their clients, the property vendors. They have a duty of care also to potential purchasers. This encompasses obligations not wilfully to give false or misleading information. The IPAV does not support the lowest of price guidelines within 10% or any percentage point as we believe it is an unworkable notion which leads only to confusion and disappointment for the house-hunter. If asked, members will try to be as helpful as possible in giving an estimate of the price region. However, this is often impossible when the property is to be auctioned. We live in a free market economy where the best offer secures the property.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in auctions where the best advice has been given, along with a guide price, and yet the guide price has regularly been beaten, for example by &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 in the case of a house with a guide price of &euro;150,000. It also happens that guide prices are not reached.</P>
    <P>In its recent study of professions for the Competition Authority, Indecon identified five tests for professionals in determining whether or not they are competitive. These involve the entry requirements to a profession, and their possible use to restrict entry to the profession; the existence of free competition between members of the profession; the question of allowing advertising by the profession; the demarcation of the profession's functions in such a way as possibly to restrict the activities of other groups; and the freedom or otherwise of the profession's members to form limited companies of multidisciplinary practices.</P>
    <P>From any reasonable perspective, auctioneering passes all five tests to determine whether a particular profession is competitive or not. The service given to prospective buyers and tenants by auctioneers is very much taken for granted, despite the enormous commitment involved in terms of professional time, travel and effort. While percentage fees have dropped dramatically, the buying and selling public still <Col N="428" />expect, and by and large receive, a first-class service.</P>
    <P>The claim that the auctioneering sector lacks competition is inconsistent with what is happening. When instructions are sought or given, it is now normal that four or five auctioneering firms will be invited to tender for business, and fee rates fully reflect this fact. I can think of no other profession that fails to charge for the time it spends on aborted work.</P>
    <P>Auctioneering is the very essence of a consumer driven profession. In recent years it has been open season on auctioneers' fees with current fee percentages being merely a fraction of those prevailing in the early 1990s, while the percentage taken by the auctioneers who actually sell properties has been falling. With regard to sealed bids, I agree with Senator Ross that if an auction is by private tender, the bidders or their representatives should be allowed to attend the opening of the tenders.</P>

However, I am honoured to be a member of the IPAV and wish to declare that interest also.</P>
      <P>A journalist, writing in one of last Sunday's newspapers with regard to this motion, stated auctioneers were up there with politicians and journalists as favourite targets for abuse.</P>

      <P>Entry into the profession of auctioneer or house agent is governed by statute, namely, the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts 1947 to 1973. A whole body of case law governs auctioneers in the conduct of their business. They must, like any other citizen, operate within the law and do. There may be a few rogue auctioneers but not as many as there are such solicitors or members of other professions, as the statistics will prove.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ross and, particularly, Senator O'Toole when they argue for protection for all. If there is a shortfall and if something further needs to be done, nobody will object to it. I certainly do not. If there is a shortfall in trust and confidence, we must overcome it. Other matters such as valuations are not an exact science. While things can go wrong, I suggest this is not deliberate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many problems arise because the public does <Col N="429" />not generally understand the relationship between the auctioneer and vendor and that between the auctioneer and prospective buyer. Auctioneers' contractual obligations are to their employers, the vendors. While they have a duty of care to prospective buyers, auctioneers are engaged on behalf of the vendor, not the buyer. They have a duty of care to the vendor in the first instance and a legal obligation to maximise the price for him or her.</P>
    <P>The motion &ndash; perhaps unwittingly, as I do not think this was the intention of Senators Ross and O'Toole &ndash; suggests that all auctioneers are dishonest and untrustworthy, or that may have been the impression given. However, it is a generalisation contradicted by the record of the auctioneering profession in the protection of clients' funds. This contrasts markedly with the record of numerous other professions, although I will not go down that road.</P>
    <P>It is entirely the vendor's privilege to decide whether, to whom and for how much he or she should his or her property. Rights regarding property are guaranteed by the Constitution. The auctioneering bodies, the IAVI and the IAPV, have for many years been seeking increased regulatory control over the issuing of licences, the raising of minimum educational qualifications and the minimum number of years' experience before the issuance of an auctioneering licence to an individual, an issue the Government may wish to address.</P>
    <P>As Senator Scanlon said, the IAVI and the IAPV have codes of practice, ethics and standards in place which already require disclosure of the personal interests of their members. Rule 13 of the IAVI &ndash; I am not sure which rule it is in regard to the IAPV &ndash; states one must declare one's interests when one is dealing in property on one's own behalf.</P>
    <P>The motion is perhaps confusing because no attempt is made to distinguish between an auctioneer and a house agent, who can have different functions legally. There is a body of case law extant to show that their functions can be distinct at times.</P>
    <P>There also seems to be a difference in regard to guide and reserve prices. Senator O'Toole referred to this and is not confused about it in any way. A guide price is simply the opinion of an auctioneer or auctioneering company as to what it is reasonable to assume a property may fetch on the open market. The reserve price is the price below which the vendor will not sell. It is an absolute right to set this reserve, irrespective of what the auctioneer may guide. This should be remembered. Auctioneers are subject to instructions like solicitors and other professions, and may often be over-ruled. I am sure Senator Scanlon has experienced this, as I have.</P>
    <P>It is a condition of the codes of conduct of both the IAVI and the IAPV that members act properly and in compliance with the law in all instances. While both bodies would not be opposed to a requirement that every property <Col N="430" />should have a guide price, it will not necessarily sell at that price and there could be pitfalls if it becomes mandatory. The bodies would be opposed to legislation which compelled vendors to sell once a bid above the guide price had been received. If this became law, vendors would, in effect, choose guide prices which far exceeded any conceivable price to ensure they could not undersell. The effect of this on property prices would unquestionably be inflationary. It would also significantly reduce the number of properties coming on the market. Furthermore, such a practice would tend to mitigate against auctions, the most transparent form of sale. Transparency is, apparently, what the Senators are seeking, to which I have no objection. I could tell the House some interesting stories, which I told to Senators O'Toole and Ross yesterday, about what can occur.</P>
    <P>It would be common and best practice for agents to record bids received and from whom. This does happen. While this information will be protected by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, it could be accessed in the future by a third party provided consent can be obtained under the Act. Both auctioneering bodies would have no difficulty in principle with such a proposal.</P>
    <P>Regarding complaints, to which the motion refers, they should be referred to the appropriate body and then investigated. The IAVI and the IAPV have a proud record of investigation of complaints and would welcome referral of any complaints any of their members would have. I encourage Senators, if they have any complaints, to bring them to the professional body, of which the auctioneer in question is a member. I guarantee, as did the president of one of the bodies yesterday, that such complaints would be investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the motion. I am delighted that it gave me food for thought. I did not prepare a written contribution to the debate because I wish to speak about my experience in this area. Most auctioneers I know are sincere and do their work magnificently. I have no difficulty with them. However, there is no doubt that there is a perception that some have not performed in recent years to the standard required by the two organisations dealing with the profession.</P>
      <P>I have considered the relevant legislation which dates back to 1947 and was updated by the 1973 Act. It has not been tidied up since then. I welcome the recognition in the amendment that a regular review of the auctioneering industry's regulatory framework is desirable. There is no doubt about that since we only have to look during the years of the Celtic tiger at the large number of housing developments. As a county councillor, I became aware of the practice of the phased release of new developments in order to increase the prices. I felt that was not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Constituents have often told me that an auc<Col N="431" />tioneer would state there would be no development next to the house they were interested in purchasing. That is how it might stand in a development plan at the time, but in the next one there might be changes. The auctioneer is not in the position to claim there will be no such developments. However, because a house is on the market, naturally the auctioneer wants to get a quick sale. It is only in these types of cases that I would question them. In the majority of cases there are no difficulties.</P>
    <P>That is one little example, like that which we see with politicians &ndash; one bad mistake by a politician and we are all bad. One bad mistake gives the impression that auctioneers are not up to standard. I have read the code of ethics of the IAVI and the IPAV and noted they have laid down stringent regulations. I checked the entry requirements for the educational course and it is validated. There are high professional standards built in with their qualifications.</P>
    <P>Another phrase that comes to mind is &ldquo;Dutch auction&rdquo;. An auctioneer informs a potential buyer that there is an offer of &euro;125,000 for a property; if the potential buyer can beat that, the property is his. He returns with a new offer but the auctioneer gives yet another price, such as &euro;140,000. That type of practice erodes trust and confidence in auctioneers.</P>
    <P>Consumers will welcome this discussion, as will those auctioneers who have welcomed the move to adhere to professional standards. Another issue centres around conflicts of interests. When county councillors discuss the development plan &ndash; most declare their interests, but there are some who do not &ndash; there can be a conflict. That is another grey area. The regulations should take into account those kinds of issues when the code of practice is reviewed.</P>
    <P>We are airing the points that have created unease among the public. We endorse the code of ethics and we hope the IAVI and IPAV will address these matters. Most auctioneers do their work well. However, there is gazumping, phased release of developments pushing up prices, and the occasional Dutch auction where people are not sure they are getting the right price. These issues worry me and the public.</P>
    <P>Auctioneers cannot give accurate information as to whether there will be a development in an area. They do not know and should not presume to tell any potential purchaser that such developments will or will not occur. I suggest that potential purchasers should telephone their local councillor or planning department. This would prevent claims by purchasers that they bought their house because the auctioneer assured them there would be no more developments in that area. When there are new developments, it always creates objections. If the industry was more transparent and informed people of the potential for other development, there would be no such problems. These are the areas that the <Col N="432" />auctioneering code of ethics should take into account.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion and the putting in place of a review of the regulatory framework to improve standards within the auctioneering profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It never ceases to amaze me that people who proclaim their commitment to the market economy and the competition model of economic efficiency always seem to be late when it comes to the most important part of competition policy &ndash; that there should be perfect knowledge to both participants in an economic transaction, yet we spend years explaining why this is a bad idea. We have a medical profession which believes it is a bad idea to have tabulated fees people can look at.</P>
      <P>We have a motion and amendment before the House. I prefer the motion. It is astonishing, after the last six years of the most spectacular property boom, that the Government is asking us to set up a review to examine whether there is a need for the introduction of a code of ethics and professional standards in auctioneering.</P>
      <P>I took it for granted that any profession accepted the need for a code of ethics and professional standards. In my profession we have a code of ethics, as we have one in this House. The Minister of State, Deputy Tony O'Malley, as a pharmacist, has a code of ethics. The medical profession has a well developed code of ethics. It might hard to believe, but the Law Society has one. Six years into the most lucrative time in the history of the property industry, the Government is asking me to agree to an examination of whether auctioneers need a code of ethics. Even if they were saints, they still would need a code of ethics.</P>
      <P>The public needs to know by what standards people operate. This is where consumer legislation in the broader sense is so important. Individual consumers by definition do not have perfect information. If the consumers do not have this, then there is no perfect competition. If there is no perfect competition, someone is left with an unfair advantage or disadvantage. Any half decent economist will state that once perfect competition is moved away from, their models do not work. The whole thing becomes skewed and goes in different directions than intended. That is why we need external regulation of all these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a great believer that the more information made public about how people do their business, the more the consumer is empowered. Whether it be engineers, politicians, pharmacists, auctioneers or whatever, the more the public knows, the stronger the position the consumer and the more likely it is that people will operate to decent standards. One hears those anecdotes about people could not get an honest answer as to the size of the second room in an apartment they were buying in Dublin, the response of the auctioneer being if that person did not want it, there were <Col N="433" />dozens of others who did. If we allow market forces to prevent people from getting the rudimentary information to permit them to make so-called rational decisions, we will actually be forcing them into making irrational economic decisions.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to a requirement that, prior to undertaking any auctioneering transaction, auctioneers be required to make a declaration of interest. I look forward to the Minister telling me whether the current position is that they do not do so. I could, for example, become involved in dealing with an auctioneer whose family has an interest in the property he or she is trying to sell me and he or she is not obliged to declare that. In such instances, we are moving away from true competition and a fair market. The only purpose markets serve &ndash; I say this as a long-standing member of the left &ndash; is to make the position of buyers and sellers operate in reasonable equilibrium and distortions such as that to which I refer serve no purpose. We might as well get rid of it entirely.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to sealed bids. I do not know enough about sealed bids but the suggestion in respect of them that is contained in the motion appears perfectly reasonable.</P>
    <P>The motion also calls for a requirement that all properties should have a published guide price. I am astonished that, not just in terms of houses but also the pages of used car advertisements, one does not have to put a price on a second-hand car. I am at a loss to know why, in a consumer-focused market economy, one cannot know in advance the demanded price for something so that one can be in a position to bargain. Why that information can be withheld is beyond me.</P>
    <P>Another requirement mentioned in the motion is that all auctioneers should maintain for inspection, by an approved authority, a record of all bids and bidders. The inspection by an approved authority is only included because most people are not convinced that auctioneers have an honest and verifiable record. Perhaps they are wrong, but we need to develop some way of ensuring, independently, that the process of bidding is fair and that it is not loaded against the consumer in favour of the vendor. That is what this matter is about. It is not about interfering in the sale, it is about ensuring that the sale of property operates according to the conditions that make for a functioning market economy. One of the conditions to which I refer is information.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to an appropriate system to facilitate the investigation of complaints by bidders who believe that they have not been fairly treated. Is it not extraordinary that, after a six-year property boom, there apparently is no appropriate system to facilitate the investigation of complaints? In what world are we living? That is what astonishes me about this matter.</P>
    <P>There is a question I would like somebody who is more closely associated with the auctioneering profession than me to answer. How can an auctioneer lose money? What risk is involved in auc<Col N="434" />tioneering? Auctioneers do not buy property and then sell it; they facilitate transactions. Unless an auctioneer takes options &ndash; which most of them do not have to do &ndash; I do not understand how he or she can lose money. The vendor must pay for all the advertising. There is a guaranteed percentage of the price and, therefore, the auctioneer has a vested interest in manipulating the price to maximise his or her return. That is understandable and it is part of a functioning market economy. It is, however, an astonishing commentary on our unwillingness to allow genuine markets in a range of areas that a motion of this nature is only being discussed at the end of six years during which the auctioneering profession, among others, has cleaned up. It has done so not because of its diligence, efficiency or innovation, but simply because it happened to be in place at the right time. It is not good that people are rewarded just because they happen to be in a particular position, rather than as a result of something they do that merits that reward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join colleagues in welcoming the Minister. There has been much discussion in recent months about affording the House an opportunity to discuss the regulation of the auctioneering business. For that reason, I welcome this debate which can help to clear up some of the misnomers that exist and allow us to examine further the areas that require investigation.</P>
      <P>I agree with some elements of the motion brought forward, but the amendment we propose is a much better way to deal with the issue. There are some elements of what Senators O'Toole and Ross said that I find acceptable. The difficulty &ndash; Senator Coghlan alluded to it earlier &ndash; is that the overall thrust of the motion and the way it is phrased appears to suggest that auctioneers in general are somewhat untrustworthy or dishonest. That is the thrust of the motion, although it may not be the intention of the Senators. As a number of people said, however, the record contradicts it.</P>
      <P>One only need consider the position of some of the other professional bodies. A previous speaker stated that many other professional bodies face a greater level of indictment in terms of the actions of their members. Despite the fact that there are some bad apples in the auctioneering industry, it is widely accepted that there have not been the same difficulties as those which occurred in the banking, stock broking, insurance and many other sectors. I would welcome a debate on those professions because they are highly regulated. In many cases they are covered by defining legislation, but problems consistently arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cornerstone of this debate is about the auctioneer and the customer. As far as I am concerned, the customer is the vendor and he or she engages the auctioneer to carry out the action, namely, the sale of the property, on his or her behalf. However, that point appears to have been missed by some Members on the other side of the House. There is a duty of care on the part of the <Col N="435" />purchaser in terms of the actions of the auctioneer, but the real duty of care must lie with the vendor because he or she engages the auctioneer and, in effect, pays the bill. There is a legal obligation on the auctioneer to maximise the price for his or her customer. That point should be noted. It is everybody's right to ensure that they obtain the maximum price for that which they wish to sell.</P>
    <P>We live in a democracy. People have a constitutional right to own property and they also obviously have a right to sell property to whomever they like and at whatever price they decide. That does not necessarily mean &ndash; this is where some of the confusion arises &ndash; that we have to sell to the highest bidder. There are many reasons somebody might decide not to sell to the highest bidder, one of which might be a concern on the vendor's part about the purchaser's capacity to pay for the property. For example, the perspective purchaser may have to dispose of another asset or property in advance of buying the property in question. If I was the vendor in a situation like that, I would prefer to deal with the person whose bid might have been a little lower but who would be in a position to pay immediately. This would allow me to proceed with whatever I propose to do in terms of the disposal of the property. We cannot lose sight of our constitutional requirement to sell the property for whatever price and to whom we so wish.</P>
    <P>A case could be made for suggesting that the entry level criteria should be strengthened. That issue has been raised by Senator Ross on a number of occasions, but Senator Scanlon was clear in highlighting the fact that auctioneers have to go before the courts. Unlike those in other professions, auctioneers are obliged to go before the courts on an annual basis and, at that stage, objections can be made to their holding licences. That is a strong point and it is worth reiterating.</P>
    <P>Auctioneers are service providers &ndash; in that context, they are no different from anybody else in the service sector &ndash; and their reputation precedes them. It is their reputation that will allow them to continue to trade. There is no doubt that the dodgy elements within the auctioneering trade do not survive because if they do not represent their customers properly or achieve the best price for their properties, they will not continue to attract business. Only those who employ best practice attract business. Some Members on the other side of the House seem to believe that best practice should relate to the purchaser. However, the purchaser is not the central element; it is the vendor who engages the auctioneer and, hopefully, the auctioneer will ensure, on their behalf, that they obtain the best price.</P>
    <P>Given that only the fittest will survive in such circumstances, I am not concerned about over-regulation. This is obviously related to the reputation of auctioneers. As Senator Scanlon pointed out, some 90% are members of professional bodies. The code of ethics operated by both pro<Col N="436" />fessional bodies provides the required level of security and insurance that the highest standards are achieved, as required by Members on the other side.</P>
    <P>Any review must concentrate on the vendor and the protection of his or her rights which are more important in this context than the rights of the purchaser. We must ensure the person paying for the service is protected at all times. The level of self-regulation in the auctioneering industry works and we should continue along the lines of self-regulation.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to treat auctioneers in isolation. There have been greater problems in other professions. Any review that may be established would need to examine all professional bodies. Perhaps a committee of the Oireachtas would be a suitable forum for addressing codes of practice and ethics applied by all professional bodies.</P>
    <P>Recently I read an article by Senator Ross in one of the Sunday newspapers which addressed the issue of stockbroking firms, an area with which the Senator, who comes from a stockbroking background, will be familiar. In it he questioned the independence of stockbroking companies, particularly in the Irish market, because in many cases stockbrokers advising clients to purchase or continue to purchase certain stock also worked for large firms. The Senator made the valid point that stockbrokers rarely advised clients to sell stock in particular companies and questioned whether one could give credence to any information emerging from such companies. There are some parallels here which need to be examined.</P>
    <P>The Enron scandal which occurred about two years ago was largely brought about because certain companies have consultancy and audit functions. In effect, two departments within a large consultancy firm organised trade-offs to protect a company in which they both had a fundamental interest. Nobody is suggesting this is also happening in the auctioneering industry. In fact, the contrary argument is made, namely, that auctioneers concentrate on the person who owns the property, which can only be good given that this is the person they are paid to represent. It is always open to someone who wishes to purchase a property to engage an auctioneer to facilitate his or interests. In such circumstances, the auctioneer will act in the best interests of the person who has engaged them, that is, the purchaser.</P>
    <P>As I stated, some elements of the motion are acceptable. The proposed requirement that auctioneers make a declaration of interest before each transaction, while welcome, is already part of the code of the two professional bodies. One might as well have another auction if one gets into the level of detail contained in the proposed requirement on the opening of sealed bids. If those who have made sealed bids are seated around a table when the bids are opened, the arguments that would follow would result in another auction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental element in respect of the proposal is that it would regulate matters beyond the necessity to protect the rights of the person selling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will have an opportunity to respond in due course. He correctly pointed out that involving a third party, such as a peace commissioner or commissioner of oaths, to ensure the process was handled correctly was probably a better approach. As the majority of sealed bids are opened in the presence of a solicitor, there is already a level of cover.</P>
      <P>The proposed requirement to publish the guide price is crazy, as is the proposed requirement that no property should be withdrawn in the event that a bid exceeds the guide price. Giving legal force to such a requirement would call into question the constitutional rights of vendors in terms of their ability to determine the price for which they sell their property and the person to whom they sell it. It would also result in the demise of the auction process. Many people would not attend auctions if such a regulation was introduced. We all believe auctions provide a relatively transparent mechanism in the current environment. While they may not be ideal in terms of protecting the purchaser, they offer considerable openness and transparency. I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. It is important I declare my interests. I am an auctioneer and farmer and have extensive experience in the auctioneering business. Auctioneering is a varied and interesting career. The profession has changed dramatically over the past decade. The era when anybody could call himself or herself an auctioneer is long gone. To become an auctioneer nowadays one must have successfully completed a property related course and a period of work experience, even before one can apply to the courts to obtain a licence. As Senator Scanlon stated, the licensing system for auctioneers requires that an application for renewal of one's licence be made each year. When applying to the courts, one must instruct a solicitor to place a public notice in newspapers informing the public of a person or company's intention to acquire a licence. One must also have a security bond and tax clearance certificate and satisfy the court that one has attained the appropriate academic standards to conduct an auctioneering business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" />If a member of the public has an objection to a person or company acquiring a licence on the grounds of incompetence, dishonesty, wrongdoing or for other reasons, he or she has the right to object to the application when it comes before the courts. The general public receives notification of an application well in advance as the notice must appear in a newspaper six weeks before the court date. What other profession is more transparent? </P>
    <P>Like every profession, auctioneering has a few rotten apples who can give the business a bad name. Other Senators have mentioned professions which have acquired a bad name through the actions of a few cowboys. Auctioneering may not be different but 95% of those involved are decent, honest people who take pride in their profession.</P>
    <P>I do not condone practices recently brought to our notice by which some auctioneers deliberately breach codes of ethics and conduct by wilfully underestimating the guide prices of properties advertised for auction or fail to divulge the square footage of properties they are selling or the size of rooms. This trend is wrong and must be condemned. Legislation must be introduced to rectify this problem and make the system more transparent. This is what society demands of professions and the auctioneering profession is no different from others. We already have codes of conduct and ethics.</P>
    <P>Other issues which upset people are the high cost of advertising and commission charges. Such costs should be discussed and agreed before the owner puts the property on the market. Auctioneering is a highly competitive business and, like others, auctioneers will do deals. However, similar to solicitors they will provide in writing the costs of conducting business on behalf of a client.</P>
    <P>There is a notion that auctioneers receive generous discounts from newspapers for advertising. While I am not aware that this practice is widespread, I am aware that some property newspapers tout for business over the telephone and pretend to give generous deals. They then place a second advertisement without the auctioneer's or owner's consent and invoice for same. This is a new practice which should be addressed in any new legislation.</P>
    <P>I support proposals to update the guidelines and put a code of ethics in place for the profession. This is important to protect the public and ensure there is no room for wrongdoing or dishonesty in the profession. It will also protect honest auctioneers who conduct their business with integrity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Bannon for sharing time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully support the motion. I found it difficult to believe we did not already have a code of ethics in place for auctioneers. It is essential we have one. Whether dealing with a vendor or buyer, it is important that auctioneers operate to the highest standards as they are dealing with people <Col N="439" />investing in or selling a property worth a lot of money.</P>
    <P>It is only a few auctioneers who behave in a disgraceful manner. It is particularly disgraceful at this time when so many young people are trying to buy their first property. We hear stories day after day regarding people who, having viewed a house in a new housing estate, particularly in Dublin where prices are extremely high, put down a deposit to secure a house. Some weeks later they may get a telephone call to say their deposit may have to be returned or that a mistake was made and the wrong price was given or the particular house on which they made a deposit was priced differently. One way or another the people concerned find themselves in a situation where they cannot afford to buy the house.</P>
    <P>It is a serious matter that an auctioneer would lead people astray in this manner. Obviously, the builder, in association with the auctioneer, is trying to get the best price. Just a few weeks after accepting a deposit they feel they can get a higher price because of the huge demand. This practice is wrong and unfair. We must put measures in place to ensure it does not happen.</P>
    <P>Another issue with which we must deal concerns auctioneers' advertisements. Their advertising leaves a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy. Sometimes they advertise a house as adjacent to local facilities which do not even exist. The plans may state local schools or shops will be provided in the future. People buy houses without knowing the school or shop may not be provided for a further five years. Auctioneers should be obliged to provide accurate information for those purchasing properties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator. His confidence is touching. The Minister has asked me to thank him and the Independent Senators for raising this important issue and giving me an opportunity to update the House in relation to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure most Senators will agree that, as a nation, we have a keen interest in property ownership. The fact that Ireland enjoys one of the highest home-ownership ratios in the world is no mere accident. We have always had a strong connection with the land and owning our own homes. This has something to do with our history. The desire for property ownership has always burned brightly within us. Anybody who doubts that the flame still burns today, as it did in times past, <Col N="440" />need look no further than at current newspaper supplements, devoted entirely to property related matters, read avidly by thousands every week.</P>
    <P>The developments we see countrywide, in the residential, office, retail and industrial markets have to a large degree been fuelled by our growing economy. Tangible benefits have been achieved on foot of this strong economic background. Mortgage rates have never been lower and economic growth has been excellent. These factors, combined with strong levels of customer confidence and rising incomes, have strengthened consumer demand and created the impetus behind what has been happening in the property market.</P>
    <P>Buying and/or selling houses or land is probably the largest single business transaction for most of us. The institutes representing auctioneers and valuers have sought to ensure such transactions are carried out effectively and efficiently. It is of the utmost importance that consumers are protected in these transactions. To the credit of auctioneers and valuers, they have striven to ensure they are in a position to provide a first rate, professional service for those who call on them. The Minister agrees, however, that important affairs affecting property should be handled using the highest standards of professionalism and competence.</P>
    <P>In so far as legislation is concerned, Senators will be aware that the existing legislation, the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts, 1947 to 1973, provides a regulatory framework for the manner in which auctioneers and house agents must act in the performance of their professional work. Its provisions are wide-ranging and there are specific provisions in regard to how moneys are to be handled on behalf of clients and the fees charged, etc.</P>
    <P>Auctioneers must apply annually to the District Court for a certificate of qualification. It is open to any member of the public to object to the annual renewal of any auctioneers licence if he or she has grounds for so doing. This condition appears to act as a deterrent to malpractice by individual auctioneers.</P>
    <P>The Minister notes that in the recent report by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates &ndash; An Economic Assessment of Recent House Price Developments &ndash; reference is made to the practice of phased releasing of new developments to ratchet up prices, to the return of booking deposits in a small number of well publicised instances and subsequent gazumping of prices and to instances of aggressive staged payments, through which consumers may have paid the majority of the purchase price before completion of the houses being bought.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    <P>It is to be stressed that it is not considered that these other practices [that is, the practices referred to in the report] are widespread, but the impression, and it is no more than that, is that they are increasing, to the detriment of consumers. However, if the market was not in <Col N="441" />disequilibrium in relation to supply, demand and prices in the first instance it would make such practices ineffective.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one has to look at the various players in the housing market and the factors or reasons that lead to the pricing of houses and property, not just the regulation of auctioneers in isolation.</P>
    <P>Most auctioneers, because they are members of the two largest auctioneering bodies, the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute or the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, are obliged by their membership of these bodies to comply with conditions of membership. Both bodies have disciplinary committees which deal with complaints from members of the public in relation to auctioneers or valuers. The Minister understands the auctioneering institutes do expel and fine members, order the return of part or all of the fees charged/or outlay, or impose other penalties where these actions are deemed warranted. He also understands both the IAVI and the IPAV, the two main auctioneering organisations, have adopted a code of conduct for their members.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that neither the Minister nor his Department has received any level of complaints in regard to auctioneering practices or procedures from the public or organisations. However, he accepts that a regular review of the adequacy of regulatory legislation is desirable. He has asked me to inform the House that, in this regard, he intends to arrange for a review of the regulatory framework for the auctioneering industry. This review will include an examination of the need for the introduction of a code of ethics and professional standards for the profession.</P>
    <P>The review of any profession is, however, a matter which requires the utmost care and consideration and other parties which have an obvious interest in the role of the auctioneering profession will need to be involved. Discussions will be needed with the profession and all interested parties to clarify the issues involved. At the same time, the Minister would also be mindful that any reform of the profession should not introduce a level of red tape or bureaucracy for the sake of it. The Minister considers that any regulatory control to be imposed on the profession should improve matters rather than disimprove matters for all concerned. I have noted the points made by Senators during the debate and will bring them to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of the State. I compliment him on his gift of prophecy because he indicated that he has taken note of all the things Senators have said. Some of us have not said much so far, but I am sure what we say will be noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have declared an interest in this matter by stating that they are auctioneers. I am not an auctioneer, but I am part of the &ldquo;descendancy&rdquo;. My grandfather inherited three incumbent farms, which he had to return to operation. He did a <Col N="442" />little bit of everything &ndash; he ran a post office, he engaged in auctioneering and his name was a byword for honesty and good humour. There are plenty of good, decent auctioneers and I have spoken at meetings on their behalf. I have at home a small brass gavel, an auctioneer's hammer, which they presented to me because I made them laugh. However, I accept that there are problems in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comment that the Government will consider introducing further regulation. That is excellent, honest and open and a clear vindication of Senators O'Toole and Ross for tabling this motion. We have received an acknowledgement from the Minister of State. Good contributions were made on the other side of the House, including that of Senator Ormonde who, like me, thinks the majority of auctioneers are decent honourable people. However, she gave some instances of gazumping in the marketplace and of people floating houses at a particular price. In such circumstances, the situation usually becomes similar to that with air fares, where there is suddenly only one return seat to London priced at 99p while all the rest cost £199, plus half an ounce travel allowance. Such things may not happen that often in the auctioneering business. Concern about the fact that they do occur, however, was sufficient to cause the Government to introduce a review, which I welcome.</P>
    <P>Guide prices are a complete nonsense. They are used as bait. I love the supplements on Thursday in <i>The Irish Times </i>and on Wednesday or Friday in the <i>Irish Independent</i> because they cater to my snooping instincts. I am able to look at other people's houses to see what they are like and how much they cost. It is terrific fun. However, sometimes the guide price for magnificent houses is set at next to nothing. We all know it is bait to get the nincompoops in so that there will be a big auction and people will bid. We all know that there have been instances where auctioneers have introduced people in the back of the room to bid a property up. That is a bad practice.</P>
    <P>Let us consider solicitors and the fees they charge. If a person gets a mortgage when he or she is buying a house, an extensive search is done which costs a huge amount of money. That search should be done for all time and it should be stamped on the deeds that they have been investigated by a reputable solicitor. If a person gets one, two or three mortgages from the same mortgage company on the same property after it has been bought, the solicitors will charge on each occasion they are obliged to go through the motions of the same search. That is theft and it should be stopped. I ask the Minister of State to take note of that.</P>
    <P>I looked at the rules of conduct of Irish auctioneers and those of British auctioneers, which are five times as extensive. They cover material in considerable detail. We should look at that as a model while we are investigating the possibility of introducing some form of regulation. I am not impressed by the fact that one must advertise in <Col N="443" />a newspaper &ndash; well, break my heart. They have educational courses, but people do not have to take examinations. How many of us would take examinations if we did not have to do so? I would not volunteer. That is complete nonsense. A person must put a notice in the newspaper and apply to the District Court for a licence. He or she may take an examination if he or she desperately wants to, but he or she does not have to possess any qualifications or training. However, he or she must not be bankrupt.</P>
    <P>In the rules of conduct of the British auctioneers, there is a clear and detailed duty to maintain separate and internal accounts. Rule seven in the British model does not seem to have a parallel in the Irish rules of conduct. It states:</P>
    <P>A member shall not seek business by methods which are oppressive or involve dishonesty, deceit, or misrepresentation. Members shall not use any business term, name or initials which could cause confusion between their own business and that of the Association.</P>
    <P>The note attached to the rule goes on to state that:</P>
    <P>It is considered oppressive to seek business by methods designed to take unfair advantage of the age, condition, infirmity, ignorance or bereavement of a prospective client or by any course of action which amounts to harassment. Members are not permitted to use any cheat or subterfuge to obtain business.</P>
    <P>I am not alleging that any auctioneer in this country would engage in such behaviour. However, when I was 20 years of age I was faced with having to sell the family home. I went to a reputable auctioneering house. The person who was sent out was genteel &ndash; I knew his family &ndash; but it was his first day in the business and he was told he would learn the business on the job. In other words, he was learning at my expense. I still know him and he is still a decent fellow. He did not have any training. I showed that house to the people. I knew what to do and I had to do it, but it was awkward. I was bereaved because my mother had just died and that was the reason we had to flog the house. There was no bid at the auction and there were mistakes in the advertising. I was encouraged and harassed to sell it to someone afterwards who bid a good deal under the market value. I raised the price of the house by refusing to sell it. The person to whom it was sold was a solicitor who did business with that firm. I cannot say that there was anything wrong with that; it may have just been a series of coincidences. However, I was a vulnerable young person and I did not feel that I was protected.</P>
    <P>I have, on the other hand, had extremely good experiences of other auctioneers and their professionalism. Clients should be made clearly aware of the fact that when they put a house up for sale, in many instances the auctioneer will charge a scaled fee, which is quite large. <Col N="444" />However, they will exclude from that advertising costs, photography and other incidentals. That is fair enough as long as the client realises it.</P>
    <P>There are occasions when houses are put on the market by auctioneering firms but when they are not sold. In such instances, the vendor may eventually be approached by someone and they may agree to sell it. One must be careful and question whether the auctioneering firm, which has failed to sell the house, should be entitled to reap the benefit of the vendor's capacity to sell the house on his or her own behalf. I raise a question mark about that because it does happen.</P>
    <P>I compliment my colleagues on tabling this motion. They were right to do so. The Minister of State has indicated they were right because he has taken careful note of what they said and he is taking some degree of action. I do not believe that the intention of my colleagues was to vilify the auctioneering trade. I have suggested that there were some occasions when I had doubts, but they may be unjustified. I have met a great number of thoroughly decent auctioneers. Enough was said by the Government side and by those on this side of the House, including the Independents, for the Minister of State to take this action, which fully justifies the tabling of the motion by the university Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has dealt on many occasions with auctioneers, I have found them to be straight and decent. Perhaps they fooled me at times, but I was unaware of that. The Minister of State said that a regular review of the adequacy of regulatory legislation is desirable. Perhaps that has happened as a result of the motion tabled here this evening. The Minister of State said he intends to arrange a review of the regulatory framework for the auctioneering industry. That will be worthwhile. He also said that the review will include the examination of the need for the introduction of a code of ethics and professional standards for the auctioneering profession. That is a response to the motion and to the amendment.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Scanlon's comments about licensing and the opportunity people have, if they so wish, to complain about an auctioneer if he or she is not carrying out his or her functions in a proper manner. Auctioneers are often blamed in the wrong in cases where property developers, who make substantial profits, fail to complete estates. People tend to point the finger at the auctioneer from whom they bought the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Auctioneers also conduct business at livestock marts. It was often the case when the mart had finished that people said the auctioneer had taken money from their pockets because of the number of people around the sales ring. &ldquo;Who bought that? John Rafter,&rdquo; was a great saying to describe this activity, indicating that the bidder had paid a price as high as the roof of the premises. That was common knowledge, but in general auctioneers have done a good job. I have been involved in a number of property cases involving widows <Col N="445" />and others and they were dealt with fairly by auctioneers. The people involved went back to the auctioneers on many occasions to find out where they stood.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant run on property over the past three or four years. Property sold itself without the need for much advertising. However, prior to that, auctioneers had to work hard to make a sale. The motion is worthwhile as the auctioneering business has become professional. Given the volume of property that has been sold in recent times, many auctioneers have made a great deal of money. They have worked hard and the profession employs a significant number of people.</P>
    <P>I have always found auctioneers to be upright and straight. I accept a number of the points sincerely made about certain auctioneers who did not conduct their business properly. Unfortunately, the same can be said about every profession. Even in our profession, the finger has been pointed at certain public representatives but every one of us has been tarred with the same brush.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments, which represent a move in the right direction. Perhaps it is the first step and I look forward to improvements in this sector. I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate. Senator Scanlon referred to the need for competition and I welcome his agreement regarding the presence of a disinterested individual at the opening of bids. I wrote the motion and reread it to ensure it did not give the impression that auctioneers were dishonest or otherwise. I made changes to the wording to achieve that and I am sorry that Senators Coghlan and Dooley got the wrong impression. My intention was to generate debate and get people together to investigate and develop codes of practice and ethics in the same way as when I represented teachers.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State and Senator Ormonde addressed the question of the release of new house to the market in stages to keep prices up. That is an appalling practice and it is interesting that the Minister of State picked up on that part of the Bacon report. It meant prices were maintained artificially high.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan made the case for a code of ethics. A number of Senators mentioned the leading auctioneering company that refused to supply potential buyers with the dimensions of an apartment it was selling. Another company wanted a member of my family to put down a deposit on an apartment from the plans. The company had the plans but could one imagine supplying plans without including the dimensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Moylan pointed out that many of the auctioneers with whom we deal are above suspicion and it is important that we do not engage in scaremongering. Senator Dooley and others referred to the issue of guide prices, reserve <Col N="446" />prices and sealed bids. I accept sealed bids cannot be used if when they are opened the auction commences again. The property should be sold on the basis of the conditions laid down beforehand or else a public auction should take place. However, the use of sealed bids eliminates phoney bids, which is important.</P>
    <P>A reserve is the price below which a vendor will not sell while a guide price is one which an auctioneer places in an advertisement. I accept Senator Coghlan's point that an auctioneer in various transactions acts as an auctioneer or as an agent. However, for example, an auctioneer and a vendor could agree a property should be sold for not less than &euro;200,000 and the auctioneer might say he or she will not achieve that and there is no point in selling. Alternatively, the auctioneer might say it is worth more than that and a guide price of &euro;250,000 should be put on the property. Once the guide price is established, one should not be able to say one will not sell when the guide price is achieved, otherwise incorrect and unfair advertising has been used.</P>
    <P>Senator Bannon mentioned a code of ethics and I accept that both the auctioneering representative groups and a number of companies have adopted such codes. Senator Norris outlined the dangers of gazumping. He also referred to repeat conveyancing, an issue which I pursued recently at the national agreement talks and which should be pursued through the Competition Authority. Houses have been sold three times in ten years but, in a number of cases, the same conveyancing procedure was followed each time by the same firm of solicitors for the same financial institution at the same cost. That is all wrong and it is pumping up prices.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minster for his contribution and I appreciate the thought he gave this matter following the two conversations we had over the past few days. I welcome a number of his points. I agree with him that this industry must remain competitive, the finger should not be pointed at auctioneers and too much red tape should not be reduced. He accepted the need for a review, which will include an examination of the need for the introduction of a code of ethics and professional standards and said they should be extended outside the auctioneering profession. He stated, &ldquo;Discussions will be needed with the profession and with all the interested parties to clarify the issues.&rdquo; That relates closely to what I have sought.</P>
    <P>I would like the review to include discussions and consultations with people other than auctioneers because that is important. The auctioneering representative groups should bring forward their own code of ethics and there should be statutory regulation to implement it. The disciplinary group would have to include a majority of people who were not auctioneers and auctioneers would not have a difficulty with that. It would draw up the code following consultation. Although its implementation and the judgment on it would include auctioneers, it would also include others. While <Col N="447" />this might be jumping the gun somewhat, that is what I would ultimately like to achieve.</P>

      <P>In no contribution did I hear anything that would go against this. Certainly, those who declared an interest as being auctioneers were very open and welcoming about how the issue might be approached. I would like to do it in this way and be supportive. I will be prepared to accept the amendment if the Minister of State can assure me those carrying out the review will include more than officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They should include the people outlined here, representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, auctioneers and their two bodies, and others. They will produce a report and it will be up to the Minister to decide if it represents the way forward. It should be a very useful exercise, from which auctioneers would have most to gain initially.</P>
      <P>As I said, we are talking about transactions valued at up to &euro;25 billion and probably far more on an annual basis. It is huge money and needs some form of transparency, openness and regulation. I ask the Minister of State to confirm his position on this.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 deal with the increase in audit exemption thresholds, <Col N="448" />which was an important matter we addressed on Second Stage. I put these amendments down to allow Irish companies to avail of audit exemption thresholds in line with those available in other EU member states.</P>
      <P>In order to extend the audit exemption relief as contained in section 32 of the Companies (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1999 to small companies, section 32 needs to be amended to extend the exemption threshold to the size criteria for small companies as specified in section 8(2) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986. The current turnover level is &euro;3.8 million and balance sheet total of &euro;1.9 million. However, under a recent EU decision, the size criteria for small companies have been raised to a turnover level of &euro;7.3 million and a balance sheet total of &euro;3.65 million. All EU member states may exempt from the statutory audit requirements companies with turnovers and balance sheets below these thresholds. There is an argument that to lighten further the regulatory burden on small companies and to allow these businesses to spend more time on creating wealth and less on administration, the threshold should be increased further. We would not be out of line with our nearest competitor, nor should we be. It is widely anticipated that our nearest competitor, the UK, will increase the turnover threshold to £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>Under section 30 of the Companies (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 1999 a company is eligible for exemption from auditing its accounts where its turnover does not exceed &euro;317 million, its balance sheet total does not exceed &euro;1,904,607 and it has fewer than 50 employees. However, there are a number of exemptions under the Schedule to the 1986 Act such as banks, insurance companies and financial services companies including insurance brokers. It is that group I want to touch on.</P>
      <P>The exemption was given to small businesses because the cost is out of proportion to the benefit to such companies. At present insurance brokers find themselves in exactly this position since regulation of insurance brokers was transferred to the Central Bank, and now the IFSRA, the cost of auditing insurance brokers' accounts has doubled. It is now running at an average of &euro;2,500 for insurance brokers with a turnover of under &euro;150,000 and one or two employees.</P>
      <P>Insurance brokers whose turnovers range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;150,000, which are approximately 80% of this sector of small business, will continue to be excluded under section 33 of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1965. Authorised investment firms are required to audit their accounts regardless of the size of turnover and this was carried forward to the Insurance Act 2000, which transferred the regulation of brokers to the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This should be re-examined and I bring it to the Minister of State's attention with a view an amendment to the insurance legislation, which <Col N="449" />will be possible under the Financial Services (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill scheduled for October this year. I contend that insurance brokers are being discriminated against in comparison with other small businesses in relation to the requirement to provide audited accounts.</P>
    <P>The Chair has been very patient with me as I wanted to bring this to the attention of the Minister of State. We are dealing with the audit threshold which is very important, as for all small businesses, as the Minister of State understands. It is not the Minister of State's intention, or anyone else's, to put Ireland at any competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis </i>our neighbours in the North or across the water. I stress that point. I know the Minister of State has this issue in mind and I look forward to his response.</P>
    <P>I was holding the fort there for Senator Quinn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for being late and I thank Senator Coghlan for taking my place.</P>
      <P>My point was that the main job of a director is to make sure the company succeeds by bringing entrepeneurship and good business practice to the company. He must also do the job of policeman and ensure the company does not break the law. However, we are giving directors onerous responsibilities. I was relieved to hear Senator O'Toole's contribution regarding compliance &ndash; he reminded us that the Bill states that the directors of a company shall prepare or cause to be prepared a directors' compliance statement containing the following information concerning the company &ndash; its policies respecting compliance with its relevant obligations. Nobody could object to that.</P>
      <P>The statement is also to contain the internal financial and other procedures for securing compliance with its relevant obligations and nobody could object to that, or to its arrangements for implementing and reviewing the effectiveness of the policies and procedures already referred to. However, then we have the Government amendment: &ldquo;. also acknowledging that the directors are responsible for securing the company's compliance with its relevant obligations .&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is my concern. Would any Member accept a directorship of any company when told he or she is responsible for it? The Government amendment also states:</P>
      <P>(except for instances of non-compliance of a minor or otherwise immaterial nature that may have occurred), the company has complied with its relevant obligations in that financial year .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seem to be doing exactly what Senator Coghlan said &ndash; putting an onus of responsibility on directors. I do not know about other Members but I would not accept a non-executive directorship of any company where it was clear that I would be responsible. That is the Government <Col N="450" />amendment. Perhaps it is moderated elsewhere by another amendment.</P>
    <P>In recent years significant legal steps have been taken to enforce company compliance with the law, notably by the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Further measures such as the compliance statement requirements are excessive. The costs and problems they will cause are out of all proportion to any likely benefit. I have to convince the Minister of State that the compliance statement is over the top.</P>
    <P>I am thinking of my company and the Bill seems to say that as a non-executive director I am to make sure nobody breaks the food safety or environmental regulations. It is not a question of saying we have systems in operation; we do not know all these laws, and nobody could know all of them. We bring in consultants who are experts in environmental law, food safety or work practices.</P>
    <P>The compliance statement is over the top &ndash; it is belt and braces, as Senator Hayes said. I urge the Minister of State to accept Senator Coghlan's amendment, as the Government amendment is so strong that it is impossible for any reasonable individual to accept a non-executive directorship because of his or her responsibilities. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourned remarks were made which were unfortunate and very rude. They seemed to cast a slur on all directors of all companies as being fat cats and motivated by nothing. It would be a pity if the House appeared to endorse those remarks or that the Government, in bringing in this necessary and important Bill, would allow people to be traduced in that way. I hope we can get over that. We do not all approach these things from the same plateau of moral rectitude but we do our best.</P>

      <P>He is not here and I do not want to name names. I would rather the person were here. That is all I want to say.</P>
      <P>This is not about escaping control. It is not about asking people to take on tasks which they cannot, in conscience, necessarily do without doing a lot of others, as Senator Quinn said. The part I find the most onerous is section 43(4)(<i>d</i>)(ii). I can live with section 43(4)(<i>d</i>)(i) which states &ldquo;used all reasonable endeavours&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great difficulty is turning non-executive directors into executive directors. That is not their job. Members said directors should ask questions. Of course, they should but they should ask them at the marco level. The worst that could happen to an organisation is for non-executive directors to micro-manage and get involved in the nuts and bolts of the operation. That would dissipate and <Col N="451" />diffuse responsibility from those who should have it because when one spreads responsibility among a lot of people, one takes the focus off those with responsibility. Senator O'Toole gave the classic definition of the role of directors, that is, to see that systems are in place and adhered to and ensure compliance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at the core of the issue, which is, to decide the role of company directors. It is a much broader discussion than perhaps what is contained in the Bill. Senators Coghlan, Quinn and Maurice Hayes have made this point. While I agree with the general approach they have taken, I wish to raise substantial points.</P>
      <P>Directors must be responsible for compliance. There is no getting away from this. We should park that point and look at the question what needs to be done. Company directors have to ensure those down the line running some aspect of the company are not ripping it off. They have to put in place structures to ensure they are not being ripped off, even though they are only executive directors and not watching goods coming in to see they are weighed properly, looked after and processed. They have to have trust and confidence in the structures in place. It is the same in terms of the law of the land.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made a point about health and safety. While I would not expect the directors of Superquinn or any other food company to know all of the food safety legislation, I consider it a fundamental requirement for those appointed to certain levels to know and ensure the law of the land is complied with. I expect them to be responsible, not the directors, as Senator Maurice Hayes rightly pointed out.</P>
      <P>That brings us to how directors do their jobs. Senator Maurice Hayes highlighted a significant point when he said section 43(4)(<i>d</i>) stated that having made all reasonable endeavours to secure the company's compliance by asking various questions, directors must state that, apart from instances of non-compliance of a minor or otherwise immaterial nature, the company has complied. A number of speakers have said this is frightening as it is written. One could read it in that way. A director could say he or she is writing down that a large company has paid all its taxes and complied with the law of the land but that he or she might be getting it wrong. I would have no problem including the phrase, &ldquo;as far as I can reasonably attest&rdquo;. Perhaps we should include such a phrase which would not change the intent of the paragraph in any way. It is a subject of judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Structures directors have put in place might not be working, an issue Members raised. All directors should have to prove is that they have made all reasonable efforts &ndash; no more than one would expect of a director. That is not to say they should turn stones in every corner of the company but they should put in place structures in order that <Col N="452" />they can satisfy themselves and be assured by company senior or middle management that they are working. A director could then say that, as far as he or she could reasonably attest, the company was compliant. That was all that was ever intended. It was always intended to be a subjective judgment. I would not object to such an approach if it could be done.</P>
    <P>There is a wider issue concerning the role of directors. Accountancy bodies, employers, IBEC and some involved in business have said to me that those who become directors of companies should attend a course for their own protection in order that they would know their responsibilities and duties. That is hugely important and would be welcome. Like Senator Maurice Hayes, I am a director of a number of structures of different types, at least one of which is charitable, and understand the points he made. It is important we look at the issues. As far as I know, it is the policy of the Institute of Directors that some training or education course should be provided for those about to become company directors in order that they will know what their responsibilities are, be reassured it is something they should do, because it is good to have independent directors, and ensure they do not need to be troubled by personal liabilities or exposure as long as they do their job properly.</P>
    <P>The final issue to which I wish to refer, raising the audit threshold, was raised by Senator Coghlan. It is an interesting issue. Listening to the different groups, I did not have a significant difficulty with raising the audit threshold as I indicated on Second Stage. However, since then I have received a ream of material telling me to be careful. It is important I quote my sources, of which I will refer to one which reflects quite a number. I refer to an article written last week, not by a regulator but by the chief executive of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants in the United Kingdom where, as in Ireland, they are talking about raising the threshold to the European level of &euro;4.8 million. She made the point that &ldquo;the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) is equally strong in its view that the audit is not a waste of time and money.&rdquo; She further stated:</P>
    <P>On the surface, raising the small audit threshold may seem a painless, popular way to cut red tape. But there is a genuine chance that a big rise could lead to increased levels of deception and lower standards of compliance, governance and financial management generally. The biggest losers would be stakeholders of affected companies, who would no longer have access to reliable accounts.</P>
    <P>She gave an example to show this was not hearsay or anecdotal. She stated:</P>
    <P>In 2001, ACCA surveyed 1,250 of its practising firms in the UK to determine the incidence of fraud that they had encountered. On aver<Col N="453" />age, these firms had 215 clients, so the report covered 260,000 UK companies. The principal cause of fraud was found to be personal gain by management and it often involved manipulation of records to disguise, suppress or alter transactions. [This is below the level of director and in the interest of the company director.] In these cases, management overrode financial controls to let fraud be effected. In 45 per cent of cases, it was external auditors who detected the fraud.</P>
    <P>A strong argument is being made by accountants who are being quoted widely as saying the threshold should be lifted. While I do not know the answer, I indicated on Second Stage that I thought a substantial argument had been made to raise the audit threshold. I think Senator Coghlan did the same. We need to be careful we are not facilitating those who would wish to be fraudulent. I do not want to make that allegation but we should not be hasty.</P>
    <P>There is a wide variety of areas at which we need to look. The point raised by Senator Maurice Hayes is important. I am not sure that his proposal regarding a person's judgment could be easily phrased. I agree with his point that the majority of directors of large companies, some of whom are my best friends, are not necessarily fat cats out to screw the consumer. It is inappropriate to suggest this &ndash; it was indicated earlier &ndash; and to do so is to misrepresent the focus of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I will try to be helpful and respond to some of the points of Senator O'Toole. If one subjects one's car to an MOT, which is one's responsibility, it does not mean that one will be aware of a blown tail-light bulb while one is driving. I have no difficulty with a requirement that directors should inform themselves of their duties or do a course. Some of the companies with which I have been involved have such a requirement.</P>
      <P>I was chairman of the board of a hospital in Belfast, which was run as a company. I was required to do a course and to assure the Minister that every member of that board had been fully informed and trained in the requirements under the Cadbury rules. That is a reasonable requirement and it may be done through regulation or otherwise, but it is important that people know their responsibilities.</P>

      <P>A very important point was raised by Senator Maurice Hayes on the role of the directors and the distinction between executive and ordinary directors. Consider a family business mainly run by a husband, who does so in an executive capacity. His wife may be involved in a non-executive capacity and may not know what is going on in the company. There would be requirement on her to familiarise herself with the accountancy practices. The majority of people in business do not understand the finan<Col N="454" />cial projections and assessments their accountants make at the end of the year. I have yet to meet business people who understand the accounts, apart from accountants who are running businesses themselves. No matter how much education they got, they would still not understand the complexities of accountancy procedures, company law, etc.</P>
      <P>Executive directors on boards should not be treated as non-executive directors. Senator Maurice Hayes, for example, who brings his expertise to Independent Newspapers, may not know anything about the financial management of the business.</P>

      <P>I have been following this debate with great interest and have been waiting for us to deal with the amendments under discussion. Senator Burke has outlined some of the concerns. I am seriously concerned that the good work that has been done to make this economy competitive is being undone because of over-regulation in the company law area, particularly since the passage of the 2001 Act.</P>
      <P>I do not necessarily agree with the detail of all the amendments that have been tabled and I would like assurance from the Minister of State that there is recognition within Government that small and medium-sized businesses have become over-regulated. The vast majority of the businesses driving the economy are of a small and medium size. Accountants with whom I have spoken are dealing mainly with the types of businesses to which Senator Burke referred, namely, those run by husbands and wives or small businesses.</P>
      <P>The compliance requirements provided for in the Bill do not confine themselves to accountancy and audits but concern such diverse matters as health, safety and other areas that are not traditionally within the remit of company practice. Accountants and those auditing books traditionally had client-accountant relationships &ndash; most accountants deal with clients on an ongoing basis &ndash; and would have accepted in good faith the detail being provided for audit purposes. However, they can no longer have such relationships because, if they are found non-compliant in any way, they will be liable for severe sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if any other Member has stated that we have become over-regulated, but the <Col N="455" />chief executive of Anglo-Irish Bank articulated this view extremely well in the past week.</P>

      <P>I am trying to articulate a concern that has been expressed by accountants, particularly those operating in the small and medium-sized business area. I understand that a review group from the Minister's Department is looking at all the compliance regulations that have arisen as a result of the 2001 Act. This begs the question as to whether these initiatives, which I guess have been brought in for the noblest of purposes to ensure transparency and accountability, may also be knee-jerk reactions to all the bad news emerging from the various tribunals in this city.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Government feels that we need to be seen to be totally corruption-free and clean in the eyes of the international financial community. However, in achieving this, have we thrown the baby out with the bath water? It has been indicated already that accountants have been attending seminars in recent weeks to update themselves on all the new regulations. They are being told that foreign direct-investment companies are now looking at regimes with less regulation, such as those in England and Scotland, where they have more chance of being able to set up without all the red tape and bureaucracy that exists here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" />Will the Minister give some indication as to what the review group is doing? Does it acknowledge that we have become increasingly over-regulated and that we might be throwing the baby out with the bath water? Accountants, in the main, will opt out of doing audits if they find themselves in a position such as that which I have described.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the regulatory impact assessment, regarding which I spoke and received no response, has been ignored in this case, yet the Government declared it would issue a White Paper to ensure that no legislation would be enacted without a regulatory impact assessment. This was pointed out by the OECD in 2001. It must be pointed out to Senator Mooney that he is saying exactly what I am saying. I agree entirely with Senator O'Toole. When I became chairman of An Post, I attended a very good course in the IMI on how a director should behave. There are courses which are very acceptable.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole used moderate words when he spoke about what was expected of directors. Directors are supposed to concern themselves with a company's policies in relation to compliance with its relevant obligations, its internal financial and other procedures for securing compliance with its relevant obligations, its arrangements for implementing and reviewing effectiveness and so on. These are all very well. Immediately after this, in subsection (4) comes the following: &ldquo;acknowledging that they [the directors] are responsible for securing the company's compliance with the relevant obligations&rdquo;. On the next page, in subsection (7), we read: &ldquo;Where the directors of a company to which this section applies fail to prepare a compliance statement as required by subsections (2) and (3) each director to whom the failure is attibutable is guilty of an offence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Any one of us would be mad to take on a non-executive role. Why would anybody do it? It has been pointed out to me what a non-executive director needs to be sure of. The Bill proposes to enlarge the statutory responsibility to every form of law affecting the company materially in respect of its financial statements. In Ireland today this includes law in respect of employment, health and safety, environment, competition, pensions, consumer protection, insurance and intellectual property. There is no way any non-executive director could know those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing one can do is get in an expert consultant for each of those areas. The cost would be outrageous for a company. This will only apply to companies registered in Ireland. It will not apply to their competitors registered outside Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am frightened at the implications of this. I am delighted to hear Senator O'Toole has recognised that the words may be too strong and that they should be tempered. I hope the Minister of State will consider doing this before tomorrow. Subsection (7) states, &ldquo;Where the directors of a company to which this section applies fail to prepare compliance statements each director to whom the failure is attributable is guilty of an offence&rdquo;. Senator O'Toole asked if it is not the director who is responsible, then who is? The company is responsible. It is a corporate body. If each individual non-executive director is made responsible for all of these areas, the directors will be faced with an impossible task. Anyone would be mad to accept a non-executive directorship in the knowledge that he or she could face such a charge.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to reconsider as it is not acceptable policy. While the intention is good and correct, I suggest that he rethink this compliance statement entirely at this stage. If he cannot do so by tomorrow, he should withdraw the Bill before it goes to Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought we had dealt with this before during Private Members' time. I remind the House that professional directors seem to go from boardroom to boardroom and from one insolvency to the next but never resign or apologise to the public. They merely collect their fees. Some of these directors appear to have no shame. The AIB was ripped off to the extent of approximately $670 million in the United States and not one director resigned. I have no sympathy with such directors.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State to stick with this. These directors may not be as available as they have been heretofore. Many have been anxious to serve in as many as ten companies. If one goes through the list of directors of companies which went bankrupt, became insolvent or left debts all over the place, one sees the names of people who never apologised or resigned. Directors must take their responsibilities seriously or not take the jobs. There are plenty of good people prepared to take responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was chairman of the Western Health Board for a year and had to fulfil responsibilities to the best of my abilities. I had to take the position seriously and became almost a non-executive director by attending regularly at the board, whenever I was wanted. There are fine directors. I do not paint them all with the same brush. However, the principle is right. If one accepts responsibility, one must ensure one works with the company. Anyone who does so to the best of <Col N="458" />his or her abilitiy will have no problem in complying with the Bill. If directors have difficulties, they can easily resign. Most of the public are sick and tired of people who have been directors of so many companies and never apologised.</P>
    <P>I have been lobbied by several people in relation to the auditing threshold of &euro;317 million. In Britain, not necessarily a good example, the UK company and law review group, chaired by Ms Margaret Beckett MP, recommended a rise in the small companies audit exemption threshold to £4.8 million, &euro;7.7 million. Mr. Gordon Brown has considered this matter and made it clear in the last budget that the rise in the audit threshold, probably to £4.8 million, was on the way, barring problems during the summer.</P>
    <P>In all those regards, I urge the Minister of State to raise the level by minsterial order rather than setting the level in the legislation which would require amendment in the future. The proposed level is far too low. Most small companies should not have to do such audits if they are to maintain competitiveness with companies in Northern Ireland, Scotland or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This is the aspect of the Bill on which I have received most representations. I have also heard from accountancy companies that they will not accept limited companies but propose to ask clients to stay as individuals. There is so much regulation in relation to company law that many companies would be better off not being limited liability companies. Such companies could not possibly comply with the rules in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will do his best. We will vote for the Bill, whatever he decides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some valid points have been made, particularly by Senators Quinn and Maurice Hayes. Executive directors deal with the nitty gritty, financial management and so on while specialist directors, such as Senator Maurice Hayes, are very worthy people and can give a wider perspective and an overview. Such a non-executive director, despite his or her great value to a company, cannot be held responsible for its day-to-day financial management. We must make some exceptions.</P>
      <P>Senator Paddy Burke, on the other hand, raised the question of smaller companies. In a small family business a husband might be an executive director and his wife, a non-executive director with both equally responsible in law and equally culpable for the actions of the company. From what I hear a non-executive director in such a situation could ask deep and searching questions, sometimes outside office hours. Some questions might be asked on the pillow.</P>

      <Col N="459" />Senator Leyden made some good points on the question of the audit exemption threshold, on which I support him. Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 cover this point. However, I cannot be associated with the good Senator's earlier comments regarding fat cats and golden circles. The law applies equally to everyone.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response on the issue of executive and non-executive directorships and the audit threshold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want the Minister of State to put my mind at rest. I assume these proposals about compliance will apply to Departments, State-sponsored bodies and local authorities. For example, when a person becomes a member of a local authority they will be accepting compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to permit the Minister of State to give a comprehensive reply, I want to refer briefly to what has been alluded to in respect of the exemption limits. While I never disagree with my friend and colleague, Senator Leyden, I ask the Minister of State to consider the European norm &ndash; rather than the UK norm &ndash; in respect of this matter. Why must we always look to the UK regarding matters of this nature? The European Union limits are of the order of almost &euro;7 million, whereas the UK limit is much lower and stands at approximately &euro;4 million. If we are good Europeans, why can we not consider the European Union limit rather than that which applies in the UK?</P>
      <P>I should perhaps have stated on the record &ndash; it is contained in my statement of interests &ndash; that I am a director of a small trading company. It is so small that, as a result of all this over-regulation, I have taken the advice of my accountant to delist it later this year. I am obliged to do so because I cannot possibly comply with the various regulations. There is a real chance that I could be accused of non-compliance. My accountant stated that, whereas heretofore he would have accepted the documentation I would have provided, he will now be obliged, on foot of these proposals and many of the provisions in the 2001 Act, to chase up every piece of paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is below the audit exemption threshold at present, but that is not my point. My point relates to over-regulation and to the emphasis being placed on the compliance nature of the legislation, which is going to create enormous difficulties for those who are trading &ndash; in this case a husband and wife &ndash; and for many <Col N="460" />others. It is also about the impact the existing legislation is having on small accountancy companies. My accountant used to attend seminars that were addressed by other accountants, who spoke about various changes and devolution. These seminars are now addressed by senior barristers. The trend in this area has changed completely.</P>
      <P>As a legislator, I am concerned that if Ireland obtains an image abroad of having gone too far in terms of over-regulation, it will lose its competitive edge to other countries that are not too far away. This will ultimately result in a loss of jobs. I would like some reassurance from the Minister of State that he recognises these danger signals.</P>
      <P>I am not attempting to defend the type of people to whom Senator Leyden referred. None of us is attempting to defend criminal activities or the existence of any golden circle. I am talking about a significant corpus of company activity &ndash; in the small and medium-sized area &ndash; which will be overwhelmed by a raft of paperwork. These companies will become so afraid of getting involved in this area that not only will they leave business, but their accountants will refuse to audit their affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with amendment No. 45. Recommendation 14.1 of the report of the review group on auditing recommended that not only should the director's compliance statement cover obligations under company law and taxation law, it should also cover other relevant statutory or regulatory requirements. In translating this recommendation into law, section 43(1)(<i>c</i>) &ndash; in the definition of relevant obligations &ndash; provides for compliance with any other enactments that provide a legal framework within which the company operates, and that may materially affect its financial statements.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the review group reports leading up to that recommendation, directors are already required to prepare accounts that give a true and fair view and auditors, when undertaking audits, have to have regard to Statement of Auditing Standard No. 120 &ldquo;<i>Consideration of Law and Regulations</i>&rdquo;&ndash; SAS 120 &ndash; which places obligations on auditors to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence about compliance with those laws and regulations that relate to the preparation inclusion or disclosure of specific items in financial statements. The commentary contained in SAS 120 requires that auditors remain alert for instances of actual non-compliance with other law and regulations which might affect the financial statements. In the circumstances, while I have listened to the arguments made by Senator Coghlan and others, I do not consider that they outweigh the other considerations involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" />With regard to amendment No. 46, the purpose is to separate the requirements in section 43(4)(<i>d</i>) into a new subsection (5). The content of the provision, however, remains the same.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 49 makes failure to comply with section 43(4)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), as now restated, an offence, in addition to retaining the offence already provided for, for failure to comply with subsections (2) and (3).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 50 makes it clear that the disapplication of section 158(7) of the principal Act now relates to the new section 43(5) created through amendment No. 46. The net point is that no offence is created for failure to comply with subsection (5).</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 47, tabled by the Opposition, I know that the report of the review group on auditing, in paragraph (14)(3)(iv), suggested that in the event of non-compliance, the directors should indicate that such non-compliance has been reported to the relevant statutory authority. However, in the drafting of this provision we were advised that the current formulation is the appropriate manner in which to approach this matter and will avoid such issues as self-incrimination or otherwise falling foul of the European Convention on Human Rights. In the circumstances, I am unable to accept the amendment because it would impose an obligation on directors to report cases of non-compliance.</P>
    <P>The effect of amendment No. 48 would be to create a different category of exemption from the requirement to prepare a director's compliance statement to that in the current subsection. Essentially, a small private company with a turnover not exceeding &euro;3.8 million would be exempt, as compared with the turnover threshold of &euro;317,000 under the existing exemption. While the audit review group recommended that the compliance statement should be signed by the directors of all companies, regardless of their size, in subsequent deliberations on the matter, and having regard to the fact that new section 205F requires the auditor to review the directors' compliance statement, we decided to exempt directors of that category of company eligible for exemption from audit from the need to prepare a compliance statement.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 53 appears to suggest the substitution of a different balance sheet figure for section 32(3)(<i>a</i>)(iii) and I presume that the Senator's amendment should have referred to the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 and not the 1986 Act. That figure is already included, so no change would arise.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 52, however, would increase the turnover threshold for audit exemption from &euro;317,000 to &euro;3.8 million. In essence, therefore, it would achieve the same result as amendment No. 48. Since Second Stage, I have been examining the question of the appropriate turnover threshold for audit exemption and, pending com<Col N="462" />pletion of this exercise, I am unwilling to agree to the substantive change contained in Senator Coghlan's amendment No. 52.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to link the exemption threshold from the compliance statement to the definition of a small company, as proposed in Senator Coghlan's amendment No. 48. I will continue to reflect on the points made and I may make further amendments in the Dáil. The Bill if amended in that House will have to be returned to this House for final consideration. In all of the circumstances, I am not prepared to accept the Senator's amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes raised a question about exempting charities from the provisions relating to compliance statements, etc. Charity law is being looked at by another Department and we will wait until it concludes its deliberations before proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the situation regarding executive and non-executive directors. The company law review group considered that issue. I do not recall the outcome of its deliberations but I will contact it and ask it to review the situation in light of the Senator's comments.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn asked whether this legislation would apply to Departments, health boards and local authorities. It will not because company law applies to limited companies, not State and semi-State bodies.</P>

One does a test to see whether financial and other controls are in place and working. I would not expect directors, executive or non-executive, to act as auditors or as management, although I know that in family owned companies, directors may work from the top to the bottom of the business and know everything about it.</P>
      <P>Senators have raised many interesting questions which will give my officials and me much food for thought between now and the time the Bill is brought to the Dáil. Questions have been raised to which we must give consideration. Members can be assured that will be case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the section. While I will not go over the issues again as we have covered this in great detail, I am disappointed. We have had very good Second Stage and Committee Stage debates but, as far as I can see, not one point has been taken. I am not sure of the point of having a Seanad if the Government simply listens to us and then brings the Bill to the Dáil. We might as well be clear on this. The Minister of State has said half a dozen times today that the changes will be made in the Dáil. I am not sure this is the purpose of the Seanad. Most Ministers come to the Seanad, listen and say they can take a particular point. I particularly refer to Senator <Col N="466" />O'Toole who made the point minutes ago that he felt that if this was presenting a problem, words could be introduced to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I oppose the section because the main purpose of a board member is to make sure the health of a company is such that it will succeed, survive and thrive. The Bill seeks to make their main purpose that of policemen and detectives. I am concerned that the compliance statement states they are guilty of an offence individually, although I understand a company might be guilty of an offence as a corporate body.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked: if the directors are not guilty, who is? The answer is that the company is guilty, although it may well be that its executives are found guilty of something. However, to expect that non-executive directors will accept non-executive directorships of companies when they could be guilty of an offence if it turns out that they have not been able to comply with everything in, for example, the area of food safety, the environment or otherwise, there will not be good and competent non-executive directors. If there are, it will be necessary to pay them a lot of money to insure them against anything going wrong.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State must think this through again and I am sorry he has not done so today. I get the impression from what he said several times that he is not planning to take amendments on Report Stage. That is no compliment to the Seanad after such a good debate on Second Stage and today. I hope he will reconsider between now and tomorrow. While there are certainly some amendments which will benefit from consideration over the summer before the Bill reaches the Dáil, I would be disappointed if some of the points made today were not considered in time for Report Stage tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that company law is a complex issue and do not expect that the Minister of State will cover everything here. However, I would like to be reassured. I was making a general point which had been expressed to me by those in the accountancy profession dealing with small and medium-sized businesses. The Minister of State should give some assurance that he is aware of these concerns.</P>
      <P>I asked about an internal departmental review group which, I understand, has been set up within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to consider the implications of the 2001 Act as it relates to the increasing corpus of legislation drawn up over the last couple of years and as it affects and impacts on, as Senator Quinn so eloquently put it, the efficient operation of companies. I would like the Minister of State to give some indication on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister of State have any comment to make on what seems to be a growing body of opinion among those in corporate Ireland and the accountancy profession that there may be an <Col N="467" />inference, if nothing stronger, that the increasing regulatory regime in recent years could adversely impact on our competitiveness in terms of attracting overseas industries, which, considering the current economic environment, is the last thing the Minister of State or any of us involved in representative politics would wish to happen because, ultimately, it impacts on jobs? It was in that spirit that I made my comments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's commitment that he will define an increase in the audit exemption limits. I ask him in that regard, when he brings forward specific proposals, to look beyond the UK model to the European Union model which has a higher limit. I see no reason it should not be considered. While the Minister of State has not indicated which model he is considering, from what is inferred we might be taking the UK model as a given whereas I hope there would be a wider view.</P>
    <P>I would be grateful if the Minister of State could add anything to the comments made or my specific questions. If he feels, in the light of his response, that he has nothing further to add, I fully understand. I have no wish to put him under any pressure in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I said earlier and will say again for the benefit of Senator Mooney that the chief executive of the second largest group of accountants in the United Kingdom is opposed to the raising of the threshold. While I have some sympathy for the raising of the threshold, it is accountants who are most strenuously opposed to it. I receive strong representations that it is time we made limited liability the privilege that it is, that it is worth something and important. In that sense, it has been forgotten. It was bequeathed by society to companies on the basis that we had trust and confidence in them to manage their own affairs.</P>
      <P>I read out the story from the accountancy magazine about the auditor who found that there was no fire safety door on a company's premises which could be deemed a criminal offence. This kind of scare story is a two-edged sword and could take off. There are many who would like this kind of pressure being brought to bear on companies. I am certainly not one and know of no one on the interim board of the IASA who supports that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State read out recommendation 14(g) of the audit review group which specifically stated the compliance statement should go beyond the area of tax and company law. Why was that? I was one of those who started off with the view that it should apply only to tax and company law. Many of the representations I have received on this issue ask if this means directors can sign off as being compliant, despite the fact that they may be throwing illegal waste in the wrong dumps, or that there could be <Col N="468" />a company collecting waste and not putting it into legal dumps, or they could have workers surrounded by asbestos and still knowingly making a turnover. I have received example after example of such scenarios.</P>
    <P>I gave an example earlier of a situation where it does not materially affect the company. The words &ldquo;materially affect&rdquo; were inserted to ensure directors would be protected. If a company breaks the law by insisting, for instance, on appointing a man rather than a woman to a position, it is in clear breach of equality legislation but as it does not materially affect the balance sheet, there is no requirement to disclose this. On the other hand, it could break customs regulations, for instance, by bringing materials over the Border, for which it is not paying excise duty and developing an entire business. I have received representations demanding that it should be a requirement of companies.</P>
    <P>The whole approach to this matter should be sensible. The Minister of State must reassure us on this point. Whatever reassurances we have to receive, we must make it clear we are not creating work for consultants. We must ensure we are not saying that in order for an auditor to complete a company set of accounts, he or she has to start employing consultants. That must not be the case. The legislation states it must be on the basis of the information that comes to the auditor during the course of the audit or during the course of non-audit work conducted for the company by the audit company. In other words, we are talking about information they come by in the course of their work generally. That is how the issue must be resolved</P>
    <P>I raised a point in response to Senators Quinn and Maurice Hayes on a form of words. What is intended under subsection (4)(<i>d</i>)(ii) is that people make a reasonable judgment. However, this can be subjective for that very reason. It was never intended to be objective in the sense that people would have to go and check themselves that there was this whole list of legislation. That is not the case. Those peddling this view are the lawyers who are speaking to the accountants. Senator Mooney is right about this. They are the ones running training courses, charging large fees, for accountants. What they are saying is accountants have to do all these ridiculous things. That is not the case and will not happen. It is not the case that one begins with a raft of legislation and then go through to decide where it could apply to a company. No, we will begin with the company accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They were. I know the people who told them. The ones who told them had no connection with the IASA, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or any of those who worked on this legislation. They are <Col N="469" />the ones who make their living out of creating a market by bringing to them people worried about this issue and establishing courses to meet their concerns. We have to reassure people that that is not what we are intending to introduce. It is to marry the company books with the term &ldquo;materially affect&rdquo;. That is the only part of the legislation at which we have to look. We will have to indicate how that will happen.</P>
      <P>In order to address the point raised, I hope the Minister of State will take on board under subsection (4)(<i>d</i>)(ii) a phrase that would make it clear what was intended in so far as a person could reasonably attest or state or give a reasonable assurance. It is all about reasonableness and making a judgment on that basis. We should not move along on the basis of scaring people.</P>
      <P>We have put much time into legislation covering areas such as the environment, equality and work. I find it impossible to argue against someone who asks me, as a legislator, if I am asking them to be supportive of those signing off on a compliance statement, even though they might be aware that they are breaking the law passed by these Houses. We need to approach the issue in a reasonable fashion.</P>
      <P>I agreed with some of the concerns raised by Senators, including Senator Quinn. The Minister of State must reassure them that the issue of mountainous responsibilities on directors will not be the outcome of this legislation, that instead it is an articulation of what is contained in previous company legislation, that directors are responsible and the accounts are proper. It must deal closely with those directors who claimed they did not know during the inquiries of the last ten years, a matter about which we have spoken in the House. As politicians, we were held responsible for the fact that that owner of Dunnes Stores had made contributions that could not be found through a company audit because things did not have to be done in the way we asked them to be done. The question was raised of what was happening to ensure the same carry-on was not taking place in other companies. The answer was that there was nothing happening. The Committee of Public Accounts, therefore, directed both Houses to put something in place to ensure it did not happen again. Having said that, legislation cannot be over-bureaucratic.</P>
      <P>I read about the decision taken last night by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington to bring forward stringent regulations to make it a criminal offence and to ensure auditors did sign off on the compliance statement of a company.</P>

      <P>I will go through the regulation but I assure the House that we have looked at what I believe is called the blue book of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the raft of regulation emerging in other countries is far more intensive than what is coming through here. That is the reality.</P>
      <P>We should remember that after a period of a few years there will not be a fund manager, a pension manager or anybody in the financial area, and I say this without fear of contradiction, who will invest one cent of investors' money in any economy which is not honestly and transparently above corruption.</P>
      <P>Every year <i>The Economist</i> magazine publishes a corruption league. Fortunately, the only people who pick it up in Ireland are the tabloids but we are not held in high regard in that respect. That is becoming a huge problem. Senior people in the business world are concerned about it and they also want this area cleaned up. In fairness, the Senators who have taken different views here all agree on that point. It is about getting the balance right and we cannot do much better than what is here, taking on board a number of the points that have been made.</P>

It appears to be a contradiction, if the Senator does not mind my saying so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney asked me a number of questions. I can tell the Senator that I have had many discussions with former colleagues of mine in the auditing and accounting profession. I cannot say I got a common view but some of them want to get rid of the practice of auditing while others want to keep it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the compliance statement, the small company limits could be brought in which <Col N="471" />would be distinct from audit exemption limits. I have taken notes and I continue to get representations from various accountancy firms but I have not made final decisions on many aspects.</P>
    <P>I found today's debate, and the Second Stage debate, very informative. I would say to Senator Quinn that it has not been a waste of time. Many of the points he made deserve and will be given serious consideration. Senator Quinn has an experienced business background at all levels and those of us on this side of the House would be foolish not to take note of his words of wisdom. I assure the Senator that I will consider the points he made in the debate.</P>
    <P>With regard to the audit exemptions, as far as I am aware the position is that if we raised the audit exemption to &euro;1.5 million, it would take up to 80% of limited companies out of the audit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator O'Toole asked earlier if it is appropriate that people should have a privilege of limited liability. That is the question that must be considered when deciding whether to extend the audit exemption limit.</P>
      <P>Confidence is vitally important to the continuing growth of the economy. If people did not have confidence in accounts and information being presented, it would have a more adverse effect on the growth of the economy than regulation.</P>
      <P>The kernel of the first report of the company law review group was simplification. Even though new rules and regulations have been brought in, from my personal experience the information being provided now to people is far better than that provided 20 years ago when there was less regulation and compliance. If we do not have regulation and compliance, there will not be confidence in this area and the economy will suffer.</P>
      <P>As Senator O'Toole outlined, we must get across the message in terms of what is contained in the Bill because there has not been exact reporting in that regard in some newspaper articles over the past few weeks. The Bill is not perfect but I reiterate that much of what was said here today will help us to produce a better Bill than that first published.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister sincerely for what is an important intervention. The key words he used were confidence in the economy. I am also very grateful to Senator O'Toole and I fully appreciate, despite my earlier remarks, the expertise he brought to bear on the debate because of his involvement with the audit review group. The fact that he conveyed to the Minister many of the concerns that have been expressed is also important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously this is a question of education and clarification as much as anything else because the message has somehow got mixed up along the way. My main concern as a legislator, which I <Col N="472" />believe is shared by all of us, the Minister and Members alike, is that nothing introduced here, particularly in a difficult economic period, should inhibit in any way the free flow of inward investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's remarks are important and he should continue to reiterate them. I suggest that he take that proactive approach into the wider public domain. I am sure he will have many opportunities to do that in the other House also. The debate on these serious issues is important and I am very grateful to the Minister for his response.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State listened with attention to our contributions and indicated that he would consider the points we made. He mentioned the Lower House on half a dozen occasions during the debate. If his intention is not to accept any amendments on Report Stage <Col N="474" />tomorrow, it would be much better to wait until he has considered the contributions made in the House during the Second Stage and Committee Stage debates, both of which were excellent. He listened carefully and responded to our amendments. It is my intention to table amendments and to give the Minister of State an opportunity to consider them. It is unlikely that he will have time, given the late hour, to consider them in sufficient detail to be in a position to respond to them by tomorrow. A number of other Senators will do the same.</P>
      <P>I urge the House to reconsider the proposal to take Report Stage tomorrow. Perhaps this can be decided on the Order of Business. As the House will sit for at least another month, the Minister of State will have ample time to consider the matter and return to the House before the recess.

      <P>While I understand the Minister of State's point, the purpose of the Seanad is to provide Senators with an opportunity to hold Second Stage and Committee Stage debates and to give the relevant Minister sufficient time to consider the points made during the debates before taking Report Stage. If the Minister of State is indicating that he will not have time to give much attention to the contributions of Senators on Committee Stage, the House will sit tomorrow for no reason other than to pass Government amendments. If this proves to be the case and the Minister of State will return to the Seanad only after the Dáil has made amendments, the House will not receive the attention or respect it deserves. The Minister of State should delay Report Stage and return to the House when he has had time to consider our amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had an excellent and worthwhile debate. I assume at least a token amendment will be accepted. The Minister of State did not accept any amendments on Committee Stage and I have the impression he will not accept any amendments tomorrow because he will not have time to consider them beforehand. This does not show the esteem the Seanad deserves &ndash; perhaps Senators do not deserve it. I call for Report Stage to be taken at a later date when the Minister of <Col N="475" />State will have had time to consider our amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, here again. We are going over old ground which I have gone over with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance since the last time Deputy O'Malley was here.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not remember, but Mary Tudor was described as having had &ldquo;Calais&rdquo; on her heart when she died. I am beginning to think that I will have &ldquo;Central Mental Hospital&rdquo; inscribed on mine because of the situation there which I consider serious. This Minister of State has at least visited the hospital to see the dreadful conditions there, whereas many of the Ministers have not. I have repeatedly called for the attention of the Seanad and of the Ministers for Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be brought to the appalling conditions obtaining in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
      <P>Vulnerable mentally ill people, some of whom have hallucinations, delusions or serious depression, reside in that hospital. They all have serious forms of mental illness. Some are there because they committed crimes but a number are there because they had to be committed before they did something that would cause grievous injury to themselves or other members of the public.</P>
      <P>The Central Mental Hospital is a truly dreadful institution. I cannot praise its staff enough but at least they can go home in the evenings. However, patients incarcerated there cannot. The hospital is supposed to be the forensic psychiatry flagship in Ireland. The patients are incarcerated in what I, and most people, would consider a non-therapeutic environment. We must remember that these people are considered to be ill. We are supposed to be trying to treat them so that their medical condition improves. I am encouraged that the Minister of State's professional background gives him a good insight into psychiatric illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="478" />Most of the patients in the hospital are housed in a building dating from 1850. It has changed little since then apart from a bit of paint every now and then. The whole area is not hopeless because some new residential units, and a residential hostel from which some patients are able to leave and work outside the institution, have been built. About 40% of the patients have been there for over five years and there is little hope for some of them of ever leaving it. I loathe using the word moral, but we have a moral obligation to make the lives of these people some way tolerable for the rest of their time in this institution.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has seen the conditions. He has seen where patients have no in-cell sanitation and sleep on a sort of concrete base. They have to slop-out and defecate and urinate in plastic buckets from 8 p.m. when they are locked in to 8 a.m. when they are let out. As a professional with the knowledge of what happens with psychiatric patients, the Minister of State knows, as I do, that this is not right.</P>
    <P>I do not put the blame on him or the Government because this has been going on for decades. The reports of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals over the past 30 years contain repeated indications that the situation in the Central Mental Hospital is one of the worst. It is so appalling that it could not be described as a therapeutic environment.</P>
    <P>The situation is bound to get worse because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said he will abolish padded cells for psychiatric patients in the prison service. Where does he propose to send these people? If I were in a padded cell in Mountjoy, Wheatfield or Clover Hill I would ask to stay there rather than be moved to a cell in the Central Mental Hospital. A person would have a better chance of being in a therapeutic regimen in the prison service because the staff in the hospital are fighting an impossible situation.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill, in which it is suggested that those who have committed crimes who are psychiatrically ill will not be sent to prison but sent to a psychiatric hospital, is also before the House. The hospital in question must be the Central Mental Hospital because there is no other forensic psychiatric facility in the country. The Inspector of Mental Hospitals has described the dreadful situation and one cannot but agree with everything he has said.</P>
    <P>On &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; recently I spoke to the mother of a young man currently in the Central Mental Hospital. Every time I speak on the issue I get the most distressing calls from relatives of those incarcerated there. The most recent call described the terrible situation of a man whose sister had become institutionalised after many years in the hospital. She had ended up in the Central Mental Hospital at the age of 23 and after several attempts she succeeded in committing suicide. He wanted to know why this sort of thing <Col N="479" />happened. Sadly this is not the only case of this kind.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I tried to get funds from the sale of State property by the Office of Public Works put aside towards the building of a new Central Mental Hospital. The figure of &euro;34 million was the last figure I was quoted for this, although it is probably more now because building costs rise daily. However, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, informed me that the Office of Public Works was not involved in building hospitals.</P>
    <P>I then had the inspiration that funding might be provided by the sale of property owned by the Department of Health and Children. For example, a large amount of St. Brendan's Hospital has been sold off. Other psychiatric institutions may also be sold off. Nothing could be more important than getting funds together for a new Central Mental Hospital. For years the Inspector of Mental Hospitals has been urging the making of a decision on replacing old buildings.</P>
    <P>I realise there is yet another review going on about what should happen in Dundrum. I will put my fingers in my ears if the Minister of State again informs me of the position in that regard. Sometimes I think we believe that something has been done when we receive a report or carry out a review. These things can be done at the same time as those I have suggested. I want the Minister of State to carry out an audit of the property of the Department of Health and Children to ascertain what could be sold off. The money could then be put it into a special fund to build a proper unit in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Henry for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Central Mental Hospital admits patients from the criminal justice system and also from the psychiatric services under the provisions of the Mental Treatment Act 1945. In addition to in-patient care, the hospital provides a consultative assessment service for the Irish Prisons Service and for hospitals throughout the country. I am informed that the Central Mental Hospital admits approximately 150 patients per year, the majority of whom come from the prison system.</P>
      <P>In addition to in-patient services based at the Central Mental Hospital, consultant-led services and out-patient clinics are provided for the Dublin prisons. Additional forensic consultant psychiatric posts have been approved in recent years with a view to extending in-reach services within the prisons in order that only those with severe mental illness and in need of appropriate hospital care will be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital. Providing the in-reach services for prisons should facilitate patient access to services of a quality equivalent to local psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" />In December 2000, the East Coast Area Health Board, in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children, established a group to advise on proposals for the future of the Central Mental Hospital. The group took into account national and regional services provided by the hospital, linkages and community psychiatric services, the criminal justice system, new mental health legislation, the training role of the Central Mental Hospital for medical, nursing and paramedical staff and future accommodation and resource requirements. It concluded its work last year and its report was submitted to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and to the Department of Health and Children. The report included plans to modernise, refurbish and extent the existing building at the Central Mental Hospital and to provide a new residence on the campus. Overall capacity is projected to increase from 90 to 120. These plans will be subject to the approval of the Department of Health and Children and to the necessary capital funding being available.</P>
    <P>To progress the redevelopment of the hospital as quickly as possible, the Minister for Health and Children has established a project team. This consists of representatives from the Department of Health and Children, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the East Coast Area Board, the Irish Prisons Service and a representative of health board chief executive officers. As part of its work the team is examining all financing options for the overall project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in despair. The Minister of State said that these &ldquo;plans will be subject to the approval of the Department of Health and Children and to the necessary capital funding being available.&rdquo; They will not; they will be subject to the Department of Finance. We must start a fund which will be specifically allocated to the hospital because we repeatedly hear from the Minister for Finance that he does not have a bob. If we do not do something about it, we will not get anywhere. Why do we not start a fund for the Central Mental Hospital? I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the position.</P>
      <P>On the previous occasion on which we debated this issue, Senator Ryan said that the Government would not get any praise if it gave money to the Central Mental Hospital and it would not get any blame if it did not. That is the truth. We must do something and leave the Minister for Finance out on a limb. I thank the Minister of State for his reply, but he is as impotent as me in respect of this matter. We must start a fund. Perhaps we could start a charity.</P>

      <P>The failure of the Minister for Defence and his Department to release the necessary funding for the refurbishment of the military barracks at Castlebar, County Mayo, has caused major disappointment among the military personnel there, particularly those committed 680 members of the Reserve Defence Force of the 18th Battalion and Companies A, B, C and D and the 5th Motor Battalion. They are disappointed that their loyalty, service and commitment is being disregarded. They are dismayed that because of a failure to release the necessary funding to carry out the required electrical work at the barracks, the annual summer training camp cannot now take place. Five one week camps and one camp for non-commissioned officers will be moved out of Castlebar to other centres such as Mullingar.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the 18th Battalion is one of the finest in the country. It has acquitted itself well and proudly. Its members' FCA experience, and the fact they wear the FCA uniform, has provided the appetite for hundreds of them to apply for membership of the regular Army. I remind the House and the Minister that Private Billy Kedian, who was from my county and town, was the last member of the Irish Army to give his life on active duty in the Lebanon. The Minister attended his funeral in Ballyhaunis. His appetite to become a member of the Permanent Defence Force was whetted and nurtured by his service in the FCA.</P>
      <P>The Mayo members of the Reserve Defence Force feel strongly that they are getting the thin edge of the wedge. Not only will the annual summer camp not take place in Mayo this year, but the 25th Galway Battalion and the 18th Mayo Battalion will be amalgamated, with an overall reduction in members from its current complement of 1,824 to 1,370. Some 310 of that reduction will take place at the expense of the 18th Mayo Battalion, thereby inflicting a double blow. I do not care about the financial constraints; this treatment is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Defence to inspect and respect the contribution of the 18th Battalion. I want him to outline in his reply the estimated cost of the necessary refurbishment at Castlebar. I want him to issue an order to his Department to immediately release the funding to enable the necessary work to start immediately. Castlebar should be properly refurbished and become the headquarters of the Reserve Defence Force in the west instead of what seems to be a calculated decision to take it out of commission completely.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Higgins for sharing time and for clearly outlining the case at issue here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Castlebar are dismayed that the summer camp will not proceed. In reply to a par<Col N="482" />liamentary question by Deputy McGinley, the Minister said that even if the kitchen renovations were not completed in time, there would not be any question of the members of the Reserve Defence Force not being able to attend annual camp, as arrangements would be made to facilitate personnel at other locations. That suggests that every effort will not be made to locate the camp at Castlebar, as has been the case in recent years. The Minister has given himself a way out by suggesting that the camp will be located in other areas. People are also disappointed by the fact that is the first shot in the campaign to downgrade Castlebar Army barracks.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will outline that the summer camp will go ahead as planned, that the barracks will not be downgraded, that the personnel allocated to Castlebar will continue to serve there and that the barracks will be enhanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to outline the position regarding the FCA summer camps at Castlebar barracks.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to close any Reserve Defence Force facility. A number of works were carried out at Castlebar barracks in 2002. These included the re-roofing of the dining hall at a cost of &euro;37,000 and the upgrading of the dining hall and other areas at a cost of &euro;73,000. These upgrading works included the installation of fire alarms, ceiling repairs, electrical rewiring, heating, fire doors, shower, ablutions in the billet block and tarmacadam. In addition, local services contracts to service routine maintenance works were completed at a cost of &euro;84,000 which covered windows, doors, gutters, painting and decorating.</P>
      <P>The resources I have provided for the Reserve have dramatically improved and I also ensured that the clothing and rifle issues were addressed. There is no doubt that the Government has upgraded the Reserve's facilities in every way possible.</P>
      <P>The electrical rewiring within the sleeping accommodation is in need of upgrading. As safety is paramount, it has been decided by the military authorities that the sleeping billets will, therefore, not be available for use this summer. Renovations are also necessary to upgrade kitchen facilities to meet health and safety requirements. Fair-minded people will accept that it will not be possible to have this work completed in time for summer camp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Higgins and Paddy Burke are realistic and they will know that this work cannot be completed by June. We must go through the normal tender process and hire a contractor and we will not be able to do so in time. The cost of hiring temporary accommodation, ablution facilities and kitchen facilities to hold summer camps in Castlebar barracks this year is estimated at &euro;140,000. It <Col N="483" />will also be appreciated that a value for money issue arises for consideration.</P>
    <P>The only alternative, therefore, is to provide for this year's annual training, which would normally take place in Castlebar, at another location. Accordingly, the necessary arrangements will be made to facilitate personnel at Columb barracks, Mullingar, where accommodation and training facilities are of the highest standard.</P>
    <P>I will not accept a reduction in the numbers serving in the Reserve Defence Force in Mayo. I have always emphasised the geographical spread of the force, its voluntary ethos and the commitment of its members. I will not allow a situation to arise where such commitment is ignored in the context of the reorganisation process. However, that process must take place. We have a three brigade Defence Force and we must move on. The force must also be trained to a much higher standard so that people in the Reserve will have the opportunity to serve overseas. A dramatic change will take place in terms of upgrading, but the people of Mayo can be assured that I have not agreed to a proposal to reduce numbers. I will ensure a fair spread of members throughout the State, particularly in areas that have served us <Col N="484" />well in the past. Their needs will never be ignored.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and his assurance that he will not countenance a reduction in Reserve Defence Force members in Mayo. The work to be carried out will cost &euro;140,000 and will not be completed in time for camp in three or four weeks. Does he anticipate the contract will go to tender before the end of the year with a view to having the work completed before next year's summer camp?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given instructions that the work should be undertaken as speedily as possible. However, the sum of &euro;140,000 that I mentioned relates to the temporary accommodation that would be required if the summer camp was to be held in Castlebar, which would be a waste of money. It would be better to make arrangements for Mullingar and use that money to improve the permanent accommodation in Castlebar. I do not know the full cost for the other work, but it will proceed through the normal process.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.45 p.m. until 10.30&nbsp;a.m. on Thursday, 29 May 2003.</P>
