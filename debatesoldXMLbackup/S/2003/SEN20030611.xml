      <P>I have received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the position regarding the planned closure of St. Brigid's secondary school, Goresbridge, in light of the salvage plan recently presented by the St. Brigid's action group.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate the added resources which will be provided to health boards directly or to service providers to enable them to continue to provide services without cutbacks to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ryan of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the Irish Wheelchair Association is provided with sufficient resources to guarantee the retention of its current number of community employment scheme staff.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators John Paul Phelan and Ulick Burke as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Ryan as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is No. 1, statements on the humanitarian situation in post-war Iraq, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all <Col N="634" />other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and on which Members may share time, the Minister to be called to reply not later than ten minutes prior to the conclusion of the statements; No. 2, Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill 2000 &ndash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 3 p.m. and to conclude not later than 4.30 p.m.; No. 3, statements on autism, to be taken at 4.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 6 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed seven minutes, and on which Members may share time, the Minister to be called to reply not later than ten minutes prior to the conclusion of the statements; and No. 13, motion No. 32, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. There will be a sos from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to propose an amendment to the Order of Business that, on the conclusion of No. 3, statements on the recent European Central Bank interest rate cut take place. There was cross-party agreement in the House yesterday that we should address this issue. Some banks are moving in the desired direction, but a number of culprits have not done so. It is important that the House debates the issue at some stage today, preferably with the Minister for Finance present. If he cannot be here, we will debate the issue ourselves. A one hour debate on this at the conclusion of No. 3 would help us to speak with one voice about the outrageous position put forward by some establishment members of the banking system. Members need to speak, as one, today. Will the Deputy Leader consider my amendment?</P>
      <P>Later today, the Public Offices Commission will publish the details relating to expenditure by candidates in last year's general election. While we welcome that as an important move towards some element of transparency in terms of election spending, of greater concern is the proposal by Government &ndash; it has not yet been officially announced &ndash; to extend and increase the amount that can be spent during elections. This would be a detrimental step and, before the Government formally arrives at a position by way of an amendment to the Electoral Acts, a debate should take place in this House on the issue. Those of us involved in party politics resent the fact that we must raise money for our political parties. We should not increase the amounts of money to be spent on elections. It is bad for democracy. We need time for the current election spending limits to take root within the political system. Will the Deputy Leader provide time for a debate over the next week or so in which we can speak to the Government before proposals are produced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment by Senator Brian Hayes to the Order of Business. We raised the issue of the banks yesterday. It is no accident that they happen to be moving in concert with each other. A cartel is in operation and <Col N="635" />it smacks of conspiracy. If it is, it is in breach of serious criminal legislation and would constitute a criminal act.</P>
      <P>I am not reassured and I am certainly not happy just because a few crumbs were dropped from the table yesterday that this is no longer an issue. We need to make clear that, as public representatives, we do not accept that people can be trodden upon. Someone asked yesterday what I meant by competition and competitiveness. It involves not just first-time buyers, but small businesses and people with overdrafts. A variety of people are affected by this. The most profitable banks in Europe should at least be prepared to give back to the people what has been given to them by the EU. It is excruciating. While it is unimportant to them, it is hugely important to those dependent on them. I formally second the motion.</P>
      <P>A new portrait of the President has recently been hung in the entrance hall of Leinster House, which is appropriate. However, this means that her portrait is on the right as one enters, with those of people from the Fianna Fáil wing of Irish politics, while those of people from the Fine Gael side are on the left with that of Robert Emmet, whose portrait is in place for the year to celebrate his bicentennial. It is appalling that there is no portrait of anyone to represent the left side of Irish politics.</P>

      <P>I am not blaming the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for this &ndash; I thought the House might offer its views. I am sure the senior partners in Government who are worried about Irish life moving too far to the right would be very supportive of what I have said. I ask the House to support me in this matter in order that we may have balance in all things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the call for a debate on the banking system. I was astonished to hear about the high level of prices in Ireland on a radio programme as I was driving to Dublin this morning. The chairman of the Competition Authority was a participant in the debate, as was the chairman of the Consumers Association of Ireland and the chief executive of RGDATA. The Director of Consumer Affairs refused to participate on the grounds that it was not a matter in which the director had any responsibility, being to do with inflation. I am beginning to wonder what job the director actually does. We now know that the banks ripped us off from 1999 to 2002 during the period of transition to the single currency. It is time the House had a look at the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>The issue of race and immigration is important. We had an interesting and colourful contribution from one Member on the Government side during the passage of the recent legislation dealing with the accession countries. In Cork an interesting and disgusting display took place during the last general election campaign. I know the attitude of the Government to this because one of the central figures in that display subsequently became Chairman of an Oireachtas committee but I am a little disturbed to find that Fine Gael is recruiting the other half of that &ldquo;Dumb and Dumber&rdquo; set.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy Leader organise, between now and the recess, a debate on the OECD report on the economy? This report would be a very good peg on which to hang an economic debate because it shows that, far from squandering the boom, we are holding on so far to the gains we have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come into the House to deal with yesterday's admission by the chief executive of the IDA of its failure to bring industry into the regions, particularly the BMW region? Various Members on this side of the House have requested a debate on the region and the failure of the Government to acknowledge that it has failed to bring infrastructure and jobs into it. By 2006, all the regions will have to compete on equal terms for new jobs. The fact that only seven of the 20 projects taking place this year will be outside Dublin and only one will be in the BMW region is an indictment of the failure of the Government, and the Minister in particular, to provide jobs in the region, despite the fact that it is the policy of the IDA to bring jobs to the regions on an equity basis. It is of the utmost importance that we deal with this before we close the hatches on the BMW region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to send a message to the Israeli ambassador in Dublin about the attempted assassination of the Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, by the Israeli Government in the Gaza Strip yesterday. As the road map for peace is being negotiated among the Americans, the Israelis and the Palestinians, it is a very provocative act by a democratic government to carry out an assassination attempt on a Hamas leader. The attempt has inflamed the atmosphere in the region. A woman was murdered by the Israelis during the attempted assassination while a young girl is in intensive care. As a democratic House, we should condemn the actions of the Israeli Government and appeal to Hamas and the Palestinians to show restraint in the face of this massive provocation. We should also try to ensure the peace talks are not derailed by the Israeli Government. I cannot understand&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in agreeing with Senator Leyden. Yesterday's attempted assassination was a very dangerous course of action for the Israeli Government. Now perhaps Mr. Bush will feel like revising his description of Mr. Sharon as a man of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" />Yesterday I asked that we might use the time allowed for statements on Iraq to formally pass the resolution in the name of the Independent Members which was unanimously passed by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The Leader said she would consider it and did not seem to have any great difficulty with it but nothing was said. Could I have an undertaking that this can be done? It should be reasonably easy to find a formula whereby that simple and uncontroversial motion could be passed, unless there were strong objections from Members, in the context of statements on Iraq. This would be very helpful. Perhaps the Deputy Leader will give us an indication of whether this is possible. I emphasise that it was passed unanimously by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, which included Government members. It is quite reasonable that we should simply take it to be passed in the House, especially if there is no strong objection from any Member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>We should ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and explain the arbitrary transfer of jurisdiction under the equality legislation from the Equality Authority to the District Court, an astonishing development. The District Courts, in their wisdom, have indicated that they regard the licensed vintners as having used this tactic as an attempt to subvert the law. This means that the Minister is assisting a very powerful vested interest and lobby group in subverting the operation of legislation passed by this House, which is perfectly entitled to an explanation.</P>

      <P>In <i>The Irish Times </i>today there is a United Nations report to the effect that Ireland is one of the worst countries in Europe in this regard and, in the world league of countries, comes behind 12 African countries. Eritrea, Angola and Rwanda have more women parliamentarians than Ireland. It is no coincidence that the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden and Finland, where there are positive political programmes to secure the election of women to parliament, also have the best family protection and <Col N="639" />social policies and are peaceful and prosperous countries.</P>

All of us have received a copy of a little blue book last week &ndash; the Government's progress report on broken promises for the period June 2002 to June 2003.

I hope we will have an opportunity to discuss this very topical matter with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan.

      <P>This week and next some very important discussions are taking place in Brussels on the Fischler CAP reform proposals which will have a major effect on the economy, particularly in relation to life in rural areas. I ask the Leader to make time available, as soon as the discussions are finalised, for a full debate in this House on the outcome. I wish the Minister for Agriculture and Food well in the discussions.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate at the earliest possible opportunity on the position of the Minister for Transport in relation to the open skies policy, specifically how it will affect Shannon Airport and the mid-west region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues on the other side of the House in calling for a debate on interest rates and the failure of the banks to adhere to the guidance of the ECB. It is outrageous that there are still a number of banks which have not gone along with the greater good. I am not necessarily applying the same pressure in calling for a debate today but, certainly, at the earliest convenience with a view to using the good offices of this House to echo the sentiments which many have expressed.</P>
      <P>On another issue, I join my colleague from County Clare, Senator Daly, in seeking a debate as early as possible on the gateway policy which Shannon Airport currently enjoys. There is concern in every town and village throughout the mid-west region. It is not just the interest of the airport that is in jeopardy. There is also great concern among the wider audience, including every small business, hotel, shop and restaurant throughout the county and the mid-west region. I strongly support Senator Daly's call for an early debate.</P>

      <P>I support the previous speaker in relation to the open skies policy. I listened to the recent comments of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, on the issue. Whenever there were fundamental changes in relation to Shannon Airport, the respective Ministers involved were the former Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, Deputy Brian Cowen, now Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan. Accordingly, Senators on the other side of the House should <Col N="641" />direct their criticisms at their Leader and the Minister involved. That is the direction from which the change of policy is coming. The Minister for Transport attended a meeting in Europe&mdash;</P>

      <P>Over the last month I have asked on a couple of occasions that the Minister for Health and Children provide the House with information on the basis of the expert advice he was getting in relation to SARS and the Special Olympics. I regret that this information has not been made available. It would be helpful, even at this late hour, if we knew who was coming to Ireland and under what terms, what was the perceived threat and what steps were being taken to deal with it. Incidentally, I have spent the last few days at a hugely prestigious conference of the world newspaper industry, a very important event to have in Ireland. I was delighted to see delegations from Toronto, Singapore and Beijing and wondered as to what different criteria might apply to them, as compared to the Special Olympians.</P>
      <P>On another point, I support Senator Norris's request to have his motion and that of his colleagues embodied in the debate today. It would be helpful, if they would agree, simply to ask the American and British authorities to carry out their responsibilities under the Geneva Convention, without using the terms &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; and &ldquo;occupying&rdquo;. If one is trying to influence somebody, it does not really help to use terms which they find derogatory.</P>

I request the Deputy Leader of the House to arrange for the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make a statement in this House as to his intentions in relation to increasing spending limits. One of the main features of last year's general election was the very long run into it. Prior to &ldquo;flag fall&rdquo;&ndash; the official announcement of the campaign &ndash; the Government squandered hundreds of thousands of euro on billboards and electioneering.</P>

Since the Government policy was introduced in 1999 the objective of putting 50% of all new projects into the BMW region has been a resounding success. While there have been only seven projects in 2003, we are still in the middle of the year and we have no reason to believe that it will not continue to be a resounding success. However, it would be useful to have the Tánaiste here to debate that matter and also, because it is linked, to debate the OECD report so that we can get some of the facts into the public domain and get away from the sensationalist scare tactics which people have been preaching through the media about the OECD report.</P>

The incident happened in Portadown when supporters from Monaghan were travelling home by bus. Four buses were stoned. It is completely unacceptable that on a Sunday evening, between approximately 6 o'clock and 7 o'clock, supporters travelling home in two coaches and two minibuses were stoned and windows in a bus were broken. A lady is in the Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin suffering an eye injury.

When we joined the EEC in 1973, the expectation was that the rising tide of Social and Cohesion Funds would lift all boats but it has not. From the point of view of the Border, midlands and western region, we have been stuck in the shallows and, as the figures published yesterday prove conclusively, we are not getting anything like the largesse of which we were told.</P>
      <P>The second issue is an announcement last week by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he was to review the workings and costs of tribunals of inquiry. That is urgently needed. Yesterday the newspapers told us that the Flood tribunal could run for another 15 to 20 years. Considering the costs involved therein, it is time to apply the brakes or certainly to conduct a review.</P>
      <P>On the issue of costs, in a tribunal in which I am involved, the Morris tribunal, there is separate legal representation, each consisting of a junior counsel, a senior counsel and a solicitor, for the Garda Commissioner, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association. That is a frightening extravagance. It is exorbitant. They have a commonality of interests and they should be represented by one legal team.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators for their interventions this morning. Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of the Opposition, moved an amendment which was seconded by Senator O'Toole. Senators Ryan, Bannon, Dooley and Coghlan also spoke about the same issue, the reduction in interest rates by the ECB and the tardiness of the banks in passing on the reduction. There is a important competition issue here. We are all being asked to have a competitive economy and obviously one of the key factors in all of that is the cost of funds to small businesses. It is quite obvious that the margin being charged by the banks, relative to that on which they are getting their own funds, is a high one and is a multiple of the margins elsewhere in the European Union. Although it is an important issue, we cannot find time to discuss it today.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, I did a sum on the back of an envelope yesterday evening. As I understand it, 0.5% of the &euro;46 billion outstanding in mortgages amounts to &euro;230 million per annum or &euro;630,000 per day. The mortgage book accounts for one third of total lending and therefore it is a very serious issue. It is an issue which the House should debate but unfortunately we will not be able to do so today.</P>
      <P>The matter of election spending was raised by Senator Brian Hayes. I am not aware of proposals to increase the spending limit but I will certainly make inquiries in that regard. If there are such proposals, I am sure they will come before the House in due course to be debated.</P>
      <P>The portrait of the President was raised by Senator O'Toole. You yourself remarked on it, a Chathaoirligh. It is primarily a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but it is important that in any country the portrait of the head of state should be in the parliament and it is common practice throughout the world. It is a matter for Committee on Procedure and Privileges to decide what others might be there.</P>
      <P>On Senator Ryan's shift on the trade union movement, I will leave it to the domestic squabbling between the various Members on the other side of the House to sort that one out. He seemed to have a difficulty with Fine Gael rather than with the Government on the matter of race and immigration, and we will leave him to sort that one out with Fine Gael.</P>

There have been calls over several weeks, including one from myself, to have that issue <Col N="646" />debated and it would be important to reach it before the end of the session.</P>
      <P>Senators Ulick Burke, Higgins and MacSharry spoke about the need for investment and jobs in the west. It has been a consistent Government policy, and especially the policy of the Tánaiste, that the regions should benefit from investment and job creation. It was also a consistent policy of the previous Government. It is a successful policy. Job creation is happening very successfully despite the downturn in the economy. The OECD has reported that we are still managing the economy well and I do not believe the Government has a case to answer in that regard.</P>
      <P>People who invest large sums of money make hard-headed decisions and it is up to the Government to facilitate their investment in the west, but it is the case that many companies still prefer to be near the capital city, irrespective of what country it is.</P>

      <P>I refer to the point made by Senator Norris and wish to explain to the Senator that there was confusion about this matter. The Leader was under the impression yesterday that the House was dealing with No. 28 rather than No. 29 on the Order Paper. The inquiries made were with regard to No. 28 and there was definitely a difficulty about the use of the word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;.

      <P>Thank you for your protection, a Chathaoirligh. Senators Daly, O'Meara, Dooley and Finucane raised the open skies policy and the Shannon gateway issue. It is an important matter and we will make time for a debate. It has an impact on tourism and business in the west and is related to the question asked about the IDA and investment.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara raised the matter of CAP reform, which is a critical and important issue. The talks are due to conclude on Friday. Whether or not they have reached a conclusion, the House should give the matter its attention. It marks a radical shift in the way that the Common Agriculture Policy is being organised.</P>
      <P>I have already referred to the point made by Senator Maurice Hayes about the motion. I do not disagree with him about SARS and the Special Olympics. The expert group has been making its position clear but perhaps not with the clarity that the House requires. I note his views on the newspaper editors.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins raised the matter of the stadium. There is general agreement that a stadium is needed and the only question is its location. That is where the difference of opinion lies. I am confident that difference can be resolved and that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will come to the House to give his views on the matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Brien's views on the incident that took place outside Portadown involving the Monaghan supporters travelling from a GAA match. It is appalling that anybody attending any sporting fixture anywhere in this island should be subjected to that sort of violence. It is unacceptable and the authorities will be made aware of the dissatisfaction in Monaghan and throughout the country with regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Burke raised the issue of taxis, which can be referred to during the debate on transport in Dublin. I hope the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, will attend the debate and I am confident he will be happy to deal with it.

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to be back in this House. I am pleased to address this issue of the humanitarian situation in Iraq. I am conscious that the House discussed this matter on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Experience has demonstrated that the humanitarian consequences of conflict continue to be felt long after the images of war have faded from our television screens. In Iraq today, millions of people continue to suffer from the effects of conflict, food insecurity, water shortages and from deprivation of other kinds. Hospitals in Iraq have been extensively looted and are overwhelmed by the demand for basic health services. Security incidents and ongoing instability continue to hamper relief efforts. The country's infrastructure has been further degraded with the disruption and destruction caused by the war. Basic services such as sanitation and electricity remain in short supply, causing hardship and increasing the risk of an outbreak of cholera and other diseases.</P>
      <P>In Baghdad, up to 50% of the water supply has been lost as a result of damage to the water network. Some 800,000 litres of drinkable water are being distributed in the capital on a daily basis by UNICEF. Water and chlorine are also being distributed in other parts of the country where possible. Ireland's humanitarian assistance is aiding these essential efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many millions of Iraqis remain dependent on food distribution. I was pleased to note the commencement on 1 June of the country-wide distribution of food aid by the UN World Food Programme, WFP. Prior to the conflict, 60% of the population, some 16 million people, depended on food rations as their only food supply. The resumption of regular food aid distribution is essential if enormous suffering and consequential population movements are to be avoided. Ireland remains a strong supporter of the WFP in its work. We assist it through core funding and responding to specific appeals. This mix of fund<Col N="651" />ing mechanisms provides the organisation with the flexibility to deliver food aid rapidly and effectively. Mr. James Morris, executive director of the WFP, will visit Ireland in July and I will meet with him at that time. This will provide a valuable opportunity for discussions on the organisation's work in Iraq and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that war in Iraq followed on from two previous conflicts and 12 years of crippling sanctions. Since 1991 the people of Iraq have experienced a dramatic drop in all aspects of their living standards. To put this in context it is important to point out the following. In the index that measures quality of life &ndash; the human development index, HDI &ndash; Iraq fell from 96th place to 127th place in a little over ten years. No country has fallen so far so rapidly. This deterioration has been translated at the basic human level into increased child deaths, malnutrition and high rates of disease. Iraqi children have suffered greatly and are still at great risk as we meet here today.</P>
    <P>My top priority, as Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation and human rights, is the protection and saving of human lives. This is the humanitarian imperative to which I am wholly committed and this focus has been a priority for the Government from the outset. All of the assistance we have delivered to Iraq has been informed by this imperative. I have worked closely with Irish NGOs and the key international organisations in shaping the Government's response.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, on 25 March I announced a &euro;5 million humanitarian assistance funding package to alleviate suffering in Iraq. As a result of reports emanating on the ground from humanitarian agencies, the key focus of this assistance is emergency support for health services, water and sanitation, food assistance and support for internally displaced persons. This funding has been delivered via the Red Cross family, UNICEF, the WFP, Concern, GOAL and Trócaire. Funding has also been provided to assist with the co-ordination of the humanitarian effort. This funding package is now on stream. Our partners have a proven track record of providing effective emergency relief to those most in need in difficult operating environments. I believe that Ireland's assistance is reaching the most vulnerable in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>I pay particular tribute to the Red Cross family and UNICEF who remained, as far as was humanly possible, active on the ground during the conflict. The heroic work of the mainly Iraqi personnel of these organisations undoubtedly saved many lives as they selflessly addressed the needs of the most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>A key component of our humanitarian funding to the Iraqi people responds to the UN flash appeal for Iraq. This UN assistance will be provided in strict adherence to the humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality that underpin the mandates of the United Nations and <Col N="652" />its emergency humanitarian agencies. The UN Secretariat has made it clear that a generous response to this flash appeal is critical, as the contracts in the oil for food pipeline will not be sufficient to meet the essential needs of the Iraqi people in the short term.</P>
    <P>The UN appeal covers two elements, food and non-food. It is estimated that the food needs of the Iraqi population will amount to 480,000 metric tonnes per month for the first few months. Non-food needs include the provision of water, health, shelter, education, protection, de-mining and emergency repairs. A total of &euro;2.4 million of our package will respond to this appeal, supporting programmes which are being implemented by our key UN partners, the WFP, UNICEF and the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</P>
    <P>The European Union, including the Commission, has allocated over &euro;700 million in emergency humanitarian aid for the crisis in Iraq and, to date, has delivered more than &euro;285 million of this. I welcome this rapid response and I will continue to use every opportunity to highlight the humanitarian needs of Iraq to my colleagues in the EU.</P>
    <P>In any conflict the primary responsibility for the protection and welfare of the civilian population rests with the warring parties. It is important that the political debate over the justification for the war, which has re-ignited over the past two weeks, does not divert the focus of the international community from the humanitarian effort at this time.</P>
    <P>It is still early days in the recovery efforts for Iraq. There are, however, some encouraging signs. Inter-agency co-ordination is good and the UN agencies and NGOs are meeting regularly. Five humanitarian corridors are operating through Turkey, Jordan, Syria, Iran and Kuwait. The adoption on 22 May of UN Resolution 1483, lifting sanctions on Iraq, means that estimated reserves of over 100 billion barrels of oil can now be put to use in the recovery process. For the first time in over three decades, free elections have taken place to choose the presidents of universities and deans of colleges and 13 new newspapers have commenced circulating in the country. A process of general disarmament of the population is beginning. These are first, but nevertheless welcome, steps toward normality for a population desperate for peace and stability.</P>
    <P>While it is clear that the situation confronting Iraq is extremely daunting, the challenges facing us are not unique. As donors, we have garnered valuable experience and lessons from similar post-conflict situations. Our aim must be to avoid the mistakes of the past and incorporate the lessons learned in a practical way in all our recovery and reconstruction activities. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of co-ordination in all phases of the recovery effort in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>While recent experience of post-conflict situations has been mixed, our understanding of the <Col N="653" />elements required for post-conflict development is improving. I would highlight Afghanistan and East Timor, in particular, as recent examples of countries that have made admirable progress in a short space of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The two most critical lessons seem to be that the recovery and reconstruction process has to be owned by the population concerned and that high levels of international engagement need to be sustained for many years. We know from our own experience in Northern Ireland how difficult it is to achieve lasting peace where deep divisions and suspicions exist. What is required is motivation and support rather than prescription.</P>
      <P>Iraq has access to vast wealth in the form of oil reserves to fund reconstruction. Financial resources alone are not sufficient. The way in which the financial resources are translated into actions and programmes will be the key to the outcome of recovery efforts. Successful reconstruction will necessitate building the capacity of local institutions and systems, facilitating good governance and assistance in the key areas of basic needs and livelihood support. The process must be managed carefully in order to balance the understandable desire to achieve early results with the capacity of any new administration system to act in a productive and accountable manner.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the United Nations should play a central role in any recovery process. This issue was discussed by the Taoiseach in his meeting with President Bush in Hillsborough last April. The Taoiseach has also had discussions on this matter with the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. The Government believes, as do our partners in the European Union, that the United Nations should be at the heart of the reconstruction process. It has the experience, capacity and perceived impartiality to carry this objective forward. The recent achievements of the United Nations in post-conflict situations as diverse as East Timor and Afghanistan are a good indication of its capacity to deliver what is required today in Iraq.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome the appointment of Mr. Sergio Viero de Mello as the new UN special representative for Iraq. I have met him on a number of occasions recently and the House will be aware of his good work following the conflict in East Timor. His experience will be a valuable asset to the recovery and reconstruction process. Moving beyond purely humanitarian interventions, the United Nations can assume a significant role in the broader task of helping Iraqis to forge new democratic institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is all the more important in the broader context of the dissension which affected the international community in the lead-up to the conflict in Iraq. We have taken the position that it is time to move beyond these divisions. Not least, it is <Col N="654" />essential to begin repairing the damage to the United Nations. The Security Council should be the guarantor of international peace and security in the future. This will only be possible if it is united and determined. Security Council Resolution 1483 represents a solid step back toward the position which the United Nations must occupy if the world is to continue in security and peace.</P>
    <P>Complex post-conflict issues must now be addressed if Iraq is to emerge from this crisis as a peaceful and representative democracy. The members of the Security Council carry a heavy responsibility to demonstrate that the United Nations is capable of working in unity and with purpose. It is also essential that the Iraqi people play an important and expanding role in the work being undertaken to reconstruct the country, both its institutions and infrastructure. I am pleased to see that this is being increasingly recognised and that efforts are being made on the ground to encourage members of the Iraqi police and civil service to return to their duties. These efforts should continue and intensify, as recognised in Resolution 1483.</P>
    <P>The assurance of Iraq's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, with every appropriate involvement on the part of the United Nations, will be of the greatest importance for Arab public opinion. It will help to dispel any fears that rule from outside could be imposed. We still have to guard against the twin dangers of destabilisation in the region and the worsening of the terrorist threat.</P>
    <P>The Government worked actively to avert the possibility of conflict, both during its time in the Security Council and subsequently, a matter we have discussed at length in this House. We signalled the risk that conflict could destabilise an already volatile region, warned of the prospect of increased tension between the Moslem and Western worlds, and laid particular emphasis on humanitarian concerns. Thankfully, the conflict was brought to an early close and casualties were lower than had been feared. Nonetheless, the risks of destabilisation and tension remain, It is vital that every effort is made to address these concerns in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The security situation on the ground continues to be extremely difficult, even if the wide-scale looting has been largely stopped. American forces are coming under daily attack. It appears that these attacks are increasing in number and, at least in some cases, being carried out on some sort of organised basis. The US Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, has predicted that it will take months to eradicate pockets of resistance by supposed elements of the Ba'athist regime, although it is not at all clear that resistance is limited to these elements alone.</P>
    <P>All this has led to a very tense situation in which there have been incidents where innocent civilians have been mistakenly fired on by occupation forces. Such casualties are particularly regrettable. There are further adverse consequences for the civilian population. Great <Col N="655" />obstacles have been placed in the way of United Nations and NGO relief workers. We must salute their heroism in braving these dangers.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say how this situation will develop; we need to keep it in perspective. What is happening is still on a relatively small scale. The outbreak of some degree of violent unrest was almost inevitable. The much wider destabilisation, which we feared, has thankfully not taken place. We can hope that, if cool heads prevail, this unfortunate situation can be contained with minimum casualties and will eventually disappear. It will be of particular importance to make a rapid transition to democratic, civilian rule by Iraqis which is seen by the Iraqi people as being run by themselves.</P>
    <P>This is what is envisaged in Security Council Resolution 1483, unanimously adopted on 22 May. As I have said, Mr. Sergio de Mello has been appointed as the Secretary General's special representative in Iraq. He has been given a mandate which assures the involvement of the United Nations in the future reconstruction of the country. His independent responsibilities include reporting regularly to the Security Council, co-ordinating activities of the United Nations in post-conflict processes in Iraq, and co-ordinating United Nations and other international agencies engaged in humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. He will also, in co-operation with the occupying powers &ndash; the Coalition Provisional Authority &ndash; assist the people of Iraq in all of the key activities which will be required for the reconstruction of Iraq and its restoration to normality. These responsibilities will include working intensively with the authority, the people of Iraq and others concerned, in order to advance efforts to restore and establish national and local institutions for representative governance, as well as by working together to facilitate a process leading to an internationally recognised, representative government of Iraq.</P>
    <P>In addition to this task, Mr. de Mello will also work to facilitate the reconstruction of key infrastructure in co-operation with other international organisations, promote economic reconstruction and the conditions for sustainable development, encourage international efforts to contribute to basic civilian administration functions, promote the protection of human rights, encourage international efforts to rebuild the capacity of the Iraqi civilian police force and international efforts to promote legal and judicial reform.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the fact that Resolution 1483 has taken the right of the Iraqi people to a representative government as a starting point in its consideration of the future of Iraq. We also welcome the clarification which it brought to the role to be played by the Secretary General's special representative in facilitating the formation of the future Iraqi government. Any future Iraqi government should be as broadly representative as possible of all the Iraqi people. We hope to see movement as soon as possible towards the forma<Col N="656" />tion of a permanent government structure based on the democratically expressed wishes of the Iraqi people. The Iraqi people have the inalienable right to a representative government of their own choosing and the sooner this can be achieved the better for everyone. The UN Security Council will be keeping the matter under continuing review and is committed to reviewing the resolution within 12 months.</P>
    <P>My overriding concern is that we should not lose sight of the urgency of the current humanitarian situation, as I have outlined to the House. The scale of needs on the humanitarian front in Iraq is still enormous. Helping the people of Iraq to survive from one day to the next must be no less of an imperative for the international community than the task of rebuilding the country and laying down the foundations for lasting peace and stability. I will continue to do everything in my power to relieve the humanitarian suffering of the Iraqi people and support the international effort to assist recovery in Iraq.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for returning to the House to give us his views on the ongoing situation in Iraq. It is important for us to have such a debate and continue to monitor the developments very closely. It is some weeks since President Bush formally declared that the conflict was over. I wish it was as simple at that but it is not. To paraphrase another party and politician, &ldquo;The problem has not gone away.&rdquo; As the Minister of State said, there is killing almost on a daily basis in Iraq. The number of American soldiers, in particular, who have died since the so-called conclusion of the conflict is almost as many as the number who died during the conflict. Let us be under no illusions. The problem has not gone away, the conflict is not over and the terrible problems in Iraq in recent years are still evident &ndash; if anything, they are now greater.</P>
      <P>The question posed regularly by the media and which has taxed politicians most in recent weeks is the location of the weapons of mass destruction. Will they ever be found and was the war against Saddam Hussein fought on a false basis? This question is very much to the fore in British political circles. There is also a strong undercurrent among our colleagues in the American political system as to where are the weapons. This is a crucial issue which needs a full debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps in the shorter term we should try to address the question the people of Iraq are asking of western Europe, in particular: where is the food, medical assistance, humanitarian relief and the road map to their future? We hear a lot about the road map proposals for the Middle East but the question the people of Iraq are asking is, where is the roadmap for the future of Iraq? I recognise that humanitarian relief for Iraq, some of which has been outlined by the Minister of State, is being planned and delivered to a certain degree in many guises by the United Nations, the United States, Britain and other countries. We must recognise that this support programme will <Col N="657" />require a different basis than the normal humanitarian relief programmes with which we would associate for countries such as Sudan, Cambodia, the Congo and so on.</P>
    <P>Iraq is not a Third World country. It has at least 10% of the world's oil resources and a sophisticated and educated population. Prior to Saddam, it had a history of efficient local and central administration. Against this background it is imperative that, apart from the necessary short-term aid, our focus is firmly on restoring democracy and government to the Iraqi people and allowing them to get on with the job. Civil administration is a vital component of that argument but until we can put in place civil administration in Iraq, there will not be any great progress.</P>
    <P>We discussed this issue prior to the outbreak of the war. While the military operations were under way, there was a key argument that Iraq needed to be given back to the Iraqi people as soon as possible. That is the core of any long-term solution. I welcome the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 adopted last May which arose from the original motion tabled by the United States, Great Britain and Spain. The main issue dealt with by the agreed resolution included the phasing out of the Oil for Food Programme, the appointment of a United Nations special representative, the lifting of all sanctions against Iraq, except those relating to weapons, and, most importantly, the setting out of the objective of establishing a recognised representative government for Iraq.</P>
    <P>The public position of the United States &ndash; I believe it to be the case &ndash; is a wish to hand over control to a representative government at an early date. However, despite this avowed intention, there is still very strong opposition to the US approach both from within Iraq and the wider Arab world. This problem has been compounded by the absence of a generally acceptable local leader or group of leaders. There is no indication whatsoever of a strong indigenous local leader emerging. A meeting was held by the United States on 15 April to discuss possible future local leadership in Iraq. A follow-up meeting was held on 25 April. Both meetings were very modest affairs and no great progress was made because, unfortunately, the main Shiah Muslim group did not participate. However, there has been some progress since. On 8 May there was the formal setting up of the Coalition Provisional Authority, a small but very necessary step forward. The initial head of the authority, General Garner, has now been replaced by the former ambassador, Mr. Bremner. He said an Iraqi national conference to choose an interim government would meet in July or thereabouts. There must be strong international pressure from all of us on the authority to progress this issue and ensure an early transfer of power will take place from the authority to the interim government.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the role of the European Union, an absolutely crucial one from the point of view of the future development of Iraq, and <Col N="658" />also a crucial one for us to address in regard to the future direction of EU policy. Yesterday we debated the Convention on the Future of Europe when many Members spoke about the difficulty and the desirability of having a common EU voice on foreign policy. This was never more necessary, yet it was never more lacking during the ongoing EU debate during the Iraqi crisis. The European Union must learn from these difficulties. It must take a lead role in continuing to stress the principle of territorial integrity for Iraq and the right of the Iraqi people to shape their own democratic future. The European Union must press strongly and publicly for transparency in regard to the economic and political measures which must be taken.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested that some EU countries are considering an early reopening of their embassies in Iraq. This is something on which we must reflect. The Irish Embassy in Iraq closed in 1991 during the first Gulf War. Since then our relations with Iraq have been handled through our Permanent Mission to the United Nations. We should consider at an early date the possible reopening of the Irish Embassy in Baghdad. The Irish business community would like to see this development. While there are probably limited business opportunities in Iraq for the Irish community at present, we must try to plan ahead. This is necessary, particularly in view of our forthcoming Presidency of the European Union. At that stage an Irish presence in Baghdad would be helpful and perhaps necessary. From that perspective, the Irish and the European Union's response to the crisis that has caused so much public debate and division must be one of ongoing pressure on the United States to seek a return to Iraqi self-government at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The tensions between Europe and the United States are still evident and could be seen very clearly at the G8 Summit last week. The body language between President Bush and President Chiraq spoke for itself. Some Members of the Oireachtas were in the United States last week on a political visit and could also feel the tensions. There was much constructive debate between the Irish delegation and United States politicians. However, the tensions between Europe and the United States on this issue were evident to us last week. They will not disappear overnight. The core argument of EU policy on Iraq's future must remain that its future should be decided by the Iraqi people and that the resources of Iraq should be used for the people of Iraq.</P>
    <P>A major role in the humanitarian and political situation is being played by the UN Secretary General's special representative, Mr. de Mello, who has made a positive start since his appointment a few weeks ago. He met informally some days ago a group of Iraqi professionals, including lawyers, judges, journalists, economists, human rights advocates and people from various political and religious backgrounds. There was strong consensus among the group to see the United <Col N="659" />Nations assisting in Iraq to help the political process to advance. The need for reform of the judicial system was also strongly stressed. Mr. de Mello is very constrained at present in that all decision-making continues to rest with the provisional authority of the US. Regrettably, he will have little more than a speaking role until he is given the space he needs to make political progress.</P>
    <P>One possible source of reconstruction help on which we have not dwelt very much is OPEC. I understand that the OPEC group is meeting today in Doha. The director-general of OPEC has already said that while OPEC does not normally provide assistance to its member countries, Iraq is a special case. He has indicated that the OPEC Ministers can discuss the possible funding of assistance for Iraq. I hope that at today's meeting the OPEC countries will put their money where their mouth is in relation to Iraq. Those countries were very strong in their views in advance of the military conflict. They argued strongly and validly against military intervention.</P>
    <P>There is now a problem regarding oil prices. Iraqi oil has not yet begun to flow again. The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has said that the money gained from the sale of Iraqi oil will go into a central fund to kick-start the resumption of economic progress in Iraq. Some of the OPEC countries fear that the flow of Iraqi oil will depress oil prices internationally. I hope OPEC will look today at the bigger picture. They should look kindly on their neighbour's plight, not merely talking about it but supplying direct aid to help the reconstruction programme.</P>
    <P>An issue which concerns me is the practicality of humanitarian relief, in particular food and medicine distribution. There is an international reservoir of goodwill and good intentions by the various agencies. The practical problem is that there are few if any international staff on the ground in Iraq in control of the aid delivery programme. I wonder about the capacity of the agencies to deliver the food, medicines and other resources so urgently required. The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, spoke about UNICEF and the World Food Programme. There are fine plans, which I hope are more than aspirational. This is crucial, because at present there are thought to be 16 million people in Iraq entirely dependent on monthly food rations after the two decades of war and economic sanctions. The World Food Programme believes that 27 million Iraqis will be in a position to receive food rations from more than 44,000 distribution points. That reads well, but when there are not sufficient ground staff to activate those programmes, the situation must be monitored closely. We cannot wash our hands and simply read about the aid and food figures if the relief is not being delivered. International staff and NGOs have a huge role to play and we wish them well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" />There is still a mountain to climb in relation to the future of Iraq and its once proud people. The military campaign has occurred and we cannot turn back history. It is essential that the US and their coalition forces recognise that they must leave Iraq as soon as possible. They must see that civilian control in Iraq must return, that democracy has to be put in place and that the future of Iraq and its resources is a matter for the Iraqi people and nobody else.</P>

      <P>I have never been to Iraq, but most of the Iraqis I have met were decent, intelligent people. We must ask ourselves why we should send aid to Iraq. It is a country with vast oil reserves &ndash; currently 100 billion barrels, according to the Minister of State. Senator Bradford said that Iraq was, until the time of Saddam Hussein, a country with an ordinary government at local and national level. It had universities, schools, museums and so on.</P>
      <P>There are two reasons why we should sent aid to Iraq. In the first place, the country has been invaded by a coalition of the UK, US and Australia. I have said this before, and people do not like my saying it, but it was an illegal invasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>The invasion was not sanctioned by the UN. I will say something else that people might not like. The invasion was necessary in order to topple the dictator Saddam Hussein. He slaughtered thousands of his own people. He gassed the Kurds.</P>
      <P>We were given a huge amount of disinformation by the intelligence services of both Britain and the US. We were told that weapons of mass destruction would be found, and they have not been found. I wonder why the alliance could not have told us the truth, that it wanted to invade Iraq to topple the dictator and secure the oil reserves. Would that have made much difference? There is not much we can do about it, but at least the alliance could have told us the truth. Saddam Hussein was indeed a ruthless dictator. There is no sign of him. He disappeared with billions of dollars and God knows where he has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if we could learn a lesson from this. It seems that the Western powers &ndash; I use the term widely, but with particular reference to the US, though I am pro-US rather than anti-US &ndash; seem to nourish dictators as long as they are keeping down any smell of left-wing government anywhere. Then, when these dictators become too powerful, we raid the countries and remove them. I am thinking of people like Suharto, Marcos and Pinochet, all supported in their time and given arms by Western governments. Saddam Hussein was once a friend of Ireland, a man to whom we sold meat, and who was supplied with arms by all the Western powers. When he went too far, they went into Iraq and deposed him. Perhaps in future we should not support dictators <Col N="661" />on the rise, and instead allow democracy to work wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Any aid Ireland provides must be for basic needs, solely for the welfare of the Iraqi people, especially health and medical services. Iraq is in a state of turmoil, with most of its infrastructure destroyed. That infrastructure must be rebuilt, and the country's security needs met, by those who invaded Iraq, namely the UK and the US. This should be done under the control of the United Nations if possible. I welcome the appointment of the UN Special Representative, Sergio Vieira de Mello, who I believe will do a very good job, provided he is allowed to operate as freely as possible.</P>
    <P>The Iraqi security situation is far from settled. The Minister of State mentioned Afghanistan. That country is not at all settled, and thousands of innocent Afghans have been killed for reasons I do not know of. The situation is similar in Iraq. Thousands of civilians were killed. It is only as the figures gradually emerge that we see the horror of the war visited on the Iraqi people. We tried sanctions for a long time. All that happened was that Saddam Hussein continued to sit comfortably and allowed perhaps 5,000 or so babies to die monthly. He had no respect for his own people and that situation could not have been allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In a country where people were educated, were intelligent and had a normal form of government, it is strange that 16 million of those people were fed by food programmes. They were dependent on handouts. That is a horrific way to run a country. These people have got used to handouts. The programmes were organised by the Iraqi Government to keep these people barely alive, while much of the funding was siphoned off to build palaces for Saddam and his brothers, and those of his relations whom he had not killed.</P>
    <P>There is a huge task facing the world community. The European Union has so far contributed &euro;100 million. This is only a drop in the ocean in respect of the needs of these people. There are parts of the world more deserving than Iraq, such as parts of Africa where people are dying of AIDS and starvation, with a lack of food and water. This is not going to happen in Iraq. I do not mean they do not need help and the Government should not send aid to Iraq, but there are places which are worse off.</P>
    <P>The one thing we have to watch in Iraq is the outbreak of diseases. The season of peak hot weather is aggravating the worsening condition of the more vulnerable in the cities, particularly in Baghdad where rates of cholera remain high. Other diseases such as dysentery and typhoid are becoming problematic due mainly to the water supply. It is damaging to the whole health infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Children are at particular risk in Iraq and have been for so many years. Apparently children's lives were expendable by the regime that went <Col N="662" />before. We must ensure this does not happen again.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar situation that we allow a dictatorship go so far, invade and destroy most of the infrastructure, and then appeal for it to be rebuilt. There must be some better way. We are not a wealthy country.</P>

      <P>Anybody who has read the Ireland Aid programme and seen the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, will observe that we have a proud programme. We have done the best we can with the resources available and aid distributed wisely and fairly. Most of the aid we send reaches where it is supposed to go and achieves what is intended for it. The current Minister of State is interested in this aspect of his brief and is doing his best with the resources available to him.</P>
      <P>I do not want it to appear from what I have said that I do not welcome aid going to Iraq; of course I do. Any aid that we provide must be carefully monitored to ensure that it goes only to the needy, the sick, children and for the provision of medical and water services. We must be careful that any aid we provide does not go to the reconstruction of buildings. There are plenty of world powers vying for those contracts. We do not any part in that sordid business.</P>
      <P>I welcome the work done by the Minister of State and the Government. We should continue to provide aid to the extent we can and subject to the resources available to us.</P>

      <P>I move motion No. 29:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to use his good offices to ensure that the United States and the United Kingdom Governments meet their absolute moral obligation, as well as their legal obligation, under the Fourth Geneva Convention to provide the finest medical care and rehabilitative treatment for all the civilian casualties of their recent war in Iraq as a matter of the greatest urgency.</P>
      <P>This has been agreed by this House, despite the interventions of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which came to light this morning in discussions on the Order of Business. I found it interesting that it is still not prepared to face the truth about this war. Apparently, officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs objected to the motion they thought I was putting down &ndash; No.&nbsp;28 &ndash; on the basis of one word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;. I ask the Minister of State to find out from his adviser who wrote this stuff what he has against the use of the word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;. What on earth does he think it is, if it is not an occupation? This is a nonsense. Let us tell the truth in this House and let us have truth from the Department of Foreign Affairs on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" />The coalition forces bombed the blazes out of Iraq, they went in illegally, they pretended there were weapons of mass destruction. Now, we cannot use the word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; because Iveagh House is frightened of alienating the Yanks. Tell the truth and shame the devil. It is a disgrace that we are not allowed tell the Irish people the truth and the word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; is unusable. Why is that the case?</P>
    <P>I deliberately chose motion No. 29 because it was passed unanimously by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. I strongly deprecate this resistance to the use of the word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;. That was what happened. It was said in this House by two Members on the Government benches. I was also told privately that it was objected to by Iveagh House. We must get our act in order on this issue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a whole series of issues that were put down in our names, such as the use of Shannon. We were told the reason was weapons of <Col N="664" />mass destruction. Iraq has the highest rate for the agglomeration of cluster bombs in the world. That is certainly worrying.</P>
    <P>With regard to the position of the United States and of this Government on the war in Iraq, I wish to cite the following statements:</P>
    <P>Simply stated there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction &ndash; Dick Cheney, 26 August 2002.</P>
    <P>Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the production of biological weapons. &ndash; George Bush, 12 September 2002.</P>
    <P>If he declares he has none, then we will know that Saddam Hussein is once again misleading the world. &ndash; Ari Fleischer, 2 December 2002.</P>
    <P>Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500 tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. &ndash; George Bush, 28 January 2003.</P>
    <P>We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make more. &ndash; Colin Powell, 5 February 2003.</P>
    <P>We have sources who tell us that Saddam Hussein recently authorised Iraqi field commanders to use chemical weapons &ndash; the very weapons the dictator tells us he does not have. &ndash; George Bush, 8 February 2003.</P>
    <P>So has the strategic decision been made to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction by the leadership in Baghdad? I think our judgment has to be clearly not. &ndash; Colin Powell, 8 March 2003.</P>
    <P>Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised. &ndash; George Bush, 17 March 2003.</P>
    <P>Well, there is no question that we have evidence and information that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, biological and chemical particularly&nbsp;. all this will be made clear in the course of the operation for whatever duration it takes. &ndash; Ari Fleischer, 21 March 2003.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the regime of Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction. &ndash; US General Tommy Franks, 22 March 2003.</P>
    <P>We know where they are. They are in the area around Tikrit and Baghdad. &ndash; Donald Rumsfeld, 30 March 2003.</P>
    <P>The former UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Robin Cook, said in the last week:</P>
    <P>We were told Saddam [Hussein] had weapons ready for use within 45 minutes. It is now 45 days since the war has finished and we have still not found anything.</P>
    <P>It is plain that he did not have that capacity to threaten us, possibly did not have the capacity to threaten even his neighbours, and that is profoundly important. We were, after <Col N="665" />all, told that those who opposed the resolution that would provide the basis for military action were in the wrong. Perhaps we should now admit that they were in the right.</P>
    <P>The motion that I put down, with all-party support, deals in a very bland way with the use by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of his good offices to persuade the US and UK Governments to live up to their obligations to the civilian population of Iraq. This was strongly supported by our distinguished former Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Andrews. When he took up that office, this measure was passed unanimously. It is important that we pass this motion.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the pictures of little Ali who lost both his arms and whose family was wiped out. As a result of an intensive international campaign, he was transferred to Kuwait where certain rehabilitative procedures were engaged in, but what about all the rest of the people? What about the morality of the situation which we all witnessed live on television where, on foot of rumours that Saddam Hussein was in a particular restaurant, a couple of thousand pound bombs were dropped on a civilian house and an entire family wiped out for no good reason? We condemned on the Order of Business the murder by the Israelis today of a Palestinian activist, but what about these people and what about the situation they face?</P>
    <P>There are points in the Minister of State's speech which I very much welcome such as his congratulations to the various aid agencies, the Red Cross, UNICEF, the WFP, Concern, GOAL and Trócaire. He also indicates the catastrophic fall in the human development index of Iraq. That is all very important and it is important it should be said. He also pays tribute to the heroic work of the mainly Iraqi personnel of these organisations &ndash; the fact that they certainly saved lives. I am very glad he said that.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot believe that Afghanistan and East Timor are being cited. Those are classic hit and run operations &ndash; certainly Afghanistan is. They went in, they walloped that country for their own reasons, they have now skited off and the world's attention has moved away from that country. Hamid Karzai controls about seven miles around Kabul and the Taliban and warlords are in control of most of the rest of the area. Poppy production in that country has quadrupled. What are we talking about? That is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and our Government played an important supportive role in East Timor. That was marvellous, but again world attention has shifted. The place is devastated. There is no infrastructure and the Minister of State knows that well.</P>

      <P>I was arrested on the way in because my comments were not so bland as to please the Indonesia administration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the incidence of disease, while diarrhoea is a simple disease to treat, large number of children are dying from it in Iraq. Some 70% of all child deaths recently in Iraq have been diarrhoea related. Dysentery and typhoid are also becoming a significant problem and this is partly due to the bombing of the water and electricity supply infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In a recent UNICEF newsletter there is a picture of a young girl, Ayat, picking grains of rice out of sewer in front of her house and washing them so that they can be sold in order to supplement the family income because they are starving. That is a classic method of transmitting disease.</P>
      <P>I did not get into East Timor because I was arrested. I am honoured to have been arrested and not to have been allowed in. However, I have been to Baghdad and I have been to the children's hospital. I would like to tell Members what Maura Quinn has to say in her report about the situation there. She wrote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the main paediatric hospital in Basrah. The doctor brought me around the overcrowded wards in which up to three mothers and their babies shared the same bed. We visited each mother and children to hear their story. Eventually we came to a very ill baby, attached to a drip. He was seven month old Mohammed, the first child of his 20-year-old mother Nabila. He weighted 3.5 kg, less than half his target weight. He was also suffering from pneumonia and diarrhoea. The doctor told me there was nothing further he could do. I sat with Nabila and we watched her beautiful son die. I raged at the waste of his life, while she, in a dignified way, appeared to accept his death as inevitable. News of Mohammed's death spread quickly. Many of the other mothers came to her bedside. Again, the unnatural acceptance of this baby's death. One <Col N="667" />of them asked me, the foreigner, &ldquo;How many more of our children have to die?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the question we should be addressing today. How many more of these children have to die? Can we not exert pressure on the people who helped create this situation to engage in some remedial action? </P>
    <P>I know that Saddam Hussein was a monster because I was one of the people who said it over the past 20 years and protested at Halabja when the west was supplying him with the gas and the Government was supplying him with meat for his army. I was more or less a lone voice protesting at that time, so nobody need question my credentials about this. I listen to the media and I hear the media in Iraq now saying, Saddam Hussein was bad but this is worse, and it is not over yet. It is oil that is at the back of this entire matter.</P>
    <P>There are also outbreaks of cholera. In Basra, there are 66 confirmed cases of cholera, with three people having died from the disease. Of the 66 cases, 79% are children under five years old and 59% of the victims are girls. There are also clinically confirmed cases of cholera in Nassariya and Missan, but these cases have yet to be confirmed through laboratory tests. This is due to a serious lack of the required medical equipment in the south and throughout Iraq as a whole. Dysentery and typhoid are also becoming a real problem for children. Dysentery is spread through contaminated water and food. The bacteria lodge in the intestines of a child and erode the intestinal wall, leading to bloody diarrhoea. Typhoid, which is also spread by contaminated food, is being seen throughout the capital as well. The current worry is that prior to the war and the collapse of the health system there was rigorous surveillance of typhoid, but now there is none. There is no reporting and no surveillance.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the education system in Iraq which is referred to in the UNICEF newsletter. I listen with interest and compassion to what we are told about some of our students who have to use an outside lavatory. I will outline the current situation in Iraq. The newsletter states:</P>
    <P>The collapsed education system in an example of how far Iraq has fallen. In a country which values education highly, and had the highest primary school enrolment in the Middle East for both girls and boys, this hurts. The 8,000 primary schools are in a dreadful condition &ndash; no windows or roofs, school-yards under water, awash with raw sewage, rat-infested and in some cases without electricity, sanitation or water.</P>
    <P>Yet we bellyache about students in Ireland in one or two cases having to use outside lavatories. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. We should certainly attempt to address this problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problem of landmines. During three weeks in the past month there were 500 injuries and 80 deaths of which we know. This <Col N="668" />is the subject of one of the earlier motions I tabled. The spokesperson for the coalition said that cluster bombs are not illegal &ndash; they are of course but that does not matter, they can still lie as much as they like. They are effective weapons. There was equipment in and around built up areas and accordingly the bombs were used to take out the threat, knowing that these cluster bombs primarily affect children and are illegal under the Geneva Convention. There is no question they are illegal but they are still used. They are still there and they have not been taken away.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Lydon, in a most interesting speech, said that our overseas aid should not go towards the rebuilding of the infrastructure because many other groups are involved in that. We know them, they are the friends of George Bush &ndash; Bechtell and Haliburton, these people who incited the war, planned and conspired to bring it about. It was not the intelligence service. Let us put a stop to that myth. It was not the intelligence services who lied; it was the massaging, manipulation and misuse of intelligence information by political leaders that led to the situation where even the intelligence services in the United States and the United Kingdom could not stomach it and they started leaking information. That is how we know what the truth is.  </P>
    <P>This was a shameful war. I opposed Saddam Hussein from the beginning. While I am glad he is gone, I fear for the people in Iraq because it will be another hit and run exercise, just like Afghanistan. The media victory was won and American citizens were persuaded that right was on their side and so on. I pity those left behind when the media move on. For that reason, it is terribly important that this House continues to monitor the situation for ordinary Iraqi citizens.</P>

      <P>I second the motion proposed by Senator Norris. I am glad the Minister of State used the word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;. It is difficult to make an appeal under the Geneva Convention concerning the responsibilities of occupying powers unless one admits those forces are in a position of occupation, which is what the invading armies are in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Norris, I opposed the war. Unfortunately, I can understand to some extent the Government's position. A very vindictive <Col N="669" />Government is in power in the United States of America. I was saddened by the words of Condoleezza Rice, an adviser to President Bush, who said France must be punished. If the US Government continues to adopt that approach internationally towards those with which it disagrees, especially on such serious issues, there is very little room for progress. I issued a newsletter on the war to some constituents and received a great deal of support for my opposition, especially from people who had worked in hospitals in Baghdad.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Norris, I also objected to Saddam Hussein's activities during the years. Not only did we send him meat for his army, anyone from Iraq on whose behalf I sought asylum was refused. One was a surgeon from the Iraqi army who sought asylum because he was being asked to amputate the limbs of deserters from the army. He fled to Ireland where he had undergone some training. We did not even think at that stage of granting him asylum. We must examine the way we have behaved during the years and realise that we are now in a position within the European Union to act in a responsible way in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are socially acceptable to the people of Iraq, which is a major advantage. We have an enormous responsibility to try to do everything we can to help them. The Minister of State pointed out the appalling decline in the health statistics in that country. This has been ongoing since the late 1980s. Maternal and infant mortality figures are now much worse than in Iran. Iraq was previously much better than its neighbour.</P>
    <P>We have no idea of the number of casualties, civilian and military, in the last war in Iraq. Certainly, they are in their tens of thousands but the situation is such that thousands more are dying, especially children. This is due to the destruction of the health service and the looting of hospitals. It is extraordinarily important that we address this issue at once or the casualty figures from the war will be much higher.</P>
    <P>There was something macabre about the G8 meeting taking place in a spa, Evian, full of clean water when, in another country not that far from Switzerland, obtaining clean water was one of the main responsibilities the occupying powers should have been undertaking. It is extraordinary that the oil wells have been secured while the water wells have not and that people are still drilling for water in their backyards. Precedence has been given towards securing the oil desired by the United States of America rather than securing the health of the Iraqi people. Senator Norris gave a vivid account of the spread of disease by water. This is appalling. I gather that in Iraq a child can expect to have about ten bouts of diarrhoea a year. It is very difficult for any child to survive in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>We must examine other important elements also. Through the worst of times and thanks to UNICEF to a large extent, Iraq tried to keep its immunisation programmes operational. I presume all the supplies have now been looted. I <Col N="670" />take Senator Lydon's point that we prefer to supply aid towards this type of project rather than towards the firms which Senator Norris said were going to rebuild the country's infrastructure. Will Minister of State examine the immunisation programme in Iraq? There was a breakdown a few years ago and polio broke out again. They managed to resurrect their immunisation system and rectify matters through courageous work by some of their doctors. Polio has been eradicated internationally and it would be terrible if pockets were to break out again. Given that it is a water-borne disease, we need to examine this very carefully.</P>
    <P>The armies of occupation have an enormous responsibility to protect the humanitarian aid workers in Iraq. It is understandable why so many excellent organisations have not returned foreign workers to the country. Their faces may not be very acceptable at present. I applaud the Red Cross and UNICEF for the work they do. Their people in Iraq are behaving in an incredible manner. We must put it to the military forces that they must protect them. This is not happening in Afghanistan. I listened the other night to an Irish aid worker, Patrick O'Brien, who said their lives were in danger all the time. It is important to remember that more UN humanitarian aid workers are killed internationally than members of peacekeeping forces. I have always found this an extraordinary statistic but apparently it is true.</P>
    <P>The occupying forces must also assist the United Nations inspectors in examining the nuclear facilities that have been looted. One hears appalling stories of clothes being washed in barrels which were used to store nuclear residue or something similar. As happened after Chernobyl, this could lead to the spread of infected clothes throughout the country and would be a major factor in causing leukaemia. There are also the matters of depleted uranium weapons and cluster bombs scattered throughout Iraq which need to be dealt with. We have a duty to point out to the forces there that these are their responsibility. As this is covered by the Geneva Convention, it should not be very difficult to do.</P>
    <P>What has been the fate of those people who were part of the regime and surrendered or were arrested by the occupying forces? I am thinking specifically about the two women scientists attractively nicknamed, Mrs. Anthrax and Mrs. Bacteria, or something similar. What has been their fate? We have heard nothing about them. It is fine to say they will be interrogated to obtain information from them but how valuable will that information be? The dreadful spectacle of Guantanamo Bay is still ongoing, a matter about which we should make representations.</P>
    <P>I have spoken previously during business in the House and on the Adjournment about the scuppering by the United States of attempts to introduce a verification protocol to the 1972 United Nations convention on biological weapons and toxins, on which great work was done in Geneva for many years. When all was going well in late 2000 and early 2001 and we hoped something <Col N="671" />would be signed in July 2001 and the verification protocol agreed, the United States pulled out in July and stated it would bring something better forward in September. Almost two years later, nothing has been brought forward. The only country I know of where anthrax has been a problem is the United States of America. They never seem to have found who was responsible. It must be a cause of concern for people in America to know that someone is capable of obtaining anthrax, putting it in envelopes, sending it and no one has managed to find him. We need to hunt these people down in case they end up posting such envelopes to us. These issues are all extremely important.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the occupying forces in the Kurdish area are, according to newspaper reports, refusing to allow the harvest to be brought in because they are afraid the Arabs and Kurds in the area will fight. However, the Arabs and the Kurds have stated that they have no intention of doing so. There are plenty of farmers in this House who can tell us that the harvest will not wait forever. Are the occupying forces trying to make these people even more dependent on aid from us? I would welcome it if the Minister of State could have this matter investigated.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Leyden talked about how the West nurtures dreadful dictators when it feels it is in its interests to do so and that it is only when they have gone completely crazy that we pull the rug out from under them. One wonders about the many countries &ndash; including Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and others in that region &ndash; whose despotic regimes are not being dealt with. What about the regime in Burma? We are delighted to hear that Aung San Suu Kyi is alive, but nobody has sent any troops to invade Burma. Even though the people voted in favour of a different Government, no one in the West felt there was any need for a regime change.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and his officials have a great commitment to this area. I compliment his officials on printing the Minister of State's speech on both sides of the paper. That is an environmental issue in which I am interested and it is well worth printing speeches in this way. I hope the Minister of State makes these points, because we have a very important voice in Iraq at present and we should use it.</P>
    <P>We should also deal with some of the problems we have with the USA. I doubt whether US business interests in this country would withdraw their operations because we might object about the fact that people not being allowed to take in the harvest.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and congratulate him on his continued initiatives in the area of aid. Despite being a small country, Ireland plays an important role on the world stage. This is in no small measure due to Deputy Tom Kitt's commitment <Col N="672" />to his responsibilities in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers referred to issues other than those covered by today's debate. We should realise that we are here to make statements on the humanitarian crisis in post-war Iraq. It is important to reiterate that the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Iraq is a result of two previous international conflicts &ndash; the Iran-Iraq war and the Gulf War in which Iraq invaded Kuwait &ndash; 12 years of international sanctions imposed by the United Nations and the most recent conflict. As a result of this, in 20 years Iraq has been reduced from a state of relative prosperity to one of mass poverty and ill health. This was highlighted by the Minister of State, who referred to the human development index.</P>
      <P>No one should think that the current humanitarian crisis in Iraq is a result of the most recent conflict, although it might suit certain contributors to this debate to narrow the focus and enter into a finger-pointing exercise. They talk about telling the truth: let us speak the truth. Power in Iraq was held by a dictator who practised genocide and mass murder. The meaning of the word &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; can be extended to include this. As a result of his rule, conditions in Iraq have deteriorated to their current state. That is the truth.</P>

      <P>As I said, if we want the truth we must look at the humanitarian conditions. There is evidence to show that there has been a deterioration over a 20-year period. The Senator should not focus the humanitarian crisis into the last six months; it did not happen in that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Ireland fervently hoped that the most recent military action could have been averted. That was not possible. We hoped that Iraq would be disarmed peacefully and that any military intervention would have the backing of a second UN resolution but, unfortunately, this was not possible. The focus for Ireland and the international community must, therefore, be on the <Col N="673" />humanitarian crisis and on assisting in every way the post-war reconstruction of Iraq.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian arena is where Ireland has credibility in international affairs and it is one of the leading donors of overseas development assistance in the world. We invest heavily in a long-term way in building up partnerships with developing countries in the poorest parts of the world, defending human rights, building robust democracies in poor countries and defending the rights of the vulnerable and the poor in natural and man-made disasters.</P>
    <P>Iraq is no different. No sooner had the conflict ended than our NGOs were active on the ground. There has been no shortage of funding. We have a large humanitarian budget, which has flexibility and can respond very quickly to emergencies such as this. I compliment the Minister of State on his commitment of a &euro;5 million funding package for humanitarian assistance for Iraq, which will be delivered via the Red Cross, UNICEF, Trócaire, Concern and GOAL. The key focus of this assistance is emergency support for health services, water and sanitation, food assistance and support for internally displaced persons. Funding was also provided for the United Nations humanitarian co-ordination efforts.</P>
    <P>It is important to put our commitment on the record. Since 1999, Ireland has provided more than &euro;6.2 million in humanitarian assistance for Iraq. Ireland's generous response has largely been matched by that of its European neighbours. The European Commission announced an overall package of some &euro;100 million in humanitarian aid, of which &euro;22.5 million has already been allocated. In addition, EU member states have pledged more than &euro;630 million in assistance and more than &euro;263 million of this has been committed thus far. I am sure Ireland's funding will continue to be focused on meeting basic needs within the humanitarian context. I also expect that future funding requests for recovery and reconstruction will be carefully examined in light of developments within Iraq, the role of the UN and the use of oil revenues.</P>
    <P>The humanitarian aid effort in Iraq is, unfortunately, not without its dangers and the distribution of aid is a less than seamless measure. Security remains a major concern in many parts of Iraq. There is concern that some main routes, particularly in the north and north-east, are becoming increasingly dangerous due to attacks by armed gangs. The UN has set up a security co-ordination cell in Baghdad to keep the humanitarian community informed of security developments throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As always, our praise and admiration must go to the NGOs active on the ground. Theirs is a dangerous but valuable and important job and they must be accorded the highest praise. Commitment by governments of money from overseas development budgets is meaningless if we do not have people on the ground to distribute the aid and ensure that it is given to those who need it most. I welcome the process of general disarma<Col N="674" />ment taking place among the civilian community because this is necessary to ensure proper and efficient distribution of aid.</P>
    <P>The NGOs are best positioned and best equipped to distribute aid and work to alleviate hardship and suffering. There is nothing more demeaning than to see soldiers fling food parcels from the backs of trucks. Humanitarian agencies have an independence and professionalism in terms of the distribution of aid which cannot be replicated by soldiers. We should be in no doubt that the humanitarian situation in Iraq is indeed a pressing one. Demands for health and medical services continue to outstrip supplies. The impact of instability and the consequent breakdown of basic services is more severe in the principal cities, particularly Baghdad.</P>
    <P>Cholera levels remain within the norm for this time of year in Iraq. However the approaching seasonal peak of hot weather is aggravating the weakened condition of the more vulnerable, mainly in the cities. While the World Health Organisation continues to monitor the position, the possibility of a serious outbreak is one of the major challenges in the weeks ahead. According to UNICEF, the health situation of children in Iraq remains tenuous. Many children continue to suffer from high rates of diarrhoeal disease, much higher than this time last year. Dysentery and typhoid are also becoming problematic, mainly due to the shortage of drinking water and damage to the health infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The need is, therefore, great and I am glad that Ireland and the international community are rising to the challenge, with the UN playing a central role. The new UN Special Representative for Iraq, Sergio de Mello, who arrived in Baghdad on 2 June, has met Paul Bremer, administrator of the coalition provisional authority, to discuss the role of the UN in areas such as humanitarian assistance, reconstruction, development, civil administration, legal and judicial reform and human rights. Thousands of food agents have resumed the distribution of food rations in all Iraqi areas. The food distribution is reported to be proceeding smoothly. Since the first week of April to the end of May, the World Food Programme has brought about 440,000 tonnes of food to Iraq to replenish the food distribution system.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the reconstruction of Iraq is high on the political agenda of all nations within and outside the EU. US officials have announced that a meeting of donors to raise money for the rebuilding of Iraq is planned for September, following preliminary discussions at a meeting to be held in New York in June.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the G8 summit. It is to be welcomed that it has been agreed to unite behind the Iraqi reconstruction effort, despite lingering disputes over the justification for the recent war. Like the EU, Ireland welcomed the recent adoption of the UN Security Council Resolution 1483 on post-conflict Iraq and the creation of the post of UN Special Representative. The resolution achieves one of the main <Col N="675" />objectives pursued by the EU, namely, that the UN must play a central role in the reconstruction process of Iraq and lend legitimacy to the action of the international community and its members. The EU has committed itself to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that the institution of the UN was one of the casualties in the recent conflict. This is all the more reason that the UN has to regain lost ground by showing leadership in facing up to the many challenges now confronting the international community as result of the war in Iraq. In this regard, I am glad that the Security Council has united to chart the way forward for Iraq by passing Resolution 1483, which spells out the assistance one would expect the United Nations, in co-ordination with the occupying forces, to give the Iraqi people. The most important task is to ensure that the Iraqi people are able, as soon as possible, to govern themselves. We must maintain international pressure to endure the hand-over of democratic control by allowing the election of a government, which will be representative of all the people of Iraq, at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Nobody was in any doubt that Saddam Hussein's regime was a ruthless and bloody dictatorship. Nobody denied that Iraq had been in wilful defiance of the international community. It is unfortunate that a conflict had to take place but, in my opinion, it was necessary. The focus must now be on reconstruction, relief and humanitarian resources. We can take pride, as a country, in the fact that we are playing our part in that regard. Keeping peace and enforcing it will be a challenge in the months ahead. We must encourage greater UN involvement, a reduction of the involvement of the occupying forces and their replacement, as appropriate, with proper civil administrative structures and, if necessary, a peace force. I support Senator Bradford's call for serious consideration of the re-opening of the Irish Embassy in Iraq.</P>
    <P>The Government will not take its focus off Africa as a result of its focus on Iraq. We have a long-standing commitment to overseas aid throughout the world and I am sure that will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us move on.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the vast sums of money the EU is supposed to have allocated. It has spent &euro;285 million, but it allocated &euro;700 million. Let us place this in context: to date, the war has cost over $60 billion. That is about 50% of our gross domestic product for a year. To compensate the Iraqi people for the consequences of that expenditure of $60 billion, we, the heroic Europeans, are going to spend approximately &euro;500 million at current exchange rates. The irony of our paying anything to make up for the damage caused by two countries which fought an illegal and immoral war is beyond me. Because I, like many Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, am a humanitarian, I will not object on account of the particular irony of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear, however, there was no legal or moral basis for this war. The <i>post hoc </i>justification on the basis of the horrific nature of the regime is, perhaps, the most selective use of selective information I have seen in a long time in the House. Of course, Saddam Hussein was a brute. I knew that and said so in the House 20 years ago. When we were feeding his army during his illegal war on Iran &ndash; which he fought because he was encouraged to do so by the United States and Britain &ndash; I did not hear one sanctimonious word about human rights from Fianna Fáil or any of its allies during that period because its friends in the meat industry made money out of that bloodthirsty regime. I ask them to spare me their <i>post hoc </i>humanitarian concern for the people of Iraq. When we were making money out of the situation there, they did not care. The should also spare me that concern, particularly in light of the fact that the governments of half the countries that have joined the alliance to liberate Iraq are also brutal tyrannies. I refer here to the countries peripheral to Iraq, which were part of the former Soviet Union and among which there is not one democracy. Some of them have dictators who have been planted permanently in place with US aid because they have accepted American bases. Spare me the humanitarian concern when what in fact one is doing is stabilising dictatorships in the region &ndash; in Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan <Col N="677" />and all those places where there has been one dictatorship after another. Let us not bother talking about Tunisia, Morocco or Saudi Arabia.</P>
    <P>I have left out remarks about the current situation because we know it is awful. Contrary to what has been said in the past few minutes, it has got spectacularly worse since the war. The health and education of children have got worse, as have the health service, the supply of clean water and food supplies. These are all worse than before.</P>
    <P>There has been wonderful glorious progress, as the Minister of State said. All the universities are electing their own heads, an extraordinary development. We do not allow that here but perhaps we will. When one is foraging for evidence that there has been progress, I am sure one must take whatever is presented.</P>
    <P>It is a glorious mess. It is disingenuous of the Minister of State, a man for whom I have great personal regard, to say it is not as bad as it could be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can interpret the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true about any situation. There has never been a situation which could not have been worse. Therefore, to say it is not as bad as it could be is simply to say it could be worse. Of course, it could.</P>
      <P>The fundamental facts are that the Government accepted, without reservation, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that it was a threat to its neighbours and the rest of the world. Neither of these statements was true. One of the ironies of life is that the best summary I have heard is a line from Rudyard Kipling:</P>
      <P>If any question why we died,</P>
      <P>Tell them because our fathers lied.</P>
      <P>The two Governments involved lied to their peoples, parliaments and the world. They knew there was no threat and that there were no weapons of mass destruction but I suppose they will find something somewhere. Iraq was a country with a nasty government and regime but the idea that there was an imminent threat to neighbouring countries, the United States, Britain or the western world generally was a fabrication deliberately entered into by two democratically elected governments and clearly a lie. They did not have any convincing evidence of weapons of mass destruction and the <i>post hoc</i> changing of the analysis to suggest that it was about liberation from tyranny is a convenient smokescreen for the greatest lie perpetrated on the Irish people since Lyndon Johnson fabricated the Gulf of Ton Kin incident to justify war in Vietnam, or perhaps since Leonid Breznev imagined that the liberation of Czechoslovakia was a serious threat to the security of the Soviet Union &ndash; one can pick either example, where big powers told lies to the people to justify actions which would otherwise not have been justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" />The war was wrong but what was even worse was the bland indifference of what are occupying powers to the well-being of the people. It goes without saying some degree of disorder was inevitable. The scale of looting, massive disorder and the collapse of any sense of personal security in what was the state of Iraq for a considerable period after the occupation, and still is in many cases, is clearly a choice made by the occupying powers. While they knew how to secure the oil Ministry, they did not know how to secure the hospitals. While they knew how to protect oil wells, they did not know how to protect schools and colleges. While they knew how to protect all of the things worthwhile to them and get contracts for beneficiaries of George Bush, they did not know how to give the ordinary people of Iraq basic rudimentary security.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that civilians were killed accidentally. They were killed, not because they were civilians but because an untrained unprepared army was put into a situation which it did not expect and where it used lethal force, just as the Israelis do, in entirely inappropriate circumstances. Any army which feels happy about using cluster bombs in built-up areas will obviously have no great problems about using lethal force when there is a threat to them.</P>
    <P>Both in humanitarian and political and military terms, we have got ourselves into another mess, just as in Afghanistan, most parts of which are returning to the medieval control of warlords and, in some cases, the quasi-medieval control of the Taliban and where the country's single biggest export, the by-products of opium, are now flooding the western world again, yet the Government can produce a script which tells me that the position in Afghanistan is improving. One of the liberating powers of Iraq, Australia, which has grabbed most of East Timor's natural gas and oil resources and walked out of an international convention to make sure no international body can rule on that particular grab, is now giving lectures to the rest of the world about the joys of liberation in Iraq.</P>
    <P>The truth is we all knew Iraq was a brutal tyranny and I am glad Saddam Hussein has gone. However, brutal tyrannies are not the issue, as we have clearly seen by the refocussing of the malevolent eyes of the present US Administration on Iran. Iran is not perfect but, in the order of democracies and personal freedoms, I will defy the Minister of State to tell me that Morocco, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Burma, Zimbabwe, China or any of the other little countries north of Iraq are more democratic.</P>
    <P>Iran held significant and comparatively free elections in recent years in which there were two contending leaders with quite different perspectives and the Iranian people voted for the person of their choice. It has been a far from perfect transition, with strong clerical elements preventing the wishes of the people &ndash; we are not too far away from such a system of government. There were free elections contended by parties <Col N="679" />with different views and now we are told they are the next target. From what will we say we are liberating the Iranians? Will we restore the Shah, that model of democracy? Those who are apologists for an illegal and immoral war are inviting Britain and the United States to do it again to another country and will find another <i>post hoc</i> rationalisation when it turns out, yet again, that the threat about which we are told did not exist. It is time to take a step back, look at the world and realise that unless we have a stable system of international order where everybody plays by the rules, we are in danger of moving towards something close to international anarchy.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his presentation and Senator Ryan for letting me share his time. I welcome this debate on the humanitarian situation in post-war Iraq. When there were calls for a debate in the Seanad a couple of weeks ago, I envisaged a broader debate which would include the road map for peace for Israel and Palestine, peace and stability in the Middle East, and the role of Ireland, the European Union and the United Nations in that process. As the Leader of the House stated in reply to my request, such a debate would be timely. I hope we can have such a debate in the near future and that the Leas-Chathaoirleach will not mind if I bring these issues briefly into the debate.</P>
      <P>While I opposed the war, one good initiative which has come out of it is the road map for peace between Israel and Palestine. While I realise yesterday's events do not augur well for the process, as in the case of Northern Ireland, it is a long and difficult road in achieving peace between two opposing sides.</P>
      <P>The Middle East peace process should be placed at the top of Ireland's foreign affairs agenda and those of the EU and the UN. Ireland should do all it can to support both sides in achieving peace and secure and stable states of Israel and Palestine. The United States and the United Kingdom should be encouraged to pay attention to this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State spoke about what Ireland can provide in terms of support and motivation for Iraq. Ireland can also provide similar support in the Israel and Palestine situation.</P>

Tá mise den tuairim gur chóir go mbeadh an díospóireacht seo ann go rialta, mar tá imeachtaí san Íaraic ag athrú ó lá go lá agus ba chóir dúinn a bheith in ann ár dtuairimí a thabhairt maidir le sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has a proud history which is recognised throughout the world. We have many friends internationally and we experience very little hostility in our international relations. One of the main reasons for this is that we never colonised, coerced or exploited any other country. Our con<Col N="680" />tribution has always been one of friendship based on a humanitarian concept. This was exemplified in the work of the missionaries, peacekeeping forces and those who helped emerging legislatures in developing countries to do their work.</P>
    <P>I made my position clear on the war in Iraq during the previous debate. I explained my position regarding the pre-emptive military strike by the Anglo-American forces against Iraq. In my opinion, the war was illegal, unjust and immoral. Everything that has happened since has reinforced that point of view. The Minister of State's contribution represents the correct approach to the current situation because it displayed a balanced view that is vital for a country such as Ireland to adopt. I do not contribute to the school of sanitisation of language in order to bring about a surgical transformation of depravity, tragedy or horror. I am pleased that the Minister of State did not contribute to that view either.</P>
    <P>There are occupying forces in Iraq. It is clear that there are many people who feel uneasy about the humanitarian issues which are becoming evident. What surprises me most of all is that when we were watching the coverage of the war by the media cartel, we were insulted on an hourly basis by the manner in which the war was presented. It was clear that the coverage was not truthful and that it was evasive and partisan. In the midst of a humanitarian crisis, the media is now playing the same role. Where are the cameras to show us what is happening in Iraq? They should be there, if for no other reason than to arouse the conscience of the international community to make a contribution to alleviate suffering.</P>
    <P>In any humanitarian crisis, there must be a two-way focus on the short term and the long term. The short term deals with human suffering, particularly that of the most vulnerable sections of society. Many speakers, including the Minister of State, have made reference to the suffering of children. I find it difficult to understand how political leaders and administrations &ndash; the members of most of which hold religious beliefs &ndash; can be so gung-ho about war. They do not seem to take the time to look at the terrible suffering. During the war, I saw pictures of two or three trucks bringing in what was obviously symbolic aid. That was an insult to our intelligence and the aid made no impact whatsoever. The occupying powers should pay for humanitarian aid, but should have no direct role in its distribution because I do not trust them. I have no doubt that the media will not give us the opportunity of seeing the reality.</P>
    <P>In the same way that I compliment the Government, which is coming out of this so well &ndash; as should be the case with in light of our State's legacy and tradition &ndash; I also praise the Irish media. Throughout this crisis members of the media here have excelled in trying to show the truthful situation, against all the odds and the privileges of the embedded journalists. I salute RTE and it will be to its eternal credit that, with limited resources, it took a stand and took on the giants of the inter<Col N="681" />national media and brought some sense of sanity and balance into this debate.</P>
    <P>This debate specifically relates to humanitarian issues, but these cannot be discussed in isolation from the larger issues. Such matters are not mutually exclusive, nor do they exist in different time zones. They must be tackled together. It will never satisfy people with discerning consciences if it is evident that the first bills to be paid out of the reserves and resources of the Iraqi people are the costs of the war. It will be not acceptable if those who were supportive of the war and who are within the golden circle succeed in winning major contracts, at inflated prices, to rebuild what the Anglo-American forces destroyed. I cannot be a contributor to that concept of sanitised language in a debate about human life, human dignity and humanitarian issues.</P>
    <P>We are also debating the issue of democracy. There is no need to begin each contribution about Iraq with a condemnation of Saddam Hussein because the whole world knew about him. Many of the countries who condemned Saddam Hussein did business with him. Some of the names prominent in advocating the American position may need to have their bank balances examined to determine whether they have been part of that culture of investment in Iraq. If it is the case that the existence of weapons of mass destruction and the reasons that were advanced for the pre-emptive strike have been removed from the agenda and replaced by an assertion that the war was about removing a brutal regime, I can suggest 12 brutal regimes that might be removed. Will the forces that went into Iraq tackle these regimes? If one examines the resources of the countries in question and discovers how much oil they possess, one will then be able to estimate how quick will be the response.</P>
    <P>If I have become cynical during this process, it is because I have been made cynical by the presentation of what has happened in Iraq. The same things, in many ways, happened in Afghanistan. I have said before &ndash; I wish to make this clear &ndash; that I am very pro-America. I regard the US as a sister nation of Ireland; it can never be otherwise. We have learned and gained a great deal from the US and we have also made a major contribution to that country. The United States is always seen as a friend of Ireland, but I query the level of agreement that is to be found in the political administration there. It is particularly noticeable that the Democratic Party in the US has started to raise its head in recent times. Despite the fact that a presidential election is looming, that party is asking questions and querying the approach being taken. I predict that in a few months' time, people in the US will be engaged in a major debate about what they have got themselves into. How will they justify their record in Iraq when other human rights issues arise?</P>
    <P>I will conclude by returning to the humanitarian issue. The Government, in fairness to it, has endeavoured to be generous. It has been gen<Col N="682" />erous in more ways than simply providing financial assistance, for example by arguing with the bigger players. Ireland must argue passionately for this issue to come back centre stage at the United Nations Security Council, which has been severely damaged by this episode. We must not be wimpish in making demands in that regard, as we have to argue the case of humankind in every form.</P>
    <P>I praise the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, whom I rank as one of the top Ministers in relation to humanitarian matters. I have no doubt that people like him will keep their finger on the pulse to ensure that Ireland will adopt a sovereign, independent and humanitarian attitude in relation to this issue at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I rarely speak on foreign affairs issues. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, to the House. As I listened to Senator Ó Murchú, I found that I could not disagree with any of the sentiments he expressed. I do not want to be repetitive in my contribution on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Senator was quite right to point out that debate on this matter has opened up in the United States. The aspiring presidential nominees of the Democratic Party there are beginning to ask questions. The harsh contrast in American politics was evident when the US Administration decided, almost with a gung ho approach, to enter Iraq. Professors, journalists and those involved in pop music were ostracised if they expressed any degree of criticism. A pop group called the Dixie Chicks was removed from the playlists of country and western stations and professors and journalists lost their jobs when they tried to give a balanced view or to express some criticism of what was happening. The US has changed dramatically as a result of the events of 11 September 2001, however, and there was probably an ultra-appreciation of what President George Bush was doing.</P>
      <P>Many of the comments made in this House today are quite true. I agree with Senator Lydon's comments about the decision of the American and British Governments to act on the basis of the existence of weapons of mass destruction. Various speakers in both Chambers have spoken about this issue and used the term &ldquo;weapons of mass destruction&rdquo;. It was almost as if this mantra was being used as a form of justification for going into Iraq. Dr. Blix and his team of inspectors were in Iraq for about three and a half months. They needed more time but they were not given it. Dr. Blix did not succeed in finding weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>I wish to look back at the Saddam Hussein regime. Sanctions prevailed in Iraq for over 12 years. I recall that it was argued during many debates in this House that the sanctions on medicines and hospital aid should be lifted. They were part of the overall umbrella of sanctions. How many people lost their lives over the 12-year period because they did not have the basic medical supports they required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" />The Iraqi economy was also in decline at this time. We know that Saddam Hussein was a dictator and that he salted away millions, but he was probably no different from many other dictators who are in power in African countries. Although the same things are happening in such countries, most African countries do not have the oil deposits to be found in Iraq. Ultimately, this issue was based on the importance of oil to the American economy.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú is correct that at least the Irish media tried to report on the war in Iraq in a balanced manner. It was interesting to read the newspapers at the time, but what was broadcast on some of the international television channels was a sanitised version of events and was very much in favour of the war. The recent debate in Britain on weapons of mass destruction has been interesting. The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, is under a certain amount of pressure to justify the war on that basis and two Ministers have resigned.</P>
    <P>The United States should stop taking such a divisive approach to this issue. Ireland is pro-Europe and France and Germany are our friends, just as the US is. The rhetoric used by Dr. Condoleezza Rice, who is said to have argued that the US should punish France, ignore Germany and forgive Russia, is inflammatory and totally unnecessary. France and Germany took a certain stance, which was consistent with UN policy at the time. The rhetoric and behaviour of Dr. Rice, who is a senior politician in the US, is not helpful at this time. It serves no purpose in the context of the great rebuilding that needs to be done. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Government do not support the rhetoric that is emanating from the US.</P>
    <P>Humanitarian aid is important. The Minister of State has been praised for providing humanitarian aid of &euro;5 million, or £4 million, which is not a significant amount when considered in light of the overall aid which is required in Iraq. A Senator said that one should consider that lovely bridges, which were built in Iraq during the better times, have been bombed out of existence by the US army. A rebuilding process is necessary in that context, but there is a feeling that the contracts will be divvied up among the friends of the Bush regime.</P>
    <P>The most important element of humanitarian aid is the provision of sanitation facilities. The Iraqi health care system has been under siege for many years. Many Irish nurses went to work in a hospital in Baghdad some years ago. CARA was supporting the staffing and the hospital had state-of-the-art facilities. Unfortunately, it was allowed to run down. Sanitation is extremely important. It is tragic to see photographs of children swimming in polluted rivers full of sewage. One can get medication in Ireland if one is suffering from diarrhoea, but diarrhoea in Iraq kills about 70% of young children. Cholera, dysentery and <Col N="684" />typhoid have been mentioned by previous speakers.</P>
    <P>Given that the newspapers have reported that people have been bombed out of existence by cluster bombs in Iraq, I was sickened that the first person President Bush grabbed when he got off the aeroplane in Belfast was a two year old child. I could not reconcile that image with the photographs I had seen in the morning newspapers. If anything, it brought home to me the horror of the war.</P>
    <P>The legacy that has been left behind in Afghanistan has been mentioned. The objective behind the military actions in Afghanistan was to root out Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. While there have been certain successes in rooting out al-Qaeda, nobody knows the whereabouts of bin Laden or Saddam Hussein.</P>
    <P>The Australian Government is giving a great deal of agricultural aid wherever their specialist skills will best operate. Australians are used to farming arid landscapes. I welcome the humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>In fairness, there has been a responsible approach to the Iraqi conflict from this country. This can sometimes be difficult for us because we are very much bedded-in with America, as Senator Ó Murchú mentioned. We have tremendous respect for the American economy. However, sometimes one has to step back and admit that one cannot always run with the pack. One often has to take a detached look at a situation such as this. That is the reason I welcome the comments made in this debate. I also welcome the constructive tenor of the discussion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I particularly welcome the allocation of &euro;5 million announced by him in humanitarian aid for Iraq.</P>
      <P>Other Senators have spoken in regard to the media coverage of the war in Iraq. While they were most responsible and provided good coverage, both on television and in the newspapers, it is regrettable that the coverage has not been as good since the war. The situation has not been reported on to the same extent. I hope it will not be forgotten. As has been mentioned, there was a similar state of affairs in regard to Afghanistan. We all remember the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair's talk of promising a coalition against poverty which we never saw but I hope we will see more humanitarian action in relation to Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the pre-war period <i>Time</i> magazine was the <Col N="685" />first to speculate that the United States and Britain would win the war but might not win the peace. This remains a major question. In many ways the United Nations suffered because it was not centre stage. All of the articles I saw focused on the hostility towards it. It is certainly to be regretted that there is now anti-US and anti-British feeling. They are not perceived as friendly countries because of the war. I hope the United Nations will reassert itself and that we will have more coverage of the current situation in Iraq.</P>
    <P>One of the things I very much welcomed was the lifting of sanctions against Iraq. I spoke in the House on a few occasions in regard to this matter which has been the cause of extreme difficulty for the Iraqi people. The sanctions on drugs and medication, in particular, have caused much hardship. I have spoken previously on the subjects of leukaemia and black fever and the difficulty in obtaining the necessary cocktail of drugs for their treatment. I cannot understand the reason there is still a delay in getting medication into Iraq. There is also a delay in getting flights to the country, restoring electricity and the purification of water.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that while the media coverage is not very good, I saw an article at the weekend in regard to Iraq in which a reporter referred to the quiet roads, the good grub and the welcome to Iraq. In the <i>Irish Independent</i>, journalist, Mr. Mark Steyn, went on to attack the NGO network. He referred to it as the new imperial class: &ldquo;They shuttle across the globe, mingling with their own kind . bringing with them the values of the mother country, or the mother bureaucracy&rdquo;. That type of reporting in which a person just uses the situation to attack NGOs is wrong. I have great personal regard for NGOs.</P>
    <P>When I visited Iraq in January with Deputy Michael D. Higgins, Dominic McSorley from Concern and Ray Jordan from GOAL accompanied us. They were there to talk about the inevitable humanitarian problems when the war was over. I have tried to keep in contact with people whom I met. I know of one Cork student who is working there for 12 years but has, unfortunately, not yet been granted citizenship. However, that is an issue for another Minister. She told me, as recently as yesterday, that electricity was only on for two hours a day in Baghdad and that there were still problems in regard to law and order. People are afraid to go out. They are living in chaos because of the fear of looters and suchlike. All these issues have to be dealt with. As has been mentioned, the situation may deteriorate as the weather gets warmer.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute, in particular, to the NGOs like the Red Cross and Oxfam for the good work they have done. I cannot understand the reason Mr. Steyn referred to the fact that they had met to discuss how they would deal with the question of humanitarian aid and how to get supplies to people. We must remember that out of 26 million people in Iraq before the war, something like 18 million depend on food rations. There is a big <Col N="686" />challenge for the World Food Programme. The Oil for Food Programme must continue. We must ensure supplies are brought to this large number. Senator Finucane referred to the large number of children affected.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate and join in the calls for Irish Embassy officials to be in Baghdad. Activist members of the Ba'ath Party must be brought to justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion which will be agreed on an all-party basis. I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and his officials. I compliment him on the fine speech he delivered, not for the first time on this subject, which distils the best values this country can contribute to the resolution of the problems in the aftermath of the war.</P>
      <P>If one tries to look at this from a half-positive point of view, there is certainly an unprecedented opportunity to deal properly with the humanitarian problems, many of which predate the war. Some are due to sanctions. Frankly, the West cannot be very proud of the way the sanctions operated, accepting also that food aid was distributed in a lop-sided way by the regime. The other condition, apart from the lifting of sanctions, is that a brutal dictatorship is gone. I certainly would not accept &ndash; except perhaps in the very short term &ndash; that the situation, either in Iraq or Afghanistan, is worse than ever. It has to be much better.</P>
      <P>People's attitude to the war, which obviously to a great degree is already made up, is still capable of being influenced and affected by the success or failure of the occupying powers &ndash; undoubtedly, the correct term &ndash; to overcome the humanitarian problems. I do not care greatly which particular firms profit, or do not profit, from the situation, provided they do what is required to rebuild the country quickly and provided that the medical, social and infrastructural problems are properly and effectively addressed.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to divorce this discussion from the ostensible justification, which was not principally humanitarian but revolved around weapons of mass destruction. The questions still hanging in the air are whether the threat was totally exaggerated and whether the evidence was doctored. The work of the UN inspectors was certainly cut short and Dr. Hans Blix remains unhappy about the position. Many of us who dealt with Northern Ireland in the past would have heard a very hollow laugh from the former Northern Ireland Secretary, Dr. John Reid, who once referred to rogue elements in the intelligence services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the Iraqi regime did not help its own case. The mystery is not why it did not use weapons of mass destruction if it possessed them &ndash; because obviously that would have provided an <i>ex post facto</i> justification for the war, as well as inviting massive retaliation &ndash; but why it gave the UN inspectors and the international community the run-around for so long. Perhaps it wanted to keep options open for the future and perhaps it was very difficult for a total<Col N="687" />itarian regime to open up in the way that was required.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out by Senator Ó Murchú and others, there are humanitarian disasters, very nasty dictatorships and conflicts, some of which are fuelled by arms exports, elsewhere in the world. In addition, there are huge problems of governance in some countries. We are still heavily influenced by the habits of the Cold War, which dictate that one cannot influence these situations because otherwise one would be inviting a nuclear holocaust.</P>
    <P>I liked the Minister of State's comment to the effect that &ldquo;The Iraqi people have the inalienable right to a representative government of their own choosing and the sooner this can be achieved the better for everyone.&rdquo; However, it is my view that every people in the world have the right to a representative government and to change that government. Through diplomatic and other pressures, rather than conflict, I hope that over the coming century we can gradually get to a situation where, as the Minister of State said, it will be one of the human rights that everyone will recognise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I would have wished to have heard the debate in the House but that was not possible. From what I have heard, however, I gather that it was interesting, realistic, informative and comprehensive. I would not have thought otherwise because, from the beginning of the conflict in Iraq, the House has been to the fore in expressing its opinions. Some would say that on several occasions those opinions were full-blooded and, if so, why not? Members of the House, regardless of whether they take a party whip, should feel free to express their genuine opinions. I have used the House to that effect and have always found that if one is honest in one's reflections they will be respected by all sides.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the forces currently in Iraq, in addition to the Irish humanitarian aid input, will make a difference in time. As yet, however, the citizens' lot has certainly not improved following the war. I am sure that matters will improve because that is the nature of such events as they unfold. Our thoughts on this matter were, on occasion, somewhat ambiguous because nobody wanted to keep Saddam's reign intact; nobody wanted to leave in place such a villain who was so clearly in defiance of human rights. Most people had figured that out and kept it in mind. Equally, however, there was a sense of dread, shock and awe &ndash; although not in the way we had been told to believe shock and awe would come about when the coalition forces moved in &ndash; that people were prepared to tell us directly what was happening. The use of television and other mass media in war means that people everywhere have a vivid and instant way of knowing what exactly is happening, although it may not amount to a full understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" />For many of us, the abiding idea of those days was summed up in the clear and unambiguous statement that weapons of mass destruction were lying ready for use in Iraq and that war had to be declared or the world would be overcome immediately. That direct appeal was made to those who feared that such events would occur. Many people had such concerns, particularly given what appeared to be the utmost sincerity with which those words were uttered in many television interviews and at various international fora.</P>
    <P>I know that many Senators have made these points during the debate and I apologise for not having been present to hear them. There were Senators from all sides of the House who never believed in the theory, so roundly enunciated, that weapons of mass destruction were awaiting each and every citizen, not of Iraq, but of the world, if they were to be unleashed upon us. We all harbour primitive fears within ourselves and those statements were clearly made to appeal to such fears. Now, however, we are told that it does not really matter and that investigations are under way in the United States and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It is true that if one keeps on talking like that after the event, people will ask one to shut up because the conflict is over. I accept that the conflict is over, but we believe in having sincerity and truth in those who aim to be the leaders of countries. Even after all I have been through in many spheres of public life, I still feel it was wrong to gull people by stating that there was a need to go into Iraq because it possessed weapons of mass destruction. Clearly, such weapons are not there.</P>
    <P>Our hope now is that not only will the humanitarian effort provide food and water, but also that law and order and democracy will return to Iraq so that people will have a way of ruling themselves in a positive way according to their wishes. When power returns to the people, they will have the opportunity of ruling themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound like a Job's comforter, but whether the people in Afghanistan, for example, are better off now. What has happened there and where is the democracy? It will come in time. We can look back at our own history, particularly the Civil War period, and see what came out of it eventually. It is the wish of this Chamber that democracy will eventually rule in Iraq.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, who continues to be a great friend of the Seanad. We always welcome him here because we know that he not only speaks from the script but also from the heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Rourke <Col N="689" />and all the Members who have spoken. I find debates such as this very helpful and enlightening. What represents the best part of this great democracy are the many individual views coming through from various parties, including my own, which I welcome.</P>
      <P>It is clear from my contribution that I did not underestimate the seriousness of the situation. I thank those who noted what I said. I did not underestimate the seriousness of the humanitarian and security situation and the difficulties and challenges ahead in making the transition to democratic and civilian rule. I will go through briefly the issues raised, beginning with the motion.</P>
      <P>From the outset of the conflict the Government recalled repeatedly the obligations and responsibilities of the combatants under international humanitarian law. We accept wholeheartedly the importance of the observance of international and humanitarian law by the occupying powers which have fully accepted their responsibilities and obligations in repeated public statements. UN Security Council Resolution 1483, which the occupying powers supported, called upon all powers to comply fully with their obligations. I agree that the occupying powers should do all in their power to meet their obligations and address the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people. I make one technical point &ndash; the conventions do not contain the language used in the final phrase of the motion.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with those who find it unacceptable that politicians would use the term &ldquo;punish the French&rdquo; or &ldquo;punish anybody&rdquo; in the post-Iraq war situation. As someone who has been involved in international politics for some time, it is not acceptable for any of us in the western world who claim to be committed to promoting democracy, freedom of speech, tolerance or reconciliation in other parts of the world to use this kind of language. I support the Members who made this point. It is a time for tolerance and cool heads and for us to get down to considering the challenges ahead. I am very heartened by the comments made by Senators on this point.</P>
      <P>My commitment is to the humanitarian side. I will cover briefly many of the points made by Senators. I agree strongly that we must serve the needs of the poorest of the poor. The needs to which I am referring are food, water, sanitation and medical treatment. Our focus will be on the basic needs. With regard to infrastructure reconstruction, these areas will be financed in part by the restored oil revenues, rightly so. As many have said, we will do what we do best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree also that other parts of the world are more deserving of our attention. Senator Ó Murchú, in particular, will recall my comments in Ethiopia on its needs. There is the problem of HIV and AIDS in Africa which the Government is committed to resolving, if possible. There is no way we will take our eye off that part of the world because it is nearest and dearest to our hearts. There are still major humanitarian needs to be <Col N="690" />met in Iraq in the short term which I will do everything possible, with my EU colleagues, to address.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised specific questions, including that of immunisation. Obviously, this is an issue of crucial importance. We already support the efforts of the Red Cross and UNICEF in the health sector and the work of NGOs, all of which devote their efforts to preventing the spread of disease in Iraq. It is important that the Senator raised the issue which I will keep in mind.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senators that the occupying powers have a responsibility to protect humanitarian aid workers, the people best positioned to deal with the problem. It is vital to provide international agencies and NGOs with the space to carry out their work. Stable and secure conditions must be established because the situation is still very dangerous and unstable.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned the case of two women scientists. I will certainly make inquiries to see what is known about them. She also spoke about the harvest in the Kurdish area. I will make inquiries because I do not have any details.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford and others referred to Irish Government representation in Iraq. The majority of our EU partners are committed to reopening their offices in Baghdad. The Government is keeping the matter under review and any decision will be strongly influenced by the security situation. No decision has yet been made but the Government will consider the establishment of diplomatic relations with Iraq once an internationally recognised government is in place.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. This debate will be of tremendous help in shaping our foreign policy. I am very conscious that we have a proud independent tradition. This is not the easiest situation for many of us. However, we will do our best and play the part we always play on the humanitarian side and in speaking our mind on how the situation in Iraq should develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised in the context of Senator Terry's amendment was one of a number of options considered during the drafting of this legislation, in consultation with the parliamentary counsel. The convention state which is a party to the agreement annexed to the legislation will be deemed, in the context of the legislation, to be the flag state &ndash; that is, the state where the vessel is registered. It will, therefore, be the only state that can make a request to the Minister for the surrender of the person arrested, the vessel detained or anything seized from a vessel and retained.</P>
      <P>It is clear from section 4 of the Council of Europe Agreement on Illicit Traffic by Sea, which implements Article 17 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, that the flag state is that in which the vessel is registered. I am advised by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel that the amendment tabled by Senator Terry is not required and would only serve to create confusion in the interpretation of the legislation. In other words, the wording used in the amendment is already comprehended in the relevant subsection. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>If the flag state is to receive preferential jurisdiction, should there not be a requirement that the convention or flag state be notified of a vessel arrested or a person on board a vessel arrested, in accordance with section 5? The master of the vessel is entitled to communicate to the convention state, as pursuant to section 4. How otherwise will a convention state be able to make a request for surrender of the person being arrested, the vessel being detained or anything seized from a vessel and retained in accordance with section 7 of the Bill, unless it has received notification from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and has dealt with said notification within two days of the arrest or seizure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, I propose to treat the convention state as the flag state because it assists our discussion to do so. The provisions of the agreement implementing the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances envisage that any actions arising from the implementation of the agreement will be taken without delay. Article 14.2 of the agreement provides that a flag state wishing to exercise preferential jurisdiction shall notify the intervening state to this effect as soon as possible and, at the latest, within 14 days of the receipt of the summary of evidence provided for in Article 13 of the agreement.</P>
      <P>The explanatory report governing the provisions in this agreement specifically states that the time of notification would have to be short, so that any delay would be minimal, particularly in cases where suspected persons are held in custody and would wish to know which state would prosecute them. The prosecutor and the investigating judge have a legitimate interest in knowing in which state the offence would be prosecuted. On the other hand, it would not be in the interests of justice if the time were so short that the flag state would almost automatically claim preferential jurisdiction. It must, therefore, be sufficiently long to enable the flag state to evaluate the summary of evidence and generally assess the situation together with the involved authorities and, quite possibly, ship owners or operators.</P>
      <P>If the amendment, as proposed, was accepted, it would mean that the provisions of the agreement would not be accurately transposed into our law. The question of difficulties of the interpretation of the agreement with other states would arise, in view of the spirit in which this maximum 14-day time limit for the notification of the exercise of preferential jurisdiction was agreed.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Terry for raising the issue and for giving me an opportunity to put the matter on the record of the House. However, the view of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that the 14-day limit reflects the spirit in which the agreement was concluded and, therefore, it is being transposed into our legislation in the way outlined. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The other amendment to section 7 tabled by Senator Terry suggests that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should communicate with the authorities of the convention state &ndash; the flag state &ndash; in the obverse circumstance. Section 7 deals with request from the convention or flag state for the surrender of persons and vessels in accordance with Article 15 of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where such requests are for the surrender of arrested persons they shall be supported in accordance with Article 15.2 by, in respect of each person, the original or a certified copy of the warrant of arrest or other order having the same effect, issued by a judicial authority in accordance without the procedure prescribed by the law of <Col N="693" />the flag state. The explanatory report governing the provisions in this agreement specifically indicate that the committee considered that the warrant of arrest would normally contain detailed information with regard to the charges against the detained persons. The right of the accused to know such charges would in any case be covered by the law of the flag state when it had exercised the preferential jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry's amendment deals with the process prior to requests for surrender being made. This issue will already have been dealt with at the stage the request is being made. It is not appropriate for inclusion in this section of the Bill. In any case, Article 13.1 of the agreement requests that a summary of the evidence be transmitted without delay to the flag state. The explanatory report governing the provisions of this agreement interprets &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; as being as soon as the evidence has been gathered and summarised.</P>
    <P>It could arise that the arrests could occur on the high seas, many miles from a port and in stormy conditions whereby a port could not be reached for some time. Accordingly the two days following arrest proposed by Senator Terry would not be appropriate in light of the spirit of what the negotiators of the agreement had in mind. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was advised on the provisions to be included in the Bill by the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel. The advice that this particular proposal was not necessary was taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his response and accept it. Many delays can lead to a lengthy period. Can the Minister of State clarify that &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; would generally mean 14 days? It could be very open-ended. I accept that two days is not sufficient to gather the information.</P>

      <P>The time is 14 days with regard to the first amendment, but I take it the Senator is referring to the second amendment proposed. It is not quantified as such, but when parties are before a court the obligations of natural justice come into play. There is the difficulty of a ship on the high seas in a serious storm and some time away from port. To specify in legislation a time limit after arrest could give rise to many difficulties.</P>
      <P>Apart from the conventional position, most systems of judicature require that a person or ship arrested be brought to justice without delay. That is a feature of general jurisprudence, but our advice was that it was not necessary to incorporate that in this legislation in terms of an express time limit after arrest.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(<i>d</i>) inform the person of the evidence preferred against them by providing a summary of the evidence that it is proposed to give to the Convention State,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This may have been dealt with already at an earlier section. The amendment is to provide the person who has been arrested with the summary of the evidence which is to be given to the convention state. Is that the norm? The arrested person should be entitled to a summary of the evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for a person arrested under the terms of the agreement to be brought before the High Court as soon as possible. That partly addresses the point made on the earlier section by the Senator.</P>
      <P>Section 9(2) of the Bill provides that the court in making an order committing an arrested person to prison will inform the arrested person of a range of matters. These include the fact that he or she will not be surrendered except with his or her consent until 15 days after committal; the fact that the person may make, or have made on their behalf, a complaint to the court concerning their unlawful detention in accordance with Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution; the fact that the person may if he or she is not surrendered be liable to proceedings in the State arising out of the circumstances which led to or followed the arrest.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry's amendment proposes that the person being committed to prison at that stage should also be informed of the evidence proffered against them by providing a summary of the evidence it is proposed to give to the flag state. As indicated already, in accordance with section 5 of the Bill, persons arrested are brought before the High Court as soon as possible following arrest. The court has to be satisfied under section 6 of the Bill that the person has been lawfully arrested, prior to remanding them. The court is not required at that stage to have at its disposal the evidence preferred against the arrested person or a summary of the evidence that is proposed to be given to the convention state.</P>
      <P>As indicated in a response to a previous amendment, Article 13.1 of the agreement requests that a summary of the evidence be transmitted without delay to the flag state. The explanatory report governing the provisions in this agreement interprets &ldquo;without delay&rdquo; as being as soon as the evidence has been gathered and summarised. Accordingly, the proposed amendment by Senator Terry that this material be furnished to the arrested person on their being committed to prison is not what is envisaged as appropriate under the terms of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the arrested person is brought before the High Court, it has to be satisfied that the various statutory matters are met. The question of the <Col N="695" />summary evidence is something that is transmitted to the flag state. That is the first opportunity there. When the person is brought before the High Court, that is the first time they are before a court. It would be unusual in criminal procedure on a first visitation to the court to require the prosecutor to furnish that amount of detail with regard to evidence.</P>

      <P>This amendment is been proposed by my Labour Party colleagues and me, because we believe that the Bill as it stands would allow a detained person to be handed over to foreign agents in the State.

      <P>As Senator Tuffy point out, this matter was raised during the passage of the legislation through the Dáil. The section follows closely the wording of other sections in the legislation that make provision for the surrender of persons. I cite section 33 of the Extradition Act 1965 and section 18 of the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1998. In the case of the corresponding provision in the Extradition Act, this is a long established provision which has been relied on in many cases and has been subject to considerable judicial comment. It is one that the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel believed did not require to be changed. For this reason, as well as for reasons of consistency, it has been replicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will note that section 17(2) of the Bill provides that any person to be surrendered by means of an order arising under section 17(1) may be received, held in custody and conveyed out of the State. This addresses the concerns raised in that the provisions of section 17(1) which are silent in relation to these issues cannot <Col N="696" />be read in isolation from section 17(2) where they are covered. For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that where a person applies for a <i> habeas corpus</i> writ, the court would have to be satisfied that such assurances given that the death penalty would not apply were sufficient. The Minister and the High Court should be required to be satisfied that such assurances given would be sufficient. I would like to hear the Minister of State's reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Senator's amendment is to provide that both the Minister and, in certain circumstances, the High Court should refuse the request for surrender from a convention state which is a party to the agreement. The effect of the proposed amendment would be that the Minister and, at a later stage in the proceedings, the High Court would be required to refuse the request for surrender where the offence for which the person was sought was punishable by the death sentence in that country unless satisfactory assurances that the death penalty would not be carried out were received.</P>
      <P>The wording in the Bill is based on the premise that it is important that where the death penalty may be an issue, the process should be stopped at the earliest possible stage before the matter has developed. The right to refuse surrender unless certain assurances are given should, therefore, be dealt with at the initial stage when the request for surrender is received by the Minister and before he or she certifies accordingly to the High Court in accordance with section 8. In this way, unnecessary court proceedings would be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording follows the precedent of section 19 of the Extradition Act 1965. The amendment would result in duplication and cross over the lines of the doctrine of the separation of powers. The Minister is dealing with an administrative matter and there would be no added benefit in accepting the amendment which could have the effect of delaying proceedings. It is out of line with existing legislative provisions in regard to the matter. This right that the Minister has is entirely without prejudice to the constitutional right any detained person always has to invoke <Col N="697" />the protection of the High Court in relation to unlawful custody.</P>

      <P>On the point the Senator raised on the section, there is cast upon the Minister a legal obligation. Therefore, there is no suggestion that in refusing this amendment we are seeking to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts &ndash; far from it. The courts would always have jurisdiction in a matter of this character were the Minister to be in breach of his duties but the point made is that this matter is addressed at an administrative stage on receipt of the request and before it has proceeded to a judicial phase. That is the form of the legislation which is in accordance with our practice in analogous statutory provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a position to at least deal with the point raised by the Senator. She is concerned about that the presence of the words &ldquo;prevent or&rdquo; in the relevant subsection and considers that they would be better deleted from the legislation. This refers to section 4, page 4, subsection (2), line 33.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised in the other House. The wording contained in section 4(2) derives from Article 11.4 of the agreement which provides that the master of a vessel boarded under the agreement shall be entitled to communicate with the authorities of the vessel's flag state as well as with the owners or operators of a vessel for the purpose of notifying them that the vessel has been boarded. The article also provides that the authorities of the intervening state may prevent or delay any communication with the owners or operators of the vessel if they have reasonable grounds for believing that such communication would obstruct the investigations into the relevant offence. This could arise in a number of circumstances. For example, the master of a vessel, having discussed the matter with the owners or operators, could issue instructions to crew members or take immediate action which would have the effect of interfering with, damaging or destroying evidence required for the investigation or prosecution purposes before it could be secured by enforcement officers. The prevention of radio or other communication would be important in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At some stage it could be the case that while prevention may be necessary, it could be argued that it should not be necessary forever but in these circumstances the provision in the Bill to prevent or delay communication is complementary. It is important to note that section 4 reflects the explicit provisions in the international agreement. The international phrase is &ldquo;prevent or delay&rdquo;. Therefore, were the amendment to be moved and accepted, we would be in a position <Col N="699" />where we would not have an accurate transposition in our law of the international agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members of the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to outline details of some of the initiatives that have been taken in recent years by this and the previous Government to enhance the level of support available to people with autism. The main areas on which I intend to speak relate to the health-funded services for people with autistic spectrum disorders and the educational services that come within the remit of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>The philosophy underpinning the planning and delivery of services to people with disabilities, including those with autistic spectrum disorders, is that people with disabilities should be given the opportunity to live as full a life as possible and to live with their families and as part of their communities for as long as possible. Factors influencing current policy include the health strategy, Quality and Fairness, which was published in November 2001, and Government policy on the mainstreaming of services for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Policy must also be underpinned by appropriate structures that facilitate access to and delivery of support services. As part of the planning structures in place, health boards have been working at regional and local level with families of people with autism and service providers to identify needs and plan responses that will meet them.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science makes educational provision for children with special needs in three ways: in special schools, special classes attached to ordinary schools, and integrated settings, in other words, integrated into mainstream classes. The main basis for provision is the assessed need of the individual child. The policy of the Department of Education and Science is to achieve as much integration as possible and also to take account of the views of parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 108 special schools and more than 500 special classes are attached to ordinary schools. Both special schools and special classes enjoy <Col N="700" />lower pupil-teacher ratios, the ratio depending on the specific disability for which the school or class caters. These schools and classes are also supported by the allocation of special needs assistants and additional capitation funding.</P>
    <P>Since the Government decision in October 1998 that all children with special needs in the primary system should receive an automatic response to their needs, there has been significant expansion in provision for children with special needs in integrated settings in ordinary national schools. The significance of this expansion can be gauged from the increase in the number of resource teachers which, between 1998 and now, rose from about 100 to more than 2,300. Similarly, in the case of special needs assistants, numbers have risen from about 300 to almost 5,000. In recent years and in line with these developments, the Department has also increased provision for in-career training in the area of special needs.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science also provides other services for children with special needs, such as a home tuition service which is designed to cater for children who, because of their disability or illness, are unable to attend school for prolonged periods. In addition, the Department provides special equipment for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>There has been significant investment in support services for people with physical, sensory or intellectual disabilities and those with autistic spectrum disorders. Since 1997, additional funding of about &euro;555 million has been invested in these services, of which almost &euro;340 million was allocated to services for persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability. Between 2000 and 2002, for example, the additional funding provided for these services was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential places, about 380 new respite places and about 2,000 new day places.</P>
    <P>More than &euro;15 million has been invested in health-related support services for children with autistic spectrum disorders and those with intellectual disability. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of schoolgoing age. Some &euro;6.35 million of this funding was specifically targeted for services for children with autistic spectrum disorders, with the balance for both the autism and intellectual disability services.</P>
    <P>There has been an increased emphasis in the health services on in-career training, some of which is provided by staff working within the services. The Department of Health and Children and the Eastern Regional Health Authority have provided funding towards the development of an e-learning module for health professionals which is being developed by Trinity College.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children also supports the development, in partnership with the North Eastern Health Board, ERHA, Aspire, <Col N="701" />Irish Autism Alliance and the Social Communications Disorders Group, of a computerised social skills programme for adolescents with Asperger's syndrome or high functioning autism. It is intended that this training programme, when completed, will be made available to professionals and parents to assist them in working with this group. Training for families, including siblings, is also an area the health services would like to see expanded.</P>
    <P>While this major new investment programme over recent years has undoubtedly made a significant impact on the level of service provision, it is accepted that a sustained programme of further investment is required if we are to provide the level of support identified as required to meet the needs of people with disabilities. In addition to resources, other factors must also be in place to deliver quality and effective services designed to meet individual needs, some of which I will seek to address later.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of developments in the provision of an automatic response to children with autism. Since 1998, the Department of Education and Science has created some 115 classes for children with autism in ordinary national schools and special schools. These classes operate with a minimum staffing of one teacher and two special needs assistants for every six children. However, that level can be augmented depending on the needs of the individual children.</P>
    <P>The Department has also funded a number of stand-alone units that are not integrated into ordinary national schools. Support for these units was committed on a pilot basis. The first was established in Cork in 1999 and is known as CABAS Cork. Since then, further projects have been established in Kill, County Kildare, and Kilbarrack in Dublin. The Department's inspectorate has undertaken an inspection of these units as well as of other autism specific provision in the system to inform development of future policy and to assist in the development of best practice.</P>
    <P>The report of the task force on autism, published by the Minister for Education and Science in late 2001, contains many recommendations which, when fully implemented, will further improve provision for both children with autism, high functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome and their parents.  The principles associated with the task force recommendations would also apply to children with other special needs and their parents. It has been widely acknowledged that until the automatic response decision in 1998, the level of resources applied to special needs was not what it should have been. However, as in the case of the health services, the issue is not just resources. There have been weaknesses in the structures for the delivery of special education services and also in the wider legislative framework within which such services are delivered.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the provision of additional resources, while extremely important in the context of delivering an enhanced level of support to <Col N="702" />people with autistic spectrum disorders and other people with disabilities, is not the only response required. There is also a need to look at the structures which underpin the delivery of those supports.</P>
    <P>It is essential that my Department can access data at national level in respect of people with disabilities who are accessing health services or may have a need to do so in the future. A national database can inform planning, service development, the prioritisation of service needs and resource allocation at national, regional and local level. The information from the national intellectual disability database played a key role in accessing the additional funding which has been made available in recent years. My Department, in conjunction with the health boards and the voluntary sector, is currently implementing a national physical and sensory disability database. While some persons with autism who also have an intellectual disability are included on the national intellectual disability database, it does not contain information on this group as a whole. While the database provides information in respect of the level of services being provided and current and future needs, it does not identify persons with specific disabilities such as Down's syndrome or autism. Its principal role is as a planning and monitoring instrument.</P>
    <P>Initial work was carried out during 2002 on the development of an information system which would give a level of information on the needs of persons with autism similar to that already available from the national intellectual disability database. This work is being continued during 2003 and consultation will take place with the health boards, service providers and persons with autism and their families.</P>
    <P>My Department will work closely with the Department of Education and Science on the information requirements of the new National Special Education Council. There has been, as I have already stated, a significant programme of new investment in services, including early services. The health boards are in the process of developing regional autism diagnostic, assessment and support teams. These are at different stages of development. The availability of these teams, together with input from other areas of expertise, will facilitate the move towards more uniformity regarding diagnostic and assessment services in general.</P>
    <P>One of the major difficulties facing the health service in delivering support services to people with disabilities and those in other areas of the service is the shortage of certain professionals such as speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Progress has been made in this area and also in implementing the recommendation made in the Bacon report on manpower planning. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places in line with the recommendations of the report, Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the <Col N="703" />Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, prepared by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates and published in June 2001. The report concluded that a major expansion was essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years, comprising an increase of over 150% in occupational therapists and a fourfold increase in speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>On 29 May 2002, the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children announced some additional therapy training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapists. The University of Limerick is to offer 25 places on a Master of Science programme in occupational therapy and 25 places in speech and language therapy. NUI Cork is to offer 25 places on a Bachelor of Science programme in occupational therapy and 25 places in speech and language therapy. NUI Galway is to offer 25 places on its programme leading to a BSc in occupational therapy and 25 places in speech and language therapy. The colleges have been working intensively to plan the provision of the speech and language and occupational therapy courses. Efforts have been made to recruit services and personnel and the recruitment of staff is well advanced. There has also been communication with the relevant professional bodies to ensure that the proposed programmes are accredited.</P>
    <P>Following the joint announcement in May 2002, the Bachelor of Science in physiotherapy in the University of Limerick commenced in the 2002-03 academic year with an intake of 28 students. It is envisaged that the masters programmes in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy at the University of Limerick will commence in June 2003 with an intake of 25 into both courses. These courses are accelerated conversion courses, the first graduates of which will be produced in two years. NUI Cork has made provision for a CAO entry in September, 2003 for both the Bachelor of Science course in occupational therapy, which has 25 places, and the Bachelor of Science course in speech and language therapy, which has 25 places. The option of a programme to allow students with suitable backgrounds to enter into the second year of a degree programme in October 2003 is currently being considered.</P>
    <P>NUI Galway plans to commence its intake of students into both programmes &ndash; the Bachelor of Science course in occupational therapy, with 25 places, and the Bachelor of Science course in speech and language therapy, with 25 places &ndash; in September 2003. NUIG is also investigating the possibility of accepting suitable students into the second years of the programmes in September 2003. In addition, the universities which are already offering degree courses in these specialities have increased the number of places being offered in the past number of years. The occupational therapy course in Trinity College increased its intake from 30 to 35 students in the 2000-01 academic year and further increased its <Col N="704" />intake in the 2001-02 academic year to 41 students. A total of 40 students were accepted in 2002-03. The speech and language therapy course in TCD enrolled 26 students in 2000, this increased to 32 in 2001 and 29 were accepted in 2002.</P>
    <P>Intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, both at local and national level. One development has been the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert group on various health professions &ndash; developments to date include the introduction of common pay scales for the therapy professions and pay structures. There have also been changes to the career structure, including the introduction of the post of clinical specialist, and many other posts have been upgraded from basic to senior level in line with the recommendations of the expert group. Management grades have been restructured and the focus on broader management issues has increased.</P>
    <P>Other developments have been the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the planned significant expansion in the number of training places in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy referred to above. The success of these measures is reflected in the increase in the numbers of speech and language therapists and occupational therapists employed in the public health service over the three-year period to the end of 2002.</P>
    <P>In 1999, for example, 371 occupational therapists were employed by the health services, but three years later in 2002 there were 642 occupational therapists. This represents a percentage increase of 73% over three years. In 1999 there were 345 speech and language therapists; three years later, in 2002, there were 460 employed by the health boards, which represents an increase of 33%. A concerted recruitment drive for the therapy grades is currently being conducted on behalf of all the health boards by the Northern Area Health Board. This has resulted, to date, in the recruitment of 20 occupational therapists and eight speech and language therapists.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services in March 2002, a major priority for the Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied, in particular, to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.</P>
    <P>Given the key role of the Health Boards Executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development <Col N="705" />in the health service, the Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations in the report. The current position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of giving individual consideration to the recommendations contained in the report and to how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process over a period.</P>
    <P>My Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional postgraduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase from the end of 1999 to the end of 2002 &ndash; from 26 to 83 &ndash; in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. This development in enhancing graduate output will help maintain an improved balance between demand and supply in human resource and service provision.</P>
    <P>The Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services as detailed in the joint review group's report and the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the action plan for people management published in November 2002. A particular priority is to ensure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the significant financial resources currently being invested in the health services to support post-graduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, the Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, is examining the current model for post-graduate psychology training, with the objective of supporting training provision on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis.</P>
    <P>At present, there are approximately 105 clinical psychologists undertaking postgraduate training in the State. Over 60 students are enrolled on the Psychological Society of Ireland's clinical psychologist postgraduate training diploma. A total of 24 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at Trinity College &ndash; 12 in first year and 12 in second year &ndash; and 19 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at UCD &ndash; ten in second year and nine in third year. It is understood that both the National University of Ireland, Galway, and the University of Limerick have plans to introduce doctoral programmes in clinical psychology in 2003, with an intake of a further 20 students in total. There has been a significant increase in excess of 40% &ndash; an increase of 121 to 412 over the three years to the end of 2002 &ndash; in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service. This <Col N="706" />has contributed to a significant increase in the volume of psychological services provided.</P>
    <P>In addition to measures to increase the supply of psychologists through the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review report, other efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in the psychological services, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the recruitment of psychologists from overseas by the health boards, the introduction of a fast-track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the devolution of responsibility for recruitment of basic grade psychologist posts to health boards from the Local Appointments Commission. Ongoing pay enhancements through the implementation of the recommendations of the public service benchmarking body will make a further contribution to reducing current vacancy levels by increasing the attractiveness of employment as a clinical psychologist in the health services.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has been aware that its capacity to respond administratively to demands for special education services has been limited in some respects. For this reason, as Senators will be aware, the Department has decided to establish a national council for special education. The intention is that the council will fulfil a number of functions. First, it will provide advice to the Minister on responses and provision for children with special education needs. In addition, it will provide a local presence on the ground in the form of special education needs organisers who will be charged with drawing together provision for children with educational needs. The council will also provide a vehicle for dissemination of information and guidance on best practice in relation to responses to special needs. It is intended that, associated with the council, there will be an appellate structure to enable parents to appeal in relation to responses to the special educational needs of their children. It is also intended that the council will be established initially by an order under the Education Act 1998. The council will subsequently be catered for in primary legislation when the new education for persons with disabilities Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002 which, in the lifetime of the previous Government, had been passed by the Seanad, was not reintroduced by the current Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who was anxious that a further period of consultation would be facilitated to allow interested groups and parties to make submissions on the legislation. That process was completed and the new Bill is now at an advanced stage of interdepartmental consultation with a view to early approval by Government and publication.</P>
    <P>The Government regards these more fundamental structural and legislative reforms as the key to enabling improvement in delivery of ser<Col N="707" />vices for children with special needs and their parents. It is intended the new education for persons with disabilities Bill will cover the range of issues including assessment, responsibility for provision, appeal processes, individual education plans and so on. In drafting the Bill, the Department of Education and Science is attempting to clarify how the needs of individual children should be met, both by the education and health services. Clearly the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science need to work together at the macro level with a view to ensuring that we have &ldquo;joined-up Government&rdquo; in terms of development of policy in respect of responses and the resourcing of services for children with special needs. Equally, at local level, there are issues whereby health boards, service providers and education services can operate in an integrated way. Clearly, the Department of Education and Science's capacity to work in an integrated way on the ground locally is very limited at present. For this reason, the national council for special education will be particularly critical in enabling integrated responses to be pulled together at local level.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has been doing a significant amount of work in terms of producing procedures and structures which will enable close co-operation to take place between NEPS and the health boards. In establishing new structures and putting in place agreed operational protocols, particular regard will be given to information dissemination so that parents of children with autism will not have the additional burden of not knowing where to turn for particular services.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that while many advances have been made in recent years, much still remains to be achieved. However, progress can best be made through partnership, whether this is at national, regional or local level. While both the health services and the educational services have worked together over the years to deliver appropriate support to children with special needs, these efforts will undoubtedly be greatly assisted by the new legislation, the establishment of the National Council for Special Education and the increased availability of allied health professionals. These measures will also assist families to access the support which they require.</P>
    <P>The availability of improved information, together with the ability to specifically target resources at agreed priority needs, will enable both children and adults with autism to receive the support which they require as they move through the various stages of life. It is in this spirit that the Department of Health and Children looks forward to the many changes &ndash; legislative, structural and service related &ndash; which will undoubtedly take place over the coming months and years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for a detailed and informative speech.</P>
      <P>Staff recruitment and retention is a major difficulty facing the health boards in many areas, including services for people with autism. I spoke here less than two months ago about the recruitment of a senior orthodontist in County Roscommon. While I accept that the Western Health Board advertised this position, there was nobody to take it up. This is a serious problem in rural areas such as Roscommon. I do not know the answer, but it is a problem which must be addressed sooner rather than later. I understand there was funding for the post but, unfortunately, at this stage the health board does not have a senior orthodontist who will deal with children with special needs.</P>
      <P>While I acknowledge a lot has been done, much remains to be achieved. I do accept that progress can best be achieved through partnership at national, regional and local level.</P>
      <P>According to the Task Force Report on autism of November 2001, &ldquo;The litmus test for the quality of any society is the way it treats its potentially most vulnerable members.&rdquo; Cutbacks will undermine the aspirations of any Government. The Minister of State may call them adjustments, but they are cutbacks. It is indicative of the way we are failing this group that a number of those vulnerable members of our society and their carers and parents had to make the journey to the gates of the Dáil yesterday in an attempt to have their case heard. We heard them talk of the shortfalls in funding and the cutbacks experienced this year. While we accept progress was made, we hear their representatives talk of reverses and of returning to the position of a number of years ago, rather than making progress. This reversal is not isolated; it is the same story nationwide. In county Roscommon, a particular project in this area had funding of &euro;50,000 for a service in Roscommon town in 2002, but this year there is no funding. We cannot carry on the same service by giving funding one year and then withdrawing it the next.</P>
      <P>There is also the situation of a person requiring specialist intensive care. As the Minister of State will be aware, such care is costly and staff intensive, but it has to be done. With the funding being siphoned from other necessary, if not so acute, areas, a person who wants a quality service must pay for it. People no longer accept that those with a disability should just be minded.</P>
      <P>In Roscommon there is also no diagnostic team. Early diagnosis is an essential element in the care and treatment of disability. It is a recurring theme in these services that there is great difficulty &ndash; if not impossibility &ndash; in acquiring the necessary specialists such as speech therapists, psychologists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists. I will refer to the urgent need to improve our training provisions for these later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a great need to support those who care for people generally and for those who sup<Col N="709" />port people with a disability in particular. Parents are entitled to the respite services that will improve their quality of life. This is another of the urgent demands in rural counties such as Roscommon and, I am sure, elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Yesterday there was confusion in the Dáil following the Government's lame response trotted out about increases in the last five years, which we have heard again, as if we should stand up and applaud them for disbursing taxpayers' money and doing what was required in this area of great need and distress. On the question of the status of the Disability Bill, there appeared to be widespread confusion, with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, echoing the Taoiseach's uncertainty as to its status and progress on yesterday's evening news. This can hardly bring much solace to those who participated in the awareness exercise outside the House yesterday.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for people who have no immediate or personal experience of autism, or of people with disability or special needs, to comprehend the great pressures on those families directly involved. Autism is a rare condition, which is characterised by what is called a triad of impairments: difficulty with developing imagination, difficulty with verbal and non-verbal communication and difficulty with social relationships. It affects about one in 700 newborn children and three out of four people who suffer from autism are male. There are approximately 1,950 children and adults with autism in Ireland. It can be suspected as early as a few weeks or months after birth, or not until the age of two or two and a half. What I find unusual, from a physical view, is that people with autism look perfectly normal and understandably this can often lead to difficulty in diagnosing the condition.</P>
    <P>It was in the early 1940s that the first papers identifying autistic children as a group were published by researchers Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger. A great deal of research has been done since then and has focused on the best methods of education and assimilation of children on what is referred to as &ldquo;the autistic spectrum&rdquo;. This research focuses on early intervention, intensive resources and personnel, intensive emphasis on visual education and realistic training.</P>
    <P>The provision of trained personnel and good education facilities is the key to the education of these citizens with autism. There is great difficulty in recruiting the necessary professionals in the vital area of disability support. Why can we not train an adequate number of people for the specialist areas? Although I hear that they are now being trained, why are we discussing this today? There is a great need for an increase in services, particularly for the assessment of children, speech therapy, psychology services, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, although I accept that the Minister of State's figures are bone fide and that there have been increases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" />As I outlined, many vacancies exist despite the efforts made to fill the posts. Why are we unable to train the numbers required for our own health services? There are people coming in from South Africa and from various other countries where we are trying to recruit personnel. Why has there been such a shortfall in the recruitment of experienced people? People of the required quality are certainly coming out of second level education and Ireland has for decades exported some of the best health care workers to be met anywhere. This is an amazing problem. From my personal experience, I know of people who are admirably suited and have tried to get training positions but cannot do so for a variety of reasons. A study published in July 2002 dealt with the future shortages and requirements regarding certain health care professionals and how this could be dealt with. I wonder if the recommendation of a major expansion in the training of each of the therapy grades has made any progress.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to explain that we appear to be incapable of providing services to those with special needs, to their parents and to the caring professions. This is particularly poignant at a time when we are hosting the Special Olympics. We seem to have failed the people whom we will be celebrating in the next weeks.</P>
    <P>In October 2000, Deputy Michael Woods, then Minister for Education, established a task force to investigate all aspects of autism care provision and make recommendations. This report was published in November 2001. The task force was chaired by Dr. Sheelagh Drudy, professor of education in UCD. The committee retained an independent line and made an admirable study of the issues involved, receiving submissions from numerous sources both in Ireland and from outside.</P>
    <P>The report was critical of the level of provision for autistic children. It covers a range of issues focusing on the educational needs, which naturally it sees as the benchmark for progress in this area. It also deals in depth with the area of assessment, especially early assessment. It is difficult for us to understand the trauma encountered by many parents as they are shunted from one professional area to another and in some cases almost dismissed. The recommendations in the report are a template for progress and intervention in the care of autism and the supports necessary for the families involved. It recommends that there should be constitutional reform to entitle thousands of special needs children to a proper education.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that a most vulnerable section of our society should have to go through the courts to assert their rights. The work done by Kathryn Sinnott in securing rights for her son, Jamie, has been heroic and has highlighted this area of neglect. Her work has advanced their cause in the face of generations of lack of understanding and neglect for which we are all culpable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="711" />The task force report also focuses on the primary role of the parents as educators of their children as guaranteed by the Constitution. It highlights the sometimes shabby treatment of parents of children with special needs, as when parents were excluded from discussions on their children by professionals dealing with them, as if their input were peripheral. The proper involvement of parents in these issues is essential.</P>
    <P>It was the view of Kathryn Synnott that only a constitutional amendment would ultimately guarantee the rights of her son, Jamie, and others. The report seeks &ldquo;a more solid legal base for legislation in this area&rdquo; with &ldquo;education for all regardless of difference&rdquo;. The then Minister promised to set up a new council for special education which would intervene with special needs providers if parents felt they were not getting the services they needed. A disability bill was also being prepared.</P>
    <P>Autism is referred to in the task force report as autism spectrum disorder or ASD. The report states that the capacity of current provision and resources has been and is critically unable to meet the needs of all children with ASD in Ireland and that extensive strategic and practical changes are necessary to secure a range of provisions. The creation of a national council for special needs education and the devolution of administration to regional special needs organisations are recommended.</P>
    <P>In 1996, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities emphasised that special education is a service, not a place, and that parents should be fully involved in any education intervention. A good outcome is generally defined in terms of reaching full potential and an appropriate level of independence and social competence through acceptance within society. Appropriate educational intervention is seen as the major positive response and not hospital placement, as in times past.</P>
    <P>Some legislation is very relevant to people with disability, in particular legislation dealing with health and education. The Education Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 1997 are important. The Freedom of Information Act has been curtailed by this Government, which means that necessary information may not be available and the critical area of disability may be impinged upon. While I could not accuse anyone of being so heartless as not to wish to cement the progress which is undoubtedly being made, there is a lot more to do to enable us as a society to pass the litmus test of treating our most vulnerable members in a caring and valuable way. I agree with the Minister of State that it is a difficult brief but more funding is required and cutbacks will not help his case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He said in his concluding remarks that while many advances have been made in recent years, much remains to be achieved. Much has <Col N="712" />been achieved but equally, much remains to be done. When we speak about people with autism we are talking about the most vulnerable people in society. It behoves us all, especially those of us who are elected representatives, to use that position to best effect to ensure the provision of the optimum services for those people.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Feighan's point regarding the training of appropriate professional staff. There has been a difficulty in recruiting such staff. Career guidance teachers can play a pivotal role in this regard by encouraging young people to pursue such occupations. That might alleviate the situation somewhat. There is a shortage of professional staff in the medical, nursing and paramedical areas.</P>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services has been difficult. I am pleased to inform the House that in the case of my health board, the corner has been turned. I am sure Senator Bannon will agree with me when I record our appreciation of the contribution of Dr. David Hegarty.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, approximately 1,700 additional residential places, mainly community-based, have been provided. This figure includes new residential respite places developed between 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, approximately 465 residential places were provided. Children with autism require special care and they demand additional attention. In families with other children, respite care helps relieve stress and it is imperative that appropriate respite care is provided for families with an autistic member.</P>
      <P>Between 1997 and 2002, additional revenue and funding, amounting to just under &euro;327 million &ndash; revenue of &euro;188 million and capital of &euro;139 million &ndash; was provided for the maintenance and development of services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. The national intellectual disability database indicated that in 1996, 85.5% of those with an intellectual disability, or 22,804 persons, were known to be in receipt of services. This figure had increased to 89.8%, or 24,035 persons, by 2000. We do not plan to slip a disc by slapping ourselves on the back. While we have made great strides, much needs to be done, as the Minister of State has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Midland Health Board, of which I am a member, allocated over &euro;2 million between 2000 and 2003 towards the development of services for persons with autism residing in its catchment area. A total of 14.5 posts have been approved and funded for a regional multidisciplinary specialist team. A regional respite care facility at Charleville Cottage, Tullamore and a regional community based residential and day facility based in County Longford, in Senator Bannon's locality, were commissioned in 2002. These facilities are partnership initiatives between the Midland Health Board and Rehab. The health board has two consultant psychiatrists &ndash; one for children and one for adults &ndash; with a special interest in intellectual disability and autism. The board provides a range of community and home support <Col N="713" />services for families of children with autism. Additional funding of &euro;290,000 was provided for these services in 2003. A sum of &euro;240,000 was allocated towards the regional respite facility in Tullamore and &euro;50,000 was provided for a therapist for the regional multidisciplinary team.</P>
    <P>In the context of planning services for persons with autism and in the absence of reliable studies of the prevalence of autism in Ireland, the Midland Health Board commissioned the National Research Agency to undertake a review of current service provision in the health board area. This exercise will inform the future development of services. The number of children in the health board area with autistic spectrum disorder ranges between 139 and 144, between 75 and 82 of whom have also been diagnosed with an intellectual disability. The study also identified 126 adults with autistic spectrum disorder. It would be remiss of us, at this point, not to highlight the great work being done by parents, friends of the mentally handicapped and the many groups working in this area.</P>
    <P>Approximately &euro;14.6 million has been allocated since 1998 to enhance the early intervention, pre-school and multidisciplinary support services for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. It is regrettable that such persons were treated in psychiatric hospitals. I am pleased that their reallocation to appropriate settings and locations is continuing. If one person with autism is left in a psychiatric hospital, it is one too many. As somebody who worked in such services for many years, I regret to say the setting was most inappropriate to the needs of such persons. It is a monument of shame to successive Governments that this was allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of &euro;11.43 million was provided for health boards between 1999 and 2002 to enable them to put in place a range of support services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism who present with major behavioural problems and require a more intensive level of support. This is an important provision, as it has helped to advance the care of such persons. We have to admit that more needs to be done, however.</P>
    <P>A programme has been put in place to transfer persons with an intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals or other inappropriate settings. This programme provides alternative placements and/or an enhanced level of services for such persons. The number accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in October 2002 was 452, a decrease from 970 in 1996 and 503 in December 2001. The new accommodation provided has included community based homes and a number of residential and day complexes. Senator Bannon and I, who are members of a health board, always take the opportunity to point out that it is imperative that health boards continue to provide community based services for such persons. I thank the Senator for his support.</P>
    <P>The national monitoring committee, which includes representatives of the Department of <Col N="714" />Health and Children, the Health Research Board, the chief executives of the health boards, the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Intellectual Disability, the National Parents and Siblings Alliance and the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, is also involved in the monitoring of the development of services for persons with autism. It is important that we continue to strive to provide services for those not in a position to provide services for themselves. As colleagues on the other side of the House have said, the great crusades of people like Kathryn Sinnott should be applauded. Ms Sinnott and others have fought ongoing cases over many years to ensure their children can get a break in life. Many people, some of whom are members of large families, have been discarded in the corner of houses for many years. Cases like that of Christopher Nolan, with whose father I served as a staff nurse at St. Loman's Hospital, have proved that such people can have a very high level of intelligence. If the belated interest in this subject, which has manifested itself in this and other debates, contributes to better services for persons with autism, so be it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Leader for providing an hour and a half for this debate, in response to a request I made to her. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, for coming to the House to give us a comprehensive reply to some of the statements that have been made. I do not believe his speech was adequate, however, as it read like many of the presentations made to the Joint Committee on Health and Children some time ago. The presentations were defensive, somewhat self-congratulatory and did not hold out any particular hopes or projections for the future. It should be acknowledged that successive Governments have done a great deal for people with special needs but this debate is about autism. I had hoped the Minister of State's contribution would provide a great deal of information about the numbers of autistic children and adults, the projections the Department feels are appropriate for the future, costs and the measures that could or should be taken. Such details were singularly lacking in his statement. I admit that such information is difficult, if not impossible, to gather but it would be helpful if some realistic estimates could be obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one is dealing with autism, one encounters problems such as a denial of its existence, a lack of acknowledgement of the problems involved and faulty diagnosis. I suspect that the fact that the numbers diagnosed with autism are <Col N="715" />increasing all the time can be attributed to increases in the accuracy of the systems of diagnosis. It is only now that we are beginning to discover the large extent of this problem. Many children and adults with autism were not aware of it for a very long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's reply, while it points us in the direction of past realisation of this problem, is very much a departmental brief. The words, &ldquo;my Department&rdquo; appear in it so often that one becomes suspicious that it is not written by a Minister. It is also somewhat defensive. What I would have liked to hear would have been something more hopeful for the future but we did not get that.</P>
    <P>Any suggestion that the resources are not there is unacceptable so long as the Government &ndash; this is a political point &ndash; the Members of this House and the public service are paid such vast sums of money in unjustifiable increases. It is simply unacceptable, when benchmarking is accepted by all parties that the same parties say money is not available for children with problems of this sort. It is the unacceptable face of a Government giving money to itself, its Ministers and Members of this House when other people are suffering in a way which could be relieved by those same people. That is something which we have to face. Moral issues are still there in our society and it behoves Ministers to face and be challenged by these particular types of moral issues. It is unacceptable for people who are well paid to say that the resources are not available when they are benefiting from those same resources.</P>
    <P>Nobody could have sat on the committee which I attended, as did Senator Henry, without being impressed by Kathy Sinnott. It is very different for us to discuss it in the abstract and to talk about statistics and the magnificent job which the Government and the universities have done in providing more therapists, more undergraduates, more degrees, more qualifications. It does not read like that on the ground. One only has to talk to people who have autistic children. They do not say things are getting better. They say that, if anything, things are getting worse, that there is a complete lack of acknowledgement by the authorities of the real problems which parents and children have to face &ndash; but particularly parents, because they realise what is going on. They may have politicians and all sorts of organisations and Departments coming back to them, but the situation for them on the ground is not a great deal better than it was.</P>
    <P>I gather, based on anecdotal evidence, that the problem is first manifest in very young children. In spite of that, it takes weeks, months and even years for the parent of a child who is suspected of being autistic even to get an appointment. That is the reality. One can create any number of graduates and pay the Government all this money, but it is useless if one cannot produce people to assess autistic or potentially autistic children. This increases the anxiety for parents. <Col N="716" />That is the first resort and the problem has, apparently, not been resolved.</P>
    <P>It is no good saying that these things are being resolved in structural ways. It is just not happening on the ground for the people concerned. In California they say that if you catch children before they are three, there is a very good chance of what they call normalising them in later life. I am aware that there is a very limited amount of research being done into this area. By not catching them before they are three, which as far as I can gather is the norm here, one is actually prejudicing their chances. It is no good making excuses and saying the Department is doing this, that and the other, when we could do something about that.</P>
    <P>The other matter which Kathy Sinnott raised at that meeting was the important one of the roles of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. I do not think it is a turf war between the Departments but there seems to be a great deal of conflict about whether this is an educational or medical problem. In the treatment available here, there seems to be a huge emphasis on its being purely an educational problem. There appears to be the belief that if one produces enough educational therapists this problem will be resolved.</P>
    <P>I gather that the Minister for Health and Children made a promise in Cork more than three years ago that a national hospital centre would be set up there. I would like the Minister of State to respond to this. I am not making a political point. I would genuinely like to hear the reason nothing has happened. It is apparently because the finances are not there. I do not believe that this is a good enough reason. This problem deserves both a medical and educational response for the children.</P>
    <P>As Senator Feighan so rightly said, the parents also need respite leisure time and relief from this extraordinarily acute problem. I am sorry that I do not have sufficient time to go into this matter in more detail. I would like the Minister of State, in his response, to give us a target outlining what he intends to do in the immediate future and what prospects there are for change in concrete terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for sharing his time with me. I also thank him for initiating this debate and for explaining so clearly the practical problems that the parents of the children we are discussing are having.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Ross, I too am rather disappointed by the statements of the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. His statement focused on staffing, which is all very well, but as Senator Ross mentioned, we really do not appear to know the numbers of children who are suffering from autistic spectrum disorder &ndash; which is probably a better way of describing them than autistic children. Autism is not a pure diagnosis and it is a feature of many children who have mental disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" />It is extremely important that we become involved in research as to the cause of the condition. We are not sure of the cause but it is quite possibly a genetic disorder of brain chemistry. What we do know is that there are about four boys to one girl affected and that it comes on at the time of cognitive development at about 18 months to two years. This is just when a child is beginning to flower and develop and it is extraordinarily distressing for parents who, as Senator Ross so rightly said, then cannot get anyone to see and assess their children.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to an article written in a recent copy of the <i>British Medical Journal</i> regarding the association in the minds of the public between the administration of MMR, the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, and the development of autistic spectrum disorder. The authors of this report interviewed members of the public as to how they felt the medical profession perceived the association between MMR and the development of autism. The general public felt that it was split about 50:50; that about 50% of the medical profession supported the notion and the other 50% did not. This, as the Minister of State knows, is not the case at all. Very few people see that there is any association between the administration of MMR and the development of autism. It is just unfortunate that these things happen around the same time and, naturally, all of us like to find a cause for what has happened to our child. British, French, and Finnish studies have shown no association at all between them.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the administration of MMR is still compulsory in the United States of America before a child is allowed enter school. It is most important that we try to do something about the falling rates of MMR vaccination in this country. The public health doctors' strike is making matters even worse. We need to come forward with proper research into the issue because we will end up with children with mental disabilities due to their being unvaccinated. Unvaccinated girls who contract rubella, German measles, when pregnant may produce mentally and physically disabled children. If they contract measles when pregnant they can get encephalopathies later in life. I urge the Minister of State to bring research on autism to the top of his agenda in order that we can make a contribution to this issue on the world stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this issue and congratulate Senator Ross for having raised it. Like my colleagues, I have been contacted during the years by a number of people in connection with autism. Some time ago a man from Sligo wrote to all Members of the Oireachtas but received very little by way of response. He sought a meeting with the Minister but did not get one. As I was abroad at the time, there was a delay in replying and I received a pretty snotty letter pointing out that I had not replied. As I can see some of my <Col N="718" />colleagues nodding, they must have received the same letter. I understand the man's exasperation.</P>
      <P>A few years ago I raised on the Adjournment the case of a very caring family who had an autistic child and another child with problems. The autistic child was doing well with speech therapy which was withdrawn because of some relocation of resources within the health board area. As a result, the child started going backwards, which is the most awful thing about autism. When such services are withdrawn, the child starts to regress. For that reason I welcome what the Minister of State has said.</P>
      <P>There are positive figures which I presume one can believe. It is splendid to have an increase in the number of speech therapists and those working in remedial linguistics from 100 to 2,000 but I want to know how many such children there are. That is the way we should work out the equation. Instead of saying we have this rate of increase, impressive as it is, we should accurately assess how many such children there are and then work out how many speech therapists are required to service them. Those figures are not contained in the Minister of State's speech, although that is the way we need to approach the matter.</P>
      <P>I was impressed when Senator Ross first raised this issue on the Order of Business, having attended a committee meeting which obviously moved him. As the Senator said, each case within the autistic spectrum disorder is quite different. That is the very challenging aspect of the disease. It is not like treating measles because each autistic person has a characteristically different syndrome. That means there must be the most intense, personal, one-to-one relationship between the person who is helping and the autistic child. This, in turn, requires a considerable amount of resources. The treatment of autism is expensive but if we, as a society, say we care, we will have to accept the cost involved.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. In doing so, I also commend Senator Ross for his persistence in seeking this debate, which is very worthwhile and possibly one of the most interesting we have had for some time. I am a mother of four, perfectly normal, beautiful children. Some 18 years ago, when my eldest child started attending national school, to my shame I had never heard about autism and did not know what it meant. I was a young mother in my 20s with four children under five and was too busy learning about Sudo Creme and nappy rash. It was not until one little boy in my son's class left after a year that I learned something about autism. When I asked his mother the reason, she told me her child was autistic. She said autism was a child development <Col N="719" />problem, a social communication disorder. It took me months to take this in but the child had left the national school to attend a special needs school. My view was that autism was a very severe, lonely and isolating disorder. More often than not, however, it is accompanied by a physical or learning disability. It marks the beginning of a long and difficult road for children as regards their future education.</P>
      <P>We are all now familiar with that look one gets from a autistic child. They look perfectly normal, just like other children on the road or in the playground, but they do not speak when it is their turn to do so and cannot interpret the tone of somebody's voice to understand whether it is an order to do something or a caring phrase. More often, possibly always, autistic children are locked into a world of their own. As with the look of an autistic child, we are all familiar with their behaviour, including hand clapping and swinging around.</P>
      <P>What happens to these children? I am glad to say an awful lot more is happening for them now than when I first encountered the condition of autism. In the last 20 years major advances have been made in this area. With a recognition of autism we also see support systems in place. Having listened to Senator Ross, I can see that what is happening in the North Western Health Board area is not replicated in every other region. The North Western Health Board covers counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. When I was researching this subject, I was told about the wonderful service people are receiving in County Donegal, which is second to none. It is unique because I have heard nobody else mention this in today's debate. It recognises the need for support and resources at pre-school age. A child must be diagnosed between two and two and a half years of age. The health board is doing so and providing support in people's homes in the form of applied behavioural therapy.</P>
      <P>My fellow Senators will be pleased to hear that 75 children are receiving such support. The impact of this one-to-one therapy by trained professionals is immense. These professionals come from a social therapy background or specialised nurses' training in learning disabilities. The one-to-one therapy has been hugely significant as well as rewarding for the autistic child and his or her family. Those receiving this treatment in County Donegal are classifying it as best practice and best service. How lovely it would be to see it being continued in the rest of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of service does not work on dedication alone, however. Whether it involves the dedication of staff or parents looking after the child, it does come at an enormous cost, as Senator Ross has pointed out. The annual cost of providing the service in County Donegal is estimated at &euro;1 million. This is where I want the Minister of State to lend me an ear because this cost has to come out of our health board's budget. While County Donegal has an excellent service, <Col N="720" />counties Sligo and Leitrim cannot avail of it to the same degree. We are looking to the Minister of State to try to increase the budget, although I realise that is not too friendly a term to use at present. I implore him to try to increase the relevant financial benefits for those who do not have a voice of their own.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister of State refer to better communications on a more structured basis between his Department and the Department of Education and Science. He said there would be better interdepartmental consultations. Up to now, however, a formal relationship between both Departments has been lacking. Where there is such a good relationship between Departments, great results can be obtained, as we have seen at local level. The Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, had a meeting with our opposite numbers in the Joint Committee on Education and Science recently.</P>
    <P>While the number of speech therapists has increased across all health board areas, there is still an overall lack of such staff, as I know from talking to those involved in the profession as well as those who sit on health boards. The Minister of State alluded to the fact that such health workers were being actively recruited. However, while we have gone as far afield as New Zealand and Australia seeking speech therapists &ndash; because they must come from English-speaking countries &ndash; I am told that very few have been recruited abroad. Why is that so? Are we paying enough to our speech therapists who undergo an extensive four year training course? Are we offering them lucrative contracts to work within the health board system? The Minister of State should examine these matters. I acknowledge that huge inroads have been made into the problem for which I commend the Minister of State and his departmental officials.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State referred to the extra places created last year, including three <Col N="721" />new schools in Galway, Cork and Limerick, giving a total of 75 places, for which I commend him. However, there is a great need in this area because the language component in autism is one of the basic needs. Treatment has improved, but parents' expectations are higher than they were 20 years ago and rightly so. There is no one in this House who would not seek better value for money. We are all singing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to getting better value for money. When one considers how Departments work at local level, whether in education or health, if this is achieved at regional and national level we will get better value for money. Having everyone work together is what will give the best results. We have seen multidisciplinary teams working in other areas. This is an area in which we can be most effective.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State offered a major commitment in his contribution. This was obvious in the way he outlined the number of people currently in postgraduate training. I hope these individuals will go on to form part of the multidisciplinary teams needed in that area. I was touched to hear that he will be putting structures in place and that he will not be adding to the burden of mothers or fathers with autistic children.</P>
      <P>A good friend of mine &ndash; we are the same age &ndash; left it until late in life to have her family. She has only one child and is a single parent. Just two months ago her little boy was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. I know the devastation it has brought to her life. She is a very successful business woman, but her whole world has fallen apart. She takes the train to Belfast twice a week in order to educate herself on how best to treat her child. She is trying to get him into a school here, but there are huge waiting lists. There are 28 children on the list ahead of her child. We need more resources and I call on the Minister of State to try to put more funding into this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am disappointed that his contribution lacked some sensitivity towards parents and other family members affected by autism. It would not take Einstein to work out that the money spent by the Government defending legal actions taken by parents seeking appropriate facilities and education for their autistic children would be better spent on providing these basic rights. However, it would apparently take someone more qualified than Einstein to persuade the Government that this is the case.</P>
      <P>I remind Senator Glynn that, in the Midland Health Board region, 24 parents are taking actions in the High Court. Early childhood services and special education are essential for children with autism, otherwise their condition will deteriorate. That any Government could force parents to have recourse to legal action and then fight that action, despite funding shortages and cutbacks in all health board regions, is beyond belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" />It is well established that the secret of success in respect of autism is early and extensive intervention. If the proper facilities and therapies are put in place, almost 50% of three to four year olds who present with ASD are able to join mainstream education by the age of ten. The previous speaker referred to this matter. In America, the current incidence of autism spectrum disorders is one in 129. Unfortunately, Ireland, where the incidence is much higher at one in 86, is different. Even though the need is greater, many essential services and facilities are either non-existent or substandard. In the Midland Health Board area, some progress has been made in the provision of services for those with autism. Drastic Government cutbacks, however, which are common in all areas throughout the country, are causing these services to be curtailed and, in some cases, cancelled or disbanded.</P>
    <P>There is very little integration between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science in the Midland Health Board region and I am sure this is common elsewhere. Consequently, a completed service plan for each individual cannot be developed and the most efficient utilisation of the resources, such as they are, cannot be made.</P>
    <P>During a recent six month period, out of 34 families requiring services for autistic children, 15 received no speech and language therapy, 26 received no occupational therapy, 28 received no play therapy, 13 did not see the relevant doctor and 29 received no psychological service. Special classes for autism use the outdated model, Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication-Handicapped Children. Regrettably, this is being provided in some cases by individuals who are neither qualified teachers nor trained to deal with special needs children. There are no pre-school facilities for intense intervention. There is a non-integrated class at the Presentation senior school in Mullingar, with a 6:1 pupil-teacher ratio, but the teacher is not fully qualified in this area. Despite several children now coming under the NEPS scheme, which requires one-to-one primary education, there is no attempt by the State to deliver such a service in the midlands. Post-18 years facilities for autistic adults are non-existent. Appropriate adult placements must be provided, including residential care where necessary, but not in psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>Huge burdens are placed on families of autistic people in terms of finance, time, stress, strained relationships between parents and among siblings and a lessened quality of life for all members of the immediate family. Life for many such families is a struggle without end and without hope. Due to their lack of communication skills and inability to understand the world around them, people who suffer from autism spectrum disorder have a real fear of that world. Failure to help them to acquire the skills to enjoy life and to interact with other human beings is tantamount to torture.</P>
    <P>There are currently seven schools for children with autism throughout the country. The 90 <Col N="723" />pupils in these schools face an uncertain future as the Minister has only guaranteed funding until September 2004. Three schools run on the CABAS method have been set up by parents and are funded by the Department of Education and Science as pilot projects for five years. They are located in Dublin, Drogheda and Cork and their success has brought about a huge demand for similar schools. However, the future of these schools is uncertain because of the shortage of funding in this area.</P>
    <P>The rights of autistic individuals are enshrined in the Constitution, the Education Acts, the United Nations mental health directives and the European Charter of Rights for Autistic People. These rights must and should be met. I ask the Minister of State to consider the rights enshrined in the various articles and ensure that they are upheld.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Traffic Congestion: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann recognises the severe social and economic problems caused by traffic congestion in Dublin and expresses its support for a range of measures to alleviate the problem, including</P>
      <P>(i) the invitation of tenders as soon as possible for the construction of the first phase of a comprehensive metro system for the city, </P>
      <P>(ii) the use of public private partnership as the most efficient and cost-effective mechanism for delivering the metro system, </P>
      <P>(iii) the improvement of the bus service by developing more quality bus corridors and by enabling new operators to enter the market and invest in new bus fleets, and </P>
      <P>(iv) the implementation of remedial measures to ensure that the Luas light rail line does not exacerbate traffic congestion at the Red Cow roundabout.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, and hope he will find our contributions worthwhile to the debate on public transport in Dublin, as well as the resolutions we hope to offer.</P>
      <P>In the mid-1990s we had a major debate about public transport in Dublin and came down in favour of light rail. The option of an underground metro system was rejected. Comparing the two at the time the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Lowry, said in the House: &ldquo;Underground is less acceptable, less attractive, less safe, less clean and will cost more to build and operate.&rdquo; That was that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time a major debate was also raging in Madrid about public transport. The city had a metro system dating back to 1919 but traffic congestion was choking the life out of the Spanish <Col N="724" />capital and it was clear something had to be done. Major investment in public transport was required. The authorities again went for metro in a big way. In the intervening eight years over 110 kilometres of new lines, 75 new stations, and new interchanges with suburban rail have been built. Almost 90% of the new network is underground.</P>
    <P>Here we are, almost a decade later, and a metro system in Dublin is back on the political agenda again. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition agreed three years ago to build such a system but little progress has been made. The Government now has to decide whether it will give the go-ahead for the project. I strongly believe Dublin needs a metro system and do not think we will ever resolve our congestion problems until we have one. Every capital city in the European Union has an extensive metro system, with the exception of Dublin and Luxembourg. Luxembourg, a small city of less than 100,000 people, is hardly comparable to Dublin which has a population more than ten times greater, and growing. There are few who would argue against such a system for Dublin. Gone are the spurious arguments that an underground railway would not be safe for women, that houses and shops would fall into the tunnels, and that such a system is simply not affordable.</P>
    <P>It is now widely recognised that a metro system is essential for the smooth running of our capital city. It alone offers the high-speed, high-capacity solution which works well in other major cities and which would work well in Dublin. It alone offers a real long-term solution to the transport problems of our capital city. People like Senator Norris saw the logic a decade ago. Everyone sees it now. If we accept that a metro system is needed, we must start putting in place as quickly as possible a system to develop it. Several questions have to be answered. These relate to the affordability of the project, its management and scale and design.</P>
    <P>According to the Rail Procurement Agency, a metro link from Dublin Airport to St. Stephen's Green would cost almost &euro;5 billion. For a rail link of just 10 kilometres, that figure seems off the scale in terms of affordability. We have never built a metro system in this country and have not built a major rail tunnel in almost 90 years. It is only natural, therefore, that we should approach the project in a cautious and conservative mood and seek to avoid underestimating costs and then running massively over budget but it is only natural, too, that in such circumstances we should seek to learn from others, above all our partners in the European Union. This is a particularly important point when it comes to a metro system.</P>
    <P>The world leader in metro development is the regional government in Madrid where, as I said, a massive programme of metro development has just been completed. The project team is headed by Professor Manuel Melis. In an article published last month he wrote, &ldquo;In Madrid we believe that any metro can be built and commissioned within 40 months at a cost of no more <Col N="725" />than &euro;50 million per kilometre&rdquo;. He is coming to Dublin next week to address the Cabinet sub-committee on transport. I am sure its members will listen carefully to what he has to say. He has built more metro lines than anybody else in the world, and built them faster and cheaper than anybody else. We have a lot to learn from the Madrid experience.</P>
    <P>It may be that costs in Dublin are higher than in Madrid. They may be 20% or 30% higher but they are certainly not ten times higher. It is vital that we look again at the costings for the Dublin project. Let us take Madrid as our benchmark and get as close as possible to its costings and timetable. Time is money in the management of major infrastructural projects. The most recent project in Madrid is Metrosur, a 41 kilometre metro system linking five satellite towns with 27 stations, all underground. The timetable is worth noting. The project was first floated during the regional elections of May 1999; planning began in September that year and the line was officially opened on 11 April 2003. It would be wonderful if we could emulate that kind of performance in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The affordability of a metro system depends to a very large degree on how the project is managed. There are two main alternatives &ndash; conventional contract or public private partnership. Madrid has shown how such a system can be delivered quickly and efficiently by the conventional contract approach. The authorities in the city put in place a very small but very skilled and experienced team of engineers to manage their programme of metro development. They have stayed on schedule and within budget. It is fair to say they have mastered the art of metro building using the conventional contract. We could adopt such an approach in Dublin. If we do, it is imperative that we put in place the structures and personnel to ensure the overall project is delivered on time, within budget and in accordance with best practice elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to use the public private partnership &ndash; PPP &ndash; as the best way of delivering a Dublin metro system. Such an approach would transfer the bulk of the financial risk to the private sector, bring in substantial private funding and give the private sector a real incentive to complete the project as quickly and efficiently as possible. It would only make sense, however, if it enabled us to deliver the same project at a lower cost to the Exchequer than a conventional contract. The Exchequer's contribution to a metro system delivered by way of PPP should be no more than a fraction of the figures put forward by the RPA. As I stated, the costings put forward by it are not realistic and would impose a huge burden on the taxpayer for years to come.</P>
    <P>The choice between conventional contract and PPP is a matter of efficiency, not ideology. We should pick whichever option represents best value for the taxpayer. My own view is that PPP is the best option. We do not have the structures in place to handle a project of this magnitude by <Col N="726" />conventional contract. The best way of advancing it is through the PPP route.</P>
    <P>The scale and design of the metro project are also critical. Press reports suggest that what is envisaged is a short link from Dublin Airport to the city centre, not a line across the city. I do not think such a proposal would be right for Dublin as it would not offer a real solution to our traffic problems. There should be no half-measures. If we are to build a metro line, let us build a full line, not half a line. This means running a line straight from the airport to a destination on the south side of the city. Otherwise we would be unique in Europe in having a metro system which terminated in the city centre. It would be madness to have a metro line terminating underground at St. Stephen's Green. We would then have to return in four or five years and start the whole planning process all over again in order to complete the southern line. Surely it makes sense to save time and money by building the whole line as a single project. Piecemeal planning has made a mess of our road system. Let us not repeat the mistake with a Dublin metro system.</P>
    <P>With regard to system design and route alignment, if we opt for PPP, we should allow as much discretion as possible to private sector bidders. If we are to going to use the PPP model, we should ensure that we secure the maximum benefits from the private sector in terms of smart design and smart routing. The metro saga has been running for a long period and decision time is approaching. We have received many reports, studies and evaluations. It is time now to decide whether we are going to proceed with this project.</P>
    <P>The Government must address a number of major questions before it arrives at a decision on what is be biggest infrastructural investment project in the history of the State. Will it be possible to deliver the metro at an affordable price and in line with best European practice? Are the correct structures in place and do we have the right personnel to oversee the project? Will it be possible to limit the Exchequer's financial exposure and leverage the maximum level of private sector investment?</P>
    <P>If the answer to each of these questions is yes, we should press ahead without further delay and the people of Dublin could be travelling on a metro system within five years. If the answer to any of the questions is no, we must think carefully about proceeding with the metro project. If we are confident that we have the capacity to deliver the project efficiently and effectively, we should press ahead without further delay. If not, it would be better to call a halt to the entire process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Senator Morrissey. It is obvious that Dublin needs a metro system, which would offer a fast, frequent and reliable service. Such a system is a key component of the transport infra<Col N="727" />structure of any major modern city and, in particular, a capital city.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with three issues, namely, the future role of buses in Dublin's transport system, the potential problems that will be caused by Luas and the options regarding motorway developments in and around the city.</P>
    <P>Dublin is a difficult city in which to run a bus service. We do not have a proper ringroad system to take through traffic out of the city and the M50 is far too congested to serve this function. This means that the streets in the city centre are constantly clogged with traffic. As a result bus speeds and reliability and public confidence in the system have declined. We tried to break out of this vicious circle by introducing quality bus corridors. The Stillorgan Road QBC has been an outstanding success. Bus speeds have improved significantly and the numbers using the service have shot up. People now leave their cars at home and use buses instead. The Stillorgan Road QBC worked because there was sufficient road space available to facilitate it. The corridor runs mainly on the hard shoulder of the dual carriageway and, apart from Donnybrook Village, it does not have a severe pinch point and has its own dedicated space along virtually the entire route.</P>
    <P>Other QBCs have been less successful. The Tallaght and Whitehall corridors, for example, offer a poor service compared with that offered on the Stillorgan route. On these routes, the QBCs are incomplete and there are long sections without any bus lane which are often heavily congested. The investment made in the QBCs has not delivered many of the hoped for improvements in terms of shorter journey times for passengers. We must reconsider the issue of QBCs in terms of what can be done to improve existing corridors, which routes offer the best prospects for new QBCs and how we can make better use of road space by giving high-occupancy vehicles access to QBCs. We must also consider whether we can secure better value for money by opening up new QBCs to competition.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party is a strong advocate of competition, which could work just as well in the bus industry as in other areas. I believe in competition for the ground and not on the ground. In other words, there should be a system of route franchising by competitive tender, not a free-for-all with half a dozen operators running on the same route. It is important to get new blood into the business. The Aircoach service to the Dublin Airport has been a great success and more new operators are needed in the market. The possibility of buses using the new Luas lines as QBCs was raised recently. Street space is scarce in Dublin, which does not have the wide boulevards found in many continental cities. Street space for buses will become more scarce when the Luas lines are complete. It would be very good for bus users if buses could travel on sections of the Luas system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" />Over 130 buses carrying 8,000 passengers travel along the North Quays route into the city centre per hour at peak times. Luas, running parallel to the quays, will carry about 3,000 passengers per hour along the same route. Luas will have its own dedicated track, while the buses &ndash; which carry almost three times more people &ndash; will have to battle it out with competing traffic. Sadly, it seems that buses will not have access to the Luas lines. The RPA has responded to queries from Senator Morrissey about this and he has been informed that it will not be possible to run buses on the Luas lines, which is a pity. Much road space has been taken away from motorists and given over to public transport. However, the vast majority of public transport users &ndash; those who travel on the buses &ndash; will not have access to it.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the Luas level crossings at the Red Cow roundabout, about which there has been much discussion and criticism in recent weeks. As often happens in Ireland, the decision was made several years before the debate really started. Approval for the Red Cow level crossings was given after an inquiry into Line A &ndash; Tallaght to Abbey Street &ndash; headed by Judge Sean O'Leary. Judge O'Leary based his findings on a report produced to the inquiry by the Dublin Transportation Office. Judge O'Leary stated:</P>
    <P>The DTO report is of the view that there would be no deterioration in the carrying capacity of the junction as the LRT can be accommodated at suitable phases of the traffic control system.</P>
    <P>That report was dated 14 March 1997, six years ago. This crucial report was carried out when the rainbow Government was in power and when the former Deputy, Mr. Dukes held the transport portfolio.</P>
    <P>Traffic counts carried out by the NRA in 2000 showed that up to 75,000 vehicles per day use the Red Cow roundabout. That figure is probably well over 80,000 vehicles per day by now. Next year, trams will start running across two slip roads on the roundabout at a frequency of one every 150 seconds. This surely is a recipe for chaos on a grand scale. Motorists will suffer from increased congestion, while Luas users will suffer as trams are stalled in the heavy traffic. Clearly, the two traffic streams must be separated. I urge the Minister for Transport to examine the possibility of building a bridge, which would cost approximately &euro;20 million, to take Luas over the roundabout. If the Empire State Building could be built in 14 months, I do not understand how it could take longer to build a small bridge over the Red Cow roundabout.</P>
    <P>The Red Cow was a problem before Luas came on the scene. All of the interchanges on the M50 were under-engineered from the start. Instead of cloverleaf junctions, we have roundabouts. The net result is gridlock and the motorway is unable to fulfil the function for which it was built, namely, to carry traffic around Dublin. Every <Col N="729" />major city in continental Europe has a motorway system around it, taking heavy traffic off its city streets. This is one of the reasons buses and trams work so successfully on other cities. We need a similar motorway system for Dublin and it is clear that the M50, as it currently stands, is not able to fulfil that role.</P>
    <P>There are only two basic options. We can upgrade the existing M50, re-engineering the junctions and widening the road to three lanes, which would cost approximately &euro;800 million to &euro;900 million. The disruption caused by four years of continuous road works would be pretty horrific. The other option would be to build a new motorway further to the west of the city, an M60 so to speak. The cost would be great and the planning difficulties would be greater still. It might take a decade to get to the point where construction could start.</P>
    <P>Neither option is easy nor cheap. However, we are going to have to face up to one or the other if we are serious about solving Dublin's traffic problems. We cannot say that we want European quality public transport, if we are not prepared to invest in European quality urban roads. Providing a proper motorway system for Dublin is going to be expensive no matter which option we take and will probably cost in the order of &euro;1 billion. That amount is much money in anybody's book and not easy to come by.</P>
    <P>If we adopt a sensible approach to our road development policy, we could find the money to which I refer. One of the priority projects in the national road development programme is the construction of a motorway from Dublin to Waterford. The estimated cost of this project is around &euro;1 billion. I am in favour of people from Waterford having good access to Dublin. Good road links are essential if the city, the county and the region are to develop to their full potential. However, I question the need for a motorway. The NRA has published traffic counts for all the national primary routes. In 2002, some sections of the N9 Dublin to Waterford route were carrying as few as 6,000 vehicles per day. Back roads in County Kildare carry more traffic than that. A motorway is not justified for a road as lightly trafficked as that. If it was, virtually every national route in the country would have to be upgraded to motorway. A motorway on the N9 road would be a waste of taxpayers' money on a grand scale. That is not to say that towns should be bypassed along the route.</P>
    <P>There is a simple and easy solution to the Waterford road problem. We have just spent a fortune upgrading the route in County Kildare near Moone and a new N9 now runs through the south of the county not very far from the existing motorway down to Castledermot. This new route runs parallel to the old route. Surely everybody realises that would be madness. An excellent road to Waterford can be provided at a fraction of the proposed cost. A standard, single carriageway route is all that is required to provide a proper, speedy and safe link to Dublin. Much of <Col N="730" />the existing link between Waterford and the Carlow border is inadequate and a new road would have to be built on an entirely new alignment but that could be done relatively quickly at a relatively modest cost. A motorway will not be open for business until well into the next decade and the timeframe for delivery of the project has been slipping all the time. The people of Waterford would much rather see work getting under way quickly on an affordable option than having to wait anything up to ten years for a motorway. Good government is all about making the best use of available resources. Building a motorway between Dublin and Waterford does not seem like good value for money or good government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am baffled by this motion and the latter comments of the Senator opposite. Is he in government or is he not?

      <P>It concerned the motorway, which he has said now should not go ahead. On a point of information, I do not consider that issue is relevant to this debate, although I would be glad to debate it with the Senator at a future date. If I was to do so now, I could spend the time I have to make my contribution debating that issue alone.</P>
      <P>I did not bother tabling an amendment to the motion because I thought there was no need to do so. Progressive Democrats Senators were so critical of the Government I could not possibly criticise it anymore. It is amazing for the Progressive Democrats who have been in government with Fianna Fáil for the past six years to frame this type of motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The transport system, especially in Dublin, is a mess. I will concentrate on Dublin to which the motion relates. The DTO predicted levels of traffic in Dublin in 2016, which have now been reached, 13 years ahead of schedule. Some 23 agencies are involved in traffic management in Dublin, as opposed to a single transport authority, of which Fine Gael would be in favour.</P>
      <P>We have had the Luas debacle, the cost of which is spiralling out of control. There was the famous advertisement for Luas which indicated that the first tram was due in 2003 and every five minutes after that &ndash; how words can haunt. When the rainbow coalition Government was in office&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;Luas was to be built by 2001 at a cost of &euro;279 million, then the cost increased <Col N="731" />to &euro;635 million. Will the Minister of State clarify what is the final projected cost at this stage? We are being told that it will not be ready until 2004. The French put in place a similar system in Montpellier which is up and running while ours is still in the process of being constructed.</P>
      <P>Traffic congestion in Dublin alone is costing businesses in the region of &euro;600 million per year. The average journey time in Dublin is 57 minutes; it has increased 25% since the parties in government came to power in 1997. People are wasting their lives stuck in traffic jams when they could be spending it otherwise. The Government failed to plan ahead and distribute the fruits of the economic boom and match it with quick, effective infrastructural projects, which has left us with the disaster we have in the transport system.</P>
      <P>The motion refers to changing the bus system, of which Fine Gael is in favour. However, we are nervous when we hear the Government talk about deregulation after the fiasco created by the former Progressive Democrats Minister of State, Bobby Molloy, with the deregulation of the taxi industry overnight, which has now resulted in one in five taxi drivers having a criminal record and people not being safe travelling by taxi. The advice given by the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip in the Dáil to women in Dublin was not to get a taxi.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>She later clarified the point. This is ludicrous. Fine Gael is in favour of shaking up the bus system but only in consultation with the unions which have not been consulted. The Minister is fantastic when it comes to making announcements, although he does so without checking the position fully with all concerned, but is bad on delivering them. I hold the Department of Transport and the team of Ministers guilty in that regard.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael would be in favour of having a bus competition immediately under an interim regulator who would offer for tender 20% of public routes and allow any private or public service provider to propose a new service specifying route and frequency. Service provision for such routes would be open for tender if such a regulator was satisfied there was sufficient demand. He or she would require bus companies in receipt of subvention to publish full route performances. We also need to establish a new traffic corps for the four Dublin local authorities and the DTA.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion also refers to PPPs. Two buzz terms in the Department of Finance are &ldquo;PPPs&rdquo; and &ldquo;value for money&rdquo;, the latter term having been totally abused by the Government given that it would not know anything about value for money. The jury is still out regarding PPPs. It has not been proven that they will lead to faster project completion compared to traditional public procurement. Whether they can deliver value for money depends on a number of factors, including <Col N="732" />the extent to which contracts can be specified, agreed and monitored in order to achieve efficiencies that outweigh the higher cost of private capital. The PPP system in England, called the PFI, is slightly different from ours but there are also difficulties with it. The experience is that PFIs seem to be more suitable for road building than hospital building. Our experience of PPPs has been bad. In the case of the toll bridge on the M50, the private operator has gained far more than the taxpayer or the public element. It was one of the first PPP projects from which we can learn lessons.</P>
    <P>The construction of the National Sports Campus and Aquatic Centre was a fiasco. The PPP involved has been the most controversial to date. On 7 March 2002 Waterworld (UK), part of a successful private consortium, was dormant when it signed the heads of an agreement to operate the centre. This experience raises questions about the conduct of the procurement process. One wonders how much the Government has learned from those debacles and how much it can be trusted to deliver.</P>
    <P>With the planned Luas line at the Red Cow roundabout, perhaps the roundabout should be renamed the &ldquo;mad cow roundabout&rdquo;. Like Senator Dardis and many other Members, I use it regularly and I am sure it will be chaotic when the line is operating. We are blessed that we start work on Tuesdays at 2.30 p.m., thereby avoiding all the heavy traffic in the morning. Given the times at which we finish, we also avoid it in the evenings.</P>
    <P>We have not examined the issues involved. I agree with Senator Dardis regarding the idea of an overpass, the provision of which would cost only &euro;20 million. However, we have been told that there is no money available, yet some &euro;30 million was spent in removing a ramp at Connolly Station. It was later admitted that there was no need to remove it, even though the line is being continued to Spencer Dock. This shows the level of mismanagement of the transport system.</P>
    <P>We have not examined the Newlands Cross scenario where a park and ride facility will need be provided. I ask the Minister of State to clarify how it is intended to address this problem. If some 80,000 vehicles use the Red Cow roundabout daily, one can only imagine the congestion when Luas trams will traverse it every few minutes.</P>
    <P>We must take the issue of public transport seriously. We depend far too much on our roads on which some 95% of passenger traffic and 93% of freight traffic is carried. We need to seriously address this issue, given that we are going against the norm in the European Union.</P>
    <P>We also need to examine the level of arbitration, a matter on which I have spoken on numerous occasions and about which Mr. Padraic White of the Rail Procurement Agency expressed grave concern lately. There was a recent case where the cost of acquiring half an acre of land in Dundrum cost &euro;3.5 million in terms of compen<Col N="733" />sation. People are allowed to overestimate the value of their land by saying they could build a hotel on it when the reality is different. They also receive a 9% levy on top of its value for investment. We must get real. In Spain, apparently, everything up to ten foot underground is owned by the State, therefore, it costs the state nothing to build underground. Perhaps we could learn from this.</P>
    <P>It was stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> last year that the cost of building a metro system would be &euro;20 million, lately we were told it would cost &euro;40 million and at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport we were told by Mr. Cormac Rabbitte from a different agency that it would cost far less. There is great confusion. The Government has led by bad example and mismanaged the budgets for key infrastructural projects and the times in which they were supposed to have been delivered. It is difficult for the public to believe in it. I hope the Minister will learn from previous mistakes and begin delivering projects on time and within budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disturbed that Senator Browne has accepted defeat in terms of the ability of Fine Gael to offer some level of opposition. It is not surprising that this side of the House, as well as governing, will also have to provide a credible Opposition from within. There is a wide diversity of views, as there always would be with parties such as Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. However, there is no doubt about the ability of the two parties to work together cohesively, as we have done for the past six years and will continue to do for the next four&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and recognise that both he and the Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan, have been present for debates in the House on many occasions. Both he and the Minister are responsible for a job of work that is fundamental to the development of the State.</P>
      <P>Much of the motion is concerned with congestion which has real implications for the capacity of people to live a normal life. Certainly, in the east and especially in Dublin it has led to a certain level of stress for those stuck in their cars all day. That said, we should not lose sight of the origins of this congestion. It is the result of an increase in the population of cities as people have moved from the country because of the decline of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been brought about by the Celtic tiger. Senator Browne should remember that the economic policy in place since 1987 courtesy of cohesive Fianna Fáil-led Governments with the <Col N="734" />involvement of the Progressive Democrats has led to this fantastic economic&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">

      <P>What about the Tallaght strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tallaght strategy was useful but it was a recognition of the difficulties of Fine Gael as it brought the country almost to the verge of bankruptcy. The economic policy pursued since 1987 has caused some of the problems with congestion. It is not the fault of the Government but one of the teething problems associated with repositioning the economy and creating development.</P>
      <P>The measures set out and clearly identified in the motion, such as Luas, the metro, the M50 and quality bus corridors, will certainly have a major impact going forward but such infrastructural projects take time. Much of the work is under way. We are aware of the problems. The construction of Luas has daily implications for congestion. We should not take the short-term approach as a number of politicians would have done at the time Luas was first envisaged. They would have taken the easy option because they were not prepared to subject the people to the current level of congestion to achieve a simpler solution. Ultimately, however, they would not have put in place the infrastructure and capacity to manage going forward.</P>
      <P>A more fundamental and wider issue related to congestion is what we can do to address it. If we are to look towards Government policy and the concept of balanced regional development, we need to look at the national spatial strategy and its aims, the national development plan and other Government initiatives. It is incumbent on all Departments to try to give effect to these and assist in removing some of the congestion from Dublin city by locating development in the areas that need it more.</P>
      <P>Infrastructure along the western corridor from Cork to Donegal, be it rail, improved roads like the Ennis bypass or the continued growth and development of Shannon Airport, is crucial in terms of ensuring balanced regional development. The programme of decentralisation the House discussed last week can assist in moving people out of the city who do not need to be there in the first place. The Minister has obtained some views, such as the strategic rail review, to assist in the overall alleviation of traffic congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree fundamentally with the motion. The metro is certainly a useful and valid project going forward. We must be careful about the associated cost and need to get the fundamentals right rather than proceeding hastily just because it is needed. The cost is the major issue. We have discussed changes needed in land ownership, fixed price contracts, public private partnership, certainly a useful system going forward in terms of reducing the risk to the State, and the capacity for the design, build, finance and operate option. As there is some concern about the charges that <Col N="735" />might be levied at a later stage, we must put in place the necessary controls in this regard.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable debate about Copenhagen and Madrid and how they managed to deal with their metro issues. I know the Minister, the Tánaiste and others have had review groups visit these sites and much consideration has been given towards identifying the differences in our legislation and constitutional issues to try to reach a point where we can do what those cities have done at a similar cost.</P>
    <P>The bus service has certainly improved greatly in recent years, mainly through the use of quality bus corridors and the replacement of the fleet. That is welcome. I agree with the sentiment of the motion that some competition needs to be introduced into the sector. I know there are union difficulties and problems that obviously must be dealt with but I have no doubt the Minister, his team of advisers and civil servants will be well capable of this. In terms of competition in the market, the franchise approach rather than the possibility of two operators on the one route would be the best model with which to proceed. We need to be careful how we monitor the service and the pricing controls or monitoring of pricing we put in place. If something is priced out of the market, it is no longer useful in terms of what is ultimately to be achieved. In this case it is to get better service while trying to resolve the congestion issue.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concerns about the M50 roundabout which I use regularly. There is considerable congestion on the ramp onto the Kildare road, no matter whether it is a Monday or Friday evening. I am not convinced by the argument of the Rail Procurement Agency that the timings and light sequences it has in place are enough. Only five cars can get onto the roundabout at any one time. Given the novelty factor of the Luas, drivers on the ramp will be looking at it only to discover that the lights have already gone green for three seconds, which will result in probably only two cars getting onto the roundabout. That will be a huge problem and needs to be resolved.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is a ministerial issue. I know the Minister has been brought in at this late stage to try to resolve an issue in which he should not be involved. It baffles me why no one within the three agencies involved, the National Roads Authority, the Dublin Transportation Office and the RPA, has been able to take a leadership role in recognising the problem. It should not be for the Minister to resolve these squabbles. It is an engineering problem.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed by comments of the Institute of Engineers expressing concern about the delivery of the NDP and some major infrastructural projects. Obviously, they are concerned about future work for themselves. I would be more interested in seeing them do a good job with what is in place and work with it rather than looking to the future. They should resolve whatever it is they are work<Col N="736" />ing on. We can then look towards future projects and let the Government worry about the funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who lives in Dublin, I am very aware of the congestion problems. Everybody in the House who travels to Dublin is also aware of them. The current conditions are absolutely unacceptable. We have listened to the Government and its predecessor talking about the various measures to be put in place to relieve the traffic problems in Dublin, but we have seen no improvement.</P>
      <P>The Luas project has been the subject of discussion for many years. Other countries have put similar systems in place, but we are still progressing very slowly with this project, which will ultimately do very little to relieve the traffic problems in Dublin. It is costing double what we first thought it would and may end up costing even more. In August 2002 the projected cost was &euro;20 million; now we are talking about &euro;40 million. It is absolutely outrageous that this system is not in place.</P>
      <P>The trains in operation at present are totally inadequate. We are trying to encourage people to use public transport, and they do want to, but the service and the facilities on offer cannot cater for all those who wish to use them. Senator Morrissey and I represent the same area in Dublin west, so he will be aware of the problems of which I speak. The area is served by the Connolly-Maynooth train, but, with the exception of Coolmine station, there are no parking facilities available. People have to drive their cars to the train station because there is no feeder bus service. The latter is essential if we are to make adequate use of our train service. People park all over the place. It is a source of great annoyance to residents to have cars parked outside their homes all day long. I ask the Minister of State to travel on that train some morning. Like others, he will be obliged to squeeze on to the train and stand in the aisle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well known that this train is overcrowded and extremely dangerous. Most mornings during the week one will find people, if not getting sick, feeling very ill at the end of that journey, which is quite short. I do not think Senator Morrisey would disagree with me on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need park and ride facilities for trains and buses. We have successfully put a number of bus lanes in place throughout Dublin &ndash; although <Col N="737" />there are not enough of them &ndash; and they work very well, but in order to get more people to avail of these services, we need park and ride facilities. I have been seeing documents about park and ride for years, but there is not one such facility in Dublin. If the Government is serious about tackling the problem of the transport system in Dublin, it will put a simple park and ride system in place. I guarantee that it will be used. People will drive to the car park, leave their cars, get on the bus and arrive in town far more quickly than would be the case if they drove to their destination.</P>
    <P>The other simple measure I would like to see put in place is the traffic corps about which we have heard. The system works well at Christmas, so why can we not have it all year round? We need a dedicated traffic corps working throughout the city because we do not want to impose further on the Garda. I do not understand why the system could not work on a year-round basis.</P>
    <P>Another matter about which we dream &ndash; I hope it will soon become a reality &ndash; is the provision of a metro system. People in west Dublin were told that if the stadium was built at Abbotstown, a metro would be provided. That is not the way to deal with transportation. The greater Blanchardstown area, which has a population of more than 70,000 &ndash; this is expected to increase to 110,000 in the coming years &ndash; needs a metro system. Dublin needs such a system. Let us stop talking about it and get on with it. The cost is obviously of serious concern, but it would pay for itself in time.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the problem of providing infrastructure. There are Third World countries that have the infrastructure we need here. The Minister should take on the problem, or else the city will choke. It is choking now and we are losing out economically as a result. The Dublin Chamber of Commerce has indicated that we are losing millions as a result of the time people spend stuck in traffic. I recently spoke to someone who had recently retired from Fingal County Council, of which I am a member, and asked him whether he missed it. He replied that he did not miss the three and a half hours he spent travelling every day. He was talking about three and a half hours travelling within the city. It is one thing to drive from Carlow or Longford to Dublin, but it is another to spend three and a half hours a day in one's car driving from one part of Dublin city to another.</P>
    <P>Americans and other foreign investors who come to the city will not accept this for much longer. We want this to be an attractive city for our citizens and for those who come here to work or visit. We will lose out if we do not tackle this problem. I cannot support the motion because it is a sham. Those on the other side of the House are in Government, but that Government is not delivering.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him and the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on the excellent work they are doing in the Department of Transport. I congratulate my colleague, Senator Morrisey, and his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats for putting down this motion, with which I fully agree.</P>
      <P>As a Cavan man working in Dublin for the past year, I have been struck by the enormity of the transport problems in this city. I also see the blood pressure levels of my friends and colleagues in Leinster House rocketing through the roof every morning. They complain regularly about being late for work or being stuck in traffic. Eliminating the unacceptable level of traffic congestion is essential for effective and efficient public transport and this must be at the centre of public transport policy.</P>
      <P>Last year, IBEC issued a report which indicates that the economy is being crippled by traffic congestion. The survey dealt with the impact of traffic congestion carried out by the employer body's transport and logistics council. Responses were received from 580 companies nationwide, employing 67,000 people, 50% of whom are located in Dublin where, not unexpectedly, the impact of congestion is particularly severe. Nationally, the survey found that 85% to 91% in Dublin blamed the demon traffic for an adverse impact on business.</P>
      <P>Rail, in one form or another, was once Dublin's main form of public transport. Unfortunately, the last trams were scrapped half a century ago. If we scratch the surface, however, we will find that the old lines are still there. Light rail is back. The Sandyford and Tallaght Luas routes are due to open in summer 2004. There is more disruption on the way &ndash; will it be worth it? In time, Luas will change the landscape of Dublin. The first routes from Tallaght to Connolly Station and from Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green are a taste of what is to come. By 2007, the system could extend to Lucan, the Point Depot and the north city.</P>
      <P>The great advantages of light rail are that it is electrically powered, pollution free and has its own right of way. As a result, one can predict the journey time very accurately, which is very important to transport users today. They wish to know that if they go to a Luas stop, they will get into town in 20 minutes or so. They also wish to know that the frequency will be reliable and that if the frequency is every five minutes, as is planned during peak hours, the tram will actually turn up within five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Paris, London and Copenhagen, which have been mentioned earlier, Dublin is to have its own metro system which, together with Luas, is being developed by the Railway Procurement <Col N="739" />Agency. In one hour of the morning rush, the metro could handle around 48,000 passengers. That is five times as many as Luas and the buses combined.</P>

      <P>How will the system work? In one short walk from one's house, one will take, say, the metro into town, switch to the Luas, stop for a cup of coffee or a pint, switch to the bus and so on to the end of one's journey &ndash; all on one ticket. If the system takes off, Dublin should become a lot safer, cleaner and less congested. We will then have a fully integrated city, with a fully mobile population. Compact, people-friendly suburbs will be orbitally linked to one another. A newly decongested city centre will have radiating, super-efficient transport corridors. Public transport will be no more than ten minutes walk from wherever one may live in this city. This is the theory. I invite Senators to imagine this development, which will be the reality in Dublin in 2016. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will still be in Government then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. Thank God this motion has been brought forward. Thank God there is some sense, at last. I recall being practically the only person arguing precisely this case and being hammered for it &ndash; except for one good person, Senator O'Rourke. When she had responsibility as Minister for Public Enterprise, she ran with the idea and that was great. I did not realise she was coming into the Chamber as I spoke just now.</P>
      <P>What I said is absolutely true. However, I now propose to take both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael apart on this issue. Fine Gael Senators are engaging in a continual carping exercise. They did not have the balls to put down an amendment, if the House will excuse the expression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should withdraw that remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that. They did not have the courage to do it but still they carp.</P>
      <P>We are being told from the Government side of the House that the project will be delivered in 2016. That is hopeless. That is an utter waste and it is the reason it will run into hugely excessive cost. When I heard an individual from the Railway Procurement Agency being interviewed on a radio programme, I laughed. When questioned as to how long the project would take to complete, he was not sure or did not know. In reply to a further question, he said it would cost &euro;4.8 billion. When it was pointed out that he had only accounted for &euro;1.2 billion in construction costs and was asked the purpose of the remaining expenditure, he said it was to cover administration, insurance and contingency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us adopt a realistic approach to this issue. The relevant agency in Madrid can do the job for one tenth of the cost because it knows what it is doing and does not accept this kind of nonsense. It also runs parallel contracts. A much more extensive project than the Dublin metro was completed in 18 months but we are expected to sit up and cheer because we are told the Dublin service will be delivered in 2016. Late delivery is the worst thing we can possibly have. The Govern<Col N="741" />ment should have the project properly costed, proceed with a sense of urgency and get it completed efficiently. Without question, that can be done. I am glad the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, went to Madrid to investigate the situation there. That is a type of blueprint.</P>
    <P>However, we do not have to rely on Madrid. There are people in Ireland perfectly capable of costing, managing and running the whole operation. I refer to people such as Cormac Rabbitte, who was initially involved with an integrated proposal and is now with another group. Those people have the necessary business expertise and information, having pioneered the whole idea. They produced the arithmetic I used in this House to demonstrate that the Luas, as Senator Wilson has said, could not move a significant number of passengers in the manner which an underground service could achieve, having regard to the variable length of carriages and the potential to increase the frequency of service.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note the reference to the Red Cow roundabout in the motion before the House. That is already subject to traffic jams and running trams across it will make it a million times worse. The case of Abbey Street, Nassau Street and Dawson Street is similar &ndash; absolute traffic chaos will be created. However, we are stuck with it now. It is a waste of money. I hope it will be &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;, to quote Mr. Frank McDonald of <i>The Irish Times</i>. I hope we will enjoy its prettiness, but it will not be practical. However, let us get on with the Luas project.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask a few questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief and I hope the Chair will be flexible. I will deal with just one point. If the same costings were used for the Dublin Airport metro tunnel as for the Dublin Port tunnel, the latter could be extended from Dublin to Belfast. That shows how unrealistic are the costings given by the Railway Procurement Agency for the Dublin metro. Let us get real. Let us involve people such as Cormac Rabbitte. Let us manage the project, using the Madrid experience. We can have a metro within two or three years. I will not wait until 2016.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the motion before the House, there should be significant investment in Dublin Bus. I note the reference to investment in a new bus fleet, but that follows a reference to enabling new operators to enter the market. I wonder what is meant by that. Investment in Dublin Bus is very important. The current policy in relation to Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann seems to be to make them unviable, blame them for the problem and then seek privatisation, when the real problem is the Government's lack of investment and support for the two public bus services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many good initiatives by Dublin Bus. At a time of much trumpeting about taxi <Col N="742" />deregulation, Dublin Bus was introducing very well regarded additional Nitelink services. That is the type of development which should be supported. In my area, Dublin Bus has tried to introduce additional Cityspeed routes but this has been turned down. Recently, at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport, it was stated that Bus Éireann had been asked to discontinue a very successful bus service from Cavan to facilitate a private company running a service at a much less convenient time for the public. That is just not acceptable. I am not saying that Dublin Bus is guilt-free, but most of the blame lies with the Government for any failure on the company's part to provide services.</P>
    <P>The notion that public private partnerships are the most cost-effective mechanism is absurd. Everybody knows that PPPs are the most expensive option for the State. Sometimes there is no option but to have PPPs. However, the reason there are no other options in such cases is due to lack of investment and delay by the Government. Due to Government dithering over the Luas/metro, we will not, as Senator Wilson stated, see these services in my area of Dublin until 2015 or even later, and it is sad to boast about that.</P>
    <P>The bottom line in public transport should not be about balancing the books for the public transport providers, but about the quality of the service for the consumer and the economic benefits achieved in terms of addressing congestion, pollution and people's quality of life when they are getting to work, etc. There is so much more the Government can do to invest in the existing infrastructure of Irish Rail. This is an aspect which has not been mentioned at all and it is important in terms of immediate measures which can be taken to improve public transport. It is important that measures such the doubling of the capacity on the Dublin-Kildare route go ahead as soon as possible and that there are more stations opened along the route in areas like where I live in Lucan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him and the Minister, Deputy Brennan, for their excellent work to date.</P>
      <P>Ten to 15 years ago, nobody could have envisaged in their wildest dreams the dramatic increase in the number of cars on our roads today. Any car salesman or garage owner will tell one that the past number of years have been the most lucrative they have ever experienced. Everybody accepts that the traffic volume in Dublin city is a problem, but it is a one which has to be managed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally, the economy of this country is strong and sound and, despite the doom and gloom merchants, we should have aspirations to improve and enhance our infrastructure. We need to invest further in our transport system and the Government will continue to do so. We must continue to look to the future and factor into our planning the further expansion of our economy and, therefore, our infrastructure requirements. It <Col N="743" />is my contention that even now we should be looking at the provision of other Luas lines throughout the city and beyond. It makes economic sense to avail of the expertise that is available now as a result of the work that has been done to date and the further integration of services is essential to any attempts at improving transport in the city.</P>
    <P>There might be some confusion about the comments of my colleague, Senator Wilson, regarding 2016. That is a references to a plan, A Platform for Change, which was put forward by the DTO. In my opinion, we must look forward and we cannot always look back.</P>
    <P>Like many other vibrant capital cities, Dublin has become congested. Much planning and investment has been put in place and we are in the middle of what are indeed massive works, which will only enhance and improve the living environment in the city. Almost 80% of the work on Luas has been completed and 99% of the removal and replacement of services and utilities has been completed. There has been disruption but it certainly was not as drastic as some commentators were predicting. No buildings have fallen into holes. If we were to listen to some of the predictions, we would never do anything.</P>
    <P>When one considers the scale of the works involved, the disruption to date and commuters frustration is understandable. There is quite an amount of hysteria about how the city will come to a standstill while trams cross the Red Cow roundabout&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The junction is already the busiest in the country and any improvement would be welcome. There is a new Luas bridge over the M50 already in place and there is a new slip road onto the M50 on the city side of the roundabout. These can only improve the situation. The traffic light system will determine the flow of traffic. These changes should improve the flow of traffic in this area.</P>
      <P>For many years there have been people complaining that the Harcourt Street line was closed down. Now we are opening it up again and people are complaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luas is not the only game in town. It is probably the most visible project, but there are a number of other important developments which will go a long way to improving things for everybody. For example, it is planned to increase DART capacity by up to 100% and funding is in place for most of this. Major developments such as the port tunnel and the motorways at Glen of the <Col N="744" />Downs and to Dundalk are well underway or completed.</P>
    <P>There has been major expansion of the rail services from Dublin. Senator Terry mentioned the Maynooth line. There is an expansion plan for that line and for the Drogheda line, and 76 new rail cars are being delivered to Irish Rail. This is all progress which involves huge investment but which will pay dividends for the city and indeed for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister is considering the possibility of the metro to the airport. I agree with Senator Norris that the suggestion about the metro should probably have been looked at more closely in the initial stages, but the reality is that we now have Luas. We are looking at the route to the airport and in my opinion this would provide a properly integrated solution to providing a modern efficient service to the hugely increasing numbers using Dublin Airport. It is estimated that by 2015 up to 30 million passengers per year will use Dublin Airport. By using a public private partnership to implement this and with proper forward planning, there is no doubt that such a service will add to the overall improvement in the transport system for the city. As other Senators pointed out, the example of the metro in Madrid is evidence that it is possible to provide such a service at reasonable cost and within a reasonable timeframe.</P>
    <P>When the first QBCs were introduced, there was huge scepticism. Some commentators dismissed their effectiveness out of hand, but they have been proven wrong. Dublin Bus has proven their effectiveness, with an increase of up to 40% in passenger numbers since their introduction in 1997. This Minister has committed himself to enhancing the QBC system and has called for greater co-operation between the various agencies in order to maximise the impact of these corridors and other measures. I also warmly welcome the setting up of the QBC office as a specific section in Dublin City Council.</P>
    <P>Huge progress has been made in this area. The city has never seen investment on this scale before. With the various projects underway there is bound to be disruption and inconvenience, and that is understandable. However, we are building for our future and for that of our children. There is no doubt that as we progress we will be successful and that this city will be a better place in which to live and work. I congratulate the Minister and I also congratulate Senator Morrissey on his motion.</P>

      <P>I have a habit of taking exception to the metropolitan focus of what is meant to be a national House of the Oireachtas. It is not only in Dublin but in every city in Ireland that severe social and economic problems are caused by traffic congestion. The greater Cork area in which I live will have a population of about 500,000 in ten years. It will have traffic problems by then which are similar to those currently experienced in Dublin. With current public policy, we will <Col N="745" />then have to take on the job of retrospectively fitting an appropriate system of public transport when it will be at its most costly to do so because those in Cork and nationally who have a say about Cork refuse to consider the idea of planning now for a 20-year timescale in terms of at least making land and other services available for future developments.</P>
      <P>Essentially, we are building a roads service in Cork. There is no room anywhere for a light rail service. There would be great difficulty in providing QBCs in Cork without hopelessly disrupting existing traffic routes. If Dublin has learned anything about quality bus corridors it is that if they are really to make a difference they must be located on new land and should not squeeze the space available on existing roads. While it is wonderful, it is not so wonderful for the jammed up cars on the restricted road surface which was designed for perhaps one quarter of the number of cars that this city and region now has.</P>
      <P>People should be persuaded to move from private to public transport. There is a need to provide public transport that is fast, frequent and affordable. We have the least subsidised public transport system in western Europe and expect it to meet contradictory objectives of profitability &ndash; confused with efficiency &ndash; and social and environmental service. It is easy to forget that one of the biggest arguments in favour of public transport is that per user it dramatically reduces the environmental impact.</P>
      <P>As I agree with the motion, I did not table an amendment. I wonder where people have been for the past six years and whether they have looked at the website of the National Roads Authority. It lists six or eight major road projects which were ready to begin and where all legal, planning and other requirements had been met. The only reason they could not proceed was because there was no money available.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Government believes it is the fault of the Opposition that there is no money available. As it becomes desperate, it begins to hark back to the period prior to 1997 as the cause of all its problems. At what stage do Governments stop blaming the previous regime? I suppose at this stage the British Labour Party has probably stopped or perhaps Fianna Fáil in 1973 stopped blaming the 1954 to 1957 coalition Government for the country's problems. Given the economic transformation caused by the good economic policies of the coalition Government from 1994 to 1997, from which the present Government and its predecessor benefited, it is interesting that the first Labour Party Minister for Finance in the history of the State left the economy in better shape than any other Minister for Finance ever did.</P>

      <P>The issue is one of funding needed in Dublin and the rest of the country. In the national development plan the figure for investment in public transport in Limerick, Cork and Waterford was £50 million at a time when the best part of £10 billion was being committed to the greater Dublin area. I do not begrudge one penny of that £10 billion to the greater Dublin area but it was an illusion to imagine that £50 million divided into three cities would be anything more than the metaphorical drop in the ocean.</P>
      <P>I do not understand &ndash; perhaps I do but politically one says one does not &ndash; how we waited so long to notice. How many billions did the 1997 to 2002 Government use on reducing an already low national debt? The Tánaiste plaintively told us we under-borrowed. The reason we under-borrowed was the Government decided &ndash; apart from outrageous tax cuts for the rich &ndash; to reduce the national debt instead of using some of the surplus funds generated by the extraordinary economic efficiency of the previous Government. It decided that cutting the national debt was more important. That is the reason we are now short of money. Eight projects in the National Roads Authority were ready to roll but cannot begin because the Government states it does not have the resources to fund them.</P>
      <P>If we are to have a suitable transport system for this large urban area, we must recognise that it cannot be done on the basis of market forces. Nobody has produced a public transport system based exclusively on such forces. I am fully in favour of market testing to ensure value for money is available. The idea that one can run a public transport system which is profitable according to the normal measurement of profitability is nonsense. Until we overcome this ideological obstacle we will never have a proper public transport system in Dublin.</P>

It states that I pressed ahead on my own and went underground. It also states that I pressed ahead with the Red Cow roundabout and so on. I must have marvellous prowess, not alone physical prowess but also prowess in making judgments and decisions. The editorial is, in all respects, a fabrication. It will be necessary for me &ndash; I do not blame anyone &ndash; to refute the fabrication within the confines of the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>The Irish Times</i>, which I know I am allowed to say.</P>
      <P>I will confine my remarks to Luas on which we had the enthusiastic backing of our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats. Their esteemed spokesperson was an adviser on transport to the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. I do not wish to name him because that would not be fair but Members know the person to whom I am referring. When the matter went to Cabinet on 5 May 1998, there were no more enthusiastic contributors to the debate than the Tánaiste and her colleagues in the Progressive Democrats. They underpinned the programme from then on and were involved in the decision making process. They believed in the project and put forward their ideas, so much so that the adviser on transport to the Tánaiste came forward with papers and constantly came to my Department with suggestions on how he thought the matter should advance. The matter was advanced as the Progressive Democrats Party wished it to advance.</P>
      <P>As I know the import of the editorial in question and the agenda that is being mapped out in it, I want to make it very clear that my comments in this House are completely true. All Government decisions can be examined and cleared. On 25 July 2000, there were further extensive negotiations between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, officials from my Department and officials from her Department and an equitable and proper decision was again reached on a cross-party basis. Rather than having mysterious powers that enabled me to do all these nefarious things, the truth is that the Government made decisions with the enthusiastic backing of the Progressive Democrats. I will be able to refer to what I have said in this House when another such editorial appears.</P>
      <P>When I departed the Department on 6 June 2002, the Luas project was on budget and on time. I wish to make it quite clear that I am not responsible for what has happened in the meantime.</P>

The editorial contains a large broadside against him too &ndash; it says that one should not hold one's breath while waiting for him to do anything. The Minister has given great energy and commitment to pushing forward the agenda for the Luas and metro projects.</P>
      <P>I agree with what my colleagues in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have said about building the metro. I doubt if Madrid represents the magic lamp that we can rub to make everything clear. When one examines these matters one finds that they are different from what one thought they would be. There is no doubt that the metro is needed. Prices have gone up because construction inflation is absolutely enormous, as anyone who examines the roads, the port tunnel, Luas or the metro will know. I support fully the idea of a metro for Dublin, which was put forward in the programme for Government.</P>

    <P>The fact that an all-encompassing and organised system needs to be put in place to create order from chaos is what brings us here this evening to discuss Senator Morrissey's motion. The concept of order implies a totality, an overview and an effort to co-ordinate initiatives so that the traffic problem in Dublin can be addressed. The transport system allows the economy to work, for better or for worse in terms of traffic problems, and without it our economic viability would be at risk. As it stands, transport inefficiencies reduce the attractiveness of our capital city as a location for industry, commerce and <Col N="750" />tourism.

      <P>In a recent Small Firms Association survey of manufacturing, distribution, retail and services companies in Dublin, 93% of respondents stated that they were dissatisfied with the Government's handling of the traffic situation. The motion put down by Senator Morrissey this evening is a damning indictment of the Government's ability to deal with the problem of traffic chaos in and around this city. The survey points to the lack of confidence in the Government's capacity to deal with the traffic problems.</P>
      <P>Taken in isolation, the quality bus corridors and long overdue Luas system do not go anywhere near giving commuters a viable alternative to their cars. Senator O'Rourke made the point that more people should stop using their cars but it is impossible for them to do so because there is not a proper transport system in place. The provision of a comprehensive metro system, park and ride sites, integrated tickets, proper shelters and up-to-date information on bus and train services &ndash; which must run to schedule &ndash; is imperative.</P>
      <P>Currently, 23 Departments, Government agencies and non-govemmental organisations are involved in traffic management &ndash; or mismanagement. The continuing and escalating problem of traffic gridlock and inadequate public transport would lead one to believe this is perhaps a case of too many cooks.</P>
      <P>Given that Dublin's commuter belt extends from Dundalk to Gorey and as far inland as Longford, Dublin is set to occupy a land area as large as Los Angeles. Where is the national spatial strategy document that promised city status for Mullingar, Tullamore and Athlone to draw traffic from the capital? Is it dead because of a shortage of funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The spread of development generating a significant level of car commuting is neither environmentally nor economically sustainable. Ireland is now the most car-dependent society in the world, despite insurance costs that have more than doubled in the past two years. The key elements in the efficiency of cities are: size; the speed at which people and goods are moved; the sprawl or relative location of jobs to homes. Achieving efficiency is these three categories determines the efficiency of the city's productivity and competitiveness. Dublin, unfortunately, displays signs of critical inefficiency in all three areas. If this is not rectified, it faces economic strangulation. The motion tabled by the Progressive Democrats does not go any way towards alleviating the serious traffic problems in the city. I understand the Pro<Col N="752" />gressive Democrats have a plan B, to use the Luas line for buses. Perhaps we will hear an elaboration on this.</P>

As they are so enthusiastic about it and as I am in the Department of Transport, I hope that when the Estimates are considered, we will find them equally supportive at Cabinet in order that we can gather all the funding earmarked by Members on both sides of this House.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne used the adjective &ldquo;debacle&rdquo; in regard to Luas while Senator Terry went as far as to say traffic conditions in Dublin were &ldquo;absolutely unacceptable&rdquo;. I was in the Seanad on at least three or four previous occasions to debate various aspects of transport and I am delighted to have the opportunity to do so again this evening. However, the Opposition should stop trying to flog a dead horse. Huge gains have been made in the area of transport. Members have been elected to deal with issues other than transport. The Opposition should concentrate on something more relevant because, as I said, progress is being made on transport and it takes time for this to become manifest. Given time and the necessary funding, we will continue to make improvements.</P>
      <P>It seems that if the Fine Gael Party was in government, Senator Terry would put all her eggs into the transport basket, perhaps leaving nothing for health, the environment or anything else. I am all for the maximum amount going on transport. It is a pity that she was not over here to persuade us, and others in the transport area, that&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;we would be able to manage this because we certainly require funding to implement our strategy which I accept will require time. The economy has been growing at an average of 8-9% per year under the combined Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government. Granted, it has recently taken a dip.</P>
      <P>I recently attended a Council of Ministers meeting in Athens where the Greek Minister for Transport pointed out that the number of cars in Greece had doubled since 1990 due to the strong economy. I said we had the same type of problem. The same is true of other cities throughout Europe but we are progressing. The coalition Government has a great sense of pride in regard to its achievements in the area of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a speech which consists of innumerable pages into which I will delve from time to time. I hope one can take it as read. I made notes as the debate progressed and the areas touched on are: <Col N="753" />Dublin Bus, suburban rail, taxis, roads, the metro, Luas, public private partnerships, the Red Cow roundabout, newspapers and even an epilogue from Senator Ryan which I can only describe as revisionism and parochialism. If he wants to go down the road of revisionism and ask when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will stop blaming previous Governments, I remind him that during the period 1983-87 the national debt doubled from £13 billion to £26 billion. Is it any wonder that we go back and say this?</P>
    <P>The Government has been proactive in its response to the challenge of traffic congestion in Dublin and shown its continued commitment to enhancing transport infrastructure in Dublin through unprecedented levels of investment. Under the national development plan, a wide range of initiatives have been taken to upgrade our transport infrastructure and services and reduce congestion.</P>
    <P>Among the topics referred to by Senators was that of quality bus corridors. Nine quality bus corridors are now operational in Dublin and we plan to significantly increase this number. The Stillorgan QBC, which I have used, gets people out of private cars. Peak period passenger numbers are up by 150% which proves that if used properly, they will work. In some cases bus journey times have been cut by up to 40%.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus has embarked on a major fleet replacement and expansion programme. By the end of 2002, its fleet capacity had been increased by 23% compared with 1999. As a consequence, more than one third of the fleet now consists of low floor and fully accessible buses. Bus Éireann has significantly increased its capacity on all commuter routes.</P>
    <P>With regard to suburban rail services, there has been a 50% increase in the number of DART cars since the year 2000. A further 40 cars will be delivered next year. Later this year, as Senator Brady pointed out, Irish Rail will bring into service 76 additional rail cars for operation on Dublin suburban rail services, while next year Luas will become operational. In 2005 a further 40 DART cars will be put into service.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Office traffic management grants are funding measures such as the strategic cycle network, pedestrian routes, computerised traffic signal control systems, travel and parking information systems and the development of integrated land use and transport network plans. The number of taxis in the Dublin area has also been referred to. Taxi numbers have increased by 200%.</P>
    <P>The motion is about congestion. I am informing the House of what is planned to counteract this, not as Senator Norris indicated by 2016 but by 2005. The provisions that will be implemented will go a long way towards easing the congestion problems in Dublin. In addition, some &euro;1.4 billion is being spent on the infrastructure for major road projects in the Dublin city area, which includes the Dublin Port tunnel, the south-eastern motorway and the second Westlink <Col N="754" />bridge. I hope that all these projects will ease Dublin's traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>Senator Morrissey raised the metro issue vis-à-vis public private partnerships. To my knowledge, the Government has decided that the metro project should be undertaken by a public private partnership operation. Public private partnerships represent a growing trend that has been developing in free market economies. Critically, such partnerships can allow a faster delivery of individual projects by linking the provision of an asset or service to payments, particularly in relation to complex capital projects such as these. As a number of Senators have pointed out, this is the largest single infrastructural project undertaken in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The RPA sometimes comes in for criticism but it has developed the first phase of the metro, centred on the line between Dublin Airport and the city centre. A preliminary public consultation has taken place on the metro and a pre-qualification exercise for potential bidders has been put in the place by the RPA. We are going about this in a professional way, having inserted a pre-qualification clause. Believe it or not, some 18 bidders were subsequently deemed to be pre-qualified for the metro project by the Railway Procurement Agency, when the Government takes that decision. There is no lack of professional people available.</P>
    <P>In November 2002, our Department received the outline business case for phase one of the metro from the agency and, as I have said, it is the largest proposed infrastructural project in the history of the State. Additional matters will have to be taken into account, including legal aspects, planning and technical considerations based on practice elsewhere, particularly in Madrid.</P>
    <P>I draw Senators' attention to a headline in <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>of 1 June 2003, which read &ldquo;Revealed: full scale of looming Luas chaos&rdquo;. Senator Brady has pointed out that, to date, the project is 80% complete, yet here a journalist has written a front page article in a Sunday newspaper which contradicts that. The article stated, &ldquo;Dublin's Luas system is set to produce traffic chaos in the capital, with at least seven new commuter blackspots at city centre junctions.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The report continues:</P>
      <P>The Luas trams&nbsp;. will have priority over all other traffic . an average of 124 buses pass up and down O'Connell Street every hour. Taxis, cyclists, private motorists and even pedestrians are facing similar delays at the city centre's busiest junction&nbsp;. All traffic will have to give way to trams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" />That is all factual. One has to show the Luas positive discrimination, otherwise it will not work. The same reporter never got in contact with our Department for a view on the issue. There seems to be an agenda in the newspapers to hammer the Luas project without asking anybody about their opinions.</P>
    <P>We have been to Madrid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been to Vienna, Amsterdam, Lyons and Grenoble. In all these places, light rail systems are working perfectly because they have been given priority. If the Luas is not given priority we will not succeed in what we have set out to do, which is making Dublin a place where people are able to walk freely around the city centre. If such positive discrimination is not shown to the Luas we cannot achieve that. Currently, there are buses and cars in the city centre but we are trying to get people out of their cars and on to public transport. It works in Madrid, Vienna and Amsterdam and we have taken all those issues into account. It is an insult to the intelligence of the Irish people to claim, as some newspapers have done, that we do not have people in this country who are capable of doing exactly what has been done in those foreign cities. The only two EU capitals that do not have a metro system are Luxembourg and Dublin, which has a population of 1.2 million. That leaves much to be desired.</P>
      <P>While it is impossible to say precisely, the overall cost of the metro to the Exchequer will be largely dependent on what the private sector is prepared to put into it. Following consideration of the Railway Procurement Agency's proposals by the Department, it is intended to being proposals to Government in the coming weeks. Arguments have been made about the costings of all these projects and proposals for legislative change are also being considered. I have heard the argument made this evening that it can be done for one tenth of the cost in Madrid. Unfortunately, that is a reflection of the psyche in this country. Legislative changes, whether they are to be constitutional or otherwise, will have to be introduced to see whether we can make progress on the cost issue.</P>
      <P>Those matters, including the EU's 24-hour working rule directive, are determining the cost of these projects and we cannot proceed with the current system. All these things have to be taken into consideration because the directive introduces a 40-hour working week. We will have to examine where flexibility can be allowed so that projects can be completed in a shorter time. We will be examining all these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality bus corridors have been hugely successful, although I accept that some of them leave a little bit to be desired. However, when we compared the statistics for November 2002 with <Col N="756" />the previous year, the QBC network showed a 16% increase. Over the same period, there was a reduction in car traffic on the QBC routes of 7%. On the Stillorgan route, the average bus journey time was roughly half that of the average car journey.</P>
    <P>Plans to accelerate the provision of quality bus corridors in Dublin and other urban areas around the country were recently announced. The relevant planning authorities, including the Dublin Transportation Office, Dublin City Council's director of traffic, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, have been asked to bring forward an enhanced traffic plan for the city and to engage in discussions on how to accelerate the role of the bus in Dublin. With regard to other aspects of the bus service, the Government recognises that the private sector has a key role to play in bringing about improvements in the supply and standard of public transport. In respect of bus transport, we are examining privatisation as a means of creating competition, not alone on routes but also in the quality and standards of vehicles used.</P>
    <P>The delivery of improved public transport to passengers requires a combination of investment and organisational and structural reform. It is important that the significant investment made in recent years &ndash; which all sides have acknowledged &ndash; and continued under this Government, is supplemented by the necessary reforms to ensure services are delivered in a more effective and efficient way to customers. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, has already indicated his intention to reform CIE and to provide for the introduction of competition for the provision of bus services into the greater Dublin area initially and, at a later stage, in rural areas. Discussions have taken place with the social partners in recent months regarding the Minister's proposals and this process is continuing.</P>
    <P>The introduction of light rail systems in a number of European cities in recent years has demonstrated, contrary to what the<i> Sunday Business Post</i> stated, that they have the capacity to improve the quality of urban life. Light rail achieves this by reducing congestion on the streets. As I said, one will not manage this unless one gives the system priority over other forms of transport such as private cars and buses. It contributes to a more pleasant and accessible urban environment, making the streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians. The Minister made the point during his last contribution in the Seanad that one third of people killed on the roads are killed within the 30 mile limit. Dublin can look forward to reaping the benefits of the intensive light rail construction works under way in different parts of the city.</P>
    <P>The trams will bring major benefits to Dublin. I am confident, as stated by Senators, that with integration with the bus network, the Luas will attract many new commuters onto public transport. It will not just facilitate transport from the suburbs to the city, it will also facilitate travel to areas important to the economy of Dublin city <Col N="757" />and county such as the Sandyford and Naas Road areas. When it is operational, the journey time from Sandyford to Dublin city centre will be approximately 20 minutes.</P>
    <P>The 26 30 metre trams for the Luas Tallaght line have all been delivered while eight of the 14 40 metre trams for the Sandyford line have been delivered to date. The trams are being tested with a view to full commissioning for commencement of services as early as possible. Connex, operator of the Luas, is engaged in preparations towards commencement of services next year and has begun to recruit train drivers as well as setting up operations and management structures.</P>
    <P>The two Luas lines under construction form part of the DTO strategy to 2016. The metro will not take until 2016, it is Platform for Change, the official strategy document, which extends to 2016. In this context, proposals are awaited from the RPA for extensions of the Sandyford line to Cherrywood and the Tallaght line to the Docklands area. It is very important in all major projects such as the Dublin Port tunnel to have public consultation which is already under way in these areas.</P>
    <P>I thank the traders and residents with whom departmental officials have been in touch for engaging with us. They have been discommoded and had their businesses upset.</P>
    <P>The Red Cow roundabout was also referred to in the newspaper article. The Opposition seems to know very little about this matter other than calling it the &ldquo;Mad Cow Roundabout&rdquo; or anything that grabs the attention of the media.</P>

The NRA has come up with &euro;10 million and we have the extra &euro;10 million, if necessary. We have put in place someone who has experience in this area. I believe in the intelligence of our civil servants and engineers who say the filter system at the roundabout is worth a try in the taxpayer's interest, that we should try it out rather than spend &euro;20 million on it at this point. We will, however, build the overpass, if necessary. I would prefer to leave it to the people concerned rather than listen to quotes from unqualified people here&mdash;</P>

If it works, &euro;20 million of taxpayer's money will be saved; if not, we will have the &euro;20 million for the overpass.</P>

      <P>I ask Members to leave the matter to the experts. Perhaps they should visit the port tunnel, see it in a three dimensional way, not look at it through abstract pages supplied by those who object to it. They should look at it for themselves, put their hands on it, feel the three dimensional aspect and the whole area and then come back and have a relevant debate in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the Waterford road. I am not specifically familiar with it but will ask my officials to raise the issue. Current projects include the upgrade of the M1 between Dublin Airport and Balbriggan and the M50 south eastern motorway which are due for completion. The Dublin Port tunnel is due for completion by 2005. The Glen of the Downs project on the N11 is also due for completion. The Westlink Bridge on the <Col N="759" />M50 will open in August this year. In addition, planning and design of the upgrade of the N2 between Kill and Naas are at a very advanced stage. There are many other initiatives into which I will not go.</P>
    <P>Another matter referred to on radio recently was the setting up of a traffic corps on which the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, are working. There seems to be an argument about enforcement. I was on a radio programme recently when someone said one had a one in 1,500 chance of being caught on the roads. I want to state the facts which back up what the Garda has been doing. In 1999 the number of speeding offences was 130,000. In 2002 the number of prosecutions brought by the enforcement agencies for speeding offences had increased to 350,000. A further 100,000 prosecutions could be added for drink driving, driving without insurance and other offences. More than 450,000 offences have been detected.</P>
    <P>There are in the region of 1.2 million cars on our roads. A recent report stated there was a one in 1,500 chance of being caught for a driving offence. Given that more than 400,000 detections were made in 2002 by the enforcement agencies and that there are 1.2 million cars on the roads, there is a one in four chance of being detected if there is a fault with an individual or a mechanical component. Naturally, we all want to have a dedicated traffic corps. However, I pay tribute to the enforcement agencies because there is a one in four chance of being detected if one has taken drugs, drink or there is a fault with the vehicle.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for allowing me to join the debate this evening. It is always a pleasure to come before the House. I also thank Senator Morrissey and the Progressive Democrats for allowing me to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his summary of the debate.</P>
      <P>In tabling this motion, the Progressive Democrats sought to have the Minister of State come before the House to put on record the route it is intended to take in respect of transport. We are endeavouring to adopt European models of best practise and value for money. We know that traffic congestion is costing us money. We also know that investment will be required and we need to select our options.</P>
      <P>In the case of the metro, we favoured the PPP model. I am delighted with the very positive progress report the Minister of State provided. He certainly has a supporter in the Progressive Democrats Party in terms of the way the metro issue is being addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to look at the quality bus corridors. I know that there will be a roll-out of additional QBCs in the future and, in that regard, we should adopt the Stillorgan route as our model, particularly in light of the difficulties <Col N="760" />experienced on other routes. Before we extend the system further, we must remove the glitches from it.</P>

      <P>With regard to putting 20% of Dublin Bus services out to franchise, Members on this side of the House are not talking about dismantling Dublin Bus; we are concerned with competition and value. During the past four years, Dublin Bus increased the service on the No. 37 route from ten to 18 buses but, because of infrastructural problems, it is still carrying the same number of people. The time spent making journeys on that route has increased from 50 to 70 minutes. On one hand, there is a fantastic system, such as that which operates on the Stillorgan QBC, in place but there are hold-ups on other routes. These problems should be addressed in conjunction with local authorities in order that we can achieve what was envisaged with the existing QBCs.</P>
      <P>My party supports the proposed break-up of CIE and the concept of competition. We thank our partners in Government for the way they have dealt with this debate and for the contributions they made to it. We are anxious to see a Dublin metro system introduced because we believe Luas may not do everything that it was intended to do. It will only be one piece of the entire jigsaw.</P>
      <P>We want Dublin Bus to perform; we do not want to see it dismantled. One way in which it can perform is by the roll-out of proper QBCs. To have proper route evaluation and performance criteria, we need competition in the system. I ask that we progress along that route and I do not foresee any major problems. We have seen what competition has done in the area of air transport and such competition should be encouraged in respect of ground transport. I thank the Minister of State and I look forward to his returning to the House to provide a further progress report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this issue on the Adjournment a month ago. It concerns St. Brigid's secondary school, Goresbridge, County Kilkenny. Approximately three months ago, the school's board of management received confirmation that the Department of Education and <Col N="761" />Science intends to close the school, on a phased basis, during the next two years.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment in May to ascertain what is the position of the Department and the plan to close the school was confirmed in the reply I received. Since then, local residents, students, past pupils and parents have organised an action group which has submitted a quite detailed survey of the school's catchment area. This indicated that the possibility exists for significant increases in the numbers of students attending St. Brigid's in the future and that the school could remain viable.</P>
      <P>The problem that has existed for a number of years &ndash; it was made apparent at a recent public meeting in Goresbridge &ndash; is that very little, if any, capital investment was put into improving the physical structure of the school in the past 30 to 40 years. From a health and safety point of view, the building is not in great condition. That results from a continuous effort by the Department of Education and Science to have the school closed at some point.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the number of students attending the school at present &ndash; approximately 130 or 140 &ndash; is small. A number of different bus routes, which take students from the school's immediate catchment area to Kilkenny, Bagenalstown and Carlow, are in operation and these detract from the school's prospects.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the action group has put a lot of work into its report and that there is strong public feeling in the Goresbridge area that the school should survive, I would like to be informed of the Department's current view on the matter. I have tried to find obtain information in this regard from the Department in recent weeks but I have not been successful. I have made many phone calls, but an answer has not been forthcoming. People in Goresbridge and those who work at and attend St. Brigid's are concerned that, once the leaving certificate examinations conclude, the issue will be forgotten. It appears that no information will be forthcoming until September and that the school will be closed in the next two years. I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's response.</P>

      <P>The future of St. Brigid's Secondary School, Goresbridge, County Kilkenny, was the subject of recent debate in the House. However, I am glad of the opportunity to outline the up-to-date position.</P>
      <P>The future of this school has been uncertain since a decision of the board of management to close the school was announced over five years ago. The board decided to phase out the operation of the school over two years. This decision was reached after consideration of several issues that were impacting negatively on the school. It was acknowledged that the viability of the school would become increasingly untenable due to declining enrolments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" />A consequence of declining enrolment is that the number of teachers in a school would also be reduced and the school's capacity to deliver a full range of subject options would inevitably be curtailed. A groundswell of public support for the school, and opposition to its closure, resulted in a reversal of the board's decision and my Department was notified of this in June 1998.</P>
    <P>Since then, a number of proposals aimed at increasing enrolment and securing the future of the school have been made. These proposals included the possible assumption of responsibility for the school by County Kilkenny VEC and the adjustment of the existing catchment boundaries and current transport arrangements to facilitate increasing enrolments at St Brigid's.</P>
    <P>Central to any proposal for the continuation of the school is the need for extensive capital investment in the infrastructure of the building. The reality is that enrolment trends have not changed in recent years and the indications are that, on current trends, an optimistic projection of future enrolment would be in the region of 125. This projection is based on a pattern of enrolment where in excess of 60% of the total first-year intake comes from outside the catchment area. The school currently attracts less than a quarter of the potential from schools in its catchment area.</P>
    <P>The trend of pupils from Goresbridge attending a number of other schools outside the area appears to be long established and the Minister is not convinced that any intervention at St. Brigid's would reverse these established patterns. Over time he considered the various proposals and studied the projected future enrolment potential at the school. He is reviewing the latest submission made to the Department by the local action group and will respond within the next few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this item on the Adjournment and the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, for being present. There is an urgent need for additional funding for service provision from the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for the health boards and service providers for people with disabilities. It is important that the Minister realises that there is a crisis. There have been cuts, with the worst yet to come, in the provision of funds for services such as respite care, residential care and continuing education for people with intellectual disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appalling cases about which many of us heard from the protesters at the gates of Leinster House yesterday and those we know in our communities are an indictment of the Government and its disregard for and neglect of people with a disability. The hardships endured by parents, carers and voluntary organisations when told that respite care can no longer be provided for their loved ones cannot be understood without wit<Col N="763" />nessing it first-hand. Many elderly people worry about what the future holds for their loved ones when they pass on.</P>
    <P>People with a disability, and the organisations which represent them, are the forgotten people of Ireland. The Taoiseach proclaimed that he was their champion, yet not too long ago he refused to talk to people outside the Mansion House. Yesterday he was nowhere to be seen when the protesters came to the gates of Leinster House. Many more would have been there if they had access to respite care.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks in funding are a denial of basic services to people with great needs. An extra &euro;35 million would address the needs of and eliminate the hardship endured by many. The allocation of &euro;75 million for the new Government aircraft would adequately provide for people with special needs, yet many are struggling to provide respite care. Many have received letters which state schools can no longer provide further and continuing education for people with special needs over 18 years of age. I ask the Government to recall these letters and allay the fears of the many parents concerned. Is it not ironic that only a fortnight ago, the Minister for Education and Children, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was in the House telling us about access to education for the disadvantaged, yet now another arm of government is sending out letters stating people with disabilities over 18 years of age no longer have a future in education? This cannot be reconciled.</P>
    <P>The people protesting outside the gates of Leinster House were fuming with anger with regard to this issue. There was no trace of any Government representative &ndash; Minister or Minister of State, Deputy or Senator &ndash; to tell them the facts. What is required is a mere &euro;35 million to alleviate hardship. A person who has declared himself the champion of the disabled has questions to answer. There is also a fear that the Taoiseach will portray himself as the European champion of the disabled at the opening of the Special Olympics. If this mockery takes place, the anger unleashed yesterday is only a symptom of what is to follow. I hope the Minister of State will convey to the Taoiseach, if he is not already aware, that if the crisis continues, those whose loved ones are denied basic rights to respite care and continuing education will vent their anger in many ways after the Special Olympics.</P>
    <P>There are now 600 people on waiting lists with no access to a service. There are a further 1,500 on waiting lists who must be treated as ordinary citizens and given their entitlements and rights. There is also anger about the Government's failure to bring forward a rights-based disability Bill, the lack of which is a major concern. While it is kept in abeyance, that anger will fester. Why does the Government have to torture not only carers and parents but also these unfortunate people who also have rights? If it continues to deny them their rights, we can no longer say we are a caring society and that we treat all our people equally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter and will convey to the Taoiseach the points he raised.</P>
      <P>I wish to record some facts. Since 1997 my Department has allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector, which has resulted in significant and unprecedented developments in the quality and quantity of health related services being provided for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Some are shouting and screaming about the issues the Senator outlined. With other political parties, which are politically motivating some of the issues being raised, his party had an opportunity to deliver while in government. I challenge anybody to check the record of what was put into the disability sector from 1997 onwards or take the two year period 1997-98&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the road the Minister of State is going down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and make a fair comparison with what was allocated in the previous two years and the significant and unprecedented developments will be clearly apparent.</P>
      <P>Massive additional funding of &euro;27 million has been allocated to services for persons with disabilities and those with autism in 2003 to meet the full year costs of 2002 developments and further enhance services in the sector. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to &euro;288 million, made in the services in recent years and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>Approximately &euro;100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include residential, respite, home support services, which include personal assistance, therapy and day care services.</P>
      <P>A significant proportion of this funding, more than &euro;20 million, has been provided specifically for home support services. A further &euro;81 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and issues such as the provision of technical aids and appliances. Between 1997 and 2002 an extra &euro;188 million revenue and &euro;139 million capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of &euro;327 million for the maintenance and development of services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Included in this funding is more than &euro;27 million allocated to meet identified needs in existing services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government was used to put in place a large range of additional services, including more than 900 new residential places. These residential places were not available in the years when other political parties had an opportunity to put them in place. Therefore, let us call a spade a spade and be fair to one another. Who provided <Col N="765" />these places when they had an opportunity? The Fianna Fáil led Administration provided 900 additional residential&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is denying provision for those over the age of 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.</P>
      <P>In the current year further additional funding of &euro;13 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of 2002 developments and further enhance health related support services. This brings total extra investment in these services to &euro;340 million over seven years, of which over &euro;200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</P>
      <P>In particular, around &euro;15 million has been invested in health related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, which we recognise is extremely important, home support and outreach support to children of schoolgoing age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the waiting lists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite this significant investment, I acknowledge that demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services, in particular, even though the numbers in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continue to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the experience internationally in service provision for this cohort group.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to the Senator's point about nobody being prepared to meet a group of people and tell them the facts. I invite the Senator to bring any group to meet me and I would be happy to hear their comments, take whatever action I can on foot of them and clearly outline the facts to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is money they want, not facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be genuinely helpful in a meaningful way to try to assist people who have concerns. I acknowledge there are gaps in the services. I also acknowledge the benefits of rights based legislation for the disability sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to deal with the issue of loved ones and those other phrases the Senator used. I have not yet come across a person who has a loved one with a disability who has not been provided with the level of care required, as the Senator put it, particularly when the parent has passed on. Normally the services like to have an input in the pro<Col N="766" />vision of some level of care for the person who requires it in order that should anything happen to the person providing the 24 hour care, they would have a knowledge of the individual requiring care and be able to intervene and provide the level of services required. It is regrettable that people are creating concern among parents, some of whom are elderly and have genuine concerns that a service will not be in place for their children. However, I have not come across a case where a service has not been put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the letters been withdrawn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>When I meet such a group, they express their concerns and there is proper interaction. When I ask them if they want their child to go into residential care, I do not believe the Senator will disagree with me when I say a parent will normally say, &ldquo;I have looked after my child for the past 20 to 30 years and intend to look after him or her until I die, but it is when I die I would like to have a service in place.&rdquo; A service is usually put in place. Those scaremongering parents by saying there may be no service in place are most unfair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about continuing education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from the experience of having been involved in the provision and delivery of health services as a member of the largest health board in the country and the only health authority, initially the EHB and latterly the ERHA and the NAHB. I have seen a tremendous change in the quality, quantity and value of the level of care we provide for people in the intellectual disability sector. I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to highlight this.</P>
      <P>The overall economic position in 2003 has implications for all aspect of public investment, as reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health service. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for people with disabilities. While it is not possible to continue the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years, my Department will work closely with all the structures, whether they be health boards or other structures, that will be in place or any other service providers in relation to service provision for 2003.</P>
      <P>I know that while my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley and I are in the Department of Health and Children we will do everything possible to improve, enhance and develop service provision for the intellectual disability sector.</P>
