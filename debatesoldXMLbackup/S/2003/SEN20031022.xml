      <P>I have received notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that a rehabilitation plan for old mine sites at Silvermines, County Tipperary, is agreed and implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business as proposed. If ever one wanted to know what Armageddon will be like, all one would need to do is travel through the traffic in Dublin this morning. I apologise for being slightly late.</P>
      <P>Despite the setback in the Northern talks yesterday, much was achieved and a great deal has been achieved in recent weeks, particularly in terms of the new agreement that appears to be close to conclusion between the Sinn Féin Party and the Ulster Unionist Party. Both Governments deserve our praise for their efforts in the past few weeks. I am seeking a debate on Northern Ireland, not immediately but at some stage in the coming weeks, in order that these matters can be teased out in greater detail. One thing is clear, namely, that the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic look to the Good Friday Agreement and the full implementation thereof to bring about peace and reconciliation between green and orange in this country. We thought we were close to achieving that yesterday. We can come closer to it in the coming days to ensure public confidence in the process is restored within Northern Ireland and throughout this island and that all those party to the Agreement do their best to ensure success and the agreement is bedded down. I wish the parties well. At this time I encourage all Members of the Oireachtas to temper their remarks in view of the ongoing discussions that need to take place. In that regard, I wish the Governments well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship and Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill 2003 is an excellent Bill proposed by Senator Quinn. Will the Leader indicate if the Government is in a position to accept this Bill on Second Stage? The Fine Gael group in this House looks forward to the Government supporting the Bill on Second Stage and letting it move to Committee Stage. It deals with the rather murky area of passports and <Col N="403" />the granting of naturalisation. I encourage the Government to accept the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything Senator Brian Hayes has said about Northern Ireland. I agree to the Order of Business. We will soon have a debate on the Hanly report. I commend the content of the order concerning Simpson's Hospital to other small hospitals around the country. It is good to see the board of a hospital deciding to change the <i>modus </i>under which it operates if change if required. Many hospitals could look at this motion and see the changes Simpson's Hospital proposes to make in the way in which it operates. As Members know, it has operated under the same charter for nearly 200 years.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader provide for a debate on agriculture? The Minister for Agriculture and Food has decided to introduce complete decoupling of the payment arrangements within his Department. While I agree with this, I am sure many Members are anxious to have a debate on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Brian Hayes's travails in the traffic. I note the NRA met with a committee of the Oireachtas yesterday and said, yet again, it could not impose performance criteria on the West Link bridges because of the way the contract was written. In light of what we have heard here about the demands for performance appraisal from public servants and the demand that their contracts be effectively rewritten to ensure performance appraisal, I invite the Government to seek the best legal advice on whether it can impose performance criteria in this regard. That bridge is a disgrace. Figures were produced yesterday highlighting the inadequacy of the number of toll-booths. Despite having a traffic volume of more than five times that of the M1, there are less toll-booths. This is disgraceful and it is time this body was told it cannot abuse a State granted monopoly in the way it does.</P>
      <P>Regarding a number of items on the Order of Business, it is a good idea in principle that matters are referred to an appropriate committee. However, both Houses should receive a report to ensure these are dealt with to the satisfaction of the committees and conclusions are drawn. Otherwise, we could have things bouncing between the Houses and the committees without any certainty that they were properly reflected on. I am not casting aspersions on any committee. However, there ought to be a simple process by which we would at least know where to find information to show a particular decision was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree with what Senator Brian Hayes said and that we all must temper our language on Northern Ireland. I agree with one thing SDLP leader Mark Durkan said last night, that one of the problems was that there were only two parties to the agreement and as no one else was there they could not verify precisely what was agreed. We have two conflicting versions of what was <Col N="404" />agreed and that is part of the risk of only having two bodies involved. It was a decision taken by the two Governments to facilitate negotiations between two parties but one of the problems is that nobody was there to verify what was agreed. One of the fantastic roles of the SDLP for the last 20 to 30 years has been that of bridge-builder and if other parties had been present in these negotiations there would have been considerably less room for confusion. There is a lesson to be learned from that about how to handle this in future. I do not wish to say anything beyond that because we could jeopardise what we hope will be considerable progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the day to pass without referring briefly to the situation in Northern Ireland. I acknowledge and respect the views expressed by Senator Brian Hayes and I wish both Governments well as they try to overcome the current impasse. I also welcome the commitment to holding elections in Northern Ireland in November and I hope we will see an Executive coming out of those elections. I also hope that those parties which have always held the line of reason will be acknowledged in any such Executive and will form part of it. Apart from that I concur with previous speakers, as the less said the better. I hope we can overcome this impasse and take a major leap forward to bring peace to the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider extending the time for the discussion of the Hanly report? Two and three quarter hours are scheduled for that debate but that may not be sufficient, as many Senators will want to express their views on the impact of the report on the health services all over the country and not just in the pilot areas.</P>
      <P>As a matter of urgency I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Transport in relation to the horrific accident in Clare over the weekend, where two lives were tragically lost and others were seriously injured. I extend our sympathies to the families of all involved on their tragic loss. The significant issue is the ease with which young people can purchase cars of that kind for very little money. Those young people travelled from Galway to Clare and crashed, probably at high speed, causing this tragedy. It is important the Minister explains to the Seanad the opportunities he has had to revise current legislation or to introduce new or emergency legislation to make it impossible for such accidents to occur again. This was not a unique situation; it happened before but thankfully the gardaí intercepted the car before a tragedy like last weekend's could occur. The Leader should treat this as an urgent matter to ensure another accident cannot happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse Senator Brian Hayes's comments on Northern Ireland. The Leader should impress on the Government the importance of restoring the profile of the SDLP, which has been involved in this process at all times. It is important the SDLP <Col N="405" />takes its rightful place in the negotiations and gets due credit for the heroic work it has done down the years. It is sad that party has been more or less excluded at this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his decision on decoupling having engaged in extensive consultations. Accordingly, I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come into the House so we can have a debate on the matter in the next week or two before all the i's are dotted and t's crossed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we have a debate on the North of Ireland. I had expected up until mid-afternoon yesterday that this would be a triumphant day and that we would all be heaping praise on people and saying how well things had gone. This obviously does not seem to have happened, but some significant things did. It is worthwhile putting them on record, particularly the speech of Gerry Adams, which was quite an astonishing move forward. I very much welcome it. It is important the way in which the Unionists have given a welcome to this very important speech. The problem was that General de Chastlelain is a soldier; he is not a politician. He was not up to the spin. There was too much spin and too much hype. We were led up to this announcement and people were talking about choreography. They had better get a new choreographer because it did not work. </P>
      <P>I agree with people who said it was a shame the SDLP was excluded. That was very damaging in my opinion for practical reasons that have been put on record but also from the point of view of choreography. Why did they not have Mark Durkan at No. 10 Downing Street and, if necessary, tell him to sit in the corner and read <i>The Irish Times</i> for half an hour, after which the negotiators would come out wearing big smiles and saying everything was on track? That is the kind of political management we need. It is a pity this has happened. The people in the North of Ireland are tough enough to listen to a few words from the Seanad. I do not think we need to be so mealy mouthed about it; they are practical, realistic politicians. I hope and believe they will get this back on track. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be the only person in this House to take a dissenting view of Mother Teresa, and I say that with respect. I take a different view of the political impact of her work. I want to express my concern, and ask that it be transmitted to the appropriate quarters, that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, attended as a representative of the Government of the people of Ireland at the beatification of Mother Teresa in the light of the fact that the miraculous cure attributed to her has been challenged significantly by the two doctors who treated the woman concerned. They said that she did not have cancer and that she was responding, as anticipated, to treatment for a tubercular cyst, which disappeared as they had antici<Col N="406" />pated. It is a pity the Government is involved in a hoax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Brian Hayes and the other speakers who wish both Governments, the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, well. I place on record my congratulations to both Governments and all others in Ireland, England, America and Northern Ireland involved in the talks and in the Good Friday Agreement for the wonderful work they have done in recent years and weeks. This is a week to remember in this country and particularly in Northern Ireland. I congratulate all concerned on the wonderful achievement so far. It is sad that yesterday evening another little stumbling block came in the way of what would have been a wonderful day for Ireland. I wish all parties and all others concerned in the talks well over the coming days and weeks. I hope that all will be well in a day or so, that the problem that has arisen will be overcome and that we will see the full benefits of the Good Friday Agreement and lasting peace in Northern Ireland. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Leader to raise two issues with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. One concerns the inequality that exists in one of our major banks, and probably in other banks, in relation to women reaching positions of higher management. Some 79% of the staff is female, yet very few of these women reach the top positions. I am shocked to hear they do not have an equality policy in that bank. That is something which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, should take up and ensure that these large institutions have an equality policy in place in order to be fair to all of their staff.</P>
      <P>The Minister might attend this House to outline how he proposes to monitor the regulations he has set down for people who drink in pubs whether they are under age or over age, as well as the regulation banning free drink promotions in public houses. That practice continues. If the Minister is going to introduce such laws, he should put in place a system for ensuring they are upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>The hands of the courts appear to be tied in the sense that justice and appropriate penalties seem to be restricted, even where it is plain to lay people that the punishment is not appropriate for the crime. Could the Leader find out if there is any way Senators or the Law Reform Commission could assess, investigate and hopefully improve legislation when it comes to dealing with the problems outlined by Senator Burke? He spoke about the transport element while I am talking of the legal element. We all read in our newspapers this morning of a case in Dublin yesterday involving a boy of 14 being <Col N="407" />fined &euro;5 and banned from driving for one year. I am not questioning the judgment in this case, but the process and restrictions resulting in that judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney" hpid="Ms Feeney Ms Feeney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to see if there is any way in which we could look at present legislation in relation to juveniles and improve or change it in order to make it more hard hitting. It is time to take such action in order that fatalities similar to those we saw at the weekend do not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has gone through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues in their call for a full debate on the decoupling of direct payments to farmers and on the steps the Minister might take to reduce the bureaucracy and red tape in farming because the present system is very complicated. We must also examine what the future holds for the development and promotional agencies such as Teagasc and Bord Bia, because there will be repercussions following the decision on direct payments. I would also like to know when the single payments for farmers will be determined.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues regarding the shabby manner in which the SDLP has been treated in the Northern Ireland talks. We must get things right in this area. Over the years I have greatly admired John Hume and his successor Mark Durkan. The SDLP has always been a pro peace party, a fact recognised worldwide, and it is important to have that party involved at all levels of the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley" hpid="Mr. Dooley Mr. Dooley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Burke in expressing my sympathy to the families of the victims of the horrendous tragedy in my constituency of Clare over the weekend. Not wanting to prejudice any investigation that might be under way, I agree it is time to urgently look at the trade in unroadworthy cars. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has indicated he is prepared to do so. All Members of the House would no doubt like to see something done. This situation has developed over a number of years as a result of higher car standards being put in place by means of the NCT. The net result is that there are now more cars at the lower end of the market which can still be driven but are not roadworthy. A trade has developed in that area, with cars sold cheaply, in effect allowing children to buy them. We need to address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views outlined by Senator Brian Hayes and others on the situation in the North. So much has been achieved that we must not allow the hope justifiably built in both communities to be diminished. The current situa<Col N="408" />tion is a slight, faltering step which will be, as other speakers said, corrected in a matter of days. We must be patient a little longer. We should leave the timing of such a debate, which will shortly be appropriate, to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ulick Burke on the matter he raised. A number of questions arise from this terrible tragedy. Is a person purchasing a car asked if he or she has a full driving licence or insurance? I do not believe that is the case. A mechanically propelled vehicle in the hands of an incompetent person is a lethal weapon. Many questions need to be answered. I strongly support the call for a debate on this matter. There is a huge gap in the legislation which needs to be addressed. If provision exists in current legislation to deal with this issue but the law is not being implemented, then those not enforcing it should pay the penalty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan" hpid="Mr. Coonan Mr. Coonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Brian Hayes and others on Northern Ireland. The vast majority of people on this island await, in eager anticipation, a final resolution of this problem. Everyone wishes it could be resolved.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader take up with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the issue of banks and so-called respectable lending institutions employing hardened criminals to repossess goods on which people are defaulting? I have experience of this. These people knock on the door at the most opportune time, perhaps when a person is alone, and demand the keys of one's car and drive it away. Are such people covered by insurance? This gives credence to the fact that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor. A more eminent person than I has stated that the rich govern the laws and the laws govern the poor.</P>

      <P>The virtual unanimity in the Chamber this morning regarding Northern Ireland is an indication of the great progress which has been made to bring a lasting and just peace to this island. Most of us were hoping a final solution to this particular phase would have been reached yesterday. What we are now dealing with is a cosmetic issue. We should all temper our views because, as Senator Brian Hayes said, the next 48 hours could be particularly important.</P>
      <P>Everybody in public life admires people who do good for those vulnerable in society. We are glad to extol the virtues of such people. Mother Teresa is one such person. Lest our silence might suggest in some way that we accept there was fraudulent activity involved in our admiration for her, it is important to put on the record that most people are glad to see what she has done being recognised.</P>

      <P>I, too, express thanks to both Governments for their work on the Northern Ireland issue. Reference has been made to John de Chastelain but he is only operating under the conditions laid down for his position. It is correct and fitting that both Governments should examine ways and means to clarify the issues raised. That would go a long way towards full implementation of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Ó Murchú's comments regarding Mother Teresa. We are all proud of the Minister for Defence who represented the Government at the ceremony last Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the tone set by Senator Brian Hayes in his comments on Northern Ireland. There is a need for a debate but I must take account of what is happening and I will then judge when a debate is appropriate. I congratulate all those involved and our hearts are full of hope that the negotiations will continue and full agreement will be reached shortly.</P>
      <P>The Senator also asked what the Government's position is on Senator Quinn's Bill. I was away yesterday and, therefore, I was not in touch with Government representatives. However, I will be shortly and I will relay our position then. There are many good provisions in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry praised the motion regarding Simpson's hospital and stated other hospitals could take a lead from what the hospital is doing in terms of changing their charters and the way they conduct their business. She also called for a debate on agriculture, which was supported by other Senators.</P>
      <P>According to Senator Ryan, the NRA stated it is unable to operate performance parameters but it should be obliged to do so like everybody else.</P>

      <P>I always feel a sense of futility when I say motions are to be taken without debate. However, they are usually coming back from or being sent to joint committees, of which Senators are members. I suggested to Senator O'Toole some time ago that if a report is requested on a motion, it should be sought with notice and a debate held subsequently. That is a good idea. While we trust Senators on joint committees, it would be nice to have a debate on committee reports and I will establish whether that can be done.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also commented on the North in a most open fashion. We await developments with hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" />Senator Minihan welcomed the British Prime Minister's announcement that elections would be held in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke called for additional time to debate the Hanly report. The arrangements for today's business have been made. I do not know whether the Minister will be available and the House is taking Report Stage of a Bill following the debate on the report. However, it is good that the House is having an early debate on the report given that the Dáil will not debate it until mid-November. I thank the Minister for his generosity and I hope he feels the same way having heard what Members have to say. The debate will last two and three quarter hours and I hope it will be good.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the horrific accident in County Clare. It would be useful if this issue was raised on the Adjournment because the Minister for Transport has indicated, as Senator Dooley stated, he will move to close the loopholes that may have arisen in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan endorsed the call for a debate on the decoupling issue. I hope this will be taken the week after the Halloween break.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris sought a debate on Northern Ireland and pointed out the need for the SDLP, whom we all admire, to be fully involved in all discussions.</P>
    <P>I agree that reference to Mother Teresa is for another forum, although I am not saying that is what Senator Norris said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <P>Senator Terry raised two issues of justice. She mentioned the inequality in a major finance house, but I do not know to which bank she refers. I am sure she has checked the matter. Apparently the bank in question does not have an equality statement. She also mentioned the drink promotion regulations, which have outlawed certain practices that are still happening. We will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Senator Feeney spoke about improving legislation. She said loopholes in legislation restrict the meting of proper justice. It is a separate matter in which the Oireachtas is not involved. The operation of the law by judges is a matter for the Judiciary. The Senator was careful not to get into that area, but she pointed out the loopholes that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Bannon mentioned the decoupling provisions in the agriculture sector. He asked when the single payments will be introduced and <Col N="411" />when the regulations will be drawn up. He also spoke about the SDLP.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooley discussed cars that are unworthy of being on the road. He pointed out that the Minister has mentioned that he will examine this area and I agree with that decision. I cannot understand how children were allowed to buy a car in a garage. It was a terrible thing to happen. They were careering on the road for many miles. Sympathy must be expressed to the families of the young people who lost their lives in the incident.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan agreed with Senator Brian Hayes about the progress that has been made in respect of the Northern issues. I hope the matter will be settled quickly.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn also spoke about unworthy cars. The finger of blame must be pointed at those who sold the car in question. </P>
    <P>Senator Coonan agreed with the comments that had been made about the North. He spoke about &ldquo;hardened criminals&rdquo; knocking on people's doors, but I do not know about that. I have not heard of such practices. He also spoke about finance houses being involved in repossession. I do not understand the reference he made to &ldquo;hardened criminals&rdquo;.</P>

    <Title>National Task Force on Medical Staffing: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I published the Report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing. It completes the package of reforms set out in the health service reform programme announced in June. Its implementation is vital to achieving the kinds of improvements in health care that we want and that the public deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" />My starting point has always been to do what is best for patients, and this report is about patients. It aims to ensure that consultants are more involved in patient care by taking a hands-on role in the provision of services, that junior doctors are better trained, awake and alert when they see patients and that patients will be treated in hospitals that are fully equipped and staffed to cope with their condition, whether serious or not.</P>
    <P>I established the National Task Force on Medical Staffing in February 2002 to devise an implementation plan for reducing average working hours of NCHDs in line with the European Working Time Directive, to assess the implications of moving to a consultant provided service and to address the medical education and training needs of doctors in this context. At present, most front line medical care in our hospitals is delivered by junior doctors, NCHDs, most of whom work excessively long hours. Patients have limited access to consultant care. NCHDs will soon be required by law to work fewer hours.</P>
    <P>The task force set out to answer a key question. How do we safely provide hospital services, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as the working hours of our junior doctors reduce in line with EU law? The task force brought together hospital consultants, NCHDs, doctors from general practice and public health, the nursing and midwifery and the health and social care professions, health educators, the medical unions, managers and representatives of the public interest.</P>
    <P>During its work, the task force took particular account of two previous reports: the report of the Medical Manpower Forum and a report chaired by David Hanly on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors. Both were completed in 2001 and they highlight a consensus regarding the need for more consultants, new work patterns and fewer junior doctors working shorter hours. The reports pointed to the need to re-examine how and where we will provide acute hospital services in the future.</P>
    <P>A priority for the task force was to ensure that, as it studied the measures needed to develop a modern, efficient and patient centred hospital service, sight was not lost of the value of keeping services at the heart of local communities. In order to meet the requirements of the European Working Time Directive and to deliver a better service to patients, the task force has made certain recommendations. It has set out a series of immediate measures to reduce the working hours of junior doctors to 58 hours per week by 1 August 2004. It has concluded that the only way to address reductions in the working hours of junior doctors while providing high quality patient care into the future is to introduce a consultant provided service. It has argued that a full range of acute hospital services should be available within each region, so that patients should not have to travel beyond it other than for services that are best provided at supra-regional or national level. It has recommended investment in local hospitals <Col N="414" />to provide more services for patients, including elective medical and surgical procedures, out-patient services, pre-natal and post-natal maternity services and better access to diagnostic facilities.</P>
    <P>The report also proposed retaining and developing the minor injury and illness services in local hospitals, which currently account for 70% of patients attending accident and emergency departments, and set out a series of principles for the future organisation of hospital services nationally. It outlined measures to reduce junior doctors' hours to 48 hours a week by 2009, improve training and introduce a consultant provided service over a ten year timeframe.</P>
    <P>In response to the task force report, I have set out a programme of action which will enable patients to be treated by a larger number of senior doctors working within a reorganised hospital system. Patient care will be the responsibility of teams of consultants, supported by junior doctors working safer hours in an improved training system. Non-consultant or junior hospital doctors have played a key role in service delivery in the hospital system for many years. More than 4,000 junior doctors currently deliver front line services in more than 40 public acute hospitals and numerous other health agencies. Junior doctors work an average of 75 hours a week on-site, while many work considerably longer, often for extended periods without rest.</P>
    <P>The task force has proposed a series of important national measures aimed at reducing the average working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors. The immediate target is a reduction to 58 hours a week by 1 August 2004. These measures include replacement of the present system of tiered on-call, increased use of cross-cover arrangements, the introduction of new working and training patterns for non-consultant hospital doctors and a set of measures aimed at reducing the workload of non-consultant hospital doctors in areas in which other staff are better placed to deliver a quality service.</P>
    <P>There is one measure which the task force rightly rejected, namely, the recruitment of extra junior doctors. The discussion document, Medical Manpower in Acute Hospitals, also known as the Tierney report, dealt with this issue ten years ago. It pointed out that the growth in junior doctor numbers, which had resulted in two junior hospital doctors for each consultant in the public sector, had adverse implications for patient care, the efficient operation of hospital services and the future career prospects of doctors in training. Since then junior doctor numbers have increased substantially. We have more than enough junior doctors and now need more consultants.</P>
    <P>The Tierney report is an important document given that it suggested ten years ago that we should have up to 1,500 senior consultants by 2003. We now have more than 1,730 senior consultants, in other words, we exceeded the Tierney recommendations. I say this to illustrate that what is proposed in the Hanly report is achievable over <Col N="415" />a ten year timeframe. I have heard comments to the effect that the proposals will not be achieved. Tierney's estimate of the required number of senior consultants has been exceeded.</P>
    <P>There will be other issues surrounding the Tierney report which were not advanced at the time, including the reorganisation of acute hospital services. However, there was also the issue that the appointment of a new hospital consultant required the appointment of a new team, which resulted in the number of junior doctors increasing from more than 2,000 to more than 4,000. Hanly proposes a more complete package involving all the various players, disciplines and professions. It also had to consider another imperative, namely, the working time directive which imposed a discipline on the exercise that was perhaps missing from previous exercises.</P>
    <P>Our current ratio of junior doctors to consultants limits the extent to which consultants can deal directly with patients. In order to achieve a consultant provided service, we require a substantial increase in the total number of consultants and a corresponding reduction in the number of non-consultant hospital doctors. Significant change will be needed in the current consultant contract. Consultants will be expected to work in teams, sharing responsibility for patients with their consultant colleagues. Agreement will be required to enable consultants to participate, as required, in the provision of on-site cover in the hospital over the 24 hour period and there must be clarity regarding the proportion of a consultant's time appropriately spent on clinical and training commitments. These requirements are essential to the development of a genuinely consultant provided service. There can be no question of moving to this system in the absence of a substantially changed contract.</P>
    <P>Reform of our medical education and training system is a vital component of the new service model. Because medical education and training for NCHDs is intertwined with service provision in our hospitals, we will need major changes in how we deliver and organise medical education and training in a shorter working week. Genuine training posts for all NCHDs are integral to a consultant provided service. I look forward to speedy implementation of the task force's wide-ranging recommendations in this area, which include integrating training functions currently scattered throughout numerous agencies; top quality, safeguarded training, oriented to a new model of service delivery; a flexible training strategy; and measures to address the concerns of non-EU doctors in training. The medical education and training group of the task force is currently working on a number of outstanding issues and I expect it to provide me with a final report in the new year.</P>
    <P>Earlier I emphasised the challenge facing the task force regarding acute hospital services. How do we safely provide hospital services, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as the working hours of <Col N="416" />our junior doctors reduce in line with EU law? The task force has responded by setting out a new way of organising hospital services. Its proposals mean that no hospitals will close. Instead of downgrading hospitals it proposes to bring services closer to patients while ensuring those services are both safe and sustainable.</P>
    <P>This was pointed out by a number of consultants who were part of the Hanly group. One can cite the example of a speciality such as rheumatology. There is only one rheumatologist in the entire mid-west region. Until quite recently, there were no rheumatologists in the west. Also, up to quite recently there was not even a neo-natalogist in the Western Health Board region. Everyone focuses on trauma and acute emergency treatment &ndash; this is where the debate immediately leads. There is a wide range of specialities and services for which people in the regions have to travel to Dublin or other areas. The Hanly report says this need not be the case. With the exception of tertiary treatment, such as cardiac surgery, liver transplantation and so on &ndash; obviously they will take place in national centres &ndash; the vast array of other specialities can be delivered in the regions. There is no reason why we cannot give additional services to local hospitals in terms of routine elective surgery. For example, there is no reason local hospitals cannot do routine ENT surgery, or offer a much greater range of diagnostic facilities, pre and ante-natal services and so on. The Hanly report says local hospitals might not do everything they allegedly do. There is a large question mark over what people think happens in emergency services and what actually happens. Hanly makes the point that local hospitals can provide services which they currently do not provide. The type of services provided by hospitals, in the appropriate setting and in a safe context, is at the core of the debate.</P>
    <P>A key part of any reform of our hospital services is clearly a reorganisation of emergency care. International evidence, cited by Hanly, is clear on this. Patients do better in hospitals that have the required numbers of specialist staff, are able to provide suitable medical cover 24 hours a day, seven days a week and have high volumes of activity and access to appropriate diagnostic and treatment facilities. At the heart of our reform programme, however, is the recognition that while we need to concentrate emergency care in our major hospitals, reorganisation of acute hospital services offers the potential for a wide range of safe, effective, high quality care to be offered in our smaller hospitals.</P>
    <P>Those hospitals identified by the task force as local hospitals are ideally placed for that role. The core of their services will include elective medical and surgical procedures, day surgery, minor injury and illness units, high quality diagnostic services, outpatient clinics, pre and post-natal maternity services, intermediate care and rehabilitation and convalescence beds. These services will be provided by a group of health professionals including consultants, NCHDs, general <Col N="417" />practitioners, specialist and staff nurses, radiographers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and other health professionals. In summary, I expect them to provide an increasing volume of elective procedures and the kind of multi-specialist day and outpatient care that is currently performed in the larger hospitals. Far from downgrading, these hospitals should be developed further to give people local access to a wider range of hospital services than they enjoy at present. Managing the changes required will be challenging and I will not understate the magnitude of the task ahead.</P>
    <P>I wish to proceed with the implementation of the process. In order to reduce average working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors to 58 hours next August, we need immediate engagement between management and the Irish Medical Organisation. I have asked the Labour Relations Commission to convene a meeting between both sides to agree quickly a process for negotiating the changes required. Closely linked to this process will be the negotiations on a new contract for hospital consultants. At my request, the Health Services Employers Agency has contacted the medical organisations to arrange an early meeting to discuss the format and terms of reference for the negotiation of a new contract.</P>
    <P>I also want to implement the changes proposed by the task force in the east coast and mid-western regions. To do this there will be a project group in both areas which will include management and health professionals from the hospitals involved. These groups will engage in a detailed planning exercise, identifying how best to reconfigure services and staffing at local level. With regard to future organisation of acute hospital services, I have asked David Hanly to chair a small group to prepare a national plan in line with the principles set out by the task force. His group will liaise closely with my Department and, on its establishment, with the national hospitals office. The project group which addressed medical education and training issues is now in the process of preparing its final report.</P>
    <P>The Hanly group engaged in an exhaustive process of consultation prior to writing the report. It met with approximately 600 people in both pilot areas, including consultants, junior doctors, nursing staff and other health care professionals. There were about 300 meetings. Whatever one's views of the exercise, it was detailed. It looked at the issue from a green field perspective in the sense of examining the best way to organise health services in the future for a population of 350,000. The question of what was the best and safest service for the patient is what ultimately motivated the conclusions of the Hanly group and it is the reason the Government has accepted and endorsed the group's conclusions and recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a difficult job and I wish him the best of luck with it. One can only suppose that reports such as the Hanly <Col N="418" />report are aimed at people with a vast knowledge of the health system. For a lay person such as myself, the reports have become complicated documents despite their summaries of the main points. One would have to be an expert to interpret many of the reports. Take, for example, the chart on page 170 of the Hanly report. It is like the circuit diagram for a space shuttle. The interesting question that arises, which is never dealt with, is the costs of these reports and the expenses incurred. I have no wish to undermine the work of the group as its members have obviously worked hard but perhaps they go above the call of duty.</P>
      <P>According to my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, this is the 148th report for the Department of Health and Children in the last five years. The Department could be called &ldquo;the Department of Reports&rdquo;. Other notable reports in recent times were the Bacon report, the value for money report by Deloitte and Touche, the health strategy &ldquo;Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health Strategy for You&rdquo;, the bed capacity review of 2002, the Prospectus report and the Brennan report. The Hanly report is envisaged as the first of a series which will continue on the same theme but for different regions. What will happen to these reports? The health service will muddle on with a patchwork quilt of ideas from various reports and none will be used until the various interest and pressure groups are satisfied.</P>
      <P>The Hanly report deals with three issues. The first is working hours for doctors, especially non-consultant hospital doctors. The second is a consultant provided rather than a consultant led service. This means there will be many more consultants at the coalface of the health service rather than being on call with the junior doctors doing most of the initial work. The third and most contentious issue is the attempt to rationalise the configuration of acute hospital services. The Minister faces a difficult task in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody agrees with the effort to improve the lot of junior doctors in terms of working hours, length of shifts and so forth. However, we are not leading the way in this regard but are being forced to introduce better standards by the EU working time directive or EWTD. From August 2004, non-consultant hospital doctors must not work for more than an average of 58 hours per week and not more than 13 hours on-site in a hospital. The historical development of junior doctors having to work incredibly long hours would require another report. Everybody is aware of this practice but it has been allowed to continue until now in the most sensitive of professions where focus, rest and alertness are of paramount importance. At present, there are 3,900 junior doctors in Ireland delivering front line service in more than 40 public acute hospitals and other health agencies. They work an average of 75 hours per week and often for continuous periods of more than 30 hours. In 2003, there were 1,731 hospital approved consultants in public hospitals. The EWTD will have to be <Col N="419" />implemented or we will be penalised so we cannot take any credit for being imaginative, innovative or reformist in this area.</P>
    <P>The report states: &ldquo;Acute hospital medical services would be consultant provided rather than consultant led&rdquo;. This looks fine but it is aspirational. That is the problem with many of these reports, they are aspirational but there is little meat on the bone. The reduction in junior doctors' working hours will lead to major staffing problems in hospitals with a requirement for more junior doctors or other arrangements. The objective is to have more consultants at the front line of services and one cannot quibble with that, if it is possible. However, I have a quibble with the statement on page 22 of the report dealing with methodology which states:</P>
    <P>The Task Force explicitly set aside two forces that inevitably influence the shape of health services: industrial relations issues and political considerations&nbsp;.&nbsp;Finally, the Task Force initially set aside cost implications in order to provide the best possible health service.</P>
    <P>If one ignores politics, industrial relations and costs in the health service, one has set aside three key elements in the equation.</P>
    <P>While the issue of working hours is guided by the EU directive and the consultant provided service is aspirational and, if possible, fine, I believe the most problematic issue will be acute hospital care and the configuration of acute hospital services. There are probably no huge problems with the report aside from the issue of local hospitals. The Minister faces a serious battle in this regard. One cannot ignore political considerations, although I try not to get involved with them when dealing with something as serious as the health issue, and the ingrained fears in communities who will fight to retain their hospital, be it in Ennis or, in my case, Roscommon. It does not take a consultant to interpret the immediate response of my colleague, Senator Leyden, to the report last week when he said it should be binned. He was being driven by a whole spectrum of emotions.</P>

      <P>He was driven by the whole spectrum of emotions, fears and needs that are part of the campaign to retain a respectable county <Col N="420" />hospital. The issue is how to square the circle with the need for multidisciplinary centres of excellence. The report shies away from that, once again kicking issues into touch. It does not mention Roscommon County Hospital, where &euro;8 million has been spent on an accident and emergency unit which has not yet opened. The Roscommon accident and emergency unit will face closure if the report is implemented. I state that now because I believe that is what the Minister has determined for further down the line. The Government is letting the bad information out in a drip effect, with one leak following another.</P>

      <P>As I said, those hospitals are already in a marginalised area which the Government has ignored on a whole range of issues, including decentralisation, infrastructure and investment, as it promotes already burgeoning areas of population and urban sprawl. People will fight vigorously and have been doing so for years through action committees to defend and upgrade what are seen as vital services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report seems to suggest that an enhanced ambulance service will alleviate some of the problems of emergency cases having to travel long distances for services. The Government must envisage an upgrade of ambulance services, which is recommended. However, it is already a source of criticism because of delays. Then there is the condition of the secondary roads system in the west. I do not know how many people here have travelled on the Boyle to Galway or Roscommon to Galway routes. It is a pretty hazardous trip of approximately 78 miles, taking up to two hours at the best of times. Key message 8 under section 1.8 on page 18 states: &ldquo;The organisation and staffing of acute hospitals must be restructured to allow for the safe provision of emergency and elective care.&rdquo; On page 45, it mentions &ldquo;the ability of the hospital to provide safe, quality, accessible patient care, taking account of geographic location within the region&rdquo;. I do not believe that our region fits that description and that undermines the report. Page 65 states: &ldquo;Each network of hospitals should provide a service <Col N="421" />which is, as much as possible, located close to patients' homes.&rdquo; While the report has various kinds of aspirational padding about ideas for local hospitals, ultimately, the proposals will once again be seen as downgrading and will be resisted strenuously.</P>
    <P>Other questions arise if smaller hospitals are relegated. What will happen to the alternative bed numbers? Where will they spring from in already crowded hospitals? From where will the large numbers of consultants emerge in such a short time? The report admits in 2.3.3 on page 23 that it is trying hard to work on an &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;ideal' or &lsquo;perfect' model of services&rdquo;. That may be the philosophy of those who present reports, but the nettles of a less than ideal world are the concerns of those affected by this vital, life and death primary service.</P>
    <P>Some other points I noted include the tangled web of training as outlined on page 48, with its accompanying diagram on page 49. The task force proposals for a network of acute hospitals have been framed on the basis of the experience in two pilot regions. Further consideration will be required on how best to achieve integration of decision making, planning and effective local management in other parts of the country. They should be addressed in phase two of the task force work, yet on page 61 the report states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A consistent message from previous analyses has been the need for clarity of hospital roles, genuine integration of services and the provision of high quality care.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>However, &ldquo;the record in implementing a number of previous reports has been disappointing&rdquo;. It undermines the validity of this report and the pessimism sounded by trumpets in the Minister's own party does not augur well for large slices of it.</P>
    <P>I always wish the Minister well because he has a very difficult job. Although the report does not mention certain hospitals, I believe that the future of areas where the Government has spent &euro;8 million, signed off by Senator Leyden as chairman of the Western Health Board less than two years ago, for which the Minister managed to sack him two months later &ndash; or let us say that he did not reappoint him&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach. I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to speak about the Hanly report, the third of recent times, preceded as it was by the Prospectus and Brennan reports. The Hanly report sets out a series of principles for the future organisation of hospital services nationally alongside measures to reduce junior doctor hours, <Col N="422" />improve training and introduce a consultant-provided service. It recommends investment in local hospitals to provide more services for patients, including elective medical and surgical procedures, out-patient services, prenatal and postnatal maternity services and better access to diagnostic facilities. It states that the full range of acute hospital services should be available within each region so that patients do not have to travel beyond it other than for services best provided at supraregional or national level.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out at this juncture that, while we would all like to have a centre of excellence in our back yard or home town, that is not a runner in reality and we all know it. Experience has taught us that in the case of breast cancer. It has been proven scientifically that unless 100 procedures are carried out at a centre in a given year, it is not safe to practise them. Those who have been stating that very loudly are those who would benefit from the change, namely, Irish women. The report proposes developing the minor injury and illness services in local hospitals that currently account for 70% of patients attending accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>The Hanly report concludes that the only way to address reductions in the working hours of junior doctors while providing high quality patient care is to introduce a consultant-provided service. The Government is committed to putting in place a consultant-provided service harnessing the contribution of all our hospitals and providing a wider range of appropriate services and procedures in local hospitals. Every facility involved in health delivery has a very important role to play and that should not be minimised. However, that will be done if people wish to serve a political agenda. The background to the National Task Force on Medical Staffing was that the European Working Time Directive requires us to reduce the average working hours of non-consultant house doctors from the current 75 hours per week to 58 hours by 1 August 2004 and, ultimately, to 48 hours per week by 1 August 2009.</P>
      <P>Most, if not all, Members have, from time to time, been involved with trade unions. There are not too many people in employment who are obliged to work the same number of hours as non-consultant hospital doctors. There is light at the end of the tunnel for GPs because, thanks to the efforts of the Minister, Deputy Martin, my area recently received funding for the out-of-hours GP service for Longford, Westmeath, Laois and most of Offaly. People must recognise that doctors are human and that they cannot work for hours on end. As someone who worked in a particular discipline for many years, I am in a position to say with authority that the working conditions and hours of NCHDs are nothing short of scandalous. I do not know why anybody would want to enter the medical profession and work the hours junior doctors are obliged to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force also took account of two previous reports, namely, the report of the medical manpower forum and the NCHD hours report <Col N="423" />which were both published in 2001. Senator Feighan referred to the Bacon report and the various other reports that have been commissioned. In my opinion, reports are important. If individual Members were to carry out audits on themselves, they would certainly tell themselves what they wanted to hear. It is important, therefore, that we have people who will consider the medical sector from a dispassionate point of view. The Bacon report was extremely important because from it flowed schools of language, physiotherapy and speech in Galway, Cork and Dublin. Such reports are not, as is perhaps a popular misconception on the opposite side of the House, left to gather dust.</P>
    <P>NCHDs have to reduce their average working time to no more than 58 hours per week on the hospital site by 1 August 2004, to 56 hours by 1 August 2007 and to 48 hours by 1 August 2009. It is interesting that of the 15 EU member states, to date, ten appear to be compliant. Apart from Ireland, four other states &ndash; Belgium, France, Germany and the UK &ndash; have various measures to implement before they will be fully compliant. It is also worth noting that other countries train their doctors in a shorter working week. Examples of this include Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland. In Finland, doctors in training have, since 1996, worked a standard 40 hours per week. What does this mean?</P>
    <P>There has been a call to increase the number of NCHDs. However, I believe the medical profession will agree that there are enough junior doctors and that more consultants are needed. If we take on board the concept that we are going to have a consultant led service, it is axiomatic that more consultants will be needed. Everyone who knows anything about medicine or medical procedures is aware that the incidence of diabetes has increased significantly in recent years. The Midland Health Board has applied to recruit an endocrinologist. The diabetic association in the region is lobbying the health board to have that particular specialty brought on stream. There is also evidence of an increase in the incidence of tuberculosis. The increase to which I refer is not huge, but it must be noted. It is, therefore, that the consultant appointments to those particular specialties will be made. There is also a great shortage of psychiatrists with an interest in child and adolescent psychiatry. If we are determined to have a consultant led service, we will need more consultants. It has been proven that we have an adequate number of junior doctors.</P>
    <P>The task force proposes a series of immediate measures to reduce NCHD working hours to 58 by next August. These include the reduction of tiered on-call, use of cross-cover arrangements across specialties, new working patterns for NCHDs and a set of specific measures aimed at reducing NCHD workloads in areas such as radiology, phlebotomy, pathology, pharmacy and surgery. In the longer term, we also need a number of other key initiatives such as a consultant pro<Col N="424" />vided service to replace the current largely consultant led system and changes to the existing system of medical education so that doctors can be trained within a 48 hour working week. If doctors can be trained in a 40 hour week in other parts of the EU, I do not know why they cannot be trained in a 48 hour week here.</P>
    <P>There is a major need for a consultant provided service. Under such a service, consultants would work together in teams and take a substantial and direct involvement in diagnosis, delivery of care and overall management of patients. The task force believes that this is the only way to achieve high quality care while meeting the requirements of the EWTD. This will entail a significant increase in the number of consultants working in teams, and with revised working arrangements, and a substantial decrease in the number of NCHDs.</P>
    <P>I accept that this will lead to a change in work practices for consultants. A vital element in any move to a consultant provided service will be agreeing different work practices for consultants. The task force recommends that consultants will participate in rostered work, night work and extended cover, as required. In some instances, where clinical needs and caseloads require it, this may involve an on-site consultant presence on a 24-hour basis. These proposals are quite stark and careful negotiation will be required in respect of them.</P>
    <P>While fundamental change in consultant and NCHD contracts is a central part of the reform agenda, implementation of the task force's recommendations is not completely dependent on contractual change. For example, the following measures can proceed alongside contractual negotiations: a study of the structure and organisation of acute hospital services nationally, national discussions on measures to reduce NCHD hours in the context of the task force's recommendations, actions throughout the country to meet the requirements of the EWTD and developing ways of speeding up the recruitment process, particularly for consultants.</P>
    <P>The organisation of acute hospital services will be pivotal to this. The task force report concludes that we need a substantial reorganisation of acute hospital services. Members of the House have been accused, by those outside who do not hold elected positions, of being parochial. I want to meet the councillor, town councillor, Deputy, Senator, Minister or Taoiseach who will not root for their own area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who are making the comments about Members are the unelected ones. I make no apologies for saying that I am anxious that phase 2B of the general hospital in Mullingar, which is at the design stage at present and in respect of which the development control plan is almost ready, should proceed. I am reliably informed that it will do so. It is to be <Col N="425" />expected that Members will root for their own areas and I certainly have no apologies to make for doing so. However, there is a bigger picture and people must recognise that all services cannot be provided on a local basis. There will be occasions when specialist services will be provided in a number of centres nationally. Such services cannot all be provided in our own back yards.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that hospitals will not be downgraded. This report is not about downgrading hospitals, instead the task force has pointed to the need to bring services closer to patients. It has stated that local hospitals should be a key part of an integrated hospital service for their regions, providing as wide a range of services as close as possible to the local community. They would meet most of the local population's need for hospital care by providing appropriate diagnostic and treatment facilities and a greatly expanded proportion of election day surgery and elective medical procedures for the relevant region, which would involve an increasing volume of elective procedures that are often performed in larger hospitals. Anyone with experience of medicine is aware that before the advent of day surgery, people were admitted to hospital for minor procedures and took up hospital beds. There was no need for that.</P>
      <P>A key part of the Hanly proposals is the need to ensure a well trained and well equipped ambulance service that can provide immediate care for emergency patients. The focus is not on taking the patient to the nearest local hospital, rather it is getting the patient to the hospital best equipped to deal with their condition. Taking a patient as quickly as possible to a well staffed and well equipped major hospital is by far the best course of action. What do we do? We must put patients first &ndash; it is all about the patient.</P>
      <P>I referred to the locally elected member being an important conduit in the delivery of health services. When one compares them to the monkey and the peanuts, the monkey was terribly expensive by comparison to the locally elected representative. I ask the Minister to include local democratic input in the new structures. This is vitally important and failure to include it would be fundamentally wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and while I welcome the report, I regret it has been so belated. At the end of his speech, the Minister said we must now proceed to implementation. To implement even the EU directive on NCHD working hours before next August will be extremely difficult. It is not true to say we must have EU directives to drive us to do anything that would obviously be for the betterment of the health service in this country. After all, we had the excellent Tierney report in 1993 &ndash; would to heaven that we implemented it then. At that stage there were about 2,500 NCHDs. There is now more than 4,000 NCHDs and we will have <Col N="426" />an even greater problem in paring down this number.</P>
      <P>While it is to the advantage of the patient that this report should be implemented, it is also to the advantage of the medical profession. Non-consultant hospital doctors in this country are carrying far too great a burden in the service area. In particular, non-national doctors are dealing with heavy workloads in small hospitals around the country, often with inadequate consultant support. This cannot continue and I hope the Minister manages to implement this report. I am not referring to the Minister when I say that while the political spirit may be willing, the political flesh is fairly weak. It may even be weaker on the Minister's side of the House than on this side of the House. I will do anything I can to help the Minister implement the report.</P>
      <P>We have already heard Mr. Hanly saying that the report will be implemented immediately, while the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Kelly, is not quite so sure. A definite urgency must be found to bring forward the changes in NCHD working hours.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister insist that every hospital immediately puts a member of its administrative staff in charge of rostering? This should happen before the end of the month. We know there are already serious problems in some of the big hospitals that have such positions. This must be the first area to be addressed and the report says that getting rostering right is important. It may have to be more flexible than that which is suggested in the report. It cannot be left to consultants and junior doctors to work out private arrangements between them. That will only lead to disaster. Such arrangements must come from management level.</P>
      <P>The Tierney report was extremely well written and it is most unfortunate it was not implemented at the time. We have seen that we were making far greater increases in the number of NCHDs than other parts of these islands. For example, between 1988 and 1992 there was a 6% rise in the number of consultants in the State, but a 25% increase in the number of NCHDs. In the same period there was an 11% increase in the number of consultants and a 2% rise in the number of NCHDs in Northern Ireland. The same circumstances prevailed in Scotland, England and Wales. We have continued the bad practice of relying too heavily on NCHDs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the report's suggested changes in work practices in certain areas such as accident and emergency departments are good, I wonder if some of them are realistic. At the moment it is suggested that 70% of cases that come to accident and emergency departments, particularly in smaller hospitals, could be dealt with by GPs. The only problem is that we are running into circumstances where we have a shortfall of general practitioners. I am sure the Minister saw the excellent recent article written by Dr. Leonard Condren, an experienced Dublin based GP who recently retired. His words need to be looked at. Even <Col N="427" />with the improvements the Minister has made in the primary care strategy, we are having trouble attracting people into general practice. I am anxious that we are relying too heavily on GPs taking up the slack from the closure of small accident and emergency departments around the country.</P>
    <P>The report rightly suggests that nurses could take over some of the duties doctors are currently undertaking. However, we also have a terrible shortage of nurses. Departments, especially those with specialist nurses, cannot be built up with nurses brought in from abroad for two or three years.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that pharmacists within the hospital services can have a greater role. While this would be extremely good, these changes take a while to be brought about. We are talking about having longer working days within hospitals and holding clinics in the evening. Once again, arrangements will have to be made with laboratory technicians, radiographers, physiotherapists, porters, administrative staff, etc. I worked in an acute hospital where the entire outpatient administrative service shut at 4 o'clock. Nurses and I gave notes to patients and told them to telephone the hospital the following day to seek appointments. This sort of thing does not lead to efficiency. It is not really correct to say that everything will be all right if we can get the doctors to work longer. That is not even one-tenth of the problem.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Hanly came out against a career service officer grade. That has been a disaster in Britain. This grade is filled by people who, usually due to financial or domestic reasons, had not got the qualifications to get consultant posts. This was fine for a few years but the individuals became extremely dissatisfied seeing junior colleagues with less experience promoted over them and many felt they had wasted the time they should have spent trying to get their exams. It was one of the most dissatisfied groups of people I have ever met.</P>
    <P>Hanly also recommends against using physician assistants, as is the practice in the United States. I agree with this. However, he suggests that we should look at surgical anaesthetic assistants, particularly within intensive care and operating theatre units. We should look at this, particularly in view of the shortage of nurses with operating theatre skills. The royal colleges will have to support the Minister in such an initiative as these training courses are normally of four years duration.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see a review of the training of doctors being brought forward. There is far too little concern about the quality of training some doctors have received in certain hospitals. In many cases training posts have mainly been service posts. It is very good that the report states non-EU doctors should be treated differently from EU doctors. I was not enthusiastic about suggestions made by the royal colleges about this <Col N="428" />matter and I am very glad that Hanly came down firmly against it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the section on training and medical education, have there been any discussions between the Minister and the Minister for Education and Science about his proposals for changes in medical education? That does not just apply to doctors, radiographers or physiotherapists. The area is enormous and I do not see how it ties in with saying one is anxious about it&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but the Minister's proposal will cost a fortune. Will radiographers stay in this country if it takes six years to train when it only takes four years to train in England? It is the same for physiotherapists. In addition, the Hanly report also rightly points out how long it takes here to train to become a specialist. The Minister for Education and Science's proposals would add on another two years. We already have a problem with people taking early retirement when we want people at a specialist level to be there for long enough to give decent service. Great consideration needs to be given to the proposals of the Minister for Education and Science. I have heard no costing of those proposals and the Department of Health and Children should have a much greater say regarding those proposals than it appears to have at present.</P>
      <P>The area that has received most media attention is the review of acute hospitals, which is very important. However, we have known about this area for years. We could go back to the Fitzgerald report, which recommended much the same as the Hanly report. We are in an age which requires a multidisciplinary approach to medicine so that the patient gets the best possible care. Like other people, I am sick of the word &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo;. If someone goes into the Bon Secours hospital in Glasnevin, do they say they have gone somewhere that has been downgraded? Yet this hospital only does elective surgery and procedures, so people go in there on a planned basis. I was a patient there once for a day and I could not believe the efficiency. I was saying to the staff how great it was that if one had an x-ray appointment at 10 a.m. one was x-rayed at 10 a.m. and so on. The staff said they did not have to cope with the victims of a major car crash coming in, which would throw everything into disarray. I have worked in acute hospitals for long enough to know that by 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. the plan for the day has gone out the window because something happens which takes over the entire x-ray department. I implore people to stop talking about downgrading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are possibilities in the pilot schemes, although they require a great deal of work. For example, people in Limerick will have to get used to going to Ennis if they have a quiescent gall bladder which can be treated in Ennis or Nenagh. They should be saying: &ldquo;Isn't it great? I can be <Col N="429" />done in Ennis on 4 November,&rdquo; and know they will be dealt with on 4 November, while at the same time they will get used to terrible car crashes being dealt with in Limerick. The people of Limerick will have to get used to going out to these hospitals, which could become very efficient units. There are very good doctors there as it stands and if an <i>esprit de corps</i> was put into those institutions we would do well.</P>
    <P>The problems with Dublin include the infrastructure being in such a state and transport, which is very bad. I would be anxious about downgrading accident and emergency facilities in St. Colmcille's. Now I am using that word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was doing fine until then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The elimination, let us say, of St. Colmcille's. That is a very difficult situation because St. Vincent's has a very small casualty department, although it is the only one I have been in for years where the waiting time was not excessively long, unlike the Mater, Beaumont, and so on. That will be more difficult to address.</P>
      <P>Huge investment must be made in the pre-hospital emergency services so that those working in the ambulances are properly trained. We will have to make changes in legislation to allow those workers to give out drugs and so forth. Look at how well the situation in Donegal turned out, where general practitioners started giving thrombolytic drugs to patients having coronaries in rural areas. There was a great improvement in treatment with that development. We need initiatives all round as this will be a huge challenge to us and we will just have to get on with it.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for those around the country who saw money spent in their hospitals but who now feel those units will not be used. For example, a unit in Mullingar hospital has not been equipped but it is there for six to eight years. The last Leader of the Seanad and I had terrible sessions about this, as I was receiving complaints from the area about the unit and he was saying what a splendid place it was. I gather there is no change in the situation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to get bed numbers up everywhere. In the 1960s there were approximately 4 million people in the country, but now we have almost 5 million and the population is older. We need more beds, doctors and health workers. If the Minister for Finance wants to know where the money is going, it is mainly going on pay and he agreed to the increases. If he asks the Minister for Health and Children what is being done with the money, the Minister, Deputy Martin, should tell him it has gone to pay people and that the Minister for Finance was at the Cabinet meeting which agreed to those pay increases. I am not saying they are not deserved but I get cross sometimes when I hear about black holes as most of the money I see being used is spent on pay. Some <Col N="430" />of it is being spent on infrastructure but not nearly enough.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties with the consultants' contracts, as there are always difficulties with major industrial relations situations. However, the Minister needs to hold on to more people on a part-time basis, which could be very important for those with smaller hospitals in their areas. It could help to make up a sufficient quota to cover the time during which people are on call. We have a serious problem with consultants taking early retirement and if they were asked to take on certain shifts and teaching roles in hospitals, we might hold onto more of them. There has also been a great increase in the number of young women consultants being produced and in areas like pathology, anaesthetics and psychiatry sometimes one only needs a part-time consultant. The rate of only 2% part-time consultants at present, is very low.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister success with this initiative. The only problem is that I have seen so many reports come and go. I had to work very hard when the Fitzgerald report was being produced because the man I worked for, Professor George Fegan, was on that commission and put enormous work into it. They were all disappointed when they saw their work come to nothing. Fianna Fáil brought that down but they were not the same sort of Fianna Fáil people that are around now. I am sure the Minister will have great support from many members of the party because the report deserves to be supported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister. Health service reform is long overdue and nobody can defend the <i>status quo</i>. We now have three major reports setting out a clear reform agenda. The Brennan report deals with accountability and improving financial management; the Prospectus report deals with the organisational structures; and the Hanly report deals with NCHD working hours, the provision of a consultant-provided service, improving medical education and training and reorganising the acute hospital system.</P>
      <P>The Hanly report, formally launched last week, deals with two pilot areas, the Western Health Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There is broad consensus on what needs to be done now in those areas and implementation should commence immediately. The report also sets out very clear principles and criteria in relation to organising the acute hospital system. These principles and criteria will obviously inform the next phase of Hanly, that is, preparing a report on how to organise hospital services in the other health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Hanly report is welcome. We must provide a safe hospital system, harness the skills and expertise of our highly skilled medical and paramedical staff in our hospitals and achieve value for money. Implementing the Hanly report will deliver on these. We are facing some immediate tasks. We must start implementation in the two <Col N="431" />pilot sites; Hanly mark II which will deal with the other boards must be up and running; the European Working Time Directive in relation to the NCHD hours must be implemented; and we must open negotiations with medical organisations on new contracts. I welcome that the Minister acknowledged this. It will be difficult, but taxpayers and patients cannot be held to ransom. In this regard, new contracts for new consultants must be put in place, regardless of negotiations with existing contract holders.</P>
    <P>We have three good reports. However, all will be for nothing if we do not implement them. Implementation is key and it must be a planned and clear process of change with clear accountability for making it all happen. Last June the Government promised to establish the new health service executive and the national steering implementation group, but these two important bodies have not yet been established. I am aware that senior management in the Department of Health and Children and the health boards are progressing certain aspects of the reports. However, we need an independent body to drive the reform agenda. Difficult decisions will have to be made. Current members of senior management of the health system would not be appropriate decision makers as they clearly would have a conflict of interest. We are talking about designing and implementing a new health delivery system, a mammoth task. The change must be centrally driven but with local ownership.</P>
    <P>The health service executive should be established immediately and given a clear mandate by Government to plan and drive the reform agenda. There are many stakeholders in the process who must be involved. They must be allowed to contribute but responsibility and accountability for the reform agenda should reside with the health service executive. Taxpayers, other members of the public and the Government must get not only a modern health delivery system but effective management and better value for money. Better management and better value for money are obstacles regardless of the national economic picture. Delivery of these two elements will require a new culture in the health system. Is anyone addressing this matter? Structural change will not deliver it. We must improve the capacity of management in the system.</P>
    <P>There should be the immediate appointment of the chairperson and members of the interim health service executive, the recruitment of the chief executive officer of the HSE or, alternatively, initially at least, the chairperson of the HSE could be an executive chairperson and the appointment immediately of the national implementation steering group. The implementation of the HSRP should be led, driven and managed by the implementation steering group and not by the Department of Heath and Children, its officials and health board chief executive officers as now appears to be happening.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" />With regard to the new governance arrangements, there will be a liaison role between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE and not a direct reporting relationship. In view of that I pose a number of questions. The Government decision of 17 June 2003 indicates that the Secretary General concerned would have responsibility for the implementation process. If that is the case, what will be the role of the HSE, its chairman and its chief executive officer in the implementation process? Implementation of the health service reforms is a defining moment for our future health service. We will get one chance to get it right and it is vital we do not squander it.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well. We have brought forward a degree of reforms that are on the table. It is now a question of their implementation and making the necessary decisions. Decisions must be made in the national interest, in the interest of all the people and not in interest of those with vested interests. In that regard, I would like to be dissociated from remarks made in the House last week when certain Senators referred to the fact that the Hanly report should be put on the shelf. That is not the way forward. Decisions must be made&mdash;</P>

I congratulate the Minister on his initiatives today. I wish him success in the implementation of these reform packages. I hope in the near future we will see the establishment of a proper management structure to drive this change and implement the necessary reforms to provide us with the health service that patients and others deserve.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the Minister to the House for this important and timely debate. I compliment the Leader of the House and others who organised that the Minister would be present for a debate on this report first in the House. I compliment the Minister for making himself available for it. I compliment members of the task force on medical staffing on the considerable work they have done in the public interest and on the public service they have given. I also compliment the Minister on his responsible approach to health service reform. We do not agree on every<Col N="433" />thing but one must give credit where it is due. The Minister has not sat back and said this is too big a problem and he can do nothing about it. He has taken full responsibility in this regard and has asked experts to study the area and to come up with recommendations, which is what they have done. It is up to the Minister and the Oireachtas to implement those recommendations and it is up to us to have an input in that process. This debate is an extremely important and valid part of that process. As Members of this House, representing various communities and interests around the country, we can give our views on the recommendations. I hope the Minister is broad minded enough to realise we are not taking a narrow, party political or parochial stance on this but rather we are making arguments on behalf of the people we represent and the values we represent in terms of the delivery of quality hospital care and a quality health service in our regions and nationally.</P>
      <P>Nobody could contest the fact, stated repeatedly, that there is a major problem in the delivery of health services. This problem did not pop up overnight; it has developed over many years and we have not faced the challenges of the modern era. We have not been able to put in place a health service infrastructure which would deliver the quality of care we want delivered locally and nationally. Many hospitals in Dublin are so overcrowded that patients are being treated in car parks, a service over which nobody could stand. Tragedies have occurred in Limerick and Monaghan due to the failure of the health service generally to deliver the care that was required and people have been horrified and shocked by that.</P>
      <P>In that context, this report, the Prospectus report and the Brennan report must be welcomed as adding to the body of information and analysis of the current situation we face. I thank the authors of those reports for the recommendations they came up with, although I do not agree with a number of them. One of the pilot areas in the Hanly report is the mid-western area which, from my point of view as an Oireachtas Member and a public representative in the mid-western area, is useful. The pilot area covers north Tipperary, specifically St. Joseph's Hospital, Nenagh. I ask the House to accept that I am not being parochial in this regard. The study examines this area. I live about 100 yards from this hospital and I am well acquainted with it, the issues around it, the people who work there and how the hospital and the health service in the area work. It is part of my responsibility as a public representative in the area. I am naturally very interested in the recommendations of the Hanly report as they have implications for the north Tipperary area in the context of hospital reform in the mid west, in particular the delivery of acute hospital services in that region. I ask the Minister to consider a number of issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report is being presented against the background of an accepted myth that big is better and that big hospitals deliver better services. The <Col N="434" />Minister asserted this just a week or so ago in Limerick before the publication of the Hanly report. He said that evidence shows that patients receive better treatment in hospitals that have the required numbers of specialist staff, high volumes of activity and access to appropriate diagnostic and treatment facilities. I put it to the Minister that big is not always better. For example, there is only one hospital which has conducted a study and published data on survival rates following acute myocardial infraction. The figures compared favourably with a relevant international trial. That study was conducted by Nenagh Hospital. I have heard it asserted, particularly from medical people, that one could not possibly get good service from Nenagh Hospital. The opposite is the case. The quality of care, delivery of service and value for money in that hospital are exceptionally high. Figures published by the Department of Health and Children prove this. The case I am making is not only that big is not always better, but that in this country &ldquo;big&rdquo; has become &ldquo;worse&rdquo;. Looking at the larger hospitals such as the Mater and Beaumont, it is clear, particularly at accident and emergency level and at acute level, that the care is not as good as one would get in the small hospitals.</P>
    <P>Figures from the Department of Health and Children used in the national review of bed capacity show that in 2002 there was a severe deficit of acute hospital beds. In 1981 there were 5.1 acute beds per 1,000 of population, giving a total of 17,500 acute beds. In 2002 the figure dropped to 3.1 acute beds per 1,000 of population, giving a total of 11,832 acute beds. The same report estimated that there was a need to restore between 2,800 and 4,300 acute beds nationally.</P>
    <P>The Hanly report will result in a further diminution of the number of acute hospital beds. Consider the mid west region. In Limerick Regional Hospital, which under the Hanly report would be that area's central regional hospital, there are currently 340 beds. There are some 21,000 medical admissions in the hospital annually. Currently, there is a deficit of between 80 and 100 acute beds there. If we close the acute beds in Nenagh and Ennis and in the smaller St. John's Hospital in Limerick, we will be closing 250 acute beds. Between those three small hospitals there are 12,500 admissions, of which 8,000 are medical admissions. If the acute beds in those hospitals are cancelled, it will be necessary to create an extra 350 beds in Limerick. I ask the Minister when that is going to happen and how much it will cost. The Department of Finance has committed no money. Some 50,000 A&amp;E admissions would be added annually to Limerick Hospital on top of the existing 60,000 if the A&amp;E units are closed in Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's in Limerick. What will be the waiting time in Limerick Regional Hospital, which is currently about two and a half hours? Limerick Regional Hospital will see a Dublin-style situation with patients treated on trolleys in the car park. There <Col N="435" />are currently about 20 patients being treated on trolleys in Limerick. If one adds the 11,000 admissions from Nenagh and the rest from Ennis and from St. John's in Limerick, one has a disaster.</P>
    <P>One cannot start closing A&amp;E units without looking at the implications for the central unit. It sounds fine in theory but in practice it would be a disaster. Where in the Hanly report does it say the capacity in Limerick Hospital will be increased to a sufficient level to ensure it can cope with patients from Clare and north Tipperary? I question whether this issue has been thought out. Hanly was not asked to consider this issue but to look at the organisation of the services.</P>
    <P>The Minister said local hospitals will, if Hanly is implemented, no longer have emergency services.</P>

      <P>What does the Senator mean by emergency? We are talking about trauma. We have said that 70% of what is going in to Nenagh Hospital will continue to go in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at trauma. I appreciate that the Minister is busy and must leave and I appreciate his attendance. There are a number of questions I wanted to ask about Nenagh Hospital and I hope to get answers. What will be the status of A&amp;E there? Will it be a nurse-led A&amp;E? Will it be a 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock or 24-hour service? What will one get there? Emergency and trauma services will go. If there is a major accident on the Nenagh bypass, the victims will presumably have to go to Limerick. Patients cannot be brought to Nenagh Hospital to be stabilised before going to Limerick.</P>
      <P>I want to be clear on this. We are told that the day services in Nenagh will be increased, with which I am delighted. What specialist services will come to Nenagh? When will consultants be available there? My understanding is they will be available only for day services. What will happen to Nenagh's acute beds? I presume they will be closed, after which acute hospital services will then be available only in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 70% of patients currently using A&amp;E in Nenagh will continue to do so, which is fine. However, let us take the example of a broken hand, a classic example in a county where there is a lot of hurling, with a patient presenting on a Sunday afternoon at A&amp;E in Nenagh Hospital. Such a case would not be unusual. The hand will be X-rayed and the patient will have to be sent to Limerick. An elderly relation of mine recently had a minor fall in the nursing home where he is a patient. As the nursing home was giving him excellent care, he was brought from Roscrea to <Col N="436" />Nenagh Hospital, where an X-ray revealed a hairline fracture in his shoulder. He was then brought by ambulance to Limerick for an identical X-ray. The people attending to him told me all this. I understand the staff in Nenagh Hospital were being cautious, but we must look at the delivery of care in such cases.</P>
    <P>I want to look at the issue of value for money. Cost is a very important issue in the current debate and has arisen regularly. According to the Minister's departmental figures, the cost per patient in 2001 in a major teaching hospital was &euro;558 compared to &euro;391 in a county hospital. The amount of time spent by patients in county hospitals is invariably shorter than in major teaching or voluntary hospitals. Nenagh hospital, on a budget of &euro;15 million last year, was able to deliver 3,000 acute medical admissions, 1,500 acute surgical admissions, 2,400 day cases and 11,000 accident and emergency cases. The hospital has a large outpatient service, including ShannonDoc and a primary care unit which could be upgraded and expanded.</P>
    <P>One of the inevitable things that will happen as a result of the Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly reports is reform of the health boards. An announcement has been made about the establishment of an implementation body to put into place the recommendations of these reports. Where is the accountability, particularly locally, in regard to decisions on delivery of the health service? It is not good enough to have another NRA style board which none of us, including the Minister, can get near. We in this House had better be careful to ensure we do not create another NRA and then spend the following ten years whinging about it and trying to abolish and replace it with something else. Accountability is essential to the delivery of a good health service and to the democratic process in which Members in both Houses believe. We must ensure local ownership of decisions and local trust and belief in what is being delivered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State of the House and thank the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, for bringing the Hanly report to the House. I wish to put on the record that I was a member of the national task force on medical staffing representing the public interest. At the time I was a lay member and not an elected Senator. I attended in my capacity as a member of the Medical Council on which I represent the lay interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the contents of the Hanly report well. The group, as the Minister pointed out, was made up of hard-working people who came together for 300 meetings. I did not attend 300 meetings. Membership of the board comprised medics, nursing staff and other health related professions together with medical unions, employers agencies and others. It is a product of a very detailed process. Senator Feighan referred to the costs of compiling such reports. I, and every man and woman on the task force, gave of our time at no <Col N="437" />cost. If costs were involved they were minimal. Those involved were committed people seeking to better our health service.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was starting from the position of what was best for patients. That has always been his view on such matters. The Hanly report was commissioned for a number of different reasons, one of which was to examine the working hours of junior hospital doctors. It is also about patients and delivering a better and safe service which is consultant provided and does not rely on the services of junior hospital doctors who on occasions are very tired men and women. Some of them work approximately 100 hours and not the acceptable 56 hours now being directed by the EU. The Medical Council &ndash; I know this because I am a member &ndash; does not favour junior hospital doctors working 60, 70 or 100 hours. One does not get safe practice from somebody working that long. Also, the Medical Council will not allow a junior doctor to accept a post which is not a training one.</P>
    <P>Currently, junior doctors are working unsafe hours. The Hanly report recommends tiered on-call for junior doctors, cross-cover, multi-disciplinary teams and a consultant provided service. We now operate at a ratio of one consultant for every 2.3 junior doctors, which is not acceptable. Anyone who had children in medicine would want the best possible training for them. We are seeking to double our consultant places from 1,700 to 3,600 during the next ten years, which is achievable.</P>
    <P>I listened to what other speakers, in particular Senator O'Meara, had to say on the downgrading and closing of hospital beds. This report is not about bed closures or downgrading. On the contrary, it is about better utilisation of our hospitals and beds, freeing up beds used by people who do not need them. People have a vision of their local hospital but that vision is not always the reality. That is something with which, hands on heart, we can all agree. It was a breath of fresh air to listen to Senator Henry's contribution. She put her finger on the point when she said we should stop using the word &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo; and stigmatising places and should talk things up. The Hanly report takes into account the position of acute hospitals and nobody knows that better than somebody like Senator Henry. While I may not have agreed with other things she said on that matter I say, well done.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan appears worried about political fall-out in certain areas. Yes, we need political goodwill to implement the Hanly report. If Senator Feighan and his party are to challenge this report they should at least come up with an alternative. It is a little cheap to come in here and talk about all the reports that have been commissioned and the costs involved. My colleague, Senator Glynn, has already pointed to what was delivered by the Bacon report in regard to physiotherapy and language therapy. In 1983, the Opposition, in relation to the Tierney report, said the provision of 1,500 consultants by 2003 was <Col N="438" />madness. I wonder what they have to say now given that the total consultant component of the medical service at 1,730? The Opposition should not knock this unless it has a better alternative.</P>

If we were to engage in how we were to deliver the best quality service for patients in the health system who better to engage with but the people delivering that service. The Opposition can call that &ldquo;spin&rdquo;; they can call it what they want, but that is the way forward. The Opposition says we are downgrading local hospitals. I put it to them we are enhancing them. I am in no doubt about that. There will be no downgrading of the Ennis, Nenagh, Ballinasloe or Roscommon hospitals. They will hold on to their consultants.</P>

I support Senator Glynn's call on not to remove democratically elected representatives from health bodies on which they can play a role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. If the basic principle of benchmarking was reward for increased paper usage and excessive verbiage, the Department of Health and Children would be a model for all to <Col N="439" />follow. The production of 148 reports in five years must be symptomatic of something but it is not an efficient health service. Following the other 147 reports, the Hanly report must be the worst of the batch. It offers no viable solutions to resolve the rapidly escalating crisis in medical care and, worse still, it offers no guarantee of funding to implement its recommendations.</P>
      <P>However, in keeping with the old adage what comes around goes around, it offers another report to follow as one of its key recommendations. This report is conveniently scheduled by the Government not to appear until after the local and European elections. The deferral of the report is laden with self-serving motivation, as unpalatable proposals are not the usual pre-election fare of the Government parties. Just as Nero fiddled while Rome was burning, it should not be forgotten that, while reports are written and action is not taken, people's lives are on the line. The Hanly report puts forward plans that are essentially experimental. They will put the lives of our citizens at risk and that could lead to increased suffering and death.</P>
      <P>Given the mounting evidence of Government mismanagement of our health services during the Celtic tiger years and the failure of the Government parties since their re-election to deliver on their promises, I have no faith in their ability to effect major changes to the system without endangering lives. Meeting the EU deadline on the reduction of junior doctors' hours to no more than 58 per week by making a feeble call for pilot projects and future reports is an attempt by the Government to rationalise and close small hospitals under the guise of reform and a promise of better quality services.</P>
      <P>Investment will be the crucial factor in the success of new initiatives for our health service. Sadly, when such funding was available in the boom years and the entire health sector could have been transformed in terms of both acute and non-acute services, it was wasted in favour of short-term expediency. If the recommendations of the Hanly report are to be implemented, it will be imperative that regional facilities receive significant funding to provide viable alternatives for the loss of local facilities. A total of 2,500 new beds will be necessary to replace emergency beds lost at local level and major investment will be required to replace facilities at local level. Extra resources will be required in the primary care area and GPs will require skills updating so that they can take on tasks previously undertaken by local hospitals. Ambulance services and the training of paramedics will need to be greatly extended and a countrywide air ambulance service will have to be established as a matter of priority. Senator Feighan referred to the poor health infrastructure and improved infrastructure will be of vital importance, with a specific requirement for major road investment. Local hospitals will require extensive funding to equip them for their new roles in local elective surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" />Local authorities are cash starved and are forced to generate funds through new local charges which impose unrealistic stealth taxes on residents. To paraphrase Ian Duncan Smith, being a taxpayer has become the hardest job in Ireland. Given the ever increasing burden on taxpayers, whose rapidly emptying purses are paying for the mismanagement of the Government, Fine Gael, which is opposed to the Government policy of closing down vital accident and emergency departments in local hospitals, believes it is imperative the people do not suffer the ill-effects of poorly devised policy.</P>
    <P>Rationalising and concentrating services may be a positive proposal in regard to certain specialities but vital maternity services and accident and emergency departments should not be included, given that time is of the essence in many life or death cases dealt with by these services. Emergency services are the deciding factor in life or death incidents. With public confidence in the health services at an all-time low, the people must be consulted and their wishes taken into consideration before their money is once again spent on ill-conceived and unpopular options.</P>
    <P>It is important that the views of locally elected representatives are taken into account regarding new health structures because they are the voice of the people. The most significant problem faced by health boards, heretofore, was lack of funding to administer services both locally and regionally and not the appointment of public representatives. Numerous reports have not resolved the funding problem with every health board still struggling in this regard. This is having a devastating effect on the health service. Many community initiatives put forward by voluntary bodies and others have been neglected due to a lack of funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister should confirm that phase 2B of the Longford-Westmeath hospital in Mullingar will proceed without delay. People in the Midland Health Board area are anxious about its future and I seek confirmation that this work will proceed.</P>
    <P>This is the 148th report produced by the Department of Health and Children and we do not know how many are in the pipeline. Senator Feeney acknowledged that it took 300 meetings to put this report together. What was the cost of those meetings to the taxpayer?</P>

      <P>I welcome the encouraging report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing, also known as the Hanly report. I applaud the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and his ministerial colleagues in his Department for the work they have done to compile this report. I do not mind if there were 3,000 meetings. The fact that the report has been well researched, compiled and produced is evident from the number of meetings mentioned by Senator Feeney. The process bodes well for what I hope will be a speedy process of implemen<Col N="442" />tation. If I can find a fault with the reports that have been produced, it is that they are not implemented speedily. There should be an accelerated rate of implementation of the Hanly report. I put that forward as a suggestion and I hope it will happen.</P>
      <P>The Hanly report takes account of the EU directive on junior doctors' working hours, the effects of which will become apparent within 12 months. I am heartened by the comments of the Minister, Deputy Martin, this morning. He said that the number of junior doctors will not be increased, but a larger number of consultants will be made available.</P>
      <P>I read the report and marked the sections I wish to discuss while I was away for the weekend. The report makes it quite clear that hospitals will not be closed. This area should be focused on and I would like Ministers and spokespersons to discuss it. Although the centres of excellence will be the main hospital centres, every hospital will be a centre of excellence in itself, regardless of its level. Perhaps we are shying away from this aspect of the report. It is possible that we are not concentrating on it.</P>
      <P>The Hanly report determines the best options for patients. We should not be debating what should be in the various towns because the most important matter is to determine what is best for patients when they need to be attended to. I do not believe that the people of this country are best attended to by being brought to a hospital that does not have the competence or the staffing to undertake a particular medical regime for them. It is clear that such a system would not be in the best interests of patients. It is important that hospitals should know their parameters, limitations and challenges so they can be staffed and funded accordingly.</P>
      <P>The report has outlined where the major centres of excellence will be and what they will have. As a result, patients and their families will know what is on offer in the various centres. They will be able to decide how they can best be served by the hospitals. The various hospitals will be linked by primary and secondary care services, which are hugely important. Those involved in each centre of excellence have been made aware of the equipment, funding and staff provisions at the centres. The link to the primary care sector involves individual GPs diagnosing patients' particular conditions and deciding where they can be best served in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The services already provided in some hospitals will be enhanced. Rather than considering that the levels of service on offer in other hospitals have been diminished, one should bear in mind that a certainty will exist in respect of the levels of staffing and funding on offer. We should not whistle in the wind and try to ensure that everybody who has something holds on to it. My experience in life has been that a person who becomes ill is best served if the extent of his or her illness is known &ndash; this is also true of their family, friends and acquaintances. The relevant <Col N="443" />GP and consultant are the experts in that regard. Equally, one should know where to send the patient to receive the best service.</P>
    <P>Rather than demanding of a hospital a level of expertise it does not have, trying to stretch its budget and holding parades to demand what it should or should not have, one will know under this system what a hospital has. The fact that we will be able to say that a given hospital is a centre of excellence will help to build confidence. The parameters of the hospital will be known and staffing and funding will be allocated on that basis. The process will proceed in stages.</P>
    <P>It is time for us to grow up in respect of these matters. We should be honest with one another. We should decide whether we are seeking status for our towns on the basis that a hospital can do certain things. Is it not far better for one to know what one's hospital can do? A certain status is associated with knowing that one can refer a person to a hospital in the certain knowledge that it can offer certain things. This is more important than relying on old diktats and dogmas that have been overtaken by modern life. It should be remembered that while the diagnostic, curative, consultancy and operational requirements of patients can vary, they do not vary in respect of one central tenet &ndash; all patients require the best possible treatment. All consumers of the Department of Health and Children's medical services want the best treatment, regardless of where it is received.</P>
    <P>I live in a town that does not have a hospital. I outlined the historical reasons for this in the House on a previous occasion. St. Vincent's Hospital, which treats elderly people in a caring way, is very good. The Midland Health Board provides a range of services, for example, diagnostic services, paediatric services, X-ray services and ambulance services. All of these things were laid out in the report and I am seeking their implementation. It is good we should know that such services will be provided. There will be a one-stop-shop, which will mean that consultants will come much more often. One will be diagnosed much earlier and in a better way before being referred to the appropriate&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very pleased with the report. I wish it an accelerated rate of implementation and hope its very desirable goals will be realised.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We, as Members, should value having a debate in this House on something as potentially controversial as the Hanly report. We should not turn it into a replica of the kind of debate one might have in the Dáil. I do not wish to cast any aspersions on the other House, but it sometimes seems to have more heat than light in its debates, perhaps because of the more intense political conflict.</P>
      <P>It seems there are different views on the Hanly report in all the political parties. This may be partly attributed to geography and partly to perspective. No rational person could argue with the presentation on the Hanly report made by the Minister for Health and Children, who stated that investment in the quality of service the country needs cannot be uniformly spread among every small town. Nobody could argue about the need to have specialist centres of high quality.</P>
      <P>I should have declared an interest at the beginning of my speech, as I do in all debates of this kind, because I am married to a woman who is, at least intermittently, a hospital consultant. I read a headline somewhere about somebody looking for &euro;500,000 per year and I was planning my retirement on the strength of it. However, I never anticipate that sum or believe it will appear before I retire under the normal process of ageing and elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great belief in the necessity and centrality of a consultant-delivered service. We need to realise that the term &ldquo;junior doctor&rdquo; is dreadfully simplifying. It applies to those who are <Col N="445" />essentially in their first year of internship, straight out of medical school, and also applies to those who have the same formal postgraduate medical qualifications as the consultants for whom they work. If the philosophy behind the Hanly report is realised, junior medical positions will be junior because they will be training posts. The natural and logical progression will be that anybody who is successful in the training programme will have a reasonable expectation of becoming a consultant within a contractual arrangement that delivers service in the public hospitals. We need to refine the whole area of hospital medicine in which &ldquo;junior&rdquo; really does mean junior as in &ldquo;under-trained&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some of the reports written about the service provided in hospitals imply &ndash; sometimes they are true &ndash; that certain doctors are insufficiently qualified. It is a well-known fact that one would be wiser not to have an emergency early in July or January because the first line of medical care one encounters in the big teaching hospitals could well involve somebody on the first day of his or her training. We need to rationalise the system so that when somebody is sufficiently ill to require an accident and emergency service, the doctor who treats him will be properly and fully qualified.</P>
    <P>To pretend every hospital in the country can have everything is not what we are talking about. My grumbles with the Hanly report do not concern where things should be, because we could argue about this forever, but about sequencing, to use a phrase out of the context in which it has been used for the past fortnight. It would be possible to persuade people who fear they will lose services they have enjoyed of the logic of having centres of excellence if they saw a superb service developed elsewhere first. At the risk of falling out of favour with Deputy Sherlock, I contend that the people in Mallow could be persuaded if they had a centre of excellence with no queues or problems, within a reasonable distance and which could be reached on a particularly good road. This is what the Hanly report is about.</P>
    <P>The report is about delivering quality care in centres of excellence, covering the full spectrum of care, and then providing quality of care over a more limited spectrum in local centres that comprise centres of excellence within their capacities. We are not talking about hospitals will fewer good people but about hospitals with a smaller range of specialist services. The way to persuade the public is to develop quality centres that they can see and show them that a traffic jam on the margins of Cork, Limerick or Dublin will not mean that a journey from Naas, for example, to a centre of excellence in Dublin, such as Tallaght Hospital, would not take two and a half hours, as it would have done this morning in an ambulance. It would definitely have taken two and a half hours to get from Naas to St. Vincent's Hospital because of the traffic chaos.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of joined-up thinking. One cannot just look at a map and state the distance between <Col N="446" />two points is only 20 miles when, in some cases, this distance could take two hours to travel. I would love to see Hanly revisited in terms of the time it takes to get from one place to another, rather than speaking in terms of miles.</P>
    <P>I once encountered a little problem in the wilds of west Kerry in which the Department of Education and Science wanted a primary teacher to move to a new school because of staffing numbers. It chose another school nine miles away, believing that this was a reasonable distance for the teacher to travel. However, this meant that the teacher had to travel over a mountain, the Connor Pass, which is prone to frost, fog and snow for four months of the year.</P>
    <P>Americans talk of journeys in terms of time rather than miles. We need to do this. If we did so and had high-quality services, people would demand to go to the location of these services rather than demand a less good but more widespread service, to which they could gain access in their own locality. This would also be the case if the improved services the Minister described were delivered.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, I believe we should not have the Minister for Health and Children in the House when talking about health. Health policy is being dictated by the Department of Finance, not only in terms of funding. The Department of Finance established and funded at least one of the studies we have been discussing recently. Its approach is that having generated the report, it also has responsibility for it. Apart from the extraordinary centralism of that view, it also makes it entirely meaningless for a well intentioned Minister to come to the House and outline policies, with which many of us would not, in principle, disagree, when there is not a squeak from the funding Department about how it proposes to provide the funding needed to offer the type of services that would perhaps persuade people to accept the logic of the Hanly report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I have less involvement with local services than my colleagues in the House, I thought it might be helpful to offer some observations from the point of view of somebody from outside the health service who has worked in the health field. In recent years, I chaired a committee which carried out a review of the acute hospital services in Northern Ireland. Having done our sums, we arrived at conclusions which are not a million miles away from those of the Hanly report. If the Minister wishes a copy of the report in question &ndash; it is mentioned in the bibliography of the Hanly report &ndash; I would gladly provide it and discuss it with him at any time. I hope the Hanly report will be considered as an opportunity rather than a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with many of the points made by Senator Ryan who may be interested to learn that our review in the North defined access in terms of journey times and went to considerable trouble to establish journey times for different areas. It distresses me that my colleagues in the media, <Col N="447" />particularly the electronic media, grab for the word &ldquo;downgraded&rdquo; every time they discuss hospital changes. They appear to think of nothing else. Where is the downgrading in looking after chronic conditions, elderly people and other groups?</P>
    <P>The Hanly report is the way forward. We should strive for a consultant delivered service. To extend a comment made by Senator Ryan, ultimately training posts should be supernumerary as it would allow us judge the current position.</P>
    <P>Acute care is what catches the public imagination and is talked about as if there were nothing else in the health sector. One must consider acute hospitals in the context of the wider health sector. Primary care is extremely important and investment in it and the continuing care and community care sectors could do more to relieve strain than investment elsewhere. The health system must be a seamless continuum in which acute care is only one episode.</P>
    <P>Changes are taking place and new patterns have emerged in the way medicine is delivered. If one is to have a consultant led service, one must employ a sufficient number of consultants to have proper rotas. They must also have a sufficient workload to enable them to maintain their skills, and interaction must take place between different places. These requirements drive one towards centres. Other developments, notably in telemedicine, will allow one to decentralise a considerable amount of diagnosis and after care. Changes are also taking place in the pattern of disease. Chronic and degenerative conditions are associated with ageing and, as the Minister stated, those affected by them are entitled to the highest quality of care at local level.</P>
    <P>Our review in the North came up with the idea of hospital systems, which are intended to shift people's perception of hospital services as somehow being bricks and mortar located in a particular place. The idea of systems was that each would serve a population of 350,000 to 500,000. Acute episodes would be treated at the centre of the cluster, while it would also be possible to move in the opposite direction. This opens up enormous possibilities for a local centre, whether it is called a hospital, polyclinic or something else, given that a great deal of diagnosis can be performed using imaging and telemedicine.</P>
    <P>Significant developments are taking place in day surgery, day treatments and non-invasive surgery. Follow-up services and clinics allow one to offer in local polyclinics a wide range of services backed up by the resources of a system. People will be satisfied with such services. It is important, however, that centres of excellence do not suck all the resources out of the system. In the days when people referred to hub and spoke in the context of hospitals, the hub grew fat and the spoke thin until the rim fell off. People have to be reassured that the provision at the centre is <Col N="448" />complemented by the maintenance of local services.</P>
    <P>A highly efficient ambulance service is also required as it is necessary to be able to move people and information around the system. A proper diagnostic infrastructure in which tests and so forth become immediately available is also needed. If the concept can be presented to people in this fashion, they will accept it as is an improvement on the current service.</P>
    <P>As part of the review of services in the North, we carried out a study of accident and emergency departments. The study found that 85% of those who attended accident and emergency had minor injuries which could have been dealt with at a local centre fitted with the proper equipment while around 10% of cases were complicated and required the full resources of a neurosurgical department. It is important to assure people that if they are in trouble they can be brought quickly to the place where they can benefit most.</P>
    <P>There is a major question about retaining public confidence in the service and one of the difficulties with discussing this issue is that in seeming to find fault with the current service, we lose confidence in it.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in the health service in the North &ndash; I am sure it is the same here &ndash; is that most people who work in it appear to have a vested interest in saying how bad it is. It is necessary to bring the professions along. Changes are taking place in this area. For example, the divisions between the professions are changing, with nurses now performing certain tasks which would have been carried out by doctors in the past. Many functions are now being performed in the community. Many diabetics, for example, who would have been in hospital in the past are now being maintained in the community. We will also need to enrich the jobs of paramedics. If, however, we look at the wider pattern, it is moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I was particularly impressed by the tone and quality of the Minister's speech, particularly his starting point, namely, the need to show compassion to patients and maintain standards. We all want friends, relations and ourselves to be treated by the best people at the best time. While there will always be a tension at local level, let us please try to stop using terms such as &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo;. We must stop thinking of the acute service as the only service people need. Let us examine how we improve the service within the resources available to us, which are financial and human &ndash; one cannot conjure staff out of the air.</P>
    <P>The unrolling of change will take some years. As previous speakers stated, we need two or three good working examples of the quality of the service that can be developed. I commend the report and the Minister's approach to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to the House. We all know that reorganisation of the health service is <Col N="449" />an absolute necessity. It is one of the key issues in the Hanly report, page 17 of which states: &ldquo;The priority must be to provide a safe, high-quality service to all patients at all times.&rdquo; However, this statement is completely aspirational. The Minister for Health and Children launched a new policy document on health, Quality and Fairness, and that document had plenty of aspirational language also, but not a single element of substance of the expressed intentions of that policy has been implemented. If it has been implemented, please tell us where. Otherwise, we will have to look for them.</P>
      <P>As a member of a health board for a long time, the only consequence of the policy that I can see is a paper chase. If the Minister of State, his senior Minister and others in the Department of Health are satisfied to go on indefinitely with no improvement, even though the record shows there have been 148 reports on the subject, then the emphasis on patients as the priority for health care in 2003 is extremely rich. We know what has happened and the cutbacks that have occurred. There are people waiting on trolleys in corridors, including old people who are in need of services delivered at community level.</P>
      <P>It is a pity the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is not here because I was present, as a member of the Western Health Board, when he came to Ballinasloe &ndash; Senator Leyden was also there &ndash; after the private hospital was purchased. The Minister said on that occasion that it was his and the Government's intention to develop it as an acute hospital and centre of excellence. He was playing to the gallery, just as he is doing now by telling us the patient is the priority &ndash; if only we could believe his and the Government's intentions. I remind him of the words heard by hundreds of people on a day of celebration in Ballinasloe when Portiuncula Hospital was purchased. I was glad to hear his comments, but what has happened in the interim? Due to the Hanly report, and the Hanly report mark two, which we are awaiting, there is a possibility of a replication in the other health board areas of what has already happened in the pilot areas. On that basis, Portiuncula Hospital will be downgraded.</P>
      <P>Senators on the Government side today mentioned the word &ldquo;downgrading.&rdquo; They do not want to hear that word because the reality is that there will be a loss of service. The accident and emergency department will be closed, although Senator Feeney said that will not happen. The Minister of State present earlier was mesmerised by the statement. This points to confusion, even within the Department, involving the Minister and Ministers of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very appropriate that the Minister of State is here because I was present, with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, at a public function in Ballinasloe during an employment crisis in Ballinasloe. She gave a guarantee that there would be no downgrading of Portiuncula Hospital and said that those who <Col N="450" />were making such a proposal were wrong and should desist. Her statement was supported by the Minister of State and the local Government Deputy. They gave undertakings, but nobody will believe the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister of State or the Deputy in the current climate, especially since they have now deferred the publication of the final part of the Hanly report until after the local elections.</P>
    <P>This is cynicism in the extreme as well as an example of political jobbery to ensure that the full extent of the public's wrath will not descend on Government candidates in those circumstances. The public knows that all the cuts proposed prior to the last general election were suppressed. We have no further need to refer to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's statement on financial cuts, prior to the last election, compared to what actually happened after the results of that election.</P>
    <P>We should consider the vagueness of the language used in the report. It refers to &ldquo;should&rdquo;, &ldquo;could&rdquo;, &ldquo;would&rdquo; and &ldquo;might&rdquo;. There is a series of these words on page 17 of the report. No. 4 states that &ldquo;substantially more consultants should be appointed&rdquo;. No. 6 on the next page states: &ldquo;In the pilot regions studied, acute hospital services should be delivered by an integrated network of hospitals.&rdquo; If there was any determination on the part of the Minister, the Government and the Department, &ldquo;should&rdquo; would not be used. Instead it would state &ldquo;will be delivered.&rdquo; Definite commitments to what is outlined in the Hanly report would have been given, but there is no such certainty. The same point can be said now of the Hanly report in the light of what happened to the policy document, Quality and Fairness, in that pious platitudes and statements of intent were offered, but not one item of substance has been brought forward.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Senator because he has, like me, a very important interest in Portiuncula Hospital in that constituency.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that if the conditions in the pilot areas, including his own health board area, are replicated in other areas, Portiuncula Hospital will be downgraded and we will also lose the accident and emergency and maternity units? These two specialties, among many in the acute hospital, are in themselves centres of excellence. They were developed by committed people, such as the Franciscan Sisters, over the years in the private hospital with their dedication to delivering a service of excellence in its own right. The Minister should not deny that area, where the local community, in the absence of Government commitments, funded the hospital through many fundraising projects to bring it to the standard of excellence it enjoys today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" />What is happening now? It has been bought for the purpose of turning it into a five day week, nine to five hospital, and for the remainder of the time it will be a convalescent home with a professional nursing service taking care of people. The report states that 70% of minor procedures are performed at local level. We will have people from Clifden coming to Portiuncula for a minor medical or surgical procedure, bypassing the centre of excellence as they will not be able to get in there. If that is what embracing Hanly entails, on the first day of its implementation something will happen, somewhere in Ireland, that will lead to tragedy because it is a flawed document. With the greatest professional respect to Mr. Hanly, a person with supreme knowledge of aviation and engineering, he was not the person to interpret, with any certainty, the needs of the local communities.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said he had an interest, because of his spouse's profession, in the development of a centre of excellence in Cork. He also said it was no trouble to travel from Mallow to Cork. It is my suspicion that an inner group made the final decisions in the Hanly report. In the case of the Western Health Board, Dr. Mary Hynes was one of the senior people who made the final decisions along with Professor Gerry Loftus, both of whom are based in University College Hospital, Galway, and whose interests were focused on that. Unless the Tánaiste comes forward once more, I fear for the future of Portiuncula Hospital as an acute centre. It will be downgraded because, as Senator Maurice Hayes said, all the finance, resources and personnel will be sucked into the centre of excellence and the peripheral areas will be forgotten once again. I did not believe that the Minister, Deputy Martin, should allow that to happen.</P>

I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, who has more responsibilities in the Department than I had when I held that office between 1987 and 1989.</P>
      <P>In 1968 the famous Fitzgerald report was published. It was compiled by a group of consultants who decided that Roscommon County Hospital should become a community health centre. The man who commissioned that report was the former Deputy and Minister, Seán Flanagan, whose car crashed in Tarmonbarry and whose life was saved in the accident and emergency department of Roscommon County Hospital by the surgeon, Mr. O'Hanrahan. The former Minister realised then the benefits of having an acute hospital nearby and the policy was changed. The 1970 Act was passed.</P>

    <P>Now we have decided to remove the health boards, the single avenue for public representatives and others to convey their views. The Minister of State is a former member of a health <Col N="452" />board. Until 30 June 2002, I was chairman of the Western Health Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not go into that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>During my time as chairman, tremendous work was done by the board on behalf of the public it served. I stand over that work.</P>
      <P>The national task force on medical staffing comprised about 51 consultants and professionals but hardly any consumers to put forward the views of the people of the west and other areas. I would not rely on any paid official, whether it is Dr. Hynes or Dr. Ryan, to put forward the views that I, Senator Kitt or Senator Ulick Burke would put forward. Why were their voices not heard? We should bin the report. It is a disaster both medically and politically. I do not stand over this report and I intend to ensure it is binned.</P>
      <P>However, I stand over &ldquo;Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You&rdquo; which had a vision and received marvellous input from the health boards. There were no proposals in that report to remove the health boards or to close accident and emergency departments. It also took account of the regulations and directives from Europe. The vision I stand by, which was adopted by the Fianna Fáil Party before the election of 2002, is the vision in the health strategy. It is:</P>
      <P>A health system that supports and empowers you, your family and your community to achieve your full health potential</P>
      <P>A health system that is there when you need it, that is fair and that you can trust</P>
      <P>A health system that encourages you to have your say, listens to you, and ensures that your views are taken into account.</P>
      <P>That does not include the removal of the health boards. I attended the meetings in Dublin Castle when the Minister was present. Most of the people involved with that consultative document were in the health services and were from the regions. There were none of these vested interest professionals who want large hospitals with large numbers of consultants. Has the health strategy document, &ldquo;Quality and Fairness &ndash; A Health System for You&rdquo;, been binned? It was to be implemented over the next seven to ten years and was well received by the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brennan report, the Prospectus report and other reports have been produced since then. My primary concern is that the people in my constituency get a good health service. I signed the contract for the accident and emergency department in Roscommon on 15 May 2002. It will cost about &euro;8 million to complete. I signed it as chairman of the Western Health Board. The Minister said today that he gave the board the money and I acknowledge that. I acknowledge the work he has done for accident and emergency service provision in Roscommon. However, I did not sign <Col N="453" />that contract to close the accident and emergency department in Roscommon County Hospital.</P>
    <P>If this report is fully implemented, the hospital will only open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. I passed the hospital this morning and the lights were on in the accident and emergency department. It is a beacon of hope for those who are ill and in need of emergency treatment. Yesterday, there was an 85 year old man and a 92 year old nun on trolleys in the hospital. Would they get a bed in Galway? Will the 14,000 people who are treated in the accident and emergency department in Roscommon be shipped to Galway where there will be no beds available for them? There will be no beds because it is more expensive to provide those beds than to provide the consultants in Roscommon County Hospital.</P>
    <P>I signed the contract for Portiuncula Hospital. The Western Health Board bought the hospital for £11 million. We did not buy it to close the accident and emergency department or to close the maternity unit. I owe that hospital a great debt of gratitude. Mary and I had four children in that hospital and it provided a great service. Portiuncula and Roscommon County Hospital work closely together. The hospital in Roscommon in excellent. I might be parochial but it is a referral hospital. When a case arrives, the first priority is to ensure the patient is made safe and if they have to go to an orthopaedic hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital or the Mater, they go prepared and, in many cases, they return to Roscommon for rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>There is a good working relationship between Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula and, in turn, between Portiuncula and UCHG and Merlin Park. They work well together. The model is working well and I have received no complaints about it. Why should I embrace the Hanly report? Why should the Minister and the Department embrace it? I was elected by councillors throughout Ireland and I was not elected to say that everything is wonderful or that the report is wonderful. The Minister and the Government have their view while I, as a Fianna Fáil Senator and councillor, have mine. I will campaign to ensure that the accident and emergency service continues in Roscommon. If that department, the shopfront of a hospital, is closed, the patients will be gone. The bigger hospitals will be strengthened and the patients will not return.</P>
    <P>There are 8,000 people aged more than 65 years in County Roscommon. They are in need of medical care on a more regular basis than younger people. That is a fact of life. In many cases, these people might suffer from pneumonia or something similar and they need attention. It is not necessary to go to UCHG to get that attention. You get it in Roscommon County Hospital or Roscommon Acute General Hospital and we have doubled the number of consultants to ensure that they will continue to get this service in the future. We have increased medical, surgical, anaesthetic, radiology and radiography services and we have the best screening room. It is <Col N="454" />all there. I signed a &euro;1 million contract for new theatres. I insisted that I sign that contract before my term on the Western Health Board was terminated on 13 June 2002. I was the outgoing chairman and I was not even allowed to hand over my chain of office to the incoming chairman. However, I told the chief executive officer that if I did not sign that contract it would not be signed once I had gone. I signed it because I was chairman of the Western Health Board and because I insisted. I also campaigned for, and was successful in getting, St. Colman's ward upgraded. We upgraded the hospital, which will now be perfect. The accident and emergency department will meet the needs of the people of Roscommon and surrounding areas such as Longford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where to start. I have heard quite a few contributions during the last hour. I fully agree with Senator O'Rourke about the importance of the report's implementation. That is the challenge for the Government. I have listened intently to all the speakers. Senator Brendan Ryan made the very good point that, when people are speaking about access to hospitals, they should be talking about the time taken to get there rather than the number of miles to be travelled. That is a valid contribution. Senator Maurice Hayes shared his experience and his involvement in Northern Ireland politics with us. That was extremely useful, and I was delighted Senator Hayes was so hopeful and supportive of the Hanly report. He sees it as an opportunity for the health services to improve and develop. I agree with his statement about consultant provided services and his mentioning developments in telemedicine. Things have changed, and we cannot continue with the <Col N="456" />model of health services that we had in Ireland in the past.</P>
      <P>Centres of excellence are the way to go, and the Hanly report has certainly very much concentrated on them. I share the concerns of those worried about services being sucked into the centres of excellence. However, anyone who has read the report carefully will see that is not what is suggested. On the contrary, there would be far more services given to local hospitals for the delivery of better day care services and so on. What Senator Hayes said should be repeated.</P>
      <P>I have listened to some of the statements made and I can understand people's concerns about their local hospitals. I have listened to a fair amount of the debate on television about the Hanly report. If one stands back and thinks of the people who work in the services, many of whom I have met, one will see that many of them are getting rather fed up. They have spent all their time working in the services, but people are constantly standing up and talking about downgrading those services. They are people who work extremely hard every day of the week all over the country, and they have been doing so for years. Many of those nurses and doctors, and all the ancillary professional services in the hospitals, are becoming demotivated by the constant negative drip effect on the health services. Many people's contributions are negative all the time, as if there have not been improvements in the health services. There have been huge improvements in this country's health services over the past ten years or so.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Ulick Burke. His contribution was extremely negative, and he saw nothing positive whatsoever in the Hanly report. I am sorry to say that. He stated that Mr. Hanly had deferred phase two, but he has not even done phase two. He admitted at his press conference and in his report &ndash; if anyone read it &ndash; that he wishes to implement the proposals in the two pilot areas first, after which his team will examine the other regions. To say that the report is flawed is a tragedy when it has only just been published.</P>
      <P>There have been huge improvements, including in the number of consultants employed over the past few years. The Tierney report in 1993 led to an increase over the years to 2003. The current Government has gone way over the recommended percentages in employing those consultants all over the country. There have been huge improvements in cancer services and additional services to patients and clients everywhere, in equipment, facilities and the delivery of health care. Waiting lists are down in several health board areas. The national treatment purchase fund has been a huge success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Primary care is being improved constantly, and the present Government has put a huge amount of money into GP co-operatives all over the country to ensure that many of those who were unnecessarily going to accident and emergency departments are now able to attend a proper GP service in their own community. I have spoken to <Col N="457" />many of the GPs involved in such services. They are thrilled with it. That service is working in many areas, although not yet all over the country, since in some areas the GPs were not able to organise themselves. However, in the areas where GP co-ops are working, they provide a better service to the patient and cut the numbers going to accident and emergency departments. We all welcome that.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome the report of the National Task Force on Medical Staffing which the Government published last week. The Hanly report is a very significant contribution to the development of health policy in Ireland and its implementation will be to the benefit of patients and health professionals alike. My colleague, Deputy Micheál Martin, the Minister for Health and Children, has set out the background to the report and addressed its main features. From my own perspective, I want to concentrate on some key points which I urge the House to take into account as the debate proceeds.</P>
    <P>We must remember that it is a service for and about patients rather than about geography.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <P>&mdash;we will get the results. There are many aspects to the report, including reducing the average working hours of junior doctors. Is anyone suggesting that it is wrong to reduce doctors' working hours? Are we to continue with that system? The Government has been courageous and I am delighted that the Hanly report underlines this fact. What we need is a consultant provided, not a consultant led, service. There is a major difference between the two and I look forward to the provision of a consultant provided service.</P>
      <P>There will be much needed changes in our medical education system. These will have to take place, particularly in light of the implications of the working time directive for junior doctors. In addition, there will be a reorganisation of acute hospital services. All of the proposals in the Hanly report are fundamentally concerned with providing a quality service to patients. We must not lose sight of this in the debate during the coming weeks and months.</P>
      <P>The report will not lead to the closure of any hospital. Neither will it lead to the so-called downgrading of services.</P>

If the number of consultants is doubled, there will be many more consultants working in the smaller hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Hanly report proposes that local hospitals should have substantially increased services in a number of extremely important areas, such as elective day procedures and out-patient work. Instead of having to travel to the major hospitals for many medical and surgical procedures, the report proposes that these would be provided on-site in local hospitals, closer to local communities. This can only improve the services available locally. We must ask ourselves how this can be represented as a diminution of services in smaller hospitals when the report proposes precisely the opposite.</P>
      <P>Let us consider more closely what the Hanly report proposes for accident and emergency services. It points to a huge body of evidence that treatments for serious and urgent conditions, including those which may be life threatening, are best provided at a location where there is a full range of specialties available on-site. These include medicine, surgery and anaesthesia as well as a range of important back-up services in such areas as X-ray and pathology. To do this, and to cover a full 24-hour, seven day period within a 48-hour week, we need hospitals with at least 45 to 50 consultants. At present, many smaller hospitals have as few as ten consultants and there would not be sufficient work for 45 or 50 consultants in each of these hospitals. The doctors themselves would become deskilled and this would impact on the provision of high quality patient care.</P>
      <P>What is proposed instead? A very workable alternative is put forward, which is based on two key elements. First, local hospitals will continue to cater for approximately 70% of all the patients they currently see in accident and emergency departments. People with minor injuries and minor non-life threatening illnesses will continue to be seen at their local hospital. This amounts to considerably more than the &ldquo;dressing station&rdquo; to which some have referred. In fact, local hospitals will continue to treat a substantial majority of the patients with whom they currently deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second element is equally important to stress, namely, that, in the case of emergencies, the best way to meet patients' needs quickly is through immediate intervention by trained ambulance personnel at the scene. The Hanly report stresses the importance of emergency medical technicians, EMTs, who can provide immediate life saving treatment. The focus then, will not be on taking the patient to the nearest <Col N="459" />local hospital but on getting them to the hospital best equipped to deal with their condition. The immediate intervention of well trained EMTs means that taking the patient as quickly as possible to a well staffed, well equipped major hospital is by far the best course of action.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal briefly with an aspect of the report that has not received much attention in the debate during the past week. I refer here to the necessity to reduce substantially the average working hours of junior doctors. At present, non-consultant hospital doctors work an average of 75 hours per week on-site. Some work considerably more than this. Under the European Working Time Directive, we must reduce average weekly working hours to no more than 58 by next August and to a maximum of 48 by August 2009, less than six years from now.</P>
    <P>For many years, junior doctors have been vital to the running of smaller hospitals. However, they have been obliged to work extremely long hours. Under the European Working Time Directive, whether we like it or not, this must stop. This again brings into sharp focus the best role for smaller hospitals in a new environment of shorter working hours for doctors. Reducing the working hours of junior doctors is extremely important. Excessive working time can hamper doctors' ability to provide the best possible care. For safety reasons, it would be necessary to reduce non-consultant hospital doctors' working hours even in the absence of the European directive.</P>
    <P>Implementing the proposals in this report will no doubt be challenging. However, I am of the opinion that they offer the best way forward. We owe it to junior doctors to reduce their working hours, but, above all, we owe it to patients and their families to implement reform that will improve health care for everyone.</P>

      <P>Yes, I will comment. The formula of words used in the subsection was chosen because it introduces a fundamental concept employed throughout the Bill, namely, that of a direction. If we had defined the term &ldquo;direction&rdquo; we would have been obliged to have a separate definition or interpretation section in the Bill which would have contained the phrase &ldquo;In this Bill, &lsquo;direction' shall mean&rdquo;. Given the short nature of the Bill, it was decided to incorporate or introduce the concept of a direction at an early stage rather than having a definition section.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senator that the sentence in question would be more concise if her amendment was accepted. However, to accept the amendment would cause problems elsewhere in the text of the Bill by upsetting a basic premise on which the other subsections are constructed, namely, that the term &ldquo;direction&rdquo; has been defined at the outset and is then referred to throughout the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 25, to delete &ldquo;him&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have retabled this amendment and I hope the Minister of State may have reconsidered the position. The Minister of State has said that if he accepted this amendment he would have to amend the Bill itself and previous legislation. I do not accept this. The words &ldquo;the person&rdquo; are being inserted instead of &ldquo;him&rdquo;. I do not see how this requires amending legislation that already says &ldquo;him&rdquo;. I do not accept the reasoning there. I do not think it will cause any extra work to the Department were this amendment to be accepted.</P>

      <P>Amendments to any legislation are intended to be read in conjunction with the remaining provisions of the original Act. This Act does not operate in isolation. Hence, it seems impractical to follow the course advocated by the Senator and gender-proof this Bill without gender-proofing the original 1960 Act. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has been consulted on <Col N="461" />this issue and its strong advice is that this would create a huge additional workload that would have huge resource implications for all legislation.</P>
      <P>I referred last week to the codification programme for the criminal law under way in the Department. An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment that all substantive criminal law would be codified into a single crimes Act. An expert group has been set up to advise on the scope of the codification and is due to report early next year. The codification programme will provide an opportunity to gender-proof all criminal legislation and consider the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission on plain language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a question of applying a male gender regime to legislation. It is simply a matter of ensuring consistency in the expressions used where an amending Bill deals with legislation that originated prior to the beginning of the gender-proofing regime. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has assured us that it is a question of applying the appropriate terminology that suits the circumstances. For example, amendments to the Maternity (Protection) Act 1994 would be <Col N="462" />drafted in the feminine form as the original Act is in that form and references in the masculine gender would not be used there. I am not sure that the Maternity (Protection) Act comparison is apposite as it deals with mothers, and there is a distinction between a father and a mother. While we changed our practice in this issue in 1993 and legislation is now gender-proofed, there is a difficulty with the consistency of new legislation with pre-1993 legislation.</P>
    <P>There must be a consistent standard. The difficulties caused by not having a consistent standard are considerable. In any legislation, the court will view a corpus of legislation as a consistent code, taking both earlier and subsequent legislation into account. I do not accept that it is practical to have one standard of draughtsmanship for a Bill and a different standard for an earlier Act. There simply must be consistency in legislation that amends previous legislation. This is our central issue regarding this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 23, after &ldquo;relates&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the victim of any other offence committed by the person, or a member of the family of a victim of an offence committed by the person&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue because the legislation should include the victims of a prisoner. There may also be other victims involved and the family of a victim should be included. The Minister should have regard to the welfare of those people when granting temporary release. It is an important provision and I am interested in the Minister of State's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. I am disappointed the Minister has not brought forward an amendment dealing with what we spoke about last week, specifically my amendment regarding <Col N="463" />any representations made by the victim or next of kin of the victim regarding the proposal to direct the release of a person from prison. The Minister should take those representations into consideration when considering a proposal to grant temporary release to a prisoner. I thank the Minister of State for being sympathetic to that proposal.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State did not bring forward an amendment in this regard because we want to strike a balance between the rights of the victims and the rights of the offender. We often hear of victims speaking about their fear of what may happen when a prisoner is released. For every prisoner there is a victim. There are 308 prisoners on temporary release today. That means there are 308 victims. This legislation presented an opportunity for us to strike a balance between those two rights. I would like to hear why the Minister of State was not in a position to bring forward an amendment in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to offences other than the offence for which the person is in prison, which goes a step too far. I acknowledged on Committee Stage that Senator Terry's amendment had a good deal of merit. Subsection (2)(<i>d</i>) provides that the Minister shall, before giving a direction under this section, have regard to the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public, including the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates, should the person be released from prison. That provision is welcome and positive. I would liked greater emphasis to be placed on the victim. Perhaps the Minister of State had a difficulty in bringing forward a positive measure in this regard but I hope that he, the Minister and the other Minister of State in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will use their influence to place greater emphasis on the victim in the drafting of all legislation. That would represent a beneficial change. I will not repeat what I said on Committee Stage but placing emphasis on the victim in legislation can have a restorative or rehabilitative effect on the culprits. However, it has not been possible to do that in this instance. The reference in the Bill is welcome. I do not support the amendment which provides that people who were previously affected by a crime committed by the person involved would also be consulted. That is unnecessary and it would not add to legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the wider question raised by Senator Terry, I would not like the House to be under the impression that the correct balance is not struck in this Bill or that the Department is not interested in the position of victims. The Department published the Victim's Charter in 2000. In dealing with legislation, we must judge it in the context of where it arises in the criminal <Col N="464" />justice system. This legislation is about a system of temporary release, which effectively is an abrogation of a period of a sentence for which an offender has been punished. The Oireachtas has given the Minister clear guidance under section 1(3) which provides that the Minister shall not give a direction under this section in respect of a person if he is of the opinion that, for reasons connected with any one or more of the matters referred to in subsection (2), it would not be appropriate to so do.</P>
      <P>While I found some attraction in the wider amendment proposed by Senator Terry, it would have the effect, regardless of how one would formulate it, of elevating the representations of the victim which are always taken into account by the Minister, and have to be necessarily because this is a grave power. It is not a power any Minister would wish to have to exercise. It would have to be exercised with great care and caution and it would be a foolish Minister who did not listen to victims in this matter.</P>
      <P>To write into the legislation the principle that the victim must be considered as a matter of legal obligation on the part of the Minister, could well lead to a challenge of the temporary release system because the basis of the system is that we are abrogating a sentence for humanitarian or other reasons connected with the rehabilitation of the offender. If we wrote into legislation that, as a matter of law, the Minister must consider the position of the victim, that reason of itself would be a reason to refuse temporary release. If the Minister developed a practice of consistently granting temporary release, irrespective of those objections, the exercise by the Minister of his powers or her powers under this legislation could become endangered.</P>
      <P>I examined this question in a minute way. The reality is that any amendment would have to be made to subsection (2), in regard to which the Minister cannot give a direction in respect of any matter in that subsection if it would not be appropriate so to do for any one or more of the matters concerned. That creates a legal problem which is insuperable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the amendment tabled by Senator Tuffy, the Government, conscious of the position of the victim, accepted a Labour Party amendment on Committee Stage in the other House, and amended section 1(2)(<i>d</i>) to provide the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public, including the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates. The concept of having regard to the victim is written into the legislation in the context of potential threats to safety and security. Senator Tuffy proposes in this amendment to widen that provision to include the victim of any other offence committed by the person or a member of the family of a victim of an offence by the person. That proposal would extend the provision very far. The subsection already provides for the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public, <Col N="465" />which could include any such persons. In a sense there is an element of repetition in the amendment.</P>
    <P>The other considerations which the Minister must take into account include the person's previous criminal record, the conduct of the person while in custody or while previously on temporary release, the nature and gravity of the offence, which also directly relates to the victim, the sentence of imprisonment and any recommendations of the court. There is a clear set of guidelines set out for the Minister in subsection (2). The amendment tabled by the Senator Tuffy takes somewhat from that clarity. The protection of the public generally as well as the victim of the offence is written into legislation and a clear set of guidelines are outlined to the Minister in the legislation beginning with the nature and gravity of the offence. The victim in this context is a victim who has seen his or her offender punished with a sentence of imprisonment by the courts. It is important to bear that in mind when we consider the context of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>h</i>) any representations made by or on behalf of the person,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I retabled this amendment because I believe this provision should be included in the Bill. Senator Henry said during the Second Stage debate that a person might have something to say about why temporary release might be good for a prisoner. The current position is limited in terms of sentence management. It is a positive step for a prisoner to be granted temporary release for education purposes or to gain work experience. The provision proposed would be an important inclusion in the legislation. Surely the person concerned, who will be the subject of the temporary release, should be able to make representations on his or her behalf which should be considered because the purpose of the temporary release is to assist the prisoner concerned. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sympathetic to this amendment. If a victim is not to be consulted, it would add insult to injury for a criminal to have such a right. When people are incarcerated, hopefully by due process, they should be there to serve their sentence. They should not be in a position to campaign or advocate for temporary release. There is a system already in place. Adding this amendment to the legislation would not be right and would run contrary to everything we have said in relation to recognition for the victim. The <Col N="466" />legislation refers to a report or a recommendation made by any other person whom the Minister considers would be of assistance in enabling him to make a decision. This covers the point made by Senator Tuffy that a person who might be an acquaintance of, or familiar with the person in jail, might be able to give evidence as to why temporary release for that prisoner would be desirable in the circumstances. Incorporating this amendment in the Bill would be wrong, even though the Bill allows for victims to be consulted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The victim can write to the Minister and, in practice, the Minister has considerable regard for what the victim has to say in a matter of this kind. I would not wish to have it on the record of the House that the Minister accepts that victims are not consulted. In any serious matter the victim can, through the relevant probation liaison officer in the prison, insist on being contacted and notified. We discussed this last time in the context of the issue of whether the victim should be automatically notified of a release.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendment, I return to my fundamental point about subsection (2) which sets out a sequence of legal matters to which the Minister must have regard in the giving of a direction. The Minister is under a specific statutory obligation not to give a direction, not to grant temporary release, if he is of the opinion that, for reasons connected with any one or more of the matters referred to, it would be inappropriate to do so. To legislate for representations from any person in this context is to oblige the Minister to personally consider them, vet them and take them into account as a matter of law in his determination. To impose that particular obligation on a Minister in the administration of any Department is a very far-reaching step.</P>
      <P>The intention of this Bill is to provide a clearer legislative basis for the power of the Minister to grant temporary release. This could lead to a position where Ministers would have to consider representations made in all cases regardless of their bona fides. This could result in an unsustainable burden being imposed on the Minister and would ultimately be a recipe for chaos.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>j</i>) such humanitarian considerations (if any) as may appear to the Minister to exist and such efforts (if any) as in the opinion of the Minister have been made by the person towards rehabilitation,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the things the Minister must have regard to are either neutral or negative. In the Bill the purposes of temporary release come across posi<Col N="467" />tively, but the issues covered by section 1(2)(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>k</i>), inclusive, in terms of what the Minister must have regard to are all either negative or neutral. If one considers the issue of temporary release and why it is a good thing, the Minister should have regard to reasons which are more positive as well as considering the potential dangers of such release. I am talking about humanitarian considerations and any efforts made by the prisoner towards rehabilitation. The Minister of State may say that the Minister has regard for that, but if that is the case, it should be in the legislation. I am interested in the comments of the Minister for State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense, the Senator has correctly hinted at the legislative scheme of the Bill because if one looks at subsection (1), it clearly empowers the Minister, who &ldquo;may direct&rdquo; temporary release. As the Senator outlined, it then outlines the positive reasons that temporary release might be granted. An example would be reintegration upon release or temporary circumstances relating to health or other humanitarian grounds. Section 1(2)(1)(<i>c</i>)(i) and (ii) refer to the good government of the prison and the good order and humane management of the prison. There is also a reference in section 1(2)(1)(<i>c</i>) to rehabilitation. When the Minister exercises his or her power under that particular subsection, the Minister does so in the context of one of those four positive reasons for temporary release.</P>
      <P>The considerations in subsection (2) are, as the Senator appropriately described it, &ldquo;neutral or negative&rdquo; checks. These checks lead to subsection (3), which is the checkmate, where the Minister &ldquo;shall not give a direction under this section in respect of a person&rdquo; in relation to matters in section 1(2). To put the Senator's amendment into the second subsection would say that the Minister &ldquo;shall not&rdquo; release a prisoner because of humanitarian considerations. That would introduce into the legislation a fundamental contradiction.</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(<i>k</i>) whether any risks arising on temporary release could be obviated by attaching conditions to the release, by limiting the duration of the release, by directing release during specified hours only in the course of a specified period, or by directing release with escort and with or without personal restraining measures,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to recognise that there are different types of release. The Minister argued against this on Committee Stage, <Col N="468" />but he should recognise that there are different types of release. For example, there could be an escort with the prisoner under a particular type of temporary release. This should be allowed for in the legislation.</P>

      <P>As I outlined to the House in relation to the last amendment, to insert this paragraph in the relevant section would be to give the Minister a reason to refuse to make a direction. Apart from that, I take it that the substance of the amendment is to ensure that the Minister would not rule out temporary release solely because of the element of risk. The difficulty is that by its nature, temporary release, even with conditions attached, always involves some element of risk. These risks can be obviated by attaching conditions, but in this context there is the whole extension of trust to a prisoner. It is in reaction to that trust that the Minister makes a decision and the Prison Service authorities consider whether further concessions which may help to reintegrate the prisoner can be granted. The Minister has the responsibility to seek to minimise the risk as much as possible with the attachment of conditions which are suitable. That is the reason the considerations taken into account by the Minister are so important. The primary concern regarding temporary release is the safety of the public, including the victim. As I stated on Committee Stage, this amendment is already covered by subsection (2)(i) which provides that the Minister can direct the temporary release of a person subject to such conditions as may be specified. Under the terms of the temporary release, these can be standard conditions which apply to all persons or specific conditions relative to the person concerned. I would be worried that if certain conditions were specifically stated in the legislation, as is proposed, the effect would be to limit the Minister's powers in this regard.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 20, after &ldquo;court&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, unless such order is expressed to be subject to such temporary release (if any) as may be directed under this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, which I also tabled on Committee Stage, is to allow for the release of a prisoner between remand dates or when the court is on vacation. The Minister undertook to take another look at my amendment for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction between the remanding and sentencing of a prisoner by the courts. The system of temporary release operates in relation to sentenced prisoners. Where a prisoner is on remand for trial for an offence, <Col N="469" />clearly the prisoner is within the jurisdiction of the courts system and the trial, conviction and punishment of criminal offenders is a matter reserved to the courts under the Constitution. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot be empowered to interfere with that particular process. That has been well established in our constitutional law for decades. The Minister cannot have a function in this matter.</P>
      <P>Bail applications are made to the courts who decide whether it is prudent to release a particular offender on bail pending trial or take the view that there are serious or grave circumstances in relation to interference with witnesses and, since the constitutional amendment, the possibility of the repetition of offences means that the offender should be retained pending trial. Often, when a court makes such a determination, an application is made invoking the High Court's inherent power in relation to the liberty of the citizen by way of a bail application to release him or her. That is practice in that area.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that we can interfere with this particular matter in this legislation. The decision to grant or refuse bail in any case is a matter for the courts who are independent in the performance of their traditional functions. I appreciate that this means where a humanitarian issue arises for a person in custody pending trial, the person then has to make application to the courts to obtain temporary release. Bail applications, as I know the Senator is aware, are a constant feature of the legal diary and continue during the vacation period. The courts provide for emergency sittings to deal with urgent matters.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Inspector of Prisons in his first annual report made a number of recommendations for legal and systematic change including the granting of temporary release for remand prisoners in special circumstances. The recommendations are under consideration. As I outlined already, there is a fundamental constitutional issue involved. The trial, conviction and sentencing of prisoners is, under the Constitution, exclusively a matter for the courts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister of State did not accept my earlier amendment that victims be informed when consideration is being given to the temporary release of a prisoner, I ask that he accept this amendment which is more important. I am asking that a victim be informed of a decision to grant temporary release to a prisoner. I am hoping the Minister of State has had time to reconsider this important amendment and will accept it. I under<Col N="470" />stand it is currently the position that the Garda is informed of such decisions and that it may, in turn, inform the victim. I want to provide that victims be informed of prisoner releases thus ensuring that they are not surprised if, when walking down the street, they bump into the offender.</P>

      <P>I indicated on Committee Stage that I had certain sympathies with this amendment. However, there was logic in the Minister's reply that many victims do not wish to be contacted because it merely revisits the trauma of whatever crime was committed against him or her. He also said the victim's liaison officer will often make the victim aware of temporary release measures. I would like us to establish a proper code of practice in this regard. There was an element of doubt on the last occasion as to whether every victim would be made aware of the position. I concur with Senator Terry on this matter. It tends to bring the law and the operation of justice into disrepute. The media has highlighted many instances of innocent victims being unexpectedly confronted by the culprit of the crime visited upon them. I was assured on Committee Stage that the Garda would be made aware of such releases.</P>
      <P>We should establish a code of practice whereby the victim's liaison officer would make the victim aware of his or her entitlement to information regarding a prisoner's release. Those who opt to receive such information would then be in a position to make representations regarding the release. It is important that, in practice, victims are aware of their rights in this regard. I am a little dubious that they all have such a right. Victims liaison officers will differ from one to another and while some make victims well aware of their entitlements in this regard, others may not. In those circumstances, we should put in place a fail safe system to ensure that happens.

      <P>Not all victims want to be informed of the temporary release of the offender. It may bring back memories of the pain and hurt he or she experienced. To accept the amendment in this form would be to cast a very definite legal obligation on the Minister to notify the victim in every case where the temporary release of an offender takes place. That would cause considerable practical difficulty in that it would require the Minister to maintain an updated address for every victim of an offence. It would not simply be a matter of providing for a <Col N="471" />legal obligation to inform the victim of the release of an offender. It would also place a possible legal obligation on the Minister to maintain a contemporary record of where victims of offences have gone. I welcome the discussion because it raises a number of other issues. However, I cannot accept the amendment because the Minister would then have to advise victims who do not want to hear about their offence or offender that the offender has been at large for a number of days under certain conditions and it would be possible to meet him or her.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh referred to practice. Currently, the Garda victim liaison officer advises the victim at the time of the court proceeding of the option of advising the prison service of the offender's interest in temporary release. Victims who wish to receive information about temporary release have a number of options. A victim of a serious sexual or violent offence may ask the prison service through the prisons victim liaison officer to notify the Garda prior to the release of the perpetrator from prison on temporary release or at the end of his or her sentence. A victim may also ask to be notified if an offender is to be given temporary release. Those facilities are advised by the Garda victim liaison officer.</P>
      <P>However, the Department's victims' charter is being revised and I have asked officials to examine a specific reference to this issue. Many amendments tabled relating to victims, while well intentioned, are not appropriate to the legislation but are highly apt in the context of the codification measure proposed by the Minister. If we are to get the balance right between the offender, the victim, the court and the public interest, that must be structured into the entire system. For example, if leaving it as a practice in the victims' charter, there should be an obligation on the court at the time of sentence to explain the nature of temporary release in written form to the victim. Such an amendment requires an examination of the entire criminal justice system and the codification on which the Minister has decided to embark will provide an opportunity to raise those issues.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 22, to delete &ldquo;shall come&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;comes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment, which the Minister of State could not accept on Committee Stage. The Law Reform Commission recommends that, when drafting legislation, simple language in the active voice should be used. Legislation should be clear and readable and I ask him to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>As Senator Terry pointed out, the Law Reform Commission recommended there should generally be greater use of the active instead of the passive voice. It is more appropriate on occasion to use the passive voice to emphasise an act rather than its agent. The present drafting style makes too much use of the passive voice, often obscuring the central message of a section. However, having examined this issue, the amendment does not raise the issue of the active and the passive voice. I regret Senator Norris is not present to elucidate on this matter. The active, autonomous voice relates to the detachment of a person from a particular subject whereas the active voice requires an agent or subject for the verb.</P>
      <P>The subsection under consideration states, &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on such day as the Minister may, by order, appoint&rdquo;, which uses the future tense while the Senator proposes the use of the present tense. She is correct that a divergent practice has emerged in this area. If the amendment was accepted, the legislation would state, &ldquo;The Act comes into operation on such day as the Minister may, by order, appoint.&rdquo; The view of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is that would be a change of style rather than substance. It does not alter the meaning of the provision. However, the Department raised the issue with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and pointed out the measures to which the Senator referred where the alternative construction was used. We have requested that the office should seek to ensure a consistent approach on this matter in future Bills.</P>
      <P>A number of Bills include the term &ldquo;comes&rdquo;. For example, the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2000 was amended in this regard in the Dáil. However, this does not change the fact there is absolutely no change in the meaning of the provisions. &ldquo;Shall come&rdquo; is unambiguous and clear and the commencement in this instance is done by the Minister on a future date. There is a greater stylistic precision in using the future tense to refer to a future event, namely, the making of a ministerial order to bring the Act into operation than the present tense, which introduces an element ambiguity in that it makes the enactment a continuous process. It is a fine point but we have asked the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure a consistent approach in this regard.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

We have had an interesting discussion. It was very focused on the rights of victims in the criminal justice process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that Ireland's criminal law follows the tradition established and exported from England. This involves the notion that a crime disturbs the peace of the king or queen and is a wrong against the public. We have inherited the idea that the criminal law exists to punish public wrong-doing &ndash; meaning, in one sense, that the victim has no say. It has always been established in law, for example, that the victim of an assault has no right to veto a prosecution. The assault in itself is considered to be a wrong against the public in general, as well as against the victim. This assumption led to certain practices in courts, or in relation to how we charge offenders and how we administer the system of criminal justice. The system often seems remote to victims, who may believe they are isolated from the criminal justice system. I know the Oireachtas has intervened, in many modern enactments, to try to redress this balance. This debate will have been useful if it focuses our minds on the codification <Col N="474" />measure. We have to recalibrate the entire system in terms of the interests of the victim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Roche)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have been given the opportunity to open this afternoon's discussion and update the House on the outcome of the European Convention and the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. I know many Senators followed the work of the convention with keen interest through the Joint Committee on European Affairs and other fora and I hope they will continue to follow developments at the Intergovernmental Conference with equal interest.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to keeping the Oireachtas and the public fully informed of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and I briefed Dáil Éireann last week on its opening in Rome, and the Minister will brief it tomorrow as part of the report on the outcome of last week's European Council meeting. Members of the Oireachtas will also have received the explanatory guide to the draft constitutional treaty published last week by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Joint Committee on European Affairs proved extremely useful during the European Convention by allowing for an exchange of views between the Government and the Oireachtas. I hope its good work will continue to play a vital role in informing our deliberations at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will speak and answer questions at a meeting of the National Forum on Europe at Dublin Castle tomorrow. The forum has also planned a programme of meetings with a view to monitoring developments at the Intergovernmental Conference. The Government is publishing its formal submissions to the Intergovernmental Conference on the Department of Foreign Affairs website, thus maintaining the spirit of openness and transparency that marked the work of the convention. Our aim is to ensure the public, Members of the Oireachtas and all interested parties are as informed as possible on issues relating to the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I last appeared before this House at the beginning of June, the negotiations at the convention were approaching their final stages. On that occasion, I spoke in very positive terms of what had been achieved. Now that the convention has concluded, I am pleased I can repeat a great deal of that praise. The convention method itself helps to explain much of its success. Drawing together governments and national parliaments from both <Col N="475" />current and future member states, the European Parliament and Commission, as well as observers from employers and trades unions, youth and civil society, it could fairly claim to be representative of the views of all European citizens.</P>
    <P>We were almost unique in Ireland in that three of our four Oireachtas representatives came from Opposition parties. The Irish convention team was universally recognised as having been one of the strongest. I pay a particularly warm tribute to Deputy John Bruton, who played a particularly strong role as a member of both the Praesidium and the convention, and Proinsias De Rossa, as well as their alternates, Deputies Carey and Gormley. They comprised a very strong team.</P>
    <P>I thank my predecessor Ray MacSharry and my alternate, Bobby McDonagh, of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I also thank the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs who played an extraordinary role in briefing not just me and the Government representatives but all sides. I refer in particular to Rory Montgomery and Helen Blake, two officials who proved once again, as if we needed proof in this House, that Irish public officials can stand up to competition and are certainly equal to those of any other member state. Our officials did considerable service to the nation in the way they approached their task. All of the Irish members engaged positively in the convention and our contribution is reflected in the final text.</P>
    <P>The convention's commitment to openness and transparency meant the thousands of papers, contributions, draft amendments and the views of all participants were publicly available to all. It is almost unimaginable that we could return to the old methods of treaty change and I am very pleased that the convention method is set to become the norm in the future.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal in the draft constitutional treaty to recommend. It found consensus where consensus had proven impossible in previous treaty negotiations. The convention managed to find agreement on the following: a single legal personality for the Union; a simplified and comprehensible legislative framework; the clear delineation of the roles of the Union and the member states; the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the draft constitutional treaty, without expanding the Union's area of competence; and the consolidation of the existing treaties in a coherent and comprehensible way. The convention also produced a very striking outline of the values on which the Union is based, including human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, and objectives including the promotion of peace, freedom, justice, sustainable development and full employment. These values are espoused by all public representatives and, most importantly, by every citizen in the State.</P>
    <P>Navigating the Union's decision-making procedures can often seem like navigating through a very complex maze. The convention recognised <Col N="476" />this and proposed radical changes. The so-called three-pillar structure has been abolished and the number of different legal instruments has been substantially reduced, from 15 to five. The remaining legal instruments have been renamed to make them more easily understood and to bring them more into line with national practice in the member states.</P>
    <P>The convention has also taken a significant step forward in enhancing the role of national parliaments and in monitoring the application of the principle of subsidiarity. Commission proposals will be sent to national parliaments at the same time as they are sent to governments and the European Parliament, and national parliaments will be empowered to object to the proposals if they feel that subsidiarity has not been respected. This innovation will be very welcome to Members of this House. Where one third of parliaments, or more, objects, the Commission will be obliged to reconsider its proposal. At the end of the legislative process, if parliaments feel their concerns still have not been addressed, they can have recourse to the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>As might have been expected, considerable attention has been paid to the convention outcome regarding the institutions. The Government has welcomed it because the convention proposals in general have respected the balances between the member states and the balances between the institutions. Those balances have been critical to the success of the Union to date.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference will, however, involve further detailed discussions on these key issues. For example, some small countries were among the early advocates of a long-term President of the European Council. We did not seek the creation of this post, but we believe it is now defined in a way that protects the interests of the Commission and which will ensure its holder is more chairman than chief. We hope it will, as its supporters argue, bring more coherence and a longer-term perspective to the work of the European Council. Likewise, a small number believe that a restricted Commission is more likely to be collegiate and effective than one in which every member state is represented. The countervailing and increasingly supported argument that a Commission drawn from the widest possible range of member states is more likely to be aware of and responsive to concerns on the ground, and thus more legitimate, is also very strong.</P>
    <P>The essence of the convention compromise, that all member states will be represented at all times but with a smaller number of voting commissioners appointed on the basis of strictly equal rotation, is broadly acceptable to us. Although it builds on the proposal agreed at Nice, aspects of the arrangement need to be teased out. For example, what precisely would be the roles of the voting and non-voting commissioners? On the other hand, many countries are arguing strongly for one voting commissioner per member state. If this can be achieved on terms which protect the <Col N="477" />genuine equality of all commissioners and member states, as was agreed at Nice, we would welcome it. At the end of this process, we want a Commission which is effective, embraces genuine equality and serves and reflects the interests of all member states, large and small. Throughout the process, I have repeatedly emphasised that equality is of the essence.</P>
    <P>A third key element of the institutional package proposed by the convention relates to the definition of a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers. It is proposed that a qualified majority would consist of a majority of member states representing more than 60% of the population. This is known as the 50-60 formula. While I would have been comfortable retaining the Nice voting weights, I can happily accept the convention text. The new proposals have the considerable advantage of greater simplicity and should also lead to greater efficiency in decision-making. In any case, Ireland's weight at the Council table has never been measured in terms of population. Instead, our success has been determined by our ability to build and maintain alliances and the force of our arguments. This will continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>At the meeting in Rome on 4 October to open the Intergovernmental Conference, the Heads of State or Government of the member and observer countries, including the Taoiseach, set out their broad negotiating stances. The Taoiseach made clear that we will respect the outcome of the convention as a good basis for our work. We do not wish to see all its work unravelled, nor do we want the Intergovernmental Conference to be simply a rubber stamp. We have a number of key concerns we wish to see addressed, including decision-making in taxation matters and other matters in the justice and home affairs area.</P>
    <P>An ongoing political discussion regarding the institutions will need to conclude before we reach final agreement. While we support the further extension of qualified majority voting, with co-decision by the European Parliament, there remains a small number of areas where unanimity must be maintained. One of these areas, identified by Ireland at the outset, is taxation which is central to the relationship between citizens and their governments. While I am glad the convention draft retains the need for unanimous decisions in almost all areas of taxation, the Government will continue to oppose any departure from this principle and will want to see a watertight final text.</P>
    <P>The Convention has made important advances in recommending enhanced European action against cross-border crime. Deputy John Bruton, as chairman of the relevant working group, played a major part in this. It is also important, however, that the new arrangements do not affect the deeply rooted traditions and practices of member states or the constitutional rights of their people. We will seek to ensure that this is guaranteed.</P>
    <P>Security and defence issues were discussed informally by Heads of State and Government <Col N="478" />and Foreign Ministers last week. These important issues will also be discussed in detail next month. The Government's main objective in this area is to achieve an outcome which will enable the Union to play a greater role for good internationally, while respecting the values and traditions of member states. At the Intergovernmental Conference, we will seek to clarify the various proposals contained in the draft treaty and, in doing so, we will argue that any new arrangements in the security and defence area should be transparent, inclusive and accountable to the Union as a whole. It is clear that further work is required in a number of areas, in particular, structured co-operation and defence.</P>
    <P>The Convention proposals contain much that is welcome. Commitments to human rights, sustainable development, conflict prevention and the UN Charter are clearly stated in the principles and objectives of EU external action, to which Ireland contributed in the convention. The appointment of a European Union Minister for Foreign Affairs will increase the coherence and visibility of the Union's external action. The ESDP is central to the Union's efforts to develop a role in support of shared values such as peace, democracy and human rights. This year, the European Union has undertaken three missions in the Balkans and central Africa, which is fully consistent with our approach.</P>
    <P>If the European Union is to make a contribution internationally, we need to further develop its civilian and military capabilities for conflict prevention and crisis management under the ESDP. The draft treaty states that enhancement of member states' military capabilities is in the context of the Petersberg Tasks. As a responsible member state committed to playing a part in peacekeeping and conflict prevention, we need to ensure that our capabilities, both civilian and military, are at a level that will enable us to continue to make a contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security.</P>
    <P>Developing the Union's capacity in crisis management is fully consistent with our commitment to the United Nations. Kofi Annan has welcomed the role the European Union is playing in this area. Last month in New York, the European Union signed a declaration with the United Nations on co-operation in crisis management. It makes clear that the European Union and the United Nations are committed to working together in this area, a development which all Senators will welcome.</P>
    <P>Ireland's commitment to the United Nations is undiminished. The Government will shortly seek the agreement of the Dáil for the deployment of a substantial Irish contingent to the recently established UN peacekeeping operation in Liberia. We will continue to play our part in support of the United Nations nationally and, together with our partners, through the ESDP. Equally, we will continue to make sovereign decisions, on a case by case basis, on whether to participate in future crisis management operations. As I stated <Col N="479" />clearly in the past, this means a Government decision, Dáil approval and United Nations authorisation &ndash; the triple lock mechanism.</P>
    <P>We will also take our own decisions in regard to proposals for an EU common defence. While the current treaties already provide for the possibility of common defence, no agreement has been reached thus far to move in this direction. As I have made clear in the House previously, the proposals drawn up by the convention do not change the current position as regards common defence, on which Ireland's position is clear. While we have stated we would not stand in the way of others, we cannot participate in European Union common defence without the prior consent of the people in a referendum.</P>
    <P>The proposals on security and defence need to be properly discussed by all member states and clarified. This discussion is just beginning and Prime Ministers had a useful debate on this issue last week. The Government is working to seek the clarification needed on these and other issues to secure an outcome that is good for the Union and acceptable to the people. We are working hard in the Intergovernmental Conference to ensure that our core concerns are addressed.</P>
    <P>There is a group of other issues where we feel that improvements could be made to the text without fundamentally changing the balance and coherence of the convention outcome. For instance, ECOFIN Ministers, including the Minister for Finance, have been working to develop a consensus on changes to some of the budgetary and economic governance articles. The Government will also support a reference to God or Europe's Christian heritage in the preamble of the constitutional treaty should an agreed wording prove possible.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference has held four meetings to date, including two at prime ministerial level. The Italian Presidency is seeking to conclude the negotiations by the end of the year and the Government has expressed its strong support for its efforts to manage the agenda and conclude the Intergovernmental Conference before Christmas. Should it not prove possible to find agreement, we will be fully prepared to take on the work and conclude the new constitutional treaty in time for the European Parliament elections next June.</P>
    <P>Discussions will be intensive and concentrated over the next two months. I hope and, on the evidence of the meetings to date, believe that the negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference will be characterised by the same constructive spirit that ensured the successful outcome of the convention. Although some difficult details were dealt with in the past two weeks at the level of Foreign Ministers and Heads of Government, the relationship between all participating parties was cordial and positive. At the same time, each country must be able to see its concerns have been reflected in the final outcome. We are designing a constitutional treaty for <Col N="480" />the future that must work as well as the existing treaties have worked in the past. We are designing a treaty that, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, said in the Dáil last week, must serve to &ldquo;unite the member states and the citizens across the European Union&rdquo;. The Government will approach the Intergovernmental Conference in the same way that it did the convention and all previous treaty negotiations. We will be positive and will engage with all of our partners. Europe has served us well in the past. We have nothing to fear and much to gain from the new constitutional treaty in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to the House. He has addressed us on a number of occasions concerning matters on European policy. It adds greatly to the debate in the House and I thank him for his contribution.</P>
      <P>All of us have received copies of the proposed draft constitution for Europe. When it is finalised in the near future, hopefully with minimal change and some clarification, it will be a magnificent document. The guarantee of the future economic and social progress of the European Union will be within the pages of the treaty. It will be the greatest guarantee of peace and stability across a huge part of the world. We can only reflect on how different the world would have been if there was such thinking, political progress and unanimity a century ago. Literally, hundreds of millions of lives would have been saved if the type of politics which we are now agreed on had been agreed then. A century might sound like a long time but in the context of world history it is a short time. In that short time we have come a long way. This proposed constitution for Europe will be the final guarantee necessary that the Continent of Europe will continue to be a beacon of civilisation, progress and peace.</P>
      <P>Our current debate on the proposed constitution and the Intergovernmental Conference is tremendous because it has been so open and transparent. Some of my colleagues, including Senator Ryan, were at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting during the week and while there we discussed the Convention and the future of Europe. One of the constant themes coming from our British colleagues was their view that more transparency is required. I am not sure how widespread the debate on Europe has been within the United Kingdom. Certainly, our debate has been very transparent, be it within the Houses of the Oireachtas, or that led by the Forum on Europe, chaired by our colleague, Senator Maurice Hayes, or the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. We have done an excellent job in keeping the public as informed as they wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point at our British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting that regardless of how far we as politicians try to take the debate, it is not always possible to get the public to engage with these matters. We live in a relatively apolitical time when people, despite their access to a <Col N="481" />huge amount of information, are generally fairly &ldquo;switched-off&rdquo; as far as political discourse is concerned. It is only at a time of crisis, or in the run-up to a referendum, that people tune in at a deeper level. To try to engage the public is the problem we face. In fairness to the Government and the Oireachtas, every effort has been made to ensure the people know exactly what is going on in relation to our plans for the future of Europe. When it comes to putting the final agreed treaty before the people, once we approach it on the basis that we approached the second Nice referendum, in an open and transparent fashion, I am confident the people will give it their strong approval.</P>
    <P>I am interested in what the Minister of State said about the values of Europe. It is something which we need to concentrate on in attempting to push the debate forward. The values of Europe, as described by the Minister of State Deputy Roche, include human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights while the objectives of Europe include the promotion of peace, freedom, justice, sustainable development and full employment. These are magnificent aspirations. Our job, and that of the Minister of State and the Government, is to ensure these aspirations become real through the treaty. If the debate and the proposed treaty is about putting those aspirations into practical effect then it needs our full support. My party is supportive of everything the Minister of State has been trying to do.</P>
    <P>I join with what the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, says regarding the work of Deputy John Bruton at European level. He has made a very profound and influential impact.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister of State said about taxation because one of the issues that will return to play a central role in any future referendum is the right of national governments to ensure taxation measures are laid down at home and not in Brussels. The contract between the people and their government whereby taxation provisions are applied nationally rather than from Brussels must be sacrosanct. This is something which I know the Minister of State Deputy Roche hopes to achieve. It would be a bridge too far for all of us if powers to raise and make taxes were in any way moved from the Houses of the Oireachtas without our wish.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn to the defence argument. The Minister for State made the point that Ireland's position on a common defence is very clear and that we have said that while we would not stand in the way of others, we cannot participate in EU common defence without the prior consent of the people in a referendum. That is a valid argument. I echo the comments made by my party colleague, Deputy Mitchell, in the Dáil last week, when he said we must be to the fore of this debate. We can decide to remain covered under the traditional, ever more irrelevant sacred cow of neutrality, or we can try to take part in, and lead, the debate. We have values in this country <Col N="482" />about defence and neutrality. In the new Europe and the changed world we have a role to play and an ethos to put forward. We should lead the debate on common defence, rather than in five, ten or 20 years time simply signing up to rules agreed by somebody else. I do not think any political party in this House should be ashamed to enter into a debate on traditional neutrality and on common defence. A Europe worth building is surely a Europe worth defending. If we are to play a role in this, that role should come about as a result of decisions taken by the Irish Government after a protracted debate with the Irish people. The Minister of State is aware that the Fine Gael view favours an open and strong national debate on our future on this matter. The sooner that debate takes place the better. Let us not join the game when the rules have already been written.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's indication that he hopes, if possible and with agreement, to have some treaty reference to the religious ethos of Europe and to God in the preamble or wherever is the appropriate part of the treaty. This has been the subject of a surprising amount of debate. It has been the subject of strong criticism by people who would describe themselves as liberals with a capital &ldquo;L&rdquo;. Surely the sign of a liberal is a person who is willing to take on board difference and to listen to another point of view. There is a very deep, profound, strong Christian heritage in Europe. It is something which we should, if at all possible, attempt to have reflected in the preamble or by some other mechanism in the treaty. I am pleased the Government is apparently moving in that direction. The Intergovernmental Conference is continuing its work and we will have a chance before its conclusion to debate the final draft again.</P>
    <P>The work done to date and the draft treaty are as good as it gets. The treaty sets out a route for Europe which will build on our history and heritage and ensure a bright future for the millions of citizens of Europe, particularly the citizens of applicant countries. Consider the Europe which existed 15 years ago. A wall of concrete, steel and wire divided the Continent and its people. We have come a long way since then. We are proud of the role we have played in the development of the Union but the people who are probably most looking forward to enlargement and the passing of this treaty are those who, through one form of dictatorship or another, spent hundreds of years in some type of servitude. We are drafting a route map to give those people freedom, justice and economic prosperity. The quicker we can finish the job, the better. I wish the Minister and his colleagues well in their continued work in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Roche. His brief is to take the lead in the debate on the future of Europe. At every stage of the debate he has taken a prominent role and has clearly articulated the position not only <Col N="483" />to the Houses, but also to the public. The core issue we are discussing today is how to make the new treaty readable, understandable and accessible to the public.</P>
      <P>This process started with the referendum on the Nice treaty when the public felt it was isolated. The Government, under the stewardship of the Minister of State, decided to deal with this and that is the reason we are having this debate today. The Minister of State has always made himself available when this issue has come up for debate in this Chamber, in the Oireachtas committee and in the Forum for Europe, under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes. He has been available to answer questions, listen to debate and to find out where the problems might lie. It is only by listening that one can arrive at the ideal answer for the future of Europe.</P>
      <P>The background to the draft treaty was the Convention on Europe which discussed the issues and arrived at a set of recommendations for a new integrated treaty that will be closer to citizens and understandable by all. The Convention covered three main areas: the need to have a clear, simplified treaty, the need for the new Union to play a positive role on the international stage and the need to bring the institutions of Europe into line and make them more effective and efficient in handling their administrative responsibilities. The Convention did its work well. I pay tribute to the Irish members of the Convention, Deputy John Bruton, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, Deputy Carey and Deputy Gormley. Each time one read a paper on the future of Europe and about how the discussions were progressing, those four names regularly appeared. It was clear that they did a good job on our behalf. They did it splendidly and I appreciate it.</P>
      <P>I attended the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in London over the weekend and a good deal of time was given to this debate. We expressed our views and concerns. A number of speakers mentioned the importance of transparency, connecting with the citizen, clarity and making the language as understandable as possible. Many felt that we were right to put the treaty to a referendum. That means we must get it right and simplify it. Other members wondered if they should put it to a referendum as well. It was a worthwhile discussion and I was pleased to participate in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft constitution covers four areas. The first part deals with the values and objectives of the treaty and how best to relate them to the public. The one I like is the principle of subsidiarity. It is the area in which I believe we can make great progress to ensure that member states make the decisions which should be confined to them. In other words, if decisions can be made at national or local level, they should not be handed over to Brussels. That principle is reflected in the draft treaty and I welcome that. It always works. In the debate earlier today we discussed another aspect <Col N="484" />of local democracy. It is most important that we never lose the concept of involvement at local and national level before moving an issue to the European scene.</P>
    <P>Another lovely concept, which we have heard much about in GAA circles, is the yellow card. It means that if Brussels produces legislation with which we are unhappy, a member state can reflect this view and if Brussels does not adhere to it, the state can produce a yellow card. The public will love the yellow card procedure because people are already tuned in to the warning signal it implies. I am delighted that it is incorporated in the debate. There is also the scrutiny procedure. If we are unhappy with proposals from Brussels, we can ask that they be reviewed and that different proposals be brought forward.</P>
    <P>With regard to the common foreign and security policy, I welcome the aspects dealing with how we contribute to peace and how the Union will operate on the international stage in relation to foreign policy, development co-operation, highlighting the importance of human rights, the role of the United Nations and the Union's role in conflict prevention and post-conflict situations. We will incorporate the amendment which was incorporated in the second referendum on the Nice treaty to provide that Ireland cannot enter into an EU common defence arranged without the consent of the people in a referendum. The core fear was that our position would be diluted in future referenda so I am glad the Government has reiterated its stand in that regard.</P>
    <P>The key issue is the future of the Union's institutions. A number of changes will take place in how they work. There is ongoing discussion of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, its membership and representation and whether it should last for a year. I am anxious to hear the Minister's view on whether decisions should be taken by qualified majority voting or unanimously. I am a little woolly on that. There is ongoing debate about it so perhaps the Minister would comment on it. I am sure how one could become a voting or non-voting commissioner and how that could work would become a discussion point if one had to go to a public meeting. We would not like to think our commissioner was playing a passive role based on our small population. These are areas the public may wish to discuss. Our population is becoming very educated. It came out very strongly in the last referendum that they really wanted us to discuss those issues and say in simple terms where the changes would take place.</P>
    <P>I am happy that, in taxation matters, our Parliament will retain control. That is very important. On justice and home affairs, I welcome the fact we will participate in cross-border co-operation on crime. Again, there is a reservation on that. I take it those are areas on which there are ongoing discussions. As the Minister has reassured me in his own presentation, the discussion seems to be going quite well to reach a consensus agreement so that no one will feel his or her position has been undermined in any way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" />I am glad to be here as part of today's discussion and glad that most of the recommendations that came through from the convention will be adhered to. Ultimately, we are here to talk about simplification. I want to ensure that Mr. Citizen will know what I am talking about if I discuss the future of Europe and Ireland's role in it. We will not lose our identity or our national front in any way. We will be able to say we have to be part of Europe, but we are individuals. We hold our individuality dear. In the end we will have an integrated treaty that will be accepted. We will be part of Europe, but Ireland stands alone as it always did. I would like reassurance on that from the Minister. I know he has said it, but it cannot be said enough. It must be said many times to get the message across that we will have a whole new approach to Europe that we can sell at ease to the public the next time we go to them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach and the Government for steering matters in this direction and giving everyone an opportunity to get involved. That is how democracy works for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. He and I have had many a debate, both public and private, about many issues, and his appointment was welcome. The best man for the job was without a doubt appointed by the Taoiseach. His enthusiasm for this whole project and other qualifications and skills have been put to good effect. We were well served in this country by those who worked on our behalf at the Convention. One should include the role of the current President of the European Parliament, who I believe has made a considerable contribution to the development of an understanding.</P>
      <P>I wish to be awkward at the start and then be a little more positive. This treaty contains a very valuable set of principles about European freedoms. I invite people to consider whether it is possible for a country to meet those standards if its Prime Minister owns and controls, either personally or politically, the best part of 90% of all television output in the state. That is the position in Italy. I do not wish to make a huge issue out of it, but the question has been raised by such journals as <i>The Economist</i>, which would not necessarily be identified with the constitution. I encourage anyone to read <i>The Economist</i>, which is fine and challenging, but it is not very keen on the new constitution, as the Minister probably knows better than I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, fine statements about democratic principles are of course good, and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is a good thing, though one of the things that came up a few times at the British-Irish conference which we all attended was that we now have a European Convention on Human Rights and a European Charter, along with some domestic legislation. The <Col N="486" />question arose of potential conflicts and confusions. I appreciate the documents have different jurisdictions, one covering the EU and the other the Council of Europe. Nevertheless, several parliamentarians from both Britain and Ireland mentioned that we may be creating a wonderful gold mine for lawyers and might need to clarify matters in language if not in values, which are presumably the same in them all.</P>
    <P>One of our negotiators at the Convention made the point &ndash; once someone has said something one thinks it is obvious &ndash; that since the beginning of the last century there have been only three countries on the entire Continent of Europe with a longer period of continuous democracy than this State, namely the United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland. Some of us have our doubts about the first because of its peculiar constitutional arrangements, but we will give it the benefit of the doubt. We are the other one. All the other countries of Europe had their democracy interrupted in the last century, either by internal activities or by invasion.</P>
    <P>Democracy is a thing one should never take for granted. I have always believed that, if the powers of 200 or 300 years ago across Europe ever dreamt that the democratic idea would take off, they would have worked very much harder to suppress it, because it is the most profound revolution that has happened in the way in which people are governed. Let us take the evidence of our own Continent, which is one of the great centres of world civilisation, and think how quickly a country such as Germany can collapse from being a cultural model into the sort of tyranny that enveloped it. It is always worth reminding ourselves about that and about the need always to sustain democracy and be very wary of attacks on it.</P>
    <P>The second thing that needs to be said is that, while we will argue, I hope, at length and in detail over the next few years, both about the draft treaty and whatever eventually comes out of the Intergovernmental Conference, this whole project is an enormous improvement. Anyone who has ever tried to read the combined treaties of the last 30 or 40 years &ndash; perhaps the Minister has read them all, though I am not saying that he should have&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>That is how I went grey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;will know that it had become entirely impossible, and the choice was between this and stasis. There was no way another major revision of the European treaties could ever have been envisaged by way of further amendment. Even trying to read the Nice treaty led one back to the Amsterdam treaty and so on. They came one after another, and it became utterly impossible. One would actually need a shelf to encompass them all. It was impossible, and the project was therefore a good thing, and overall the outcome is good. The reservations I might have are currently shared by the Government, <Col N="487" />and I hope it manages to clarify them. Of course, we are at an early step in the process. There is an Intergovernmental Conference, and I believe I heard the Taoiseach say that on this occasion he thought the country should have a long and detailed debate before we had the referendum. Not being too confrontational, I hope that the mistake of having an early referendum in the case of the Nice treaty will not be repeated, because I believe that only good can come of a thorough, long and vigorous debate, which one hopes will be reasonably well funded, on both sides of the argument.</P>
      <P>This is one of the areas in respect of which we should look at imaginative ways of using resources. I would be as wary as the Minister of State about some of the cranks and crackpots who might be able to gain access to significant amounts of public money and use it in dodgy ways. However, we ought to try to ensure there is a well resourced debate and people should be able to feel they have access to sufficient funds to be able to make their presence known. That is a difficult matter, but it could be of benefit to both sides to have access to resources because we need an intelligent debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Another point I wish to make has already been raised by a number of colleagues and by the Government and refers to the area of crime. I do not intend to criticise the Government, but its explanatory guide to the draft treaty states that the adoption of minimum rules on the mutual admissibility of evidence shall not prevent member states from maintaining or introducing a higher level of protection for the rights of individuals in criminal procedures. I am in favour of that, but I am wary of future circumstances in which an Irish citizen arrested in Germany or Poland might have fewer rights in one part of the EU than they would have in another in terms of mounting a criminal defence. I understand the complexities involved, but, if anything, that represents a retreat and is part of the reflection of the fact that we are involved in two entirely different legal systems. This is a dodgy area and it is one in respect of which I would counsel the Government to be careful, as I think it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I was struck by the reaction of Members of the British Parliament who I would have known as Euro enthusiasts. There were certain people present who made statements that were entirely predictable and I could have written their scripts for them because I am aware of their positions. However, one of those I would have regarded as quite positive about European developments &ndash; I do not believe it would be appropriate to name him &ndash; who resigned from the British Tory Party because of his disagreement with it on European matters, is quite wary of the entire project. In that context, there is a great deal of explaining to do. People from the British side informed us about a recent meeting they had with <Col N="488" />Dutch parliamentarians at which, instead of being lectured about their Euro scepticism, their counterparts from the Netherlands showed signs of wariness about where the process is going. There is an enormous job of persuasion to be done if countries such as the Netherlands, which have been involved in the European project since the outset, are beginning to experience, even in passing, wariness about these matters.</P>
    <P>Another point worth mentioning about the British delegation is the number of its members who noted the degree to which Europe had been of benefit to this country. They were not referring to the usual cash benefits, but were instead talking about the degree of independence and leverage Ireland enjoys. One could pick up a slight tone of envy from some of our colleagues from Wales and Scotland about their slightly dependent position in terms of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>An enormous amount of teasing out must be done in respect of the issue of defence. Let me explore a hypothetical situation. If Russia invaded Denmark, as a European democrat I have no difficulty in stating that, regardless of whether we had a treaty obligation, a country such as Ireland could not stand by and watch a colleague country being threatened with the destruction of its democracy. I would be wary of having to be told in advance that this would have to be done.</P>
    <P>I would counsel caution on the taxation veto. I do so not because I want to put the country at risk but on foot of the fact that the absence of a common European policy on taxation means that some of the countries in eastern Europe are going to compete from the bottom with us in terms of their corporation taxation rates. If our rate, at 12.5%, is extremely attractive, then rates of 0% will be hugely attractive if the difference is that decisive. If it does not prove to be that decisive, we should perhaps consider a common baseline. If it is going to be that decisive, we are going to encounter difficulties. I am an enthusiast for expansion but we would need to be somewhat more nuanced in terms of our views on taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on the work he has been doing. I join in the congratulations extended to the members of the Irish group working in the convention. Deputy John Bruton, who held a pre-eminent position, made an enormous contribution as a member of the Praesidium, as did Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, Deputies Carey and Gormley and the Minister of State's alternate, Mr. Bobby McDonagh. In my opinion, these individuals operated in the best traditions of Irish parliamentarianism in that, despite the different views they might hold, they represented the interests of the country in Brussels and tried to relate them to the broader interests of Europe. My colleagues at the Forum on Europe, of which I am chairman, would want me to express our <Col N="489" />deep appreciation of the willingness of the Irish delegates to address the forum, convey what was happening in the convention, listen to what its members had to say and use that to inform their contributions in Brussels. I hope this process proved helpful. From now on I will, in a sense, be on my own in terms of expressing my views.</P>
      <P>The report of the Convention is a great achievement, not only in terms of its substance but also in terms of the manner in which it came about. As the Minister pointed out, the Convention was a new way of doing business and was more open and transparent. Its purpose was to produce ways to tidy up arrangements and put forward a system of administration and governance which would be sufficiently robust to deal with changing circumstances, particularly enlargement. However, it was also clearly stated that it was an attempt to re-engage the ordinary citizen of Europe with the process. In my opinion, the latter remains important. I am glad, therefore, that the Intergovernmental Conference is being conducted with rather more openness and transparency than in the past. That is evidenced by the willingness of the Minister of State to come before the House and to appear at other venues to tell people what is happening and keep them abreast of developments.</P>
      <P>Sooner or later, there will be completion. Like Senator Ryan, I urge that this should not be the end of the debate. There should be an engagement with members of the public and people should be able to state their views. As we approach the holding of a referendum, there will be views for and against different aspects of the treaty. Both sets of views are entitled to be expressed. We should take the lesson from past experience that it does not help to spring a referendum on people without having first provided a context. It is important that such a context should be provided.</P>
      <P>With regard to the content of the report and what is happening in the Intergovernmental Conference, it is important that, as a smaller country, Ireland should try as best it can to maintain the balance of forces that exists. The Commission is an important part of that as far as a small country is concerned in terms of protecting the existing ethos and ensuring a balance is maintained. There are differing views as to whether the strongest Commission will necessarily be the largest. In that context, there will be difficult waters to navigate. I am sure the Minister of State will be able to manage in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State is still in a negotiating position with other countries. We cannot expect that Ireland will necessarily get all the things it thinks are important and there may have to be trade-offs. We should keep the number of absolute vetoes to the minimum. I encourage the spread of qualified majority voting, except in the small number of cases where there are vital interests to be pro<Col N="490" />tected. Of course, our vital interest might not be a vital interest for another country. There is a real danger of getting a long list of vital interests and this may lead to problems. I would not isolate myself down in the ditch on the taxation issue for the reasons Senator Ryan so ably expressed.</P>
    <P>I too have great regard for the common law tradition. We must preserve it and also preserve the constitutional rights of our citizens without in any way appearing to inhibit the ability of the authorities in other states to protect their citizens from cross-border and highly organised crime. A means must be found for this to be done.</P>
    <P>I now turn to defence. I am quite happy with the circumstances where Ireland invokes the triple lock, particularly the UN approval aspect of it. There is a possibility of a grey area arising, as the UN seems more and more willing to subcontract some of its functions in these areas to Europe. We must make it clear that the expression of UN approval in our legislation does not inhibit us from doing what is clearly approved.</P>
    <P>Progress has been reported on the convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. The work that is being done is a great tribute to the Minister of State and his colleagues. That it is being done to such an extent in public is encouraging. I hope we can all contribute to the debate in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the convention, particularly the way the convention has gone about its work in an open and transparent manner. This contrasts with the technical and bureaucratic approach of previous treaties and texts that usually emanated from Europe. I also welcome the greater effort that has been made here in Ireland, through the Joint Committee on European Affairs, in informing Parliament and the Forum on Europe which informed the public through a number of public meetings. The part played by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, Deputy John Bruton and all the Irish representatives who contributed to the work of the convention has been significant and I believe the public recognises the positive contribution our representatives and officials made to the whole process.</P>
      <P>The EU has changed and expanded immensely in the 30 years since Ireland joined. Ireland has also changed out of all recognition. Europe is vital to our prosperity and it has encouraged the modernisation of our society and the development of a strong economy which has prospered and benefited our people. It has also been instrumental in creating a peaceful Europe, which has also been good for Ireland and in which Ireland has played its own significant part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Convention was to simplify the European treaties, make Union policy making more effective and, most importantly, to bring it closer to the people. We can only hope to bring <Col N="491" />political institutions close to the people if they are relevant, effective and responsive to their needs. I expect the new constitutional treaty will be judged by its relevance, effectiveness and responsiveness. The people have shown themselves willing and ready to engage in intelligent and informed debate about European issues. The Treaty of Nice campaigns, in both cases, have taught us we have nothing to fear from open and honest debate. People want politicians to be confident in advancing our interests, strategic in our thinking and realistic in our objectives and goals.</P>
    <P>The Convention has allowed us to see a clear description of the EU's objectives, values, powers and institutions. It has made important advances in recommending enhanced European action against serious cross-border crime. Security and defence policy is another priority area and my party believes Ireland should not only be part of the security and defence architecture of Europe, but that we should be one of its architects. If we do not participate in making the rules to meet our concerns and vision for the future of Europe, others will make them. We should be present in this area from the beginning.</P>
    <P>During the Nice referendum much was spoken and written about whether Ireland should keep its commissioner. While hoping that we retain our full commissioner, the Nice proposals as modified by the draft constitutional treaty are fair. The role of the Commission is of vital importance. Any diminution of the Commission would be to the detriment of the Union as a whole and its member states, particularly smaller member states such as Ireland. However, the convention has struck a proper balance.</P>
    <P>The Convention draft retains the need for unanimous decisions in nearly all areas of taxation and I welcome this. We should continue to oppose any departure from this principle as it is of vital importance to the economic policies and well being of our nation. I accept the valid point raised by Senator Ryan regarding corporation tax and what eastern European nations may or do in this area.</P>
    <P>Another area that has commanded media attention is whether there should be a reference to God in the constitution. I honestly believe that it would not offend anybody if a proper wording could be found to make reference to God in a way that meets the concerns of persons with religious beliefs without offending others. While I appreciate other Members may have different views on this matter, I am glad the Minister of State is of the same view as me.</P>
    <P>I welcome the references to a social Europe as our membership of the Union has meant great advances for our citizens in this area. It has also forced our country to take more heed of the protection of our environment, an issue of paramount importance. I trust the Government will <Col N="492" />not use the excuse of the protection of our environment to introduce further stealth taxes.</P>
    <P>I wish the Intergovernmental Conference well. Those involved must take account of national interests and common European interests. I wish all involved in the process well. The future of Europe lies in the provisions of this draft treaty. It is an exciting time for citizens of Europe. As a member of the Committee of the Regions for the last six years, I am convinced that our future prosperity and peace lies in a strong, cohesive Europe. I hope an open, honest debate on the contents of the draft constitution for Europe will ensure the Irish people will support its contents and reaffirm our confidence in Europe and the ideals of the founding fathers of the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I must repeat what other Members said as it happens to be true: we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the people who negotiated this treaty on our behalf. I listened to Proinsias De Rossa, Deputy John Bruton and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, time and again and found them to be really impressive. As Senator Ryan said, if any man was suited to the job, it was the Minister of State Deputy Roche. That is because he is particularly interested in the subject and has worked assiduously on this project. I read the amendments he tabled on our behalf and they make up an amazing piece of work for which he is to be lauded.</P>
      <P>Some people have asked why we need a constitution, saying we are grand as we are with our own Constitution and the various treaties. There are two reasons that we need it. First, we are governed at present by a number of treaties which are incomprehensible to most people, to put it mildly. I have read the Treaty of Nice, the Treaty of Amsterdam and so on, but who knows what terms like variable geometry, subsidiarity, peripherality and pillars mean? Senator Ormonde said this must be simple and the wording of the new constitution is simplified. People can read it, understand it and agree or disagree with it, but at least they will know what it means and that is very important. All these treaties can be incorporated in the new constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason for the constitution and treaties is something that arises every time we speak about Europe and I make no apologies for discussing it. When I was a young man the then German government set up a waste disposal programme with furnaces all over Germany, Austria and Poland which burned waste every day. That was not industrial waste but human waste, the bodies of gypsies, homosexuals and Jews. Recently the Joint Committee on European Affairs visited Clonakilty, where we addressed children from ten or 12 schools as well as some other people. When I mentioned this it began to dawn on them what exactly the European Union was about, why it was so important we bought <Col N="493" />into this huge project and why the future for them as young people is so exciting. They can look forward to a future in which there will be no war during their lives.</P>
    <P>For the last 50 years we have had relative peace in Europe, which is what the European project was about. Unfortunately, there have been trouble spots like the Basque region and in our country, where a sort of war was waged for many years but which is hopefully now over. It is important to remind ourselves of that all the time, which is another reason we need a constitution &ndash; to lay down some rules and regulations whereby we can live in peace and harmony together in this wonderful new Union of many different and diverse beliefs. There will no longer be prejudices against people simply because of their religion, sexual orientation or because they have a nomadic lifestyle.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's support for the reference made by the Minister of State to the fact that the constitution treaty might agree to a wording on Europe's Christian heritage or to a reference to God. I see no harm in that because Europe has a Christian heritage. We do not have to say that everyone has to be Christian, but Christianity has played a large part in Europe. Unfortunately, it has also played a large part in a number of wars, so maybe we should stick to a reference to God. Irrespective of religion&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we had the same God, he was on all sides. It should be possible to agree on a wording.</P>
      <P>I got a booklet from the Department of Foreign Affairs which states that the protocols would be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference, one of which protects Article 43.3 of the Constitution. Will the Minister of State clarify whether this will be considered or included? I see a great difficulty with future referenda if this is not included.</P>
      <P>Regarding the common defence policy, under the draft constitutional treaty an armaments research and military capability agency will be set up, which will be open to all members wishing to be part of it. We need to look at ourselves in this regard and get off the fence. I know we have to hold a referendum on this issue, but we should have a debate on defence. We are part of a union of peoples and we agreed to come to each other's defence if we are in trouble. That is not just in the case of war but in the event of terrorist attacks, natural disasters or man-made disasters. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot hope to have people help us when we need it if we are not ready to help them. There are great fears in the country, with people saying they do not want their sons in European armies, but people have no fears about joining our army and a European army will be no different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" />I have read the constitution and on the whole it is very good, with some of the provisions in the European Convention on Human Rights being particularly laudable, such as the basis of human dignity and the right to life. There is a clear statement that everyone has a right to life and I am sure that means from conception to death. Maybe others will read it as meaning from birth to death but I read it the other way, as including the unborn. I am not sure whether the Minister of State or other countries would go along with that, but I would not like to see the lawyers debating it, as Senator Ryan fears might happen. I believe in the right to integrity of the person and the other rights enshrined in this charter of fundamental rights are good. We do not have too much to fear from having this constitution but we have much to gain. It will make for simplification of treaties and future rulings. It will help people to understand Europe and, like our own Constitution, it will be readable.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Lydon's comments almost entirely about the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche on this issue. I had the pleasure of spending a couple of days with the former French President, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, in St. Petersburg &ndash; I love name-dropping, by the way. I spoke to him about his work and he was full of admiration for the work done by people like the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, although he did not agree with him on every point. It was clear to me that there is a real task ahead of us in terms of a balance between small and large nations.</P>
      <P>If one reads <i>The Irish Times</i> today one is reminded of one aspect of that in the business pages, which state that the French have clearly been in breach of their borrowing requirements &ndash; I am not talking about the constitution here but borrowing requirements in Europe &ndash; for the third year in a row. They are under some pressure and it looks as if they will not bend too easily. We know the Germans have also been in breach of some of these regulations, yet on the one occasion we were in breach of the regulations we were ticked off very emphatically by the authorities in Europe. A balance is needed between large and small nations.</P>
      <P>In drawing up the constitution it is clear that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing had great difficulty achieving the balance, that he was very unhappy at the thought of a Commission with 25 to 27 members sitting around a table, even if only 15 had votes, and that he found this an impossible task. It is a reminder that we must fight and negotiate in a way that protects small nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was happy with most of the wording of the short explanatory guide to the draft treaty establishing a constitution for Europe which the Department of Foreign Affairs issued and to which Senator Lydon referred. It explains what we are seeking but I have a question on taxation. <Col N="495" />I know we argued very strongly for unanimity in the tax area and that we made it clear it is something on which we have strong views, as have some other countries. Has our determination to achieve that focused our attention so strongly that it weakens the attention we can give to other areas? We have had the benefit of a low corporation tax for the past number of years and our 12.5% rate is the envy of a number of businesses elsewhere in Europe. The accession countries to the European Union will consider using such a tax as a weapon to give them an advantage. Cyprus has recently introduced a 10% corporation tax undercutting ours. It is possible that some of the Eastern European accession countries who will join the Union next year have considered having a zero tax in this area. Rather than our commitment which provides that there should be unanimity, and under no condition should we give way on that, is there a possibility of having some sort of a compromise? I would like to think we could say something which would be in our interest to the effect that there should be a minimum corporation tax of 12.5%, which is our rate. I am sure that would not be acceptable to the larger countries who have rates much higher than that, but such a measure would benefit us by ensuring our rate would not be undercut. In suggesting that, I am not speaking from the perspective of a truly European ethos and culture and saying we are equal, but wearing a commercial hat and saying what is in the best interest of Ireland in this area. Given our commitment over the years, the benefit we have had from having a low tax rate and our determination to maintain unanimity in voting, is there a danger we will lose the opportunity to secure a compromise which might be in our own interest on that basis? </P>
    <P>The threat to our public private partnership borrowings is mentioned in one of today's newspapers. That is pertinent to this debate. It seems Europe has an interest in this area. It is not willing to regard our attitude to public private partnership borrowings, particularly in regard to our infrastructure, by including them in our borrowing deficit. Have we taken full account of this matter and are we able to strongly argue our case in this regard?</P>
    <P>I have a concern, although I am not sure if it is valid. Certain criticism has been expressed that the Forum on Europe will not get the same support in financial terms from the Government in the future. I would hate to think that will be the case, though it may not be and I am aware this has been denied. When this constitution has to be voted on in Ireland, as was required in the Nice referendum and previous referenda, we do not want to wait until the last minute before we start making our case, if we are in favour of it. We want to make sure we take those steps now. When I said at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs that we need to market the <Col N="496" />benefits of Europe, Senator Ormonde criticised me for the use of the word &ldquo;market&rdquo;. We should not lose sight of the fact that there will be a referendum on this issue and if we do not remind the public&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Forum on Europe has done a world of good. Let us make sure we give it all the support we can. We should remind our citizens of the benefits we have had from Europe, not only of cheques for farmers or those we sometimes think of, but the many other small and large benefits of which we have not reminded our citizens. We must ensure we continue to remind our citizens of those benefits with the full enthusiasm we have shown in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and endorse all that has been said about his focused and committed involvement to this process since he was appointed to his current position. I will relay an anecdote to indicate his level of commitment to the convention and to what for Ireland, as a small country, is an important dimension to our Europen adventure &ndash; the question of forging alliances and establishing friendships. I was attending a meeting in Brussels last June and, by coincidence, ended up on the same train as the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, which I only discovered on arrival at the other end. I was in his company going to the city when he spent almost the entire period on the telephone establishing contact with his opposite numbers in several like minded states in order to ensure there would be a consensus, or at least an attempt at a consensus, on an agenda and on the various aspects of the agenda prior to a meeting the following day. I do not say that by way of a tale out of school but to indicate how focused he is and to compliment him, not only as has been done here but on bringing together many like minded states at a critical moment in the discussions on the Convention. Many of the like minded states are candidate countries. My limited experience of dealing with representatives of candidate countries was at the discussions on the Charter on Fundamental Rights a few years ago and I noticed that because they were outside the loop they were more intent on being on-side. The Minister of State's initiatives stiffened the resolve and gave them a little spine in that they had a positive contribution to make to ensure the interest of like minded states was protected. It is important to record that is one of the legacies on which the Minister of State can look proudly during this experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out another interesting dimension to this debate, to which my friend and colleague, Senator Ormonde, will testify. It arises from our being privileged to be present at the last plenary session of the British-Irish Interparlia<Col N="497" />mentary Body, to which Senator Ryan also referred as he was also present. We had a debate on a European matter and it was interesting to hear the differing views. Coming from a position where we in Ireland would be very strong Europeans and we would take as given the benefits to which Senator Quinn referred, which are there for all to see, it was an interesting experience &ndash; I am sure Senator Ormonde would agree &ndash; to hear the differing views of regional representatives. The representatives from the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly were pro-Europe. They saw the future for their regions of the United Kingdom as being within Europe and there being a possibility of establishing their own identity within a European family. However, our English colleagues were extremely sceptical. This cut across the Labour, Tory and Liberal Democrat Parties, all of which were represented. It was difficult to get a consensus, but one view that struck me was that expressed by Harry Barnes, a long serving member of the body and of the House of Commons, who was sceptical of the entire European experience because he said there was no accountability or transparency. This goes to the core of the argument on Europe in the United Kingdom because of the sovereignty of parliament. We have managed to get the message across that not only have we ceded some sovereignty but by pooling our sovereignty we have gained enormous benefits. I said to my UK parliamentary colleagues that, as a person who travels within the European family as a parliamentarian, it mystifies me why the UK is not where it should be, having regard to its size, tradition and influence, at the heart of Europe rather than being on the outside. It is vital for us that the United Kingdom, our closest neighbour, whose people share a common language, which is a large trading partner and with which we have so much in common, is more at the heart of Europe. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, would agree with that. In fairness to the Blair Government, Prime Minister Blair has set out his stall in that regard. There are undercurrents within our near neighbour, notwithstanding the wonderful work of the convention. Margaret Ewing, the MLA for Scotland who is well known to us here, said she had to read the Irish newspapers to find out what was going on in Europe because she found no information in the United Kingdom newspapers other than what she would read in the tabloids where there was the &ldquo;tabloidisation&rdquo; of the old chestnut of some anonymous bureaucrat in the Commission deciding on the size of the English sausage.</P>
    <P>Turning to more substantive issues, there has been a shift in the Irish position, which is important. The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, might elaborate if he is replying. He referred obliquely to two areas in which there has been a shift in the Irish position. One relates to the acceptance of the charter of fundamental rights. <Col N="498" />The official Irish position during those debates was not to enthusiastically embrace the charter, mainly because there was a view in Ireland that there were constitutional issues to be decided on and perhaps that a future Irish civilisation might have to bear a financial burden in areas such as social policy and education. I am very pleased that the Irish position now fully supports the charter.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State clarify what implications there are for the existing European Convention on Human Rights which embraces all 44 member states of the Council of Europe <i>vis-à-vis </i>the enshrinement in the new constitution of the charter of fundamental rights as a legal instrument which also protects human rights, in the context of citizens having the right to apply to ensure that their rights are protected under the new treaty? They already have that right under the current European Convention on Human Rights. Any citizen may apply to the court in Strasbourg. What will the relationship be between the charter of fundamental human rights under the new EU treaty and the existing European Convention on Human Rights?</P>
    <P>We have definitely shifted our position on the question of the EU commissioner. I do not want to sound critical, but going back again to the debate on the Nice treaty, and the debates prior to and during Nice, there was no doubt in my mind that the Irish position prior to Nice and the negotiations was that we would protect and defend the right of Ireland to nominate a commissioner. We slightly blurred that area. The perception was that we did it as a <i>quid pro quo</i>, in the very best European practices of accommodation and compromise, to protect the right of this country to decide its own taxation policy. That taxation policy is now back on the agenda and the Minister for State, Deputy Roche, has been very passionate in ensuring that the country does not accept any fudging of the issue. It is clear that Ireland will maintain its position of having an independent taxation policy.</P>
    <P>Am I now to take it as unequivocal and unambiguous that Ireland asserts the right to its own commissioner? The Minister of State referred to the arguments for and against, but he did not state unequivocally that Ireland wishes to pursue this issue. This may be an opening gambit. There may yet be much more to play for because I understand that the Poles and the Spanish are playing &ndash; as Jack Charlton said in another context &ndash;&ldquo;silly buggers&rdquo; with the Nice treaty. I understand that Ireland may be keeping something in reserve on this issue. The view would seem to be that the smaller countries want the Commission. I fervently support the view that we should retain our commissioner and I do not see why it should be impossible to have an effective Commission among the enlarged states even when extended to 27 or 28. I know that this is one of the matters that has been left to an <Col N="499" />Intergovernmental Conference. I hope we strongly maintain the position of having the right to our own commissioner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to contribute to this debate. This is an excellent document and has the merit of being readable, comprehensible and simple in a way that the old treaties never were. A major step has been taken along the path of making the EU more accessible for people, without creating the impression that one needs to be a bureaucrat. Having been a bureaucrat, I know that bureaucrats find many of the EU treaties incomprehensible as they stand.</P>
      <P>From Ireland's point of view the outcome is very satisfactory. That is the message we need to keep sending to people. On the assumption that the negotiation does not drift too far away from where it is now, I do not see why we should have any difficulty endorsing it. Voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; to this in particular, but to any European treaty, is what one might call a nuclear bomb option, disastrous in its impact and effect and totally disproportionate to any particular cause of dissatisfaction that we might have. It is very satisfactory on the main issues. As for the precise voting mechanism, we are more than proportionally represented in the Council in terms of votes. That is not the issue. It is not how we exercise influence most of the time. The precise way that is done, whether through Nice or the revised way in the Convention, does not greatly matter from our point of view.</P>
      <P>On the question of the commissioner, I take a slightly different view from Senator Mooney. The Government has adopted a pragmatic attitude. Equality is what is important. If one has a very large body of perhaps 27 or 30 people, in practice what happens is that all the work is done in committees. The more people one has, the more diluted it becomes. We are old hands in Brussels at this stage, 30 years down the line, and like other countries we will have no difficulty finding ways and channels, exercising our influence, getting early warning of what is in the pipeline and taking the necessary remedial action. It is a very reassuring thought that in the 30 years we have been in Europe, it is very hard to think of an example where no account has been taken of a vital national interest of ours, or where we have been over-ridden or trampled on in the manner portrayed by some of the Eurosceptics, who seem to have visions of France and Germany trampling all over us. It has not happened. On the contrary we have had very productive and constructive relationships, not least with those two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Green Party is canvassing its members to see if they want to stick to the rather negative positions they have taken, which are pretty much out of kilter with most of the Green parties in Europe. The German Foreign Minister, <Col N="500" />Joschka Fischer, is at the opposite end of the spectrum on this.</P>
    <P>We have managed to protect our tax position, which is certainly important. Its relative importance, which particularly in the past ten years or so has been great, may not be as great in the future with the enlargement of the EU and other factors coming into play.</P>
    <P>Regarding defence, we have to take into account the fact that the people are deeply attached to the tradition of military neutrality and do no want to simply dump or abandon it. They want what we do in Europe to be an evolution and continuation, a development of where we have come from. In many ways Europe has converged in our direction just as we have in the European direction. There is nothing in the Petersberg Tasks which would cause any problem to neutral countries in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is a pity there is no reference in the preamble to the Christian heritage of Europe. It would be an acknowledgment of historical reality. One could have a little too much of a French Third Republic, Jules Ferry type ideology. That is the type of ideological thing that will inevitably cause difficulty for some people. I do not regard it as an issue that would even remotely influence me in a &ldquo;No&rdquo; direction, but it is nonetheless something that would be nice to see included. It would be a generous acknowledgment, even in today's fairly secular world, of the Christian heritage. I do not wish to exclude other religious heritages and the phraseology used could also encompass them. That is one change I would like to see in the convention when concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Roche)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their extraordinary generosity in terms of personal comments. This has been an interesting and extremely challenging debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Bradford spoke of the important role played by the Convention and, in particular, of the significance and importance of evolving a treaty that will touch citizens' lives and will be widely accepted by them. He and many other Senators made the point that the convention needs to be communicated to the people. Shortly before I came to the House I was speaking about an initiative which I hope will be part of the Irish Presidency, the process of communicating Europe at European level with European citizens. I intend to push that issue during the Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn referred to marketing. I do not have a problem with marketing which is an honourable profession. What is needed in this case is cause marketing which should point out how extraordinarily positive Europe has been in the lives of millions of people. Senator Ryan mentioned how different things would have been if political leaders at the beginning of the last century had the foresight to take that leap into the dark taken by those courageous politicians in the <Col N="501" />early 1950s when establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and ultimately the European Common Market. The idea was to make war not just unthinkable in the future but materially impossible. John Hume said it all when he suggested the European Union was the most extraordinarily successful peace process ever seen in Europe. He is correct. We have enjoyed the longest period in Europe's modern history of peace and prosperity. This treaty makes provision for the future. I agree with all Senators in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senators Bradford, Quinn and Ryan also mentioned taxation as did virtually every other speaker. The Irish position on taxation is very clear. It is not taken from the position of what is to our advantage, but from the position of what will be in Europe's interest. Competition in many areas is part and parcel of the life of the Community. Competition in tax is also important. Senator Quinn is correct in saying Cyprus has taken the decision to move to 10% taxation. Estonia has already moved to 0%. We have nothing to fear in that regard. The tax mix is only part of the overall set of advantages which we have to offer, particularly in the area of foreign direct investment. We have to compete. It is important and positive from a European point of view that we have competition in tax. First and foremost it is important because, going back to Senator Bradford's point, tax speaks to sovereignty. I agree with the Senator on that.</P>
    <P>The nature of the relationship between citizens and taxation and those who impose tax is very specific. I would not like to see it in any way violated because there is an important relationship between the politicians we elect and the taxes we pay. I would not like to see tax harmonisation moving to Brussels. More importantly from Europe's point of view is that the setting of artificial thresholds or ceilings on tax would interfere with the right of individual nations to determine indigenous policies. Let us look at this issue from two diametrically opposite ends of the spectrum.</P>
    <P>Ireland and Sweden share a view on taxation. Why is that so? We have the lowest tax regime in Europe and Sweden has the highest in terms of personal taxes. The Swedes have made the choice that the type of society in which they live determines that certain policies be put in place and paid for. They have also taken the view that the people who determine what should be put in place and what should be paid are those directly elected to do so. We have taken a somewhat different view but have come to the same conclusion. It is important we do not lose sight of tax harmonisation or its significance in terms of national sovereignty. Equally, the importance of differentiated tax rates throughout Europe should not be lost sight of from the point of view of creating competition. If some group in Brussels, removed from the realities of day-to-day politics in individual member states, were to <Col N="502" />determine the tax rates, we would inevitably have a situation where taxes would move in the same direction and there would be no internal competition in Europe to control taxes and Europe, as a whole, would lose in terms of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I understand the point made by Senator Ryan in this regard. The same point has been made by the social group in Europe. I do not think it is an argument we would support if we were to sit down and deconstruct the elements of it. A move towards homogeneity of tax rates across the Union would be dangerous to the Community. Competition in taxes is important as is the sovereign relationship between those taxed and the taxation system.</P>
    <P>Senators Bradford, Mansergh and others spoke of the lack of reference to God and the Christian tradition in the preamble. Let us put this in context. This debate arose because a preamble was written to the European constitutional treaty. That preamble, in a rather bizarre way, made reference to the contributions made by Greek and Roman civilisation and to humanism. It sought to ignore the historic reality of Christianity and the Christian tradition. I make no apologies for the stance we have taken on this. If it is possible to posit these two extremes as being part of the European experience, it is certainly possible to acknowledge the role played by the Christian tradition. It has been, as Senator Lydon said, a sometimes troubled contribution but it has also been a positive one. We are what we are. If we try to deny history, we try to deny from where we have come and will lose sight of where it is we wish to go.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to include an appropriate reference to God, which should in many ways be the least controversial reference, and-or to the Christian tradition. I agree with Senator Bradford that there is absolutely nothing as illiberal as some of the liberals in the convention who stood up to debate this issue. I believe in putting forward arguments forcibly, not hysterically. Some of the arguments against the preamble including such a reference were difficult to take. The debate arose because of the lacuna in the draft preamble. I hope suitable words, which will recognise that the Judaeo-Christian traditions made a huge contribution to Europe, will be found. Europe is now multicultural and multi-ethnic made up of people with different views. Some people believe in religion, others do not.</P>
    <P>I do not think an open reference, which is not intended to exclude anybody, is something to which people can make a reasonable objection.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Ormonde for her comments. She is correct; we must listen to the people if we are to produce answers that satisfy them. A referendum is a challenge but it is important because it keeps politicians and political leaders in touch with the people. I, unlike many politicians in the convention, do not take the view that a referendum is a chore. The only sovereign authority <Col N="503" />in this State is the people and that should never be forgotten. The people will have to be consulted in a referendum. We must learn from the mistakes of the past and convince the people by logical arguments. We will have to deal with the hysteria, distortions and mistruths that will be put forward but, above all, we must enter into a full debate that is respectful of the diversity of opinion, as Senator Maurice Hayes stated.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan suggested there might be significant differences between us occasionally but that is not the case. Both he and Senator Mooney referred, in particular, to the charter of human rights in the constitutional treaty. Senator Mooney is correct that there has been a shift but this is because of the manner in which the charter is included. In particular, the final three articles are very much references to the nature of the inclusion of the charter. They were part and parcel of Ireland's contribution to the negotiations. We were anxious that the charter should be seen for what it is in that it applies to the institutions of the Union and the member states in so far as they apply European institutional policy. The charter must not be mixed with the charter under the Council of Europe. It is important the public should be fully aware of the nature and subtlety of the changes introduced at our insistence. The charter has been clarified. There is no point in including it and persuading the people that it means more or less than it means. We have always sought to be objective in presenting the charter for what is it.</P>
    <P>One or two people are critical of the charter and I am absolutely amazed. It is one of the finest references to the fundamental rights and principles that we all should espouse &ndash; such as human dignity, the right to life, the right to the integrity of the person, the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment and the prohibition of slavery and forced labour. A total of 27 million men and women are slaves. Freedoms are listed which elevate the spirit. A number of people who are well meaning refer to the charter as a threat but they should read it because it is a fine presentation. It is also the first charter that makes references to the prohibition of human reproductive cloning. I do not understand a number of the objections that have been put forward in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan is absolutely correct that it is important to ensure the charter is not overstated because it is equally important to make sure it is not understated. This represents a fundamental change for Europe. The Senator's comments about the process adopted in the convention and the Intergovernmental Conference are also correct. The process is open and is fundamentally different to its predecessors. It is impossible to think that we would ever go back to the way the Nice treaty was handled.</P>
    <P>Senator Maurice Hayes referred to engaging <Col N="504" />the people. However, we should give ourselves credit for what Ireland has done. Between the first and second referenda on the Nice treaty, the manner in which the debate was conducted changed fundamentally. The debate was conducted in an intelligent way on the second occasion. The people have an extraordinary capacity to deal with complex issues if they are presented to them and they are not taken for granted. We should learn from the mistakes of the first referendum and communicate better with the people in an open and honest fashion by dealing with the balances and checks that have been inserted in the convention. Senator Hayes expressed doubts on the taxation issue, which I addressed earlier.</P>
    <P>I endorse the comments by Senators Cummins and Ormonde regarding the extraordinary way in which the Union has changed and shaped Ireland and created a peaceful Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon asked about the armaments agency. It is no more than a practical realisation that the taxes of the citizens of Europe are invested in many armaments. Whether we like it or not, even a neutral must make the odd purchase in that regard. It is important that there should be efficiency.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn touched on the small versus large state issue. He is absolutely correct that President Giscard d'Estaing and I had long and interesting debates about equality and the notion of small versus large. Ireland should never contribute to a debate that differentiates between small and large because the essential secret of Europe's success is that member states have been treated equally and are seen as equals, which is something that officials from larger states find difficult to understand. All member states bring something to the table. This is an issue on which the President and I disagree fundamentally.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also mentioned the EUROSTAT debate, though it does not relate directly to the constitutional treaty. It relates to the bizarre definition of capital investment and how it is treated by EUROSTAT. As a businessman, the Senator will be fully aware that if he decides to build a new superstore in my area, he will not write off all the cost in one year, particularly if it takes two or three years to construct. This is a fundamental issue and the Minister for Finance has made the point well.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the friends of the Community method, which was an extraordinary benefit of the Convention. Ireland gained incredibly because from the outset it insisted that new member states would be treated as equals because there was no point in Ireland seeking equality if it was not prepared to accept it for others. That strategic position was adopted from the beginning and it will pay large dividends.</P>
    <P>There has not been a shift in the Commission. Ireland accepted equality in the Nice treaty. Equality was bought and paid for by the smaller member states when a different form of QMV <Col N="505" />was accepted in the treaty. The Government pointed out to the people that under this arrangement it would mean every member state would not have a commissioner at some point in the future and there would have to be rotation of membership of the Commission, as a result of which Ireland would not have a commissioner on occasion. We were absolutely forthright, honest and open with the people on that. We accepted that provision on condition it applied to Germany, France and every other member state so that there would be one commissioner per member state until such time as the Community reached a certain size.</P>
    <P>The Convention put forward &ldquo;Nice plus&rdquo; in regard to the Commission so that when a member state did not have a full commissioner, another form of commissioner would be created. Equality has always been our <i>sine qua non</i>. We pointed out there would be difficulties if there was a differentiation between commissioners in terms of voting and non-voting and, for example, if commissioners were in the college of commissioners while others were not. That would create a difficulty for the Commission. If equality can be achieved in a Commission based on one commissioner per member state, Ireland will go along with that but Ireland does not want a scenario where the decision made on equality under the Nice treaty is violated or diminished.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Mansergh's comments on Christian heritage and tax. I thank Members for a provocative, thoughtful and interesting debate. We are playing our role in the Houses of the Oireachtas in so far as we are trying to communicate the ideas of Europe and the Convention and all they mean to the Irish people. It is up to the media, particularly the electronic media, to pick up on these efforts. These issues are well covered in the print media, which is a model for the rest of Europe. I am more than disappointed by the amount of coverage given to the thoughtful debates in the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House. I am glad to have the opportunity to introduce this Bill, which is intended to close off a dangerous loophole in our nationality and citizenship legislation. The loophole permitted the passports for sale scheme in the late 1980s and much of the 1990s. Many people in Government at that time were tempted to regard Irish citizenship as a matter in their own personal gift. Irish passports were issued to non-nationals in circumstances which, although they remain obscure today, were certainly of a dubious nature.</P>
      <P>The Bill is not concerned with the past, except in so far as it aims to avoid the repetition of the mistakes I have mentioned. It is concerned with the future, in which the past could be repeated if we do not enact this Bill. When the Government ended the scheme in 1998, the legislative loophole that gave birth to the scheme in the first instance was not closed. To his credit, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, has said that he accepts this point. Under current legislation, there is nothing to stop a future Government from reintroducing a passports for sale scheme. No statutory or regulatory constraints are in place to prevent such a measure. There is nothing to prevent a future Taoiseach or Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform from handing out Irish passports on his or her personal whim. In presenting this Bill, I am arguing that the loophole in question is too important to leave unclosed.</P>
      <P>The principal Act in this case is the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended in 1986 and 2001. The Act deals with the manner in which Irish citizenship may be acquired by birth or descent on the one hand, or by naturalisation on the other. The Bill before the House relates to naturalisation, which is governed by section 15 of the 1956 Act, which sets out the criteria to be applied by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in considering applications for naturalisation. The criteria apply mainly to the period the applicant has spent as a resident of Ireland and to his or her intention to continue living in Ireland. The criteria also extend to other matters, such as the requirement to be of good character and the necessity to make declaration of &ldquo;fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State&rdquo;. The criteria are simple and clear and nobody can say that they are too demanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 of the 1956 Act gives us trouble, however. It sets out the circumstances under which the relevant Minister may issue a certificate of naturalisation without the section 15 criteria having been satisfied. We need to be concerned with the first of these circumstances only. This section of the Bill states that the Minister <Col N="507" />may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation in the following cases, although the conditions for naturalisation (or any of them) are not complied with:</P>
    <P>(<i>a</i>) where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations;</P>
    <P>The key phrase that need concern us is &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;. The effect of section 16(<i>a</i>) is to give the Minister extraordinary powers to grant Irish citizenship to anyone at all who can claim &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;. One might well ask what this phrase means. When this legislation was being put in place in 1956, several Members of the Oireachtas were appalled by its breadth and vagueness. I like the suggestion made at the time that &ldquo;if an Arab in Cairo drinks a glass of Irish whiskey&rdquo;, he could claim to have &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;. Another example was given of an Asian playing in an Irish band in New York.</P>
    <P>The 1956 debate was a very interesting one. Despite the clear misgivings expressed at that time, most notably by the former Deputy Frank Aiken, the original provision was allowed to stand. The main argument in its favour was that it was inconceivable that any Minister would use this power other than very rarely and in an appropriate manner. We all know that later events proved that this argument was wrong. Everyone's prime concern in the late 1980s was the creation of jobs. It was suggested, perhaps by the IDA, that inward investment could be attracted to the country in return for offering Irish citizenship to the promoters of that investment. When people examined this matter they discovered, no doubt to their surprise, that no legislation was needed to start such a scheme. Regulations by means of a statutory instrument were not needed. Those involved could start a passports for sale scheme overnight, provided that they relied on the &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; provision in section 16.</P>
    <P>A scheme was commenced without legislative approval or ministerial regulations. The Government of the day started a passports for sale scheme with an informality that was staggering when one considers the importance of the issues involved. The conditions of the scheme were not properly set out and were, basically, open for negotiation in each individual case. The amount of money that needed to be invested was not laid down precisely. The means and duration of payment were not stated. There was no mechanism for properly checking the good character of applicants. There were no arrangements for checking what was promised by the investments, whether the promises materialised or whether the promised employment was created. The scheme was not properly regulated because it did not have to be. Why bother with that when the existing law gave the Minister such complete and sweeping powers? I do not deny for a moment that, over the life of the scheme, some very worthwhile <Col N="508" />investments were made and that some jobs were either created or saved. However, alongside this is the undeniable truth that many of the applications turned out badly. Some of the 107 granted citizenship were very dubious characters, some of the promised investments never materialised and some of the promised jobs were never created. Some of the money involved seems to have entered the pockets of middlemen who specialised in facilitating this very process.</P>
    <P>Once the possibilities of the sweeping powers became known, it did not take long for the practice of handing out passports to foreigners to become another shot in the locker of a Government that wanted to please its friends. Such was the public disquiet over the scheme that it was decided, a bit late in the day, to lay down rules to govern it. Once again, the rules were not statutory because it was not necessary to make them so. The presence of the non-statutory rules did not mean that they were followed or policed in any meaningful way. It took until 1998 &ndash; just five years ago &ndash; before the then Government, responding to widespread pressure, finally put an end to the scheme. By then, it had become abundantly clear that the scheme had done more damage to the reputation of Ireland than it had done good.</P>
    <P>Although the scheme was ended, the loophole was left in place. The apparent reason for this was a thoroughly bad one. It was suggested that, at some future date, economic circumstances might generate the need to start a similar scheme all over again. This disregarded the fact that the history of the scheme had clearly shown that any future scheme should be set up on a statutory basis, with a full set of legally binding regulations and a policing mechanism to ensure the rules were properly observed. It was specifically recommended by the review group who examined the matter &ndash; its report was published in August 2002 &ndash; that any future scheme should be statutorily based. Not even that group claimed there was any need to maintain the loophole. Since any future scheme would have its own statutory base, there was no reason to leave the loophole gaping open as it was.</P>
    <P>This Bill completes the work of ending the scheme by restricting the unlimited powers of the Minister, as set out in the principal Act. Section 3, which is at the heart of the Bill, specifically takes from the Minister the freedom to interpret Irish associations as being created by the promise of an investment in an Irish business. Section 4 adds a further safety net in that it similarly restricts the power of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to issue passports. I am not arguing that it has never been an issue; the key document is really the certificate of naturalisation.</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Bill restricts in any way the power of the Government to bestow Irish citizenship on a non-national as a token of honour. This is covered in section 12 of the principal Act and <Col N="509" />would remain untouched. In commending this Bill to the House, I appeal to the Government to carry it through to its enactment. It is the natural conclusion to what the Government itself did by ending the scheme in the first place. By closing the loophole we will be treating Irish nationality and citizenship with the considerable respect they deserve from us as legislators.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister is fully supportive of what I have proposed. I tabled this issue as an Adjournment debate on 19 December 2002. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, quoted the Minister. I have actually used the Minster's words to a large extent in trying to put forward this Bill. I commend the Minister for what he has done. He has been very forthright and determined in saying he also disapproves entirely of a scheme such as the so-called passports for sale scheme. His heart is in the right place. The only discussion we might have might be on the question of whether this Bill goes far enough. It does. It will, <i>inter alia</i>, be fulfilling Article 9.1.2º of the Constitution which states: &ldquo;The future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law.&rdquo; This Bill is a useful and essential step towards taking the next step, whatever that may be. It could well be that there will be amendments to the Bill. I commend it to the House and it is worthy of consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an honour to second Senator Quinn's proposal. Irish passports are extraordinarily valuable documents, as any of us who have travelled abroad know. It is no wonder the review body that looked into the sale of passports received so many adverse comments from the public who was shocked at the way the scheme was administered, perhaps inadvertently.</P>
      <P>When we go abroad with an Irish passport we are deemed very socially acceptable. We have no colonial past and a very good relationship with so many developing countries, where missionaries, teachers, doctors, engineers, etc., instituted educational and health measures. Our passport, therefore, is a desirable little book and it is very unfortunate that it has been debased in the way that it was.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, many women endanger both themselves and their just-to-be-born children by coming here at a very late stage of pregnancy. Thousands of such children have been born here and no such child can be refused Irish nationality under the 1956 Act and the amendments made thereto in 1999. Even if one does not declare at the time that one is an Irish citizen, or no one declares it for one, one is an Irish citizen and can claim this privilege later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Irish passport is an extraordinarily important document for everybody born on this island. Until recently, parents in the aforementioned position were allowed to stay with their children who had been granted Irish citizenship <Col N="510" />and give them the care and comfort of family life. Alas, this is no more. However, there are appeals before the courts so I should be careful what I say in this respect. It would be very sad if little Irish citizens had to go abroad to perhaps less congenial homes than those they would have if they were here or, worse still, if they were subject to inadequate care within the State if their natural parents decided it would be better to leave them here.</P>
    <P>The way passports were sold is in stark contrast to the very hard interrogation of those adults who try to get them when they seek asylum and refugee status. I have been involved in such cases and know there is a most rigorous naturalisation test in place. As the Minister knows, the vast majority of such applicants are refused.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that descendants of our emigrants to countries that are now experiencing economic difficulties are finding it difficult to pass the Irish naturalisation tests. I refer in particular to Argentina where many Irish emigrants went in previous centuries. Their descendants are extremely anxious that the grandfather clause be taken into account and that they be afforded the status of naturalised citizens here. Surely people in such circumstances are far more deserving of our help than those who have perfectly good homes somewhere else but who, for financial reasons, want to buy a passport so they can travel more easily and, perhaps, shelter from the law in their country of origin.</P>
    <P>The 1956 Act was changed very much in respect of the marriage of a spouse to an Irish citizen in the 1999 amendment to that Act. It is interesting that we made no effort in 1999 to close off the loophole Senator Quinn is now trying to close. After the amendment was made, it looked as though the spouses and children of investors would be treated more favourably than the spouses of Irish citizens. For example, after 1999 one had to have been married for three years to a person with Irish nationality. Also, couples had to be living as man and wife and swear an affidavit before the courts to say this was the case. One had to be living here for one year continuously before the date of application, and for two of the previous four years. These were onerous obligations on the person applying under the marriage laws compared to those imposed on persons who wanted to buy passports.</P>
    <P>When we consider how easily some undesirable people managed to obtain passports, it becomes evident that we need to block this loophole. There are other ways for people to obtain citizenship. I have been involved with people who relinquished British, American and Greek passports to remain here. Having lived and had businesses here for a long time, they felt fidelity to the State and loyalty to the nation. It is not as if the Bill creates circumstances in which those who want to throw in their lot with us may not do so. We want this loophole closed because a valuable <Col N="511" />document, the Irish passport, is being claimed by people who have questionable loyalty to the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to Senator Quinn for his considerable work in preparing this legislation, which deals with a matter on which I am already on record as holding views sympathetic to those underlying the Bill. The debate provides me with an opportunity to reiterate those views, which coincide in large measure with those of Senator Quinn.</P>
      <P>Senators have available to them the May 2000 report of the review group on the investment-based naturalisation scheme. With Government approval, I published the report shortly after coming into office and arranged for copies of it to be placed in the Oireachtas Library. It gives a detailed description of the workings of the scheme, which have been much debated since then, and I do not propose to address them in detail this evening, other than to point out some important aspects to give a full perspective on the issue.</P>
      <P>The scheme was established in 1989 and was adopted by successive Ministers for Justice until it was abolished in 1998 by the then Government. I understand its original genius, if I may use that phrase, was, by his own account, none other than the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy John Bruton, who observed other countries engaging in similar activities and decided that a scheme of this nature was appropriate for this State. Since its abolition by the previous Government, no new applications were to be accepted and only applications on hand when the scheme was suspended in September 1996 by the then Government, or which were to be accepted for processing afterwards by that Government for exceptional reasons, have been processed since. In essence, it has been a winding up operation, as a result of which no further investors are in the pipeline. The scheme is well and truly dead.</P>
      <P>From time to time, applications have been and will be made for naturalisation by or on behalf of the spouses and children of investors who were naturalised under the former scheme, each of which is considered on its own merits. The &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; of persons in this category does not arise from an investment but from the fact that they are associated with a person who is, in law, an Irish citizen. Likewise, were an investor citizen to have a child next week and enter the child's name on the foreign births register, the child automatically becomes an Irish citizen because his or her parent was an Irish citizen at the time of its birth. I say this for the purposes of clarity because, as I am sure Senator Quinn will acknowledge, these issues have led to considerable confusion in debates in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the currency of the scheme, it was not <Col N="512" />unusual, in respect of many applications for naturalisation being considered under the scheme, that the Minister entertaining the application would receive supportive representations from public representatives across the political spectrum. This was particularly the case with regard to applications based on investments which had a potential for creating new employment or saving jobs otherwise under threat. The general view of the scheme today is an unfavourable one, which is shared by Senator Quinn and me. I say this to ensure Senators are fully cognisant that the scheme was not always universally regarded as a bad thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, as regards some applications at least, it was considered by many to be a good scheme because of its job-saving and job-creating effect. My objections come from a number of angles. As I have stated previously both here and in the other House, I have a rooted objection in principle to the notion that citizenship can be bought or bartered for investments in the State by people who have little or no other connection with the State and no particular intention to establish any better connection. While citizenship is undoubtedly valuable, it is not a commodity to be traded in this way or in any analogous fashion.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the notion of non-nationals who come to Ireland to establish an enterprise, obtain residency for this purpose and, in the fullness of time, having lived and worked here and established firm roots in the State, seek to complete the connection with the State by applying to become citizens. I regard this as wholly proper and distinct from the basis on which the scheme was established. In such cases, there is no question of citizenship being used as a bargaining counter in exchange for the person's decision to establish, fund or invest in an enterprise here.</P>
      <P>I remind Senators of my previously voiced serious misgivings as to the legal propriety of the basis for the scheme. As Senator Quinn noted, its theoretical legal basis was that a suitable investment could be treated as coming within the definition of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;, thus enabling the Minister to waive any of the normal conditions for naturalisation under section 16, paragraph <i>(a)</i> of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. It appears this view is shared by Senator Quinn and, as his explanatory memorandum points out, it is the starting point for his proposed solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have grave reservations as to whether the latitude of this interpretation of the law was correct, although it was accepted by previous Governments. As Attorney General, I entertained those views which are, I understand, shared by the current Attorney General. I do not believe, there<Col N="513" />fore, that the Government would be advised that it could have recourse to that particular justification for reintroducing the scheme without at least amending the statute, which would require the authority of the Houses. I am clearly not alone in holding those reservations because the review group's report voiced similar concerns.</P>
    <P>Other than to register again my dismay at the irregular procedures adopted in some instances, I see no need to address individual cases in detail. It would be easy for me to spend some time thumping my chest and protesting my outrage at various incidents which occurred in the past. Having mentioned such incidents in the House on previous occasions, my views on that subject should be taken as read. Even a high standard of procedural nicety in every case would not set aside my objection to the principle of the former scheme or any such scheme and my concerns as to its legal basis under the Act.</P>
    <P>It is evident then that I support fully the motivation of Senator Quinn in seeking to put beyond doubt the revival of the former investment-based naturalisation scheme or the introduction of any similar scheme under the same rubric. This desire is in complete accord with my view and that of the Government and is in line with the commitments already given by the Government not to revive the old scheme or introduce a new one. The Government will support this Bill.</P>
    <P>We must now examine the text of the Bill to see whether it will, if enacted, achieve the aim stated by Senator Quinn. This is where we encounter some difficulties with its current wording. What I have to say in this context is a dispassionate, impersonal and somewhat technical commentary on the text and is not intended, nor should it be understood by anyone, least of all Senator Quinn, to be a criticism of the drafting skills deployed. From bitter experience in compiling many Private Members' Bills, I am aware of the considerable personal commitment involved in preparing such a Bill and I congratulate the Senator on his initiative. Nonetheless, it is necessary to examine the provisions of the Bill, as it stands, to ascertain whether it would give the right results.</P>
    <P>The core provision is at section 3, which proposes a new section 16B for insertion in the 1956 Act. One difficulty we encounter is the use of the word &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; in the context of a certificate of naturalisation. It is a principle at the heart of citizenship law that there is no entitlement, as such, on the part of a non-national to be given a certificate of naturalisation. Such certificates are given by the Minister &ldquo;in his absolute discretion&rdquo;, to quote section 15 of the Act.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; is also used in the Bill in the context of the issue by the Minister or by a consular officer of certificates of nationality, which are different from a certificate of naturalisation. A certificate of nationality can only be issued to an Irish citizen. In that sense, it merely <Col N="514" />reflects the existing reality of that person's citizenship; it cannot become a vehicle for conferring citizenship. The second point is that it cannot be issued to a person who was, at the absolute discretion of the Minister, naturalised. Therefore, it has no immediate relevance in the context of the investment-based naturalisation scheme.</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts provide for the issuing of certificates of nationality where the Minister or a consular official is satisfied that the person in question is an Irish citizen by birth, descent or marriage. For the purposes of this debate, I will leave aside the question of honorary citizenship, to which the Senator referred, which is conferred by the President on the advice of the Government. Some ministerial or consular official has to determine whether any of these situations are relevant to the incident case, but he must do so by reference to the tightly defined statutory regime in sections 6, 7 and 8 of the amended 1956 Act, which covers these cases and only on production of evidence that brings the person in question within the ambit of those sections. The issuing of certificates of nationality is, then, not strictly relevant to the issue we are trying to address here because, first, it does not arise in the context of naturalisation and, second, it is a mere consequence of citizenship acquired on the basis of statutory or constitutional entitlement which has no investment-based element.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the essence of the matter which we are trying to address, the granting of certificates of naturalisation in return for investment. I referred earlier to the situation of the immigrant who comes to Ireland to set up an enterprise and, in the normal course, applies for naturalisation having settled here for a number of years. In this case, there can be no objection in principle to granting a certificate of naturalisation to the applicant, but I am concerned that the very wide sweep of the language in the proposed section 16B might unwittingly preclude naturalising that person. I do not think that is a result which the Senator would intend and it may not be the only reading of his proposed text. I do not think that it is a desirable effect and if we are to avoid it, we must choose language which leaves no room for that ambiguity.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Senator's Bill is based on an assumption that the issuing of passports by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is wholly divorced from the question of whether the person to whom the passport is being given is an Irish national. It is undoubtedly the case that statute law is at best sketchy when it comes to the issue of passports. It is not, however, the case that there is a legal blank sheet in Irish or EU law. If the Minister for Foreign Affairs was, in some notional Government, to set up procedures for the wholesale granting of Irish passports to persons who were patently not Irish citizens, the law, either at national or EU level, might shoot such pro<Col N="515" />cedures down. The passport is evidence of Irish citizenship, but it is not Irish citizenship itself.</P>
    <P>If a Ruritanian national, by fraud or deception, tricks the Department of Foreign Affairs into giving him or her an Irish passport, that acquisition does not make him or her any less a Ruritanian or any more an Irish citizen. The only way for him or her to become an Irish citizen is through naturalisation. Section 4 would remove only a symptom of the malaise which the Senator seeks to cure, but if section 3 can be reworded suitably so as to effect the substantive cure, then the symptom would go away too and section 4 of the Bill might be superfluous. If that section disappears, the references in the Long and Short Titles of the Bill to the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 might also become surplus to requirements.</P>
    <P>It is clear that my support for the principle of this Bill must be tempered by a Government health warning that if the Bill is to go further, it will be necessary to table extensive amendments to the entirety of the Bill if it is to achieve in a satisfactory way the aim, which the Senator and I share, of amending our statutory citizenship code. It must be put beyond doubt that it cannot be used, at some future date, by some Government with a less fastidious sense of duty than the current incumbents, to put in place a scheme of naturalisation based on investments or the promise of investments in the State, or to revive the former scheme or any close relative of it. In addition, we should not underestimate the issues involved in arriving at suitable provisions to bring about the desired result, in particular where there is a strong argument that the former scheme and any future schemes are already precluded by the current language of the Citizenship Acts. If the view I entertained as Attorney General and now as Minister that the current Act does not justify people handing over money and having, without further association, citizenship granted to them, leads to the putting in place of a statutory prohibition on such behaviour to tie the hands of future Governments, we have to be clear that the new formula will be such as not to prevent unintended consequences. This is something that would have to be teased out if this measure goes to committee.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding about what I have said, I do not put forward these problems as a basis for not making any provision at all. The fact is that, notwithstanding the current wording of the Act, an investment-based scheme was in fact established, which is the point Senator Quinn made. We will have to find language that ensures that the current wording of the term &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; cannot in future be so interpreted.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that the Government welcomes the principle of the Bill and will not oppose its Second Reading. There are problems with the current text which would make it necessary to bring forward significant Government <Col N="516" />amendments on any Committee Stage, the effect of which would be probably to make very extensive changes to the entire text of the Bill. I expect to have other legislative proposals in the area of citizenship law before the Oireachtas in the coming year and I intend that my proposals will include amendments necessary to achieve our joint aim. In any event, Senator Quinn may find it possible in those circumstances to withdraw his Bill in favour of the Government legislation when it is available.</P>
    <P>I commend Senator Quinn for pursuing the matter and giving the House the opportunity to consider the matter's legislative aspects. I would also be surprised, but perhaps I am wrong, if there is not a very substantial consensus in this House that the term &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; should not be warped out of all recognition to include people who have no connection whatsoever with this country, but who put money into a failing or an emergent company as seed capital in order to become Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>When one looks at Article 9 of the Constitution, which deals with the acquisition of citizenship, it is noteworthy that fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental duties of the citizen. Therefore, I believe that even if a proposal &ndash; again I hope this is never put to the test &ndash; was put before this and the other House to put into Irish law the underpinnings of the old scheme, there could be a very strong argument that it was unconstitutional and open to the buying of citizenship.</P>
    <P>The implication of Article 9 of the Constitution, that citizenship shall be acquired and lost &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo;, does not mean any old law that the Oireachtas puts in place on a given day, but a law which is mandated and compatible with the Constitution. It would certainly have to take into account the valuable rights of voting in our elections and referenda that are conferred in citizenship, that residents' rights are available to citizens and that it is an obligation of every person who becomes an Irish national to owe a duty of loyalty and fidelity to the Irish nation and State. Clearly, if something was available to a person who had absolutely no connection with the country and was excused by ministerial fiat even from declaring their loyalty to a District Judge, as happened in many of these cases, and even from the requirement to reside in Ireland for any appreciable period, it is arguable, at the very least, that such a law would do violence to the Constitution because it would effectively allow the State to barter citizenship for money.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of IDCs, that is, Irish born citizens of non-nationals. I do not share her use of the word &ldquo;alas&rdquo; in connection with the Supreme Court's decision. It would be strange if Ireland was the only country in the world where persons illegally in the country could convert their status into one of legality by the mere happenstance that one of them had parented a child <Col N="517" />in our jurisdiction. Whereas the Constitution confers nationality on anybody born on the island of Ireland, it does not follow that a child who is born on a casual trip to Ireland confers by implication or by any moral order the right on his or her family to reside in Ireland on that basis.</P>
    <P>Apart from the refugees and indigent immigrants, who make up the classic cases in this area, can we seriously suggest that if a fugitive family from a neighbouring jurisdiction or America came to this country they would obtain the right to remain here because one of them is fortunate enough to parent or deliver a child in Ireland? There was more heat than light in the debate on the IBC issue. Consider the situation of an American academic who comes to lecture for a semester in Ireland and his wife happily has a child while they are here. The notion that the family <i>ipso facto</i> becomes entitled to remain in Ireland is untenable either as a moral or legal concept and I welcome the Supreme Court's clarification that the pre-existing law did not carry that implication.</P>
    <P>If one is born in America, the same concept of <i>jus</i> solely applies. If anybody goes to America, regardless of circumstance, and one of our children is born there, that child becomes entitled under American law to be regarded as an American citizen. However, that is always dealt with on the basis that the parent goes home immediately if they are not entitled to stay and they must bring their child with them because they have a natural law duty as a parent to bring the child with them and look after it. When the child comes of age, he or she will be in a position to avail of the full fruits of the citizenship which arises from the fact of birth in America.</P>
    <P>We have one case where a person from Nigeria with residency rights in Australia came to Ireland to have a baby before going back to Australia. That shows what people are willing to do to avail of the present state of our constitutional dispensation. However, the notion that somebody in those circumstances also gets the right to come here with their family, siblings and so forth is not sustainable. While I agree with much of what Senator Henry says, the &ldquo;alas&rdquo; she used in her contribution is one I cannot accept.</P>

      <P>It is a little more complex than that. I commend Senator Quinn for highlighting this issue. I thank him for the effort he put into this Bill. The kneejerk reaction of saying I will do it myself and voting against the measure would be, in these circumstances, ungracious and wrong. Even if I intend to compete with the Senator to have my Bill passed first in the fullness of time, I wish to indicate Government support <Col N="518" />for the principle of this legislation. We will not oppose the Bill.</P>

I also welcome the Minister's support for the Bill even if he intends to put down many amendments or, perhaps, introduce another Bill. The fact that the Minister will not oppose the Bill is a great compliment to Senator Quinn and the work he put into the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is time this loophole was closed and the Minister obviously accepts that. The way it has been dealt with has caused many problems. In 1956 a number of people were extremely critical of this section of the Bill. They included Micheál Ó Moráin, Stephen Barrett and Frank Aitken. Stephen Barrett said that if something was not done about it, many mischievous deeds could occur. The interpretation of &ldquo;Irish association&rdquo; was so wide that he described it as a chasm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken all this time and many occurrences in the meantime to bring us to this day when something is being done about it.</P>
      <P>The worst aspect of it was the passports for sale scheme. I do not have a figure for how many passports were sold in this manner. Perhaps the Minister could supply it. It was dreadful how the criteria for granting these passports were ignored. In approximately 20 cases a declaration of loyalty to the State and fidelity to the nation was not sworn. It is appalling that somebody would be granted a passport and not have that loyalty. How could they, when the passports were given out in that fashion to anybody who would invest in the State?</P>
      <P>The soft option loans for which citizenship was given was also an appalling state of affairs, one of which the Minister was extremely critical. One thinks of the Mahfouz application in which, as the Minister said, there was scant regard for fulfilling the citizenship requirements. That occurred when former Deputy Ray Burke was Minister. The former Minister, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, was greatly alarmed at the manner in which those passports were given out.</P>
      <P>If this loophole is not closed, one can envisage further appalling situations arising and they might not happen when the Minister's party is in Government with Fianna Fáil. In a way it is good that the Minister climbed the poles in Dublin to tell us not to let Fianna Fáil have it all to themselves. If we were to leave it to them, who knows when the sale of passports might re-emerge without this loophole being closed?</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to Deputy John Bruton. Deputy Bruton has been greatly maligned in this regard, particularly by the previous Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but I understand that Deputy Bruton wrote to Alan Dukes about granting citizenship to people who might invest huge sums of money in this country. However, that is where it ended. Alan Dukes did not take it up. The Minister can tell who did bring the matter up after that and whether I am right or wrong about Deputy John Bruton. There was no need for the Minister to mention his name in this regard when he was not the person who brought it up.</P>

      <P>I join in commending Senator Quinn. It is a tremendous exercise in parliamentary democracy that we have a Private Members' Bill before us, and I hope we see more of them. Otherwise we are often responding to what comes in from Ministers. The whole parliamentary process is enhanced by initiatives such as this, and in that regard I certainly welcome it. I am in any case a firm believer in such bodies. If one can set one's own agenda, it is often far better than reacting to someone else's. In that context, it is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The Minister has outlined very clearly both his own and the Government's position on this legislation. I preface what I have to say regarding it by agreeing with Senator Quinn's comments that there have obviously been abuses in the operation of the scheme, and undoubtedly some unsavoury people were granted citizenship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not particularly. We can sometimes become holier than thou in the manner in which we address such matters. I feel some revulsion at that. Senator Quinn has rightly pointed out that it is the ministerial discretion to issue certificates of naturalisation rather than the criteria that he takes issue with. I do not think he has any difficulty with Irish descent. It is the question of &ldquo;Irish association&rdquo; that he fingers as the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the 1980s, when every company would have had the cash flows of the retail trade. There were instances when I sat with workers whose companies were in receivership or liquidation. They and their families looked forward to a very pessimistic future. There were occasions <Col N="520" />when we lobbied the Government, which was not Fianna Fáil, to see if funds might be made available from the passport for investment scheme to try to give the firms a breathing space and perhaps rescue some or all of the jobs involved. We did not make any apologies, nor would any of the workers have done so at the time, for doing so. I will not be critical today of the benefits and operations that flowed from the concept behind the scheme.</P>
    <P>I share with the Minister a certain disquiet regarding people gaining citizenship purely because they have the financial wherewithal to invest in a company here. However, I must balance that by not taking the moral high ground too much regarding the plight of individuals whom I knew personally at the time, who would have taken money from anywhere to keep their company going and save the jobs of those involved. My own county languished at the top of the unemployment league table. For many years during the 1980s we had the second or third highest level of unemployment in the country, at 17% or 18%. I know companies there which benefited under the scheme and because of it were able to continue in operation, saving jobs. Obviously, prospects for the families involved significantly improved because of that. That is the other side of the coin in this debate that should not be lost sight of entirely as we clamber up the hill to the high moral ground.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I share the disquiet expressed at aspects of the scheme's operation, and the abuses of it. In the current economic climate there is certainly no need for that scheme. However, while I hope to be here for a little while, I hope it is not in the conditions which we had in the 1980s under that terrible Government of Garret FitzGerald, which visited so much economic hardship on so many people across the country&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;because of bad fiscal and economic policies. We criticise people for abusing power, which I join in, for it is abhorrent to me. Equally, total inefficiency on a scale almost amounting to criminal negligence should also be condemned. To be honest, I felt very strongly, when I saw its adverse effects on individuals, that politicians were not brought to heel for totally negligent mismanagement. We must adhere to a proper ethical code, but we must also adhere to proper management codes and apply ourselves properly to the job so the people benefit from the Administration rather than suffer because of it. That was certainly not the case in that era.</P>

      <P>If ever we got back to that bad <Col N="521" />economic situation again, I would certainly not oppose a similar scheme, operating properly and ethically administered, to save people's jobs. In those instances, I remember the bank of last resort at the time, which I believe was the State bank, Fóir Teoranta, when no other commercial bank would give money. When it failed to put funds in because it felt it was far too risky, it was money from the passports scheme which went into places to which huge risk attached. I have difficulty on that front. The same is true of business people coming to live for a period in this State. Three or four American industries in my locality have provided tremendous employment. I would like to think that those people, who may live here part time and in America for the remainder, would not be disqualified simply because they do not meet the residency criterion. If they meet all the other criteria, including being of good character and swearing fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, I would like to think ministerial discretion could be applied.</P>
      <P>I commend Senator Quinn again for his initiative in this regard. Legislative measures to discount the scheme for the immediate future, which is currently suspended, are welcome, and I hope that we never again see days when it is considered economically necessary. However, against all the criticism, we must balance the benefit. I speak on behalf of a number of people in my locality whose jobs, livelihoods and perhaps continuing residency in Ireland are owed to the scheme.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and commend Senator Quinn and the other Independent Senators on the work that has gone into it. It is welcome that Senators from the Opposition have tabled legislation in this way. I also welcome the fact the Minister has said he will not oppose it and has taken it on board. I realise that some work will have to be done on it by him and his Department.</P>
      <P>I make the general point that an Irish passport is a valuable thing. They would be devalued if it were perceived that they were for sale. On that basis I support the legislation. It is welcome that it narrows the definition of &ldquo;Irish association&rdquo;. I am, however, concerned that it might be narrowed too far and I suppose the Minister will examine that for there must be a certain amount of discretion, but the broad principle of the Bill is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a question to which the Minister might return in his reply. I do not believe it would be fair to revoke the passports of those who have already received them. However, what is the position regarding someone who received a passport and who might be involved in international crimi<Col N="522" />nal activity? Is the Minister planning to revoke the passports of such individuals?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of general issues that are not directly related to the Bill. The Minister narrowed the basis of post-nuptial citizenship too much and I believe that the position should be reviewed. From contacts with constituents &ndash; I am not seeking to raise their particular cases &ndash; I am aware that people who have been granted Irish citizenship must jump through a large number of hoops in order to obtain a visitor's visa for a family member who may wish to visit them here. In my limited experience, applications for such visas are often refused. People who have been granted Irish citizenship should have the right to have members of their families visit them for holidays, etc. The Minister needs to consider ways of taking a more compassionate approach to the people to whom I refer.</P>
    <P>I have stated on previous occasions that the Government must draw up more comprehensive immigration procedures that would involve, for example, a green card system similar to that which operates in the United States. I do not make this point in respect of the Bill, which I welcome, but our immigration policy is based too much on crisis management and a negative approach. I realise that there are people who abuse the system and provision must be made to deal with them. That is why we need an immigration system in the first instance in order to ensure that everybody is clear about how to qualify for citizenship, etc. We must develop an immigration system that is positive in nature before putting in place various measures to tackle abuses of that system.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and the Minister's acceptance of the principle behind it.

Senator Quinn should not be overly concerned and the Minister should not be too sanctimonious about the need to substantially amend legislation. Governments have managed to make a mess of legislation on many occasions.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Quinn on introducing the Bill and on investing so much work in it. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill refers to Government assurances that the passports for sale scheme shall not be reintroduced. There is no doubt that I must support Senator Quinn in that regard. I was pleased when the Minister indicated his agreement with the Bill, in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" />What we are not talking about so much here is the concept of a business permission in order to create employment. There are two different issues at stake. I am completely against the notion of passports for sale. I do not want to entertain anyone who, because of their financial status, can buy their way into this country. I do not care whether they wish to create jobs &ndash; I may be disagreeing with party colleagues on this matter &ndash; but I do not like the notion of passports for sale. The loophole must be closed and I do not want to see the scheme ever re-introduced.</P>
    <P>I would support the idea of business permission if we should ever return to the position in which we found ourselves in the mid-1980s when successive Governments tried to attract business interests to establish operations here in order to try to create employment. That is a different issue. If the Government was ever in a position whereby it would be obliged to lure people from other countries to create employment here and sought to formulate a scheme under which business permissions would be granted &ndash; such a scheme would have to include strict criteria in order that there would be no innuendo about passports being for sale &ndash; I would consider it on its merits. However, I agree with Senator Quinn that the principle of passports for sale must never enter into our language again.</P>
    <P>I came here to support Senator Quinn this evening. I acknowledge what the Minister stated about agreeing with the Bill in principle. I do not know much about drafting legislation of this nature and I would give the Minister room to manoeuvre in that regard. I will be watching and my guiding principle will be no passports for sale.</P>

      <P>I would not be as enthusiastic in complimenting Senator Quinn on this Bill as other Members. It is convenient to have a short memory about the issues that affected the decisions taken at the time to admit business people to this country. While the scheme may have been brought into disrepute on some occasions, generally speaking, it was extremely attractive and ensured jobs were maintained and created. In a period when interest rates were in the region of 17%, this loan scheme allowed rates of about 2.5%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Senator Walsh making a point about investors. I am sure he is aware of the benefits that accrued to the economy at that time. Kerry Airport would not exist today but for the naturalisation scheme &ndash; it required that support. Neither the Industrial Credit Corporation nor any of the other banks were anxious to provide funding. Schemes like Kerry Airport and the equestrian centre at Millstreet, which was also supported by this scheme, were seen as high-risk. <Col N="526" />Thousands of acres of forestry were supported by this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>A firm in the midlands, which now employs 250 people, availed of this scheme.</P>
      <P>As a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I knew about this scheme and supported it without being directly involved in it in any way. Most Ministers would have been aware of the scheme. Mrs. Nora Owen, a former Minister, was involved in this scheme in 1995. A case was presented to her and while she may not have taken a particular action, it was encouraged. A former Taoiseach was mentioned and a former Progressive Democrats Minister was also involved. I told the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about this, but many people are now rather saintly about this scheme.</P>
      <P>It is all right for those privileged few, like Senators Quinn, Henry, Ross, O'Toole and Norris, who have been here for years and never had to worry about losing their jobs. They have never had to work in the real world and try to maintain jobs that were in Edgeworthstown, nor did they have to try to create jobs in Millstreet. I have examples of numerous schemes and lots of information regarding this scheme.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to vote down this Bill and I am surprised the Government has accepted it. I assure Senator Quinn that it will be changed before it returns to this House &ndash; that is if it ever sees the light of day. While he is at it, will the good Senator consider bringing forward a Bill to remove citizenship from those people with Irish passports who live abroad to avoid taxation? Would he consider that they are playing a role in this economy by taking &euro;50 million out of the country and not paying capital gains tax? Does he feel that this might be another appropriate opportunity for him to introduce a Bill? Some of those who availed of Irish passports paid Irish taxation and bought residences in this city at a time when it was difficult to sell such expensive houses.</P>
      <P>Will the Senator consider other abuses of the passport scheme? I know a certain newspaper will not publish this because some individuals are availing of it. Most of the establishment newspapers will not publish it anyway because it is part of the establishment in the city of Dublin. I think it was called the &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo; at one stage. The golden circle is alive and well as far as I can see. Those with money can go to Monaco or Portugal and avail of opportunities such as avoiding capital gains tax. Yet, when one sees the work that was done in Millstreet and elsewhere, one would think that the people behind it are good Irish citizens and there is no question of withdrawing their passports. They comply with the laws of this land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="527" />For those who become righteous about this naturalisation scheme, the Canadians have been involved in it for years and are not changing it. The British are involved in it. While everyone in this Chamber &ndash; bar Senator Terry, perhaps &ndash; is entitled to a British passport, I am sure they will not avail of it. Anyone born in this State prior to 1948 is entitled to a British passport. Furthermore, if one's parents were born here prior to the declaration of the Republic in 1948, one is also entitled to a passport.</P>
    <P>I saw this scheme in terms of jobs. In the 1990s, I brought Sheikh Masari to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery of this House. He made a major investment in this country. He is a major backer of the Palestinians and is well respected in Palestine.</P>
    <P>I am in an awkward position as far as this Bill is concerned. I will oppose the Bill in principle but I understand the Government has accepted it. The Minister has made a good statement on the Bill. People may not know the scheme but one of the key sections in it includes the following:</P>
    <P>The Minister will be satisfied on the advice of a Minister of the Government that the applicant has established a manufacturing or international service, or other acceptable wealth and job creating projects here that is viable and involves substantial investment by the applicant.</P>
    <P>Former and serving Ministers signed those requests. The requests were granted by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and investment poured in at a crucial time when funds could not be raised and there was difficulty creating jobs.</P>
    <P>I have a great love and respect for my citizenship. There have been cases of abuse in this scheme. If someone was to come into a constituency and say that he had &euro;10 million to invest in creating jobs in Wexford, Laois, Offaly, Leitrim, Donegal or Roscommon and the only requirement was that he wanted a passport, I would be delighted to bring him in and try to change the Minister's view. This is why I hope this Bill will not be passed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Coming from where he does, like my county, his county is on the Border and he will have a certain familiarity with passports, nationality and such matters. While I have a certain degree of sympathy with Senator Leyden's interesting contribution, the sad fact is this Bill has been brought forward because the passports for sale scheme was totally and utterly discredited and created enormous embarrassment for the Government and the country in general. We were being touted around the world because not only <Col N="528" />were passports being sold, but the administration of the scheme within existing law was being flouted as well. From reading the Bill I believe that is where Senator Quinn is coming from. Notwithstanding the benefits arising from the original concept, which I am sure was introduced with the noblest motivation &ndash; Senator Leyden was attempting to convey the context in which this was introduced &ndash; on balance I understand where the Minister is coming from in his broad sympathy for the main thrust of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden is right. We all would have welcomed a bunch of Hong Kong businessmen and others, certainly in my part of the country, if they had said they would invest money in return for passports. As Senator Leyden said, this is and continues to be perfectly normal practice in the United Kingdom. However, that basic point has been made by others as well as by me.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us when the new passports will be available in all overseas embassies? These are passports with the new chip in them and though they are available in Dublin they are not available in all overseas embassies. When will that be rolled out in its entirety? Also, how will the Minister address the loophole created by the Good Friday Agreement, which has only been partially closed by the Supreme Court ruling of 23 January this year? All of us are familiar with the clause in the Agreement, on which we voted, stating that anyone born on the island of Ireland was automatically entitled to Irish citizenship. That was voted on at a time when immigration, asylum seekers, refugees and all the other sad dimensions of the human endeavour were not visited on Ireland in any great numbers.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue in the context of the Bill for reasons going back to Senator Leyden's last point. I too am proud to be Irish and proud to carry my passport. I put a particular value on carrying an Irish passport but I do not see how one can continue to operate a system when people deliberately use the law to ensure they have children born in this country without any loyalty to or knowledge of our mores, society, history or culture. They would only see this as a convenience, as we are somewhat unique in Europe, and the world, in this regard. It is all because of the goodness that flowed from the Good Friday Agreement, when we wished to reach out to our Northern brethren and say: &ldquo;You are as entitled to be Irish as the rest of us if you are born on the island of Ireland&rdquo;. Sadly, as has been pointed out in this debate, there were no qualifying conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the Minister in this regard but when I called for a debate here on citizenship two years ago I was accused of being a racist by the then Leader of the Opposition and it took him three months to withdraw that comment. I am not a racist but I am, like everyone else, proud of my nationality. According to the Minister for Justice, <Col N="529" />Equality and Law Reform's letter of 6 October there are no proposals before Government at present to change the Constitution. The issue of the entitlement to Irish citizenship of every person born on the island of Ireland is, however, under very careful and ongoing review by his Department, so there is an acknowledgement of this within the Department.</P>
    <P>I am sure I am not telling tales out of school when I say that prior to the Supreme Court judgment there was active consideration within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of what flowed as a consequence of the constitutional amendment arising out of the Good Friday Agreement but the Supreme Court ruling let us off the hook in a sense. While it went a certain distance along the road, it has not gone the full distance.</P>
    <P>It is important to put on record the requirements an applicant for naturalisation must meet. They must be of full age and of good character, they must have a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years preceding that application, they must have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years. They must intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation and they must have made, either before a justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. I presume it is the latter issue that Senator Quinn may be addressing &ndash; the special reasons.</P>
    <P>The last point the Minister made in the context of my letter was that while he had no plans to amend Irish nationality legislation at present, his Department was keeping the legislation under review, which dovetails with what the Minister said today. I strongly urge the Minister to bring forward whatever proposals he has in legislative form in this area. We need an urgent debate on this matter for a very clear reason: in 1998 there were 588 applications for naturalisation as Irish citizens, which is less than five years ago. In the last year for which statistics are available, 2002, there were 3,190 applications for naturalisation. Those are significant figures in the context of our population.</P>
    <P>All I am asking for is a debate on where we are going with our citizenship and I applaud Senator Quinn's initiative in commencing this debate in the House. I hope it continues in light of the Minister's comments. I am strongly of the opinion that anyone who wishes to acquire Irish citizenship should pass some form of test other than those outlined in the current legislation. If one goes to America to take out citizenship, as hundreds of thousands of Irish citizens have done over the decades, one has to pass a test of one's knowledge of the constitution and various other <Col N="530" />aspects of American political life. David Blunkett, the British Home Secretary, has expounded his views on how one should go about getting citizenship in the UK. Here we have the consequences of the Good Friday Agreement and we are also now a pull country for immigration. Sadly, some are abusing this law because it is in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to introduce this Bill and I thank everyone who spoke. It has been well debated and it had approval from everyone, with one exception. I express my appreciation to the Minister in particular for his support of the Bill. I found it a useful exercise to put the Bill forward. Senator Terry referred to going back through the 1956 Act and that was a reminder to me of our duty in this House to scrutinise every Bill that comes through. It was interesting to see names from the past &ndash; Mícheál O Móráin, Frank Aiken, a friend of my father's, and Stephen Barrett, a man I knew well. Those names from the past were very concerned about the words &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; but it got through the legislation and now here it comes again many years later. We should remember we are not debating the rights and wrongs of whether passports should be issued in this way but the fact that there are no rules other than &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo;. This is the weakness in that legislation. We are examining something the Houses missed in 1956 from the perspective of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what everyone has said about the Bill. Senator Henry used a good word when she said our passports were debased. My attention was drawn to a novel, <i>The Sigma Protocol</i>, by Robert Ludlum, a popular writer. Page 249 states: &ldquo;Some of those international businessmen, you know, have second passports from places like Panama or Ireland. They come in handy sometimes.&rdquo; We were mentioned alongside Panama, and Panama may be worthy in this context, but that is what happened when we produced a system with no statutory controls. My sole purpose in introducing this Bill is to avoid us ever doing something like that again without having in place statutory controls.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden mentioned that Britain, Canada, Singapore and others have similar systems but those systems have statutory controls. It is possibly a different view. Any debasing of Irish passports was anathema to Senator Ormonde, but she also said that there may be a time when we should introduce these again in some form or other and she also mentioned the need for statutory controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's uncompromising opposition to any question of a sale of passports and it is guaranteed that no such scheme would be introduced here again. That is not my concern because I know the Government and the Minister would not do so. My concern is that some future <Col N="531" />Government could do so. I urge the Minister to put my mind at rest by copperfastening his determination to make sure that does not happen again by ensuring legislation in this regard is passed immediately.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Minister has not opposed the Bill. I would like to be able to convince him to support it on Committee Stage. He has introduced two topics which I would like to examine. One is the question of entitlement. I would like to examine it because I do not understand the detail of it. The word &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; clearly creates a problem for the Parliamentary Counsel. He also talked about the difference between the certificate of naturalisation and certificate of nationality, another matter which we should examine.</P>
    <P>An alternative approach to mine would be for the Minister to introduce a Bill and to allow mine to linger and languish among the pending legislation that does not go anywhere. There is a long queue to introduce legislation and it takes time to get legislation through these Houses. It seems we have got so far with this Bill, which is a short and, I suggest, sweet one, and I urge the Minister to support Committee and Report Stages and to ensure it is passed.</P>
    <P>My objective is to make sure that we close the loophole that is in danger of debasing our passports. That can be done by way of a Bill introduced by the Minister or by way of this Bill. I hope it will be done by way of this Bill not on the grounds of any personal kudos I would get from it, although I would be very pleased to see it that way, but the process would be much sharper and snappier and it would make sure that loophole was closed.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the contributions of all those who spoke on the Bill, even those who disapproved of it. I introduced the Bill because of strong views expressed by a number of people outside this House, one of whom is Anne O Broin, who is in the Visitors Gallery. She is only one of a number of people who expressed concern that such a system could operate again. We should close this door immediately. The Minister's heart is in the right place and he has shown that today. I urge the House to pass this Bill on Second Stage and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I note from my files on this matter that the Minister of State replied to this matter when I last raised in April. This is at least the third time I have raised it as a Member of this House. The Minister of State reported to this House last April that an order has been issued and he also said that he was pleased to inform me that the document under clause K of the mining lease had been finalised and would be served on Mogul and its directors that week by the Chief State Solicitor's office. I very much welcomed that news by the Minister of State because it seemed we were making progress.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will recall at that time there was considerable concern in the community because its members were experiencing difficulties arising from the dust blowing off the tailings pond in particular. January, February, March and April were particularly dry this year, as a result of which a good deal of dust blew off the tailings pond. The monitoring which is continually being carried out by the EPA for the county council showed that the levels of lead and cadmium, in particular, contained in that dust was unacceptable and that the continuing erosion of the tailings pond is causing a major problem in the community, particularly for those who are farming and those who are living in the vicinity of it.</P>
      <P>To hear that the notice had been served under clause K by the Chief State Solicitor's office on Mogul was good news. We had hoped that in the following weeks we would see the finalisation of an agreed rehabilitation plan between Mogul and the agencies involved, specifically the EPA, in terms of a waste licence and so on, for the final rehabilitation of the tailings pond.</P>
      <P>Very little has happened over the summer. The final rehabilitation plan, which we know will be the subject of planning permission and of a waste licence permit from the EPA, has not materialised. We are now reduced to discussing a temporary solution. Even that appears to be difficult. It is my view that Mogul Ireland is dragging its heels on this matter. I know there is a considerable degree of frustration in terms of dealings with the company. To date three submissions have been made to the county council in relation to a temporary covering of the eroded parts of the tailings pond involving organic material, and even that cannot be agreed because the proposals do not meet the county council's requirements. This relates merely to a waste permit, not to a waste licence or EPA licence or planning permission, yet nothing has been finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" />It is now October and we are heading into winter. When January and February come we will once again be looking at the winds coming from the eastern side of the Kerry mountains and causing a problem at Silvermines. Time continues to pass. Concern is turning to frustration and anger. I asked the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, of which I am a member, to invite the views of a delegation from Silvermines, and that will happen in the new year. I intend to continue raising this matter and applying pressure.</P>
    <P>I learned recently that the senior official who has been dealing with this issue in the Department is no longer dealing with it. I would like the Minister of State to clarify what is happening in the Department to ensure that this matter is being pursued with the vigour and will it needs to ensure that Mogul Ireland is held accountable under clause K of the mining lease, that a temporary solution is put in place as soon as possible and that a commitment is given to me and to the community that the matter will be vigorously pursued and expedited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. J. Browne Mr. J. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Meara for raising the issue. As she said, I previously dealt with this important subject in the House on 9 April. It may be useful to summarise the main issues covered at the time.</P>
      <P>Silvermines has a long history of mining, spanning more than 1,000 years. While mining was economically beneficial to the locality, it has left its mark on the environment, including old spoil dumps, mineshafts and derelict buildings left behind after mining activities ceased.</P>
      <P>A report of an inter-agency investigation into the presence and influence of lead in Silvermines was published in June 2000. Some 36 of the inter-agency's 39 recommendations have been implemented or are ongoing. Acting on one of the recommendations, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources appointed SRK Consulting to carry out an integrated study of the remediation and management needs of the entire area.</P>
      <P>One of the problem areas is Gortmore tailings dam, which was owned and managed by Mogul Ireland under a state mining lease which expired in December 1998. The Department was legally advised that under clause K of the mining lease issued to Mogul there is a once off call on the lessee to remediate former mined sites at Silvermines. Mogul is responsible for about 50% of the sites; the other 50% were mined under private leases which have ceased and for which no responsibility can be attached to the former operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Mogul, notice of the remedial works the company is required to carry out was <Col N="534" />served by the Chief State Solicitor's Office on 10 April last. Mogul responded in a positive way on 22 April. The CSSO wrote again to the operator on 5 June seeking details of specific proposals and timescales for undertaking and completion of rehabilitation works. The company sent a detailed response on 18 June indicating its willingness to carry out rehabilitation works subject to constraints imposed by finance, access and permitting. Mogul points out that these constraints can present formidable and time consuming problems. Its response is being considered in consultation with the CSSO.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards meeting their obligations under clause K of its mining lease, Mogul lodged a revised experimental proposal for rehabilitation of Gortmore TMF with North Tipperary County Council in August 2003. This plan was not accepted by the local authority, and is being reviewed and amended as necessary by Mogul's specialist adviser. The Department and the EPA are also involved in assessing the plan.</P>
    <P>Gortmore is now in private ownership and any remediation proposals will require the owner's permission as well as local community agreement. This is also a feature of the other sites. Mogul is also working on preparation of remediation plans for other areas at Garryard tailings lagoon-settlement pond and Shalee south-east complex.</P>
    <P>There are no immediate proposals to address the remediation of sites outside the clause K areas. This Department has neither the resources nor the legal powers to carry out these works. It seems likely that legislation will be required to fund and enable a designated State agency to carry out the works. In the meantime, we will continue to work with Mogul, the local authority and the EPA in dealing with the clause K sites, and specifically the Gortmore site, which is the source of most public complaint. It should be noted that some members of the local community have expressed serious reservations about SRK's proposals for remediation of Gortmore.</P>
    <P>There is no quick fix solution to the problems at Silvermines. We are talking about an area of 2,300 hectares or nearly 5,800 acres, and there are complex issues such as funding, land ownership, local authority permitting, preservation of mine heritage and local community consultation to be addressed before any environmentally sound and cost effective solutions can be implemented.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see more specific timescales firmed up for proposed remediation proposals. To that end, the Department's exploration and mining division met the county manager of North Tipperary County Council on 15 October last with a view to updating of respective positions and clarifying the road map for achieving progress. A meeting will be held with Mogul early next month, after which it should be possible to agree more specific timescales for progressing the rehabilitation proposals, in co-ordination with the <Col N="535" />local authority, the EPA and Mogul. As I said already, the issue of which agency will provide the necessary expertise and funding to deal with the other sites needs to be decided. Legislation will probably be necessary.</P>

It is not a quick fix solution by any means but the work is done, with &euro;420,000 spent in drawing up that remediation plan. What plans, if any, are under way to draw up that legislation?
