      <P>I have received notice from Senator McHugh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to address as a matter of urgency the nine day ruling regarding whitefish which is causing deep felt annoyance to the fishermen of Greencastle, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Brian Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement concerning his plans to establish a juvenile detention centre on the green belt lands which separate Clondalkin from Tallaght.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reasons for the delay in the occupation of the new wing of James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown; the security in place at the hospital; if such security has been discussed and agreed with the Psychiatric Nurses Association; and whether it is considered adequate to meet the needs of hospital staff.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>I have no objection, in principle, to the Order of Business as proposed by the Leader of the House. I wish to raise two issues. The Leader is probably aware that last week <Col N="146" />there were leaks in the newspapers concerning a Government appointed commission on the health issue, chaired by Professor Niamh Brennan. Within its report very radical changes are set out concerning the management of the health service. It seems that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has won out against the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in regard to the need for changes in the management structure under one umbrella and a way in which to deliver a health service that is cost-efficient but effective. I ask for an opportunity to debate in the House the report when published. Excellent reports like this are sometimes left on a shelf and never debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas. When published, perhaps the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance will come to the House to debate the issue because it is important to review strategies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who spends a great deal of his time involved in negotiations, I have always felt that timing is important. I would appreciate if the Leader could convey her personal congratulations to the leader of the Fine Gael Party in this House on his extraordinarily excellent timing in tabling the motion on Con<Col N="147" />nacht rugby last week rather than this week. The choice of motion was courageous and effective. I congratulate my Fine Gael colleagues and I welcome the fact that the motion received all-party support. Given that Fine Gael was so successful with its motion regarding Connacht rugby, may I ask it to turn its attention to solving the problems in Iraq?</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes mentioned the health report, which will have implications for taxpayers and the health services. I firmly believe that the publication of the report will be the biggest news story of the year and I appeal to Members on all sides to address the matter in a non-party political way. The report's recommendations will be revolutionary and a fresh and creative approach will be needed if they are going to work. I am concerned that politicians on all sides will dig in to protect structures that we have criticised for so long. We need to operate creatively and differently as we move forward and nobody should be allowed to speak in partisan terms on this issue. Perhaps the House will need to invite people other than the two Ministers to speak here. I suggest that officials from the commission be invited to address the issue.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on a new national pay agreement are close to a conclusion. It would be appropriate to debate this matter in the House, even before the deal is adopted or otherwise. Some things remain to be done and people have an opportunity to be creative at a time when the country faces economic and financial difficulties. I would welcome a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>I would also like to bring to the attention of the House, in deference to the conscience of those who feel it is beyond them to accept the rate they are offered for their jobs, the fact the legislation was amended some years ago to allow people to opt out of the benchmarking awards they are offered. Those who feel they are not entitled to accept, do not want to accept or cannot accept the pay awards that will flow to them from the benchmarking agreement can be at ease. I appreciate that Members are entitled to say that they do not agree with pay awards, but on the next occasion they make such criticisms it would be helpful if they would also make clear that they do not intend to accept them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that nobody, including people in this House and the Lower House whose jobs were thoroughly analysed and scrutinised, will receive more than they deserve from benchmarking. I would like to place these matters on the record as it is helpful for the House to be aware of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the intervention of Fine Gael in the Connacht rugby affair, I have never doubted the affinity and deep knowledge of members of that party, particularly Senator Brian <Col N="148" />Hayes, in relation to garrison games and related issues. The class base of rugby in Ireland is an issue that needs to be discussed, but the fact that the game is becoming more popular in Connacht is helpful and might help to change its image among the working classes of Dublin and other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>One will travel far and wide before finding a Christian Brothers school where rugby is played. That is the bottom line.</P>
      <P>I was interested to see the coverage in recent days of the Kyoto Protocol, which is about to enter into force following its ratification by the Russian Federation. It seems to have suddenly struck the Government that this is a very serious issue that could have serious implications for our economy and the fiscal position of the country in years to come due to the potential for serious fines if we fail to meet our international obligations. However, it has been clear for some time now that as matters stand, we have no chance at all of meeting our international obligations. This is a train which is coming down the tracks towards us at great speed.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that Ministers seem to have only now become aware of it because the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have been aware for some time now of what is approaching and have done their level best to ensure at least one measure &ndash; to which, in theory, the Government is committed, namely, the introduction of carbon energy taxes &ndash; goes no further. This is the sort of matter the Seanad could usefully debate because it will be around for the next two or three years but nonetheless requires urgent measures from the Government. It also requires action from society in general, for example, from industry and those who provide energy. I ask that provision be made for a debate on the issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad and I express our deepest sympathy to President George W. Bush of the United States of America, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and, especially, the families and loved ones of the seven astronauts on board the shuttle, <i>Columbia</i>, who perished on Saturday, 1 February. The seven astronauts who perished were commander Rick Husband; pilot William McCool; payload commander Michael Anderson; Kaplana Chawla from India; Ilan Ramon from Israel; Dr. David Brown, navy captain pilot; and surgeon Laurel <Col N="149" />Clark. We wish to convey through the acting American ambassador in Dublin our deepest and heartfelt sadness at this major tragedy for NASA and the USA. We all share in our expression of sympathy to the families involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to come before the House as a matter of urgency to discuss the review of the education network prepared by the Centre of Management and Organisation Development which recommends the closure of nine part-time education centres and three full-time centres? This will have a massive effect on some 3,900 schools, both primary and post-primary, and is certainly a retrograde step. It is a further example of severe cutbacks in education by the Government. Carlow in my constituency will have no part-time education centre and Kildare education centre will be closed while the Kilkenny centre will no longer be full time. This will have a severe effect on the south east.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arts Council's five year plan was accepted by the Government but at the end of the year its funding was cut dramatically with the result that now there is a large shortfall in the money it can offer to performing companies. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to come into the House to discuss the matter? In various areas, the resurgence of festivals and arts programmes has been extremely important for tourism, not just the local population. We need to address this issue before we enter the summer tourist season when the really serious effects of companies' not giving performances will be felt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh" hpid="Mr. McHugh Mr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I welcome the announcements about the CLÁR programme, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to come into the House for a discussion, as was done last year, because there is a feeling among community groups nationally that there is no transparent mechanism for obtaining funding from the programme. This is quite a worry, especially as it as one of the briefs for which the Government has money to spend. We need transparency. Will the Leader reinvite the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to ask him what mechanism he proposes for the transparent drawing down of funding?</P>
      <P>If there is no confidence in the CLÁR programme, it will have a knock-on effect on the INTERREG IIIA programme. The Minister has responsibility for a sum of &euro;9.59 million for priority 3 of that programme but if there is no confidence in the CLÁR draw-down, there will be a deterioration of confidence in the INTERREG IIIA programme. Will the Leader use her influence to bring the Minister to the House to discuss the matter?</P>

      <P>I join previous speakers in congratulating the IRFU on its decision. I also congratulate Members on the Government side of the House for the clarity and sense of depth they brought to the debate on the issue last week which, I hope, brought about that decision.</P>
      <P>With regard to mutterings from Montenotte, I rather think they came from Mayfield &ndash; my address is Montenotte, about which let us be quite clear.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan" hpid="Mr. Minihan Mr. Minihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider having a debate on planning, a matter we raised on a number of occasions in the last session? Many Senators and I share the belief that we should have such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Minihan in his request for a debate on planning, particularly in relation to lap-dancing clubs and bars. It is a serious problem which is not at all funny. There is gross exploitation of women. I wonder what kinds of middle-class idiotic judges are handing out these permissions for areas in which they do not live. On O'Connell Street there are supermarkets licensed to sell trays of beer to louts at all hours of the day and night. This is a serious issue which we should debate in the House.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader confirm that it is her intention to have statements on Iraq on Thursday? If that is the case, I welcome it. Last week we referred to the &ldquo;Marian Finucane Show&rdquo; radio programme in the context of RTÉ's extraordinary attitudes. A statement on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; that a shelter in Baghdad was attacked by a &ldquo;barrack-buster&rdquo; bomb and that &ldquo;some civilians were injured&rdquo; went totally unchallenged. In fact, 400 civilians were killed. This morning there was an extraordinarily aggressive interview with Deputy Sargent on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; which put any interview with the IRA or Sinn Féin in a mealy-mouthed context. Will the Leader inquire as to whether pressure has been applied on the Government by the United States or any of its agencies and if this is being passed on by the Government to RTÉ in order that we know of this in advance of the debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. P. Burke Mr. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on the shortages of electricity supply? I understand that last week we were within hours of a complete blackout. If this was to happen, it would take nine days to restore the country to full power. This is a matter of great urgency and concern on which we should have a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask for a debate with the Tánaiste to find out what the Government is doing to ensure we have a competitive workforce? There is no point in just being shocked or <Col N="151" />disappointed at factory closures. We need investment in skills, education, training and research and development but the opposite is happening through cutbacks in third level education and research and development. It is a wrong move. Job creation is not just about tax measures.</P>
      <P>The only State-funded organic agricultural college has today been threatened with closure. That would be a short-sighted decision in a sector which is increasingly important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the breaches of security that led to attacks on aeroplanes at Shannon. The sensitivities of people regarding Shannon as a location for the landing of military aircraft have been known for many years and, therefore, I am amazed that the Government has been so slow to put in place proper security measures at the airport. It does not require a Cabinet decision to decide whether the Army should move in. I am extremely concerned that the way these attacks are portrayed in America may not result in a positive image of Ireland's position on this issue. I hope the Government will move in haste and resolve the security problem at Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that it is the European Year of the Disabled, I request that the Leader address the issue of the disabled person's grant with the relevant Ministers. Part of the problem is that two Ministers, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who administers the scheme, and the Minister for Health and Children, who determines qualification for it, are involved. As a result of cutbacks in local government funding in north Tipperary, the scheme has been frozen. No applications are being taken and this is sending a message to the old and disabled that they should not live in north Tipperary under the current Government.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader engage the Minister for Health and Children in a discussion with people and communities that are providing a tremendous service looking after the mentally disabled? I include in this the St. Anne's Centre, which has made it clear that cutbacks will leave it with no option but to discharge the people in need of care. These individuals will have to be discharged because there is no one to look after them. Unless funding is made available, we will face a serious crisis which will reflect poorly on us as we celebrate the European Year of the Disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins" hpid="Mr. Cummins Mr. Cummins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I raised the question of security and the lack of resources for the Garda in view of the circumstances in Limerick. I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House to offer an explanation. The Government is soft on crime and there is no question that the provision of resources to the Garda has not been forthcoming, despite all the pious words we heard prior to and after the election. In view of the fact that the <Col N="152" />Army has to be called in to secure Shannon Airport, one wonders about the security implications for other airports.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's call for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to come before the House to explain the savage cuts of, in some instances, over 20%, and 50% in the arts budget in respect of programming grants. It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Tuffy in calling for a debate on the efforts to close down the organic farm in Athenry. Teagasc has many questions to answer on this issue because it is discriminating against Athenry in the same way that the IRFU tried to discriminate against Connacht rugby. I hope we will have the opportunity to discuss that issue and fight for Athenry organic farm, which is the only State-funded college farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the serious breaches of security at Shannon Airport, will the Leader tell us how many penalty points Deputy Brennan has incurred as Minister for Transport? On a more serious note, we all support the right to peaceful protest but none of us condones the wanton acts of vandalism that have occurred at the airport. I fully support the remarks of my colleague Senator Finucane in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I also deplore acts of vandalism and every effort must be made to prevent them. I dissent from the view that this can only be done by an army. I have lived too long with circumstances in which soldiers are asked to do the jobs of policemen when the only thing a soldier has that a policeman does not is a gun. Do people want them to use guns? The police have far better powers at their disposal and as this is a police matter. The Garda Síochána should be given the resources it needs or made to use the resources it possesses. My experience of police forces is that it does not make as much use of its resources as it might. This is a policing matter and it would be profoundly wrong, from a political perspective, to turn it into a military one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes, the leader of Fine Gael and of the Opposition, raised the matter of the Brennan report and the need to invite the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance to discuss it in the House. The report has not yet been formally issued, although I am sure the leaks are inspired and correct. That is usually the case. Senator O'Toole speaks as one who appears to have prior knowledge of the contents of the report, which may have been discussed at the partnership negotiations. He says there is a need for everyone to be creative, in which regard he is correct. We must put aside our in-built notions of what has sufficed for 30 years, but may no longer do so, particularly in the realm of health boards and other institutional matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am reminded by Senator Feeney that the task force on health, chaired by Mr. Hanly, is due to <Col N="153" />complete its work in the coming weeks. I hope, as is sensible, that we will be able to debate both reports at the same time.</P>
    <P>Senator Feeney and others welcomed developments with regard to Connacht rugby. We are delighted at the quick response to the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil motion in the House last week. Senator O'Toole wishes to have his thanks conveyed to Fine Gael on this matter, which is something he can do himself.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole also referred to the need for a debate on partnership and said that if any one of us does not want the money, we should say so and forgo it. There is legislation which permits one to refuse the money one has been granted. I have not yet met anyone as noble as that, but perhaps I will do so before the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with what Senator McDowell said about rugby. He was very dismissive of the game, which is played by 45 second level schools of all types in Connacht. It is played in vocational schools, community schools, comprehensive schools and secondary schools and the young people involved aspire to represent their province. It is not good enough to dismiss them in the manner used by Senator McDowell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <Col N="154" />Senator Henry referred to the five year arts plan and requested that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism come before the House. I agree with her in this regard. One wonders if there should not be a long-term debate on these matters and, in particular, on the question of funding. When money is abundant, it is spent, and when it is not, many of the groups involved in the arts must suspend their operations and are unable to continue their work. It means many arts groups are unable to continue their work.</P>
    <P>Senator McHugh asked the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to attend the House to debate the future of the CLÁR programme, especially given the implications for the credibility of the INTERREG IIIA programme.

    <P>Senator Tuffy asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend the House to explain what was being done to ensure the workforce remained competitive. The Minister will attend the House tomorrow to debate the Second Stage of the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill. <Col N="155" />The Senator referred to the attempts to close the organic farm at Athenry, which matter is under the remit of the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane referred to the dilatory approach by the Government to security at Shannon Airport and the image it portrays in the United States. There are two separate issues.

    <P>Senator Cummins expressed concern about the security situation in Limerick and the lack of resources for the Garda Síochána and requested the attendance of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to debate the issue. The Minister is due to attend the House later today to debate Report Stage of the Immigration Bill. I will arrange for him or a Minister of State to attend an open debate on justice matters which, I hope, will also include a questions and answers session. Senator Cummins also requested the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to attend the House to debate what was happening to the arts.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt also referred to the attempts to close the organic farm at Athenry. A debate should be held on the matter, especially as I understand it is the only research organic farm in the country. It would be regrettable if it was to close.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan expressed his disagreement with the vandalism carried out at Shannon Airport. I do not think any of us would agree with vandalism <i>per se.</i> It is wrong, especially when members of the Garda Síochána are challenged and attacked.</P>

The Leader has just seconded a proposal by Senator Leyden who listed the names of the unfortunate astronauts who were killed. We must be careful about setting a precedent. It would be very easy for Senator Norris, for example, to read the names of the 400 people killed in Baghdad. While Senator Leyden's action <Col N="156" />may be well intentioned, it is inappropriate and could set a precedent which could go out of control. If Members wish to convey their views, they should do so.

      <P>In page 3, line 12, to delete &lsquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;carrier&rdquo;&nbsp;' and substitute &lsquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;carriers of passengers&rdquo;&nbsp;'.</P>
      <P>I ask for the Minister's advice on this matter. As the Bill stands, I understand it will apply to those who carry goods as well as passengers. Carriers of goods who unknowingly or unwittingly carry passengers are already covered by the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 which allows for the imposition of a fine on such carriers. Should we not therefore confine the effect of this Bill to carriers of passengers only, not to carriers of freight? The term &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; includes carriers of freight who are already covered by the previous legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the carrier liability provisions in the Bill is quite straightforward. Carriers which bring non-national passengers into the State should satisfy themselves that those passengers have with them the appropriate documentation to allow them to disembark at their destination &ndash; be it a port or airport &ndash; in accordance with Irish immigration requirements. For that to work in a sensible practical way, it has to apply to every vehicle arriving in the State from outside the common travel area and, accordingly, it has to apply to the persons responsible for every such vehicle. The Bill, as it stands and subject to the right of the House to <Col N="157" />amend it, carefully defines a &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; in an inclusive all encompassing way.</P>
      <P>I do not believe Senator Terry's amendment would add anything helpful to the definition. For example, if I travel alone in a camper van, commercial truck or minibus from France to Rosslare, no issues arise for me under the carrier liability provisions. If, on the other hand, I travel the same route with passengers, there may be issues under this legislation but the immigration officer will not know whether I am alone or whether I have passengers, nor can he tell what is the situation even if the vehicle is not designed for passengers or if it is not customarily used for carrying paying passengers.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind the proposed use of the term &ldquo;carriers of passengers&rdquo;, as suggested by Deputy Terry's amendment, appears to be a desire to confine the scope of the carrier liability provisions to commercial passenger carriers, airlines, ferries and bus companies only. However, it ignores the practicality that unless the term &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; applies universally to all arrivals in the State, private and commercial, designed for passengers or cargo only, or for both, the scheme simply will not work. A definition of the sort proposed in the amendment, in attempting to exempt the driver of a private car, actually provides a coach and four, if I may mix metaphors, for the smart and unscrupulous operator to find a way to circumvent the law.</P>
      <P>It is not as if the Bill would place an unbearable burden on the operator of a private vehicle. It is only common sense that a driver should know who is in his or her car and check before embarking on the journey that everybody has their passports. In the example of the Rosslare-Cherbourg ferry, the term &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; has two meanings in that context. If the carrier is the master of the ship in one sense and also the driver of a vehicle that goes on to the ship in another sense both are encompassed within the definition. In order to get on the Rosslare-Cherbourg ferry at Cherbourg, for example, one will have to satisfy the owners of the boat or the master of the boat that one is documented. It will not be a problem for somebody who is driving their family or driving a group of friends onto a boat in a car because the ferry owner will be caught by this legislation and will not allow undocumented passengers onto the boat.</P>
      <P>If I was to say that, in this context, a carrier should be defined as a &ldquo;carrier of passengers&rdquo;, it could be implied that if one is driving a vehicle not adapted for passengers, they are somehow outside the category. The only sense of such an amendment would be to put the carrier &ndash; the owner of a lorry, camper, caravan or whatever &ndash; at a disadvantage in so far as there were unknown passengers on their vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make the law operable. If somebody is travelling in a vehicle unknown to its owner and the owner could not, with reasonable care, know they were on board, no crime will be com<Col N="158" />mitted. However, if I say that the Act does not apply to somebody, for example, towing a caravan or a similar vehicle and have a definition that excludes them from the operation, the result will be that a clandestinely smuggled people or stowaways coming through the system will somehow be exempt if they travel in vehicles that are not covered by the Act. The target of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act is those who knowingly, and for gain, smuggle people into the State. It has potentially very severe penalties for those who do so with bad mind.</P>
    <P>This Bill has a much lesser aim &ndash; simply to create an incentive for those in charge of those travelling into the State in vehicles that they do not have on board people who should not be on board and that they check the documentation of those they know are on board. It will not be an additional imposition for somebody driving a jeep on to the ferry at Cherbourg with four golfing buddies, to take a practical example, because the ferry company will check them out anyway. If somebody is rolled up in a sleeping bag at the back of a vehicle, if somebody gets on to a vehicle in breach of the carrier's duty of care or if there is a container load of people at the back of a vehicle, the person driving the vehicle will commit an offence if they do not take reasonable care to ensure their vehicle is not being used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Senator's amendment does not add anything on a positive side. On a negative side, it has the potential to create a huge loophole through which virtually everybody who wants to get into the State would travel as a clandestine immigrant.</P>

      <P>The reason we propose the insertion of the words &ldquo;if required to do so by such directions (if any)&rdquo; is that we believe the drafting of this section is defective and we intend to achieve clarity with our amendment.

      <P>The amendment would insert in page 4, line 25, after the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;if required to do so by such directions (if any)&rdquo;. It would then read that the carrier concerned shall ensure that all persons on board the vehicle seeking to land in the State or to pass through a port in the State in order to travel to another state disembark in compliance with any direction given by immigration officers if <Col N="159" />required to do so by such directions, if any. That would be an omelette. The Senator has come forward with many useful amendments and I accepted a number of them on the last occasion. Some, indeed, tidied up and removed mistakes and drafting errors but to accept this amendment would be to insert a drafting error because it would make it almost unintelligible and would not add anything to the meaning of the section.</P>

      <P>In page 4, after line 46, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) This section shall not apply to an alleged contravention by a person who arrives in the State having a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her country of nationality, or (in the case of a Stateless person) habitual residence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill should not be a measure which will prevent people entitled to asylum coming to this State at risk to their lives and force them into alternative arrangements which are dangerous. It is important to add this subsection. It does not, in any way, dilute the measures the Minister wishes to introduce, but if the person were found to be a refugee the carrier would be exempt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment. Although I understand the intention behind it, which is to exempt those entitled to protection under the 1951 Act from the operation of the Bill, it would be unworkable. It would not be possible to determine at the point where a carrier had committed an offence under the subsection whether the person in question was or was not a person having a well-founded fear of persecution. Take the case of someone who arrives at a check-in desk at Orly Airport or the ferry terminus at Cherbourg and presents to a carrier for carriage to Ireland. If the subsection was applied, it would mean it would be lawful for the carrier to carry the person to Ireland if the carrier believed that, notwithstanding the fact that he or she had no documents, visa or legal entitlement to come to Ireland, the person was a genuine refugee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would happen at the check-in desk at Orly Airport or Amsterdam Airport where someone was standing at the head of a queue and was asked for a ticket and passport and a Nigerian passport was produced but there was no Irish visa? The Aer Lingus, Air France or Ryanair employee would say the person did not have documents for Ireland and could not be carried on the airline. The passenger would say he or she <Col N="160" />intended claiming refugee status there and the carrier would tell the person he or she could get on the aeroplane because with this section the carrier would not be committing an offence under Irish law. It would mean that anyone could pass through any checkpoint by asserting that they intended coming to Ireland to claim asylum. Only fools would queue with genuine documentation if by repetition of the verbal formula &ldquo;I am on my way to Ireland to claim asylum&rdquo; one could walk up the gangway on to the aeroplane or boat. That effectively is what I am being asked to do. If carriers had to satisfy themselves at the airport that the person was liable to be persecuted and carry out a mini inquiry at the harbour wall in Cherbourg or in the middle of the airport in Paris to find out if this was true, we would be turning check-in employees at ticket counters into immigration officers for the Irish State.</P>
    <P>The process implied in the amendment is not acceptable. I cannot accept the amendment as it would tear up the Bill. There would be no point in having it if it was to apply to anyone claiming to be a refugee. He or she would walk on to the aeroplane without any determination being made of whether he or she was a refugee and become our problem here.</P>
    <P>As an earnest of the Government's commitment to the full expression of the policy, I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage, now section 2(9), which addresses in statutory form the undoubted assertion by opponents of the Bill that it will compromise our obligation under the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees and its related protocol, the 1967 New York Protocol.</P>
    <P>Although unnecessary from a strictly legal point of view, the section puts the issue beyond doubt. I refer Senators to section 2(9) which states:</P>
    <P>This section is without prejudice to the provisions of sections 8, 9 and 24 of the Refugee Act 1996 and to the discretion of the Minister to admit to the State a person whom the Minister considers to be in need of the protection of the State.</P>
    <P>That is as far as I can go to meet the point, otherwise I might as well have no carrier liability. As I said on Committee Stage, Ireland is the only state within the European Union which does not have carrier liability. That is not a choice which is even open to us because we are required by European law to introduce a system of carrier liability. We cannot introduce a system which has virtually no meaning. If the amendment was to succeed, this provision would cease to have any meaning and become just a licence for anybody to get on an aeroplane and come to Ireland. It would worsen the situation rather than improve it.</P>

      <P>Having raised this matter with the Minister at an earlier meeting, I am now asking him to tighten up the provision thus making it imperative that guidelines would be drawn up. Section 2(8) should state &ldquo;the Minister shall draw up and publish guidelines .&rdquo;. If we leave it as suggested, that &ldquo;the Minister may from time to time draw up and publish guidelines .&rdquo;, it will be far too loose. For that reason I am seeking the new wording using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. To compensate for this, I have tabled amendment No. 5 which seeks to have the Bill reviewed annually. That would make it absolutely clear that the guidelines would be drawn up and that they would be reviewed on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I second these amendments. The Minister should be obliged to publish guidelines because the Bill places a substantial obligation on carriers to which it will be difficult for them to adjust. It is important to state clearly what they will have to do. In addition, the guidelines should be reviewed regularly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the amendment because it would introduce an absolute requirement on me to draw up and publish guidelines on a mandatory basis, instead of stating I should do so &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;. If the amendments were agreed to, the subsection would then state, &ldquo;The Minister shall draw up and publish guidelines concerning steps to be taken by carriers to ensure compliance by them with this Act to be reviewed annually.&rdquo; First, I need more flexibility than that and, second, the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo;, which it is proposed to delete, is designed to give me that flexibility. Under the terms of the Senator's amendments, if I noticed a mistake in the guidelines or an inadequate provision which could lead to undesired or unfair results, I would have to wait for an annual review before I could change it. The proposed text allows me to do so &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; as the occasion arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Government anticipates it will have the co-operation of commercial carriers &ndash; that is the essence of the Bill &ndash; it simply would not make sense for the Minister of the day not to issue guidelines to assist carriers as regards what they should or should not do in order to comply with the requirements of the Bill. For instance, the guidelines may cover what was or was not <Col N="162" />adequate documentation, or what documentation might be sought.</P>
    <P>The guidelines will be of assistance and I submit that the current formula is preferable because it is flexible and allows them to be altered from time to time. The implicit justification for the amendment, that the Minister of the day would try to operate the system without guidelines for any substantial period, is an unlikely scenario. There is no reason the Minister would not be attracted to issuing guidelines to secure maximum co-operation from the carriers.</P>
    <P>A voluntary code of practice for the haulage industry was agreed in 2001. This encourages best practice by hauliers to prevent illegal immigrants entering a state hidden in vehicles. That followed discussions involving the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Public Enterprise, the Garda national emigration bureau and the Irish Road Hauliers Association. The Immigration Bill 2002 provides that hauliers may be prosecuted if they are responsible for bringing people into a country with inadequate immigration documentation. There have been discussions between the Department and the IRHA with regard to this legislation. Informal guidelines are already in place and I ask the Senator to accept that including a mandatory provision such as this will only complicate life. For example, if it transpires that a guideline, for whatever reason, is undesirable, should the Act fall into abeyance between a problem arising, on one hand, and it being solved by further guidelines, on the other? There would be a free for all in the period during which I tried to deal with a problem that had already arisen in respect of one guideline, which I wanted to withdraw and replace.</P>

    <P>My colleagues and I do not disagree with the need for penalties for employers who employ illegal immigrants. However, the penalties in paragraph (<i>b</i>) are over the top. I already raised with the Minister about the need to reform the system so that there is provision for asylum seek<Col N="163" />ers to work after a reasonable period and that there should be a proper green card system in place. I notice the Tánaiste is making adjustments to the work permit system. This is a case of crisis management instead of having an overall coherent system to deal with the employment of non-nationals.</P>
    <P>While I agree there should be penalties, the penalty included in the legislation does not recognise the spirit in which people employ non-nationals. I have given an example of Irish people who have been employed illegally in other countries. As it might not be a case of an employer setting out to exploit a non-national worker, this section should be reconsidered. I ask the Minister to explain how the Government will rectify the problems to which I have referred.</P>

The points made by the Senator could be countered by recognising that the prescribed ten years or &euro;250,000 do not exceed the particular penalties. This leaves it open to judicial discretion, which is the correct way to approach the issue.</P>
      <P>There could be a fairly serious breach of the provisions of the Bill and arguments have been made that many people have profited by employing non-nationals. There is anecdotal evidence that employers may be currently employing non-nationals under permit where national workers are available. This would obviously put them in a position where they would be making substantial profits. The penalties would need to be set at a level which would act as a deterrent and be commensurate with the offence if it was a very serious breach of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to put the position of an <Col N="164" />employer who employs someone unlawfully without a work permit on exactly the same basis in terms of potential punishment as an employee who works illegally without such a permit. It would prevent any of these offences from being tried on indictment, in the case of an employer, and it would limit the maximum fine that could be imposed on, for example, a company to &euro;3,000.</P>
      <P>There is a radical distinction between the position of an employer who knowingly employs someone in breach of the law, potentially speaking, and that of an employee. I will give the Senator an example. First, there is a possibility that a sizeable corporation would deliberately decide to employ someone on a substantial salary, perhaps &euro;200,000 per annum, knowing that it cannot be sent to jail and the most it can suffer, if discovered, is to pay a &euro;3,000 penalty. To fix that as the maximum penalty in those circumstances would be to make a mockery of the law.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Senator expressed the view that the possibility of trial on indictment for employers is over the top. I could imagine a set of circumstances where it would come to light that an employer in, for example, the horticultural area or in mushroom production &ndash; I am not pointing the finger at particular areas of business &ndash; would decide to employ illegal immigrants at knock-down wages and threaten that they would be exposed to the Garda national immigration bureau if they did not behave and continue to work. When negotiations about conditions of work took place, the employers would be able to use the constant threat that the type of employees to whom I refer could face deportation if they did not behave and continue to work in exploitative circumstances. This may not be something that happens every day &ndash; I hope it does not happen at all in future &ndash; but, in light of human nature, the situation of an employee who is working illegally is essentially vulnerable.</P>
      <P>The situation of an employer who consciously takes on employees in these circumstances is essentially one of temptation to exploit the illegal status of those employees. I am saying, by way of two examples, that a conscious and deliberate violation by a corporation, which might not even be physically located in this country, to employ someone here in breach of the work permit law should be capable of being visited with more than a &euro;3,000 penalty. In the final analysis, we could be referring to people whose salaries amount to ten or 20 times that amount in a given year and for whom there would be no deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I do not doubt that the fact that people are smuggled into Ireland in the backs of containers, to be exploited for many months or years, will come to light in the fullness of time. Such people may almost become slaves as a result of being exploited by ruthless employers. Therefore, a fine of &euro;3,000 for a body corporate found to have been involved in such exploitation would be a laughable deterrent. It would not be a suitable punishment for those who have perpetuated such <Col N="165" />iniquity. A receiver of stolen property is often more guilty than a thief, as a thief would not steal if he or she was not confident of a ready market for his or her stolen goods. Similarly, those proffering themselves as illegal employees appeal, in effect, to the worst instincts in employers. I refer to employers who know that persons are here illegally and not entitled to work but employ such persons nonetheless.</P>
    <P>Senators may point to illegal employees who persuade employers to take them on in casual employment, against employers' better judgment, for example, in circumstances which would not lead to much moral guilt on the part of employers. I can imagine such circumstances but the House should bear in mind that this will be a triable offence when the Bill is enacted. It is fanciful to think that anybody would be put through the ordeal of a trial by jury or exposed to harsher penalties in such circumstances as the Director of Public Prosecutions would, in his wisdom, opt for summary trial and the lesser penalties provided.</P>
    <P>The Senator will, on reflection, take a certain view of the potential culpability of an employer who employed many employees in circumstances of grave exploitation. Employers may be tempted to deliberately breach the law if they knew that the only summary penalty capable of being imposed by a District Court was a fine of &euro;3,000. I am sticking by the severe penalties, where the offence is prosecuted on indictment, provided for in the Bill. I want Irish companies to understand they should never knowingly employ somebody who is not authorised to work in the State as to do so would be to commit an offence. Employers should be aware that in certain circumstances, if the subtending facts of the case are serious enough, they will be subjected to a serious prosecution and expose themselves to very serious penalties.</P>

      <P>My party has brought forward this amendment in an attempt to change the period of time allowed for the submission of a contact address from five working days to 25.

      <P>I oppose this amendment which relates to the period of time given to applicants for asylum status to notify the Refugee Applications Commissioner of a permanent address where he or she can be contacted, for example, if notices need to be sent out. If I accede to the amendment and it is accepted by the House, applicants will have 25 working days &ndash; five full weeks, or over one month &ndash; in which to provide the information. Somebody who comes to the State will have over one month in which to log on, if I may use that phrase, to the refugee applications system. Such a situation would be unacceptable as it could mean that we would have a large floating population whose address for the purpose of serving notices would be unknown.</P>
      <P>People may want to change their address from time to time but the Reception and Integration Agency provides all asylum seekers with accommodation, upon request. Therefore, there is no basis on which somebody could be without an address. An applicant might move from one place to another, within the direct provision system, and might, therefore, have some time to log on to the system between two addresses. Given that everybody is offered accommodation by the RIA, the system provided for in the Bill, whereby applicants must provide within one week an address to which subsequent documentation such as notices of interviews or other meetings related to applications can be sent and will be capable of being received, is not particularly strict. Acceptance of the amendment would simply create another dysfunctional area in the system as it would provide for a time period during which people would be at large and nobody would know where they were. As there is no good reason for such problems, I am strongly opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>This section of the Bill gives persons who do not show up for a meeting with the commissioner three working days to explain the reasons for their non-attendance. If the amendment is accepted, however, such people will have 21 working days to provide an explanation. I wish to change the rule under which a person who does not show up for an interview is not entitled to a second interview. Three working days is too short a time for applicants to take the initiative to provide an explanation. A period of 21 days would be far more reasonable. Similarly, the applicant should be allowed a reasonable period of time to provide an explanation for non-attendance without his or her application being withdrawn.

      <P>This amendment, like the previous amendment, proposes to extend the length of time to 21 days, which could be four working weeks. Given that we are surely not expecting people to make excuses about Saturdays and Sundays, I take it the Senator means four working weeks. Again, I cannot understand why somebody would have to wait that length of time to furnish an excuse. If the person is invoking asylum status from the State, the onus should be on him or her to give the required information as speedily as possible. The provision also places an onus on the State to accept a reason within three days. The provisions in the Bill, in contrast to what Senator Tuffy is trying to achieve, are intended to shorten the period in which this process is completed. I ask her to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Morrissey. I explained to the House on Committee Stage that in order for an interview to be conducted, a series of events must happen: first, the officer conducting the interview must arrange, in many cases, for an interpreter to be present; second, in most cases, lawyers, or at any rate one lawyer, may be in attendance; and third, the would-be asylum seeker will have to be satisfied that someone has read his or her file in advance and is familiar with its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The officer will need to have investigated the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the country of origin. For example, he or she may have done some research on whether the state in question is one in which the type of persecution in question has happened, is still happening or is likely to recur. In addition, a number of hours will normally be set aside for such an asylum seeker to be interviewed. We are, <Col N="168" />therefore, discussing a significant commitment of State resources.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that somebody may indicate, at any time before an interview and for a good reason, that he or she cannot attend. In those circumstances, non-attendance will not result in a withdrawal of the application for asylum. Somebody who misses the interview may contact the commissioner and outline the reason for their absence within the following three working days. The latter period excludes weekends. He or she can even arrange for another person to do that on his or her behalf. The person in question may explain, for example, that his or her brother or sister or good friend from Nigeria missed their interview for a good reason. I refer, for example, to a medical reason which could not have been anticipated or some serious domestic event. In those circumstances, a person's not attending on the relevant day will not be deemed to be a withdrawal of their asylum application.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy is now suggesting that instead of those three days, I should allow 21 working days. This means that an asylum seeker can effectively, and without providing an explanation, avoid meeting the refugee applications commissioner for an entire month. It would still be open to the applicant to return four weeks later and state that they had a reasonable excuse for not attending but that they were not in a position to provide it. This would send out all the wrong signals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Senator to remember that in respect of a process in which at least 90% of people are found not to be refugees, &euro;47 million is being spent annually by the State on processing and related immigration functions. As a Minister with daily expenditure commitments &ndash; many other members of the Government have more heart-rending stories to relate about the resources they need &ndash; I am aware that this money could well be spent on hospitals, education, welfare, etc. The money, by virtue of our obligations under the 1951 convention, is there to fund a super-sophisticated system of asylum applications and appeals.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind that in 999 out of 1000 cases, a refugee has the option of going anywhere else, but if he or she chooses to come to Ireland &ndash; a country that invests a huge amount of resources into giving asylum seekers fair play, makes direct provision for them while their cases are being considered and looks after them and their dependants during that period &ndash; the least he or she could do is co-operate with the system in this one way. He or she is free to either provide notification in advance that he or she will not attend the hearing, for a good reason, or, within a couple of days of the scheduled date, notify the commissioner that his or her non-appearance was for a bona fide reason and that the commissioner was not being made a fool of in terms of arranging this legal panoply to no purpose.</P>
    <P>If I was to give people a month to come up with an excuse, I would be making the system <Col N="169" />unworkable. I made the point on Committee Stage that this is a serious business. Some &euro;300 million is spent in various forms every year as a result of asylum seeking in Ireland. There are moral issues here, but morality does not go all one way. Some people believe they are girded with the garments of rectitude because they publicly stand for the rights of asylum seekers. However, there are other people who are not getting the resources to which I refer because they are being invested in this area.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for saying that if one comes to this country and invokes our asylum law, one must take it seriously, because there are moral considerations at play. People cannot have it both ways. They cannot say that it is a one way street and that all the obligations lie with the State. People who enter the system and who are cavalier about their obligations are free to walk away and leave the financial penalties to be paid by the State.</P>
    <P>I ask Senators to remember that it is not a question of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform being hard-hearted or a skinflint. I am dealing with an area &ndash; this includes the consequences of asylum seeking &ndash; that absorbs &euro;300 million every year. That is a massive sum and there are moral choices involved. As long as that money is not being invested into other areas, many socially deserving projects that Senators would like to see funded will have to go without.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers have a moral and legal duty to co-operate with the State. One of the things that really saddens me is that this year, as a result of financial constraints, although the amount of resources the State invested in overseas development assistance rose substantially it did not rise by the amount we would have wished. Of the sum of &euro;300 million to which I referred, 90% is spent on people who are not entitled to the protection of the State. I often think that if a substantial amount of that went to overseas development assistance, the interests of morality would be better served.</P>
    <P>I ask people who get hot under the collar about the asylum system to think about the moral implications of what is going on. This is not a game of legal cat and mouse. It is a moral issue. These are real resources being diverted away from many deserving causes to this other deserving cause. Those who think it should be open to asylum seekers to come to Ireland and engage with the asylum system as if it were not serious business and there were no implications for the State in terms of resources are short-changing themselves in terms of moral judgment.</P>

      <P>The new duty to co-operate and the provisions for failure to co-operate are vague. There are situations where people could be caught up in unforeseen circumstances which the Minister does not recognise. For example, what would the position be if a person was involved in an accident? They might not be in a position to comply with the provisions under the legislation. There are cavalier people, but there are also those who are not and we must allow for that. In addition to the moral duty of the applicant to co-operate, we have a duty of fairness and a moral obligation to provide for asylum-seekers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a mandate to enact laws only on foot of our position under the Constitution. The first canon of construction of any law promulgated by the President after being passed by these two Houses is that it should be construed in a constitutional way. Throughout the Constitution, from the preamble on, are values of reasonableness, constitutional justice and charity. The fundamental rule of construction in any perusal by any court or an administrator of a law is that they must interpret it in a constitutional way. If they give any Act a construction which flouts people's constitutional rights or is at variance with constitutional values, the courts are there to correct them. In those circumstances, this subsection provides:</P>
      <P>Where&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) it appears to the Commissioner that an applicant is failing in his or her duty to co-operate with the Commissioner or to furnish information relevant to his or her application for declaration, or </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(<i>b</i>) the Minister notifies the Commissioner that he or she is of opinion that the applicant is in breach of subsection 4, (4A) or (5) of section 9 the Commissioner shall send to the applicant a notice in writing inviting the applicant to indicate (within ten working days of the sending of the notice) whether he or she wishes to continue with his or her application and, if an applicant does not fur<Col N="171" />nish an indication with in the time specified in the notice, his or her application for declaration shall be deemed to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>For that section to come into the effect, the pre-conditions, as far as the amendment is concerned, are that there has to be a failure to co-operate or comply with the provisions of section 9, which are specified in the section. This amendment proposes to insert the words &ldquo;to such an extent as to warrant the application of this subsection&rdquo;. That is to exclude minor or totally insignificant failures to co-operate but I do not know what they might be. It seems implicit in the subsection that only those, which could be reasonably and fairly relied upon, can constitute grounds for the sending of a letter under the subsection.</P>
    <P>All we are saying is that, in those circumstances, the applicant is put in the position of indicating whether or not he or she proposes to proceed with the matter. It seems, from ordinary rules of constitutional construction, that the words which the Senator's amendment proposes to insert are entirely surplusage because anything which is so insignificant as to fall within the <i>de minimis non courat lex</i> rule &ndash; the law is not concerned with tiny things &ndash; is already excluded by a constitutional interpretation of this section.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Senator has in mind but she referred to a person being the subject of a medical accident. That would not of course amount to a lack of co-operation. To co-operate means to do so in the sense that one can. Lack of co-operation is surely based on some degree of default on the part of the applicant. One cannot call it failure to co-operate if the person could not co-operate. Any fair-minded judge or administrator, if it came to that, could only operate in a constitutional interpretation of the section and would have to ignore something which was so insignificant as not to warrant the application of the section. I am opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senators will recall that in our debate on Committee Stage, I gave an undertaking that I would bring forward a Report Stage amendment to make it clear that the withdrawal provisions provided for in section 6 of the Bill would not apply in circumstances where an applicant is found in breach of section 9(4)(<i>b</i>) of the <Col N="172" />Act of 1996. Paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (4) of that section prohibits an applicant from entering employment or carrying on a business, trade or profession during the period before the final determination of his or her application.</P>
      <P>I said to the House that I would not regard breach of the ban on employment by applicants as <i>ipso facto</i> indicative of a desire to abandon the application. However, I want to make it clear I regard such breaches as a serious failure to meet the requirements of the Act of 1996. It is equally clear that breaches of that nature do not in themselves mean the person is failing to co-operate in the investigation of his or her application for asylum &ndash; although I would deprecate it. If, for example, an applicant for asylum was to be offered casual employment for one or two days at some stage, I would not regard the mere fact of that being proven or established as fair grounds for saying that, regardless of the merits of that applicant's original claim, they should be deemed to have abandoned it. The effect of the Government amendment is to provide that the mere breach of the obligation not to work, although it is a serious matter, will not be relied upon by the State as grounds for concluding that the asylum application is itself devoid of substance and has been abandoned.</P>

      <P>Government amendments Nos. 14 and 21 arise from an indication I gave on Committee Stage that I would look at the time limit of ten working days, as set out in section 6 of the Bill. This ten day limit, in effect a fortnight, would arise in a case where the Refugee Applications Commissioner or the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, as the case may be, becomes aware that the applicant is no longer at the address supplied or has demonstrated that he or she is in some other way not available to co-operate in the process of investigating the asylum claim or determining the appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" />The applicant's personal co-operation is essential to the tasks the commissioner and the tribunal must perform. In cases where the applicant is no longer at the address supplied, the commissioner or tribunal will write asking the applicant whether he or she wishes to proceed with the application. Failure to respond within the time limit leads to the conclusion that the applicant does not wish to proceed and that the application will be treated as withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Having given the matter some thought and having discussed it with some Members of the Houses on Committee Stage and thereafter &ndash; I thank Senator Mansergh for the thought he gave to the matter &ndash; I have decided to extend the time limit to 15 working days or three weeks rather than maintaining the ten working days which are currently provided for in the Bill as passed on Committee Stage. This is more than fair and will give an applicant adequate time to make good the absence from the address given to consider his or her position and to consult with his or her legal representation as to the undoubtedly important decision that has to be made.</P>
    <P>I am adamantly opposed to any undue extension of the time limit. The notion, as proposed in Opposition amendments Nos. 15 and 22, that 35 working days &ndash; effectively two months &ndash; is an acceptable period in which to respond is simply not on. It is based on the misconception that leisurely time limits are in some way fairer to the applicant than clinical, crisp requirements. Overly long time limits favour only those who wish to abuse the system by dragging out the investigation process for as long as possible and who have little interest in having finality brought to their claims. Such people do a disservice to bona fide applicants whose claims for refugee status are delayed while time limits are exploited by people who are simply bent on exploiting them.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government amendments to the House. They are not draconian but reasonable. Fifteen working days amount to three calendar weeks, which is plenty of time for an applicant to address the matter. One should bear in mind that, in many cases, the person involved will have abandoned the address where her or she was supposed to be. If the abandonment goes beyond three weeks something very strange is happening because one of the conditions upon which one claims asylum is that one remains in direct provision accommodation. I cannot imagine circumstances in which there are reasonable grounds for an applicant's moving away for three weeks.</P>
    <P>If, for some extraordinary reason, an applicant moves away for three weeks, it is open to him or her to restart the process again, with leave of the Minister. If there was some extraordinary and excusing circumstance that would justify such a course, I would be disposed to looking upon the case favourably. If the system is to work at all one cannot allow two months to elapse in such cases, thereby creating another period of uncertainty that slows up the system and prevents <Col N="174" />people in the queue from having their cases dealt with. This is because files and lines of communication have to be kept open to the detriment of genuine asylum seekers. If one genuinely came to this country looking for safety from persecution, one would want to get one's status determined as soon as possible. Delay would serve no useful purpose whatsoever.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 16, to delete &ldquo;no&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;in the case of an appeal withdrawn under section 9, no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I have already said to the Minister, the provision for failure to co-operate is very serious. <b></b>While we accept that there should not be a provision for someone to appeal the withdrawal of his own application, there could be circumstances in which somebody might legitimately miss the 15 day deadline in which one must reply to the letter referred to in amendment No. 14. In such cases there should be provision for an appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to allow an appeal in all cases except where the person fails to provide an address within five working days, as provided for in section 6(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Bill, which amends section 9 of the 1996 Act, or under subsection 14(<i>b</i>) of section 9 of the 1996 Act, where a person in detention indicates a wish to leave the State and his or her application is deemed withdrawn as a consequence of his or her leaving.</P>
      <P>The amendment would also allow an applicant to appeal his or her own decision to withdraw an application or his or own actions or failure to act in pursuing an application. I fail to see the point in allowing an appeal in the case of a person who has abandoned his asylum application. If a person says he does not want to pursue an application it is clearly illogical, if not to suggest a case of bureaucracy gone mad, to invite him to appeal against his own decision. In the same way, if an applicant, by his own actions or omissions, demonstrates in a way that can leave no doubt in anyone's mind that the intention is not to proceed with the asylum application, is it the case that the applicant should be allowed to appeal against his own actions or omissions or their consequences? That is the logic of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill are fair. They give an applicant ample opportunity to demonstrate, where there is an indication otherwise, that he or she does wish to pursue the application. If the <Col N="175" />applicant, who knows from the word &lsquo;go' of the consequences of non-co-operation, fails to avail of that ample opportunity, this is a clear and active demonstration that he or she does not wish the claim to proceed. That must inexorably be followed by a definitive conclusion in the form of a decision to withdraw the application since no other conclusion is sustainable.</P>
    <P>Following the conclusion of a case in this or any other way, a further application by the applicant would take into account any unforeseen or egregious circumstances which are difficult to provide for in law. In that context, I reiterate what I said in relation to the last amendment. The possibility of resubmitting an application is provided for in section 17(7) of the Refugee Act and is predicated on the Minister's consent. If there were compelling grounds to conclude that someone had been short-changed by a series of events outside his or her control or that the system had been unfair, the Minister of the day would allow the applicant to restart the procedure. That is no reason to conduct any form of review of positive actions by the applicant which lead to the conclusion of the application process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Senator's motives in moving this amendment, but I ask her to consider the practicability of the proposal. In section 6(<i>g</i>), the Bill amends section 19(2) of the Refugee Act, 1996, by removing the requirement to obtain the consent of the Minister <Col N="176" />prior to the publication &ndash; in a written publication available to the public &ndash; or broadcast of matters likely to lead members of the public to identify a person or an applicant for refugee status. The requirement to obtain the consent of the person will, of course, remain, but the intent of section 19(2) is to protect the identity of the asylum seeker from public exposure. It is essential that this protection be provided as confidentiality is an important consideration for the applicant. It provides the security and peace of mind that his or her identity will not be revealed in circumstances where those from whom the asylum seeker claims to be seeking persecution might be in a position to affect the applicant or his or her connections in the state of alleged persecution. This does not mean that the applicant is barred from telling his or her story to the media since there are many legitimate ways of doing so without revealing a person's identity. To date, it has been the practice for the Minister to grant his consent under section 19(2) where the person had already given his or her permission, sometimes in the form of a letter from his or her solicitor.</P>
      <P>The removal of the requirement to obtain the Minister's consent will streamline the procedure under section 19(2) while retaining the essential protections for the applicant. The person whose duty it is to protect the applicant will, primarily, be the applicant himself or herself and the Minister will no longer be the presumed protector. At the moment, there is a double lock with the Minister having to consent, as well as the applicant. People have misrepresented the provisions of the section, pointing to it and saying that it is an effort by the Minister to prevent the public knowing the full truth about the kinds of people regarding whom he is making decisions. The double lock was only intended to prevent asylum applicants from exploitation by the media, but it was frequently represented as a wholly unjustifiable gag imposed by the Minister to permit asylum seekers to be dealt with secretly and away from the glare of publicity. In practice, we gave consent as a matter of course, but as long as the provision regarding ministerial consent remains on the Statute Book, the law will be seen as unjust. As recently as a fortnight ago, I heard somebody state publicly that this law was wholly unjust while implying that it was part of a conspiracy to keep the public in the dark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would hope that a person would inform himself or herself fully of all potential consequences when consenting to the publication or broadcast of material likely to reveal his or her identity as an applicant for asylum. The problem with Senator Terry's amendment is in determining whether consent is informed. What is meant by that? Is it sufficient for the person to conduct an internal interrogation of his or her own reasons, or should there be overt evidence of steps taken by the person to inform his or her consent by, for example, contacting a legal representative, the United Nation High Com<Col N="177" />missioner for Refugees or, indeed, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? The latter option is provided for in the Bill in any case. If such contacts are made mandatory by requiring informed consent, they would become, in effect, a replacement for ministerial consent and remove from the applicant the independence provided for by the amendment to section 19(2) of the 1996 Act.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that Senator Terry's amendment seeks to prevent a person from making a foolish and public statement without taking the time to reflect. It might be possible to get around this by having the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Reception and Integration Agency provide a leaflet pointing out to people that they are not obliged to encourage undue publicity which might damage them or persons connected to them. Some people would doubtless represent that amendment as an effort by me to cow asylum seekers into not talking to the media. The question is therefore where to draw the line and how to demonstrate that consent is informed.</P>
    <P>It is not a trivial matter and it is not for the journalist or the broadcaster to be placed under a moral duty to satisfy himself or herself that the consent given is informed under pain of fine or imprisonment. That is hardly an incentive to journalists to cover these stories. If they are placed under an obligation to establish that consent is informed, journalists and broadcasters will question the nature of their duty in that case. They will ask about the nature of the duty imposed on them, for example, if they will be able to cover stories which come out quickly, they are to say they will not do anything unless a lawyer is present, or they are to recommend third party advice before being contacted. That is probably desirable but it must be asked if it is workable.</P>
    <P>It must also be asked if people are to be fined for failure to obtain an informed consent when we will not define what it means. For example, where an applicant's good friend or somebody involved in the asylum process provides a service for asylum seekers, are they capable of giving such advice as would make consent informed consent? Unless we are willing to specify exactly what we mean, we can hardly create a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>While I accept the amendment is well intentioned, it may create an undefined criminal offence. For example, it may implicate those involved in the publication of articles about asylum seekers, regardless of whether they had committed an offence. The legislation means that, as Minister, I will withdraw from providing a guarantee of secrecy by means of the requirement that my consent be obtained and leave it to the asylum seeker to protect his or her own interest. The amendment seeks to ensure that in such circumstances the media must not exploit a naive asylum seeker by providing for informed consent being a precondition for publicity of this kind. <Col N="178" />While I understand its purpose, unless we are willing to set out in an appendix to the legislation a workable formula that sets out for the media what can and cannot be done, the good intention of the amendment would create confusion as to whether an offence was committed.</P>
    <P>Reluctantly, therefore, we must rely on the good sense of the applicant to make a decision, taking advice from whatever quarter he or she considers necessary. I will consider the possibility of an advisory leaflet or document to compensate for the fact that I will no longer act <i>in loco parentis</i> as a person who must consent. In the last analysis we are leaving it to the applicant's free will and as long as he or she is provided with some guidance, we cannot dilute or make unclear the meaning of the offence now provided for.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;and by the insertion after subsection (5) of:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(6) Notwithstanding anything in this section the Tribunal may make available to the public copies of its decisions regarding appeals under this Act subject to the deletion of any material which might identify the appellant unless he or she so requests'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Tribunal decisions are not available. On Committee Stage the Minister rejected my party's proposal that the tribunal would be obliged to publish its decisions. The amendment seeks to regularise the Minister's assertion that the tribunal is free to publish its decisions. The tribunal appears to think otherwise and has in the past refused to publish decisions. The amendment modifies the amendment we moved on Committee Stage and seeks a compromise to ensure there would be openness regarding the tribunal's decisions. It is generally desirable in all decision making processes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Attorney General's office that the tribunal has within its discretion the power to publish decisions with sufficient details obscured to preserve the anonymity of applicants if it so wishes. That would be the appropriate way in which to release this material. However, it is right for the tribunal to select the cases of sufficient significance to merit public awareness, rather than have a bureaucratic requirement imposed on it, as provided for in the amendment, to publicise all its decisions, with the added burden of having to <Col N="179" />anonymise most of them. Although the proceedings of the District Court are held in public, it does not have to reduce to writing all its decisions. If it did so, huge bureaucratic problems could arise. On occasion reports of family law decisions made in the family law courts appear in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Considerable efforts are made to anonymise the material in question but sometimes this is unsuccessful and it is not difficult to work out from the facts as they are reported in the newspapers who is being referred to. For example, if a newspaper considers it is obscuring detail by reporting that a father of five who is a substantial businessman in the south-east has had a given decision imposed on him in the family court, with a few more details provided about the children, for example, that one attends boarding school while another is abroad, identification becomes simple.</P>
      <P>It would not be easy to anonymise a decision of the tribunal. For example, take the case where a decision refers to an African from Nigeria. It is reported that the ground for the asylum application was, as is frequently the case, the involvement of the person in political turmoil or an attempted coup. If a decision has to be reached on whether such an applicant is entitled to asylum, issues of credibility arise regarding the applicant's story. In many cases the asylum applicant will have given a personalised history of how he or she came to Ireland, who assisted him or her and how he or she avoided persecution. Frequently, the decision is focused on the credibility of that history and it may be found incredible for obvious reasons set out in the decision.</P>
      <P>To understand the decision it would be necessary to know the personal detail of the applicant and to draw any reasonable conclusion one would have to understand the decision in detail. From my experience of examining such files, a frequent ground relied on is that it is incredible in the circumstances of, say, the example I have cited, that the applicant did not go to his brother who was chief of police or that he did not talk to his sister who was at that stage a high ranking official in a given department and tell them of the threat of persecution. However, as each fact in a decision is set out and even if the name of the applicant is not disclosed, the decision would contain revealing references, say, in this example, to the northern state or the federal nature of the Government. Only a fool reading the judgment would not know the state referred to. A further revealing reference, for example, that the applicant's brother was the chief of police, would make it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sanitise a decision completely and make it anonymous would take many hours of work trying to work out what someone with malign intent &ndash; I do not suggest that there are such persons in any particular state &ndash; would be able to gather from a particular published decision. In particu<Col N="180" />lar, when one is dealing with people whose appeals are rejected, points they made in defence of their application and accusations they made about how they were treated and the like could expose them, if sent back to their country, to prejudice of some kind or another.</P>
    <P>It is not as easy as the Senator's amendment suggests to go through a document and put a black mark through a proper name every time one comes across it. That would not suffice. One would have to spend hours going through these decisions to make the applicant unidentifiable. One would have to do this in every case if it was mandatory. It would take hours, possibly days, out of the tribunal's working week to try to sanitise its own decisions. One would end up with documents which had so much black marker all over them, or so many deletions if the work was done on a word processor, that they would be virtually unintelligible and not simply useless but positively misleading because the grounds on which someone was disbelieved would be so personal as to identify them. Furthermore, the decision would look very strange because the tribunal member would appear to disbelieve an applicant on very flimsy grounds because he or she might have had to excise a whole paragraph which might have identified the applicant.</P>
    <P>I see what the Senator is attempting to achieve but we are dealing with a process that must, in the interest of the applicant, remain secret. Applicants in all cases are given the reasons for the failure of applications and there is is nothing to prevent an applicant from publishing his or her decision if he or she wishes to do so and take the consequences. However, to require the State to spend hours and hours effectively falsifying the record so as to remove any identifying material would not simply be a waste of time but positively misleading and lead journalists looking at the documents to say the grounds given were flimsy because they would not be aware that material which made the decision entirely reasonable had been excised.</P>

      <P>I have made the point that the tribunal has that power already. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide it. To say the tribunal may make decisions available to the public is to state the obvious. Unless this is an appeal for publication to be done normally or as of course, the amendment proposes something which the tribunal can already do. The chairman of the tribunal could gather together important points of law or important precedents that he or she thought were necessary to publish. There is nothing to stop this happening.  </P>

    <P>
      <Col N="181" />The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is interpreted in two ways. While sometimes it is permissive, sometimes the courts interpret it as being equivalent to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in circumstances where a power is being given to a body.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;7.&ndash;The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 is amended in section 5(3)(<i>a</i>) by the insertion after the third and fourth references to the &lsquo;High Court' of &lsquo;or the Supreme Court',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My colleagues and I have tabled this amendment because we believe it important that an applicant should have the right to appeal a refusal by the High Court of leave to appeal. This leave relates to a fundamental human right. When the Bill was introduced in 2000, the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy Howlin, withdrew his amendment because he was told that such an appeal would lie. Since then, however, the Supreme Court has held that no such appeal lies. Therefore, I ask the Minister to rectify the position by accepting this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to remove the restriction on the right of appeal from a decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court in judicial review proceedings under section 5 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000. Currently, under that Act, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court can only be granted where the High Court certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is desirable in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court. The provision does not apply to a determination of the High Court as to the validity of any law having regard to the Constitution. The Constitution provides that not every decision of the High Court is appealable to the Supreme Court. Only some are. It is a matter to provide by law whether there should be an appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I was to remove the obligation on an unsuccessful asylum seeker seeking judicial review to obtain the leave of the High Court and point to some legal point of exceptional public importance, I would be saying to someone legally aided by the refugee legal service that he or she could not merely apply to the High Court within the time limit provided for in the Act of 2000 but, when dissatisfied with the judgment of the High <Col N="182" />Court refusing him or her judicial review, bring that same case to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In nearly every one of these cases, legal aid is granted. Where the legal system can be invoked, effectively free of charge, and the evil day postponed, and where, on experience, nine out of ten applications are found not to be well founded, the sad fact is that those who want to exploit delay within the system would, as a matter of course, ask their lawyers to bring a judicial review for them in the High Court, even though, in the minds of their lawyers, the case was probably doomed. These cases would then go to the Supreme Court without any exposure to costs, because they have no assets, and the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court invoked. If this was to happen, a pattern would emerge that every asylum seeker faced with deportation would decide to get another six months out of High Court and Supreme Court appeals, hoping something might turn up in those six months. In those circumstances I have no doubt the Supreme Court would be flooded with appeals by those who merely wanted to put off the evil day.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has upheld the statutory judicial review system as fair, constitutional and consistent with the principles of natural justice and in compliance with Ireland's international obligations on the human rights sphere. The court also recognised these provisions as being in pursuance of the legitimate policy objectives of ensuring that the delay in removing a person from the State, which is necessarily occasioned by the institution of judicial review proceedings, should arise only where there are substantial reasons which warrant that delay. The legitimate policy objective still stands and, accordingly, I see absolutely no justification for interfering with the system which carries that objective into effect. I do not want to open a stable door we have already closed in order to provide a system of legally aided delay. I have no doubt that the latter would arise.</P>
    <P>If any legal point of genuine public importance arose in the High Court, I have no doubt that a judge &ndash; because High Court justices are humane and decent people &ndash; will refer it to the Supreme Court for resolution. To put it in the gift of the applicant to decide whether the Supreme Court should reserve a full day, half a day or whatever to decide these matters &ndash; I say this in the context that we receive 12,000 applications for asylum per annum &ndash; would make the Supreme Court a target for incessant appeal. It is all very well to say the court is there to hear appeals, but if there are 400 appeals does that not bring the judicial system into disrepute? If the Supreme Court sets aside a half day, an hour or half an hour to try to discover what each case involves, this would effectively wipe out its capacity to function as a court for an entire legal year. I will not go down that road.</P>
    <P>On reflection, the stance I am taking is reasonable. The law is working well. Nobody of whom <Col N="183" />I am aware has made a substantial complaint that it has operated in an unfair or arbitrary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Ahern's, participation with the delegation from Donegal after Christmas. I also acknowledge his honesty. A few blunt instruments have been used in regard to Donegal due to the fact that perhaps things were based on anecdotal evidence as opposed to scientific data.</P>
      <P>I will not use this opportunity as a launching pad to say what should or what could have done right. The reality is Donegal fishermen have lost out in this deal. I also acknowledge the lobby groups, the Greencastle fishermen and the Killybegs Fishermen's Association, and the proactive work they have done and the in-depth knowledge they have in relation to fishing in that part of the world.</P>
      <P>I propose December as a milestone in regard to fishing in Donegal and throughout the country. The nine day rule will be reviewed in December and things will not change if there are no scientific data to prove some type of proactive measurement or a proactive management plan. I will not go through the nuts and bolts of the nine day rule which has been ploughed through almost to such an extent that it has exhausted many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the Minister's involvement but we, along the north-west coast, will have to start to invest in research. Research was done in the Irish Sea but it has not been carried out along the north-west coast. I call for investment in research involving the participants there, including the fishermen's association, because as I said they have in-depth expertise and knowledge. Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute are willing to see how they can move forward in terms of conservation. The measure in place in regard to the reduction in the fish mesh is contrary to conservation and sustainability. If we can collate all the anecdotal evidence and invest in research and if this Government is willing to do so, we will be in a position to say to the European Commission <Col N="185" />and Commissioner Fischler in December that the blunt instrument used this time is not a sustainable measure and that it is totally contradictory to any type of reasonable and logical conservation measure.</P>
    <P>We must use December as a milestone, or a watershed, when we can turn the situation around. We cannot, however, go to the European Commission unless we have scientific data. The fishermen's lobby groups, the fishermen's associations, are willing to participate because they have in-depth knowledge and expertise beyond any I have, even though I was born on the coast. They are willing to participate and to enter into some type of partnership in regard to research with BIM and the Marine Institute to look at a long-term proactive management plan for the Irish coast. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. J. Browne Mr. J. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. J. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McHugh for raising the issue and apologise for the absence of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The fishing effort limitation scheme approved at the December Fisheries Council came into effect from 1 February 2003 and may run until the end of this year. The Commission has indicated that it is a temporary measure and that a further more detailed proposal will be presented for subsequent consideration by Council. I expect the Commission to present a proposal in the coming weeks following bilateral discussions currently under way between the Commission and member states.</P>
      <P>The idea of a widespread fishing effort limitation scheme had been mooted by the European Commission throughout 2002. It was, therefore, an issue that featured prominently in the regular dialogue which the Department maintains with the Irish fishing industry. My opposition to fishing effort limitation has been consistent throughout and the Irish fishing industry has shared my concerns in this regard. I continue to maintain that the scheme is an extremely blunt instrument and do not believe that it will prove to be effective in fisheries management. Together with a number of like-minded colleagues, I emphasised this view at the December Council.</P>
      <P>In the event, as the Senator is aware, the scheme was approved in a revised format and for a reduced area, predominantly covering the North Sea and certain waters to the west of Scotland. The agreement reached at Council means that there is no clear legal obligation on member states to implement it. To this end, I have recently signed a statutory instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discussed the situation in some detail with representatives of the Irish fishing industry on a number of occasions since the December Council, including fishermen from Donegal and <Col N="186" />the Greencastle area, in particular. I have also ensured that the Department has worked closely with the industry to clarify issues about the scheme and the details associated with its implementation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this new scheme gives rise to difficulties for particular fishermen fishing off the north west coast using certain gear types. The nine day limit, to which the Senator referred, has now been increased to 11 days following discussions with the European Commission. The extra days represent an allowance for steaming time between home ports and fishing grounds as well as compensation for adjustment to fishing patterns.</P>
    <P>However, it is important to stress that the 11 day limit applies only to one gear type. It is possible to fish for a greater number of days each month if certain other gear types are used or without any limit if fishing exclusively outside the area.</P>
    <P>On the basis of an examination of recent log-sheet data, the best estimate is that a total of 24 Donegal based vessels fished in the area concerned with the fishing gear subject to the 11 day limit. Ten of these vessels also fished with other fishing gears subject to a 25 day limit. The impact of the regulation will, therefore, be dependent on the type of gear which vessels elect to use and the area in which they choose to fish.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, I do not accept the validity of the Commission's approach. It does not ensure the sustainability of fish stocks, which is the primary aim. My position is supported by the Irish fishing industry and also by a number of other member states. When the Commission presents its detailed long-term proposals for the recovery of cod stocks in particular, the debate on the most effective way forward will again take centre stage.</P>
    <P>There is serious concern about cod stocks and we must bear in mind that we are proceeding against the backdrop whereby the most recent scientific advice from ICES is for a closure of all fisheries for cod off the north-west coast of Ireland and Scotland as a targeted species or by-catch. It must, therefore, be acknowledged that stock recovery is unlikely unless stringent management action is taken.</P>
    <P>I believe that such action should concentrate on improved technical conservation measures and better control and enforcement. An appropriate balance between protecting the livelihoods of coastal communities and having in place effective measures to ensure the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks is possible. That will be my priority in upcoming discussions on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for selecting this issue which is of parochial concern to me and the residents of the Tallaght-Clondalkin area. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is a frequent visitor to this Chamber.</P>
      <P>There is considerable opposition to the proposal to establish a juvenile detention centre on the green belt lands between Tallaght and Clondalkin from the local community, the local authority, South Dublin County Council, and the Tánaiste, who informed me last week by way of a flier through my door, &ldquo;Harney strongly opposed to juvenile detention centre.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This proposal came out of the blue before Christmas, without any consultation with local Dáil or Seanad Members or local councillors. Who was consulted before this ludicrous proposal was put which would take away a substantial amount of green belt land between the conurbation of Tallaght and Clondalkin? No one was consulted about this proposal when it came from the Office of Public Works through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. On 16 January a very detailed objection on behalf of South Dublin County Council's planning department setting out its conclusions and recommendations was lodged to the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>There have been several attempts to develop the green belt lands over the past number of years and on each occasion severe objections have been made by the planning authorities. Once again a proposal in this area by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is being objected to. On 16 January the planners' response stated that the proposed development would constitute a material contravention of the South Dublin County Council's development plan 1998 policies regarding zoning objectives, traffic safety, public health and injury to nearby residential amenity. The professional planners, Dublin South County Council, are opposed to this proposal. The council has clearly outlined its views in terms of zoning, the traffic congestion on the N7, which has a greater volume of traffic than any other route, drainage and the unsuitability of the proposed juvenile detention centre on green belt lands.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste is opposed to the proposal. She said in correspondence recently that it would contravene the objective of a green belt between the two conurbations. I understand she is in discussions with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to try to stop this proposed development. I want to hear from the Minister that he is listening to the local community, the professional planners and the Tánaiste, who has a definitive view on this matter. I would be delighted if he would tell me that the Government will stop this proposed development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that before Christmas there was a controversial move by the <Col N="188" />Government to sell off the juvenile detention centre at Shanganagh. There is a view in our community that because the lands at Shanganagh are considerably more valuable than those at Newlands Cross they will be sold off, but as land in Dublin 24 is not as expensive a juvenile detention centre will be built there. This will not be accepted on a cross-party community basis. I expect the Minister to say the proposal has been scrapped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware of the matters outlined by the Senator, I am not aware of the circular by the Tánaiste to which he referred. I assure him that decisions on this matter are not influenced by a decision taken in relation to Shanganagh. There is a requirement under the Children Act 2001 for a juvenile centre for young offenders aged between 16 and 21.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I am happy to clarify this matter for the Senator. I commence by outlining the background and current status of the proposed development.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the provision of accommodation for young offenders aged between 16 and 21 years. The Children Act 2001 provides that boys and girls aged 16 to 17 years who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence should be accommodated in separate detention facilities. To the extent that this measure was enacted through these Houses there was full consultation with Senator Brian Hayes in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>In late 2001 the Prison Service advertised for a suitable site for such detention facilities. On foot of this process, a total of around 40 locations were assessed and the site at Newlands on the Naas Road was found to be the most suitable of those examined. On that basis, a planning notice under part 9 of the Local Government Planning and Development Act 2000 was served in December 2002. This involved placing public advertisements as well as site notices regarding the proposed development. I emphasise, however, that this matter is not something on which any conclusive decision has been made.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already clearly stated his position in this matter in reply to a number of questions in the Dáil last week and in his response to Deputy Paul Gogarty during the Adjournment debate last Thursday in the Dáil. There has been no change in the Minister's position since then but I am happy to restate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal referred to by the Senator is not one that comes from the Minister but has been put to him and therefore he must consider it. He is examining a number of options in this regard including the possibility of identifying alternative sites to those already considered. With that in mind, he has asked the Prison Service to under<Col N="189" />take a review of the matter to see how best the necessary facilities might be provided.</P>
    <P>No firm conclusion has been reached on the matter. The Minister will carefully consider the outcome of the review now under way and will examine all the options open to him. He hopes to come to a decision on the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>I understand what the Senator has stated about opposition to the proposed development. Indeed, the Senator outlined the objections which have been raised through the local government system in relation to it. A number of other Senators, and Members of the Lower House, from the west Dublin region and neighbouring constituencies, have also expressed strong views about this matter to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I can assure the House that in arriving at a decision the Minister will take into account the views expressed by Senator Brian Hayes and other Members of the Oireachtas representing the area, as well as those views expressed by local residents and members of South Dublin County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the Christmas recess I tabled a similar motion about the conditions obtaining in unit nine of James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown. At that time, I was informed in the reply that a new wing was being built and that unit nine would be accommodated within the new building. We were also told that the Inspector of Mental Hospitals considered unit nine as an inappropriate facility for housing this type of patient. Following that, we were looking forward to unit nine, the psychiatric division, moving into the new general hospital.</P>
      <P>However, I have tabled this matter for the Adjournment debate today because it has come to my notice that the new development may not happen for some time. I understand that the matter will come before the Labour Relations Commission next Friday. That is because, following an examination of the new building, the Psychiatric Nurses Organisation found that it has not been built to an appropriate specification for housing mentally ill patients, let alone those who are dangerously ill.</P>
      <P>For example, the glass in the unit's doors and windows is the same type as that fitted in a general hospital and a proper observation deck has not been built. In addition, the needs of the psychiatric division have not been incorporated into the hospital's design by the architects. I accept there might be problems with the management of the health board but it is quite serious for something like that to occur at this stage of the development. I would ask the Minister to examine the matter and I look forward to his response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Morrissey for raising this matter on the Adjournment. One of <Col N="190" />the objectives under the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, is to improve mental health services. Advancement in the standards of care for psychiatric patients remains at the heart of developing and improving psychiatric services, as set out in the report, Planning for the Future, published in 1984.</P>
      <P>The thrust of this report recommended the establishment of a comprehensive, community-oriented mental health service as an alternative to institutional care for persons with mental illness. The shift from a predominantly hospital-based service to a service delivered to patients in the community, with the least disruption to their daily lives, has taken place with significant improvements in standards of patient care.</P>
      <P>Acute psychiatric in-patient services for area six of the Eastern Regional Health Authority are currently being delivered from unit nine at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, which has 22 beds. In his report for the year ended 31 December 2001, the Inspector of Mental Hospitals noted that this unit was unsuited for its purpose and that the shortcomings of the unit had resulted in unsatisfactory conditions for service users and considerable difficulties for staff working in the unit. The inspector also noted that the unit was structurally and decoratively poor with a temporary add-on structure providing bathroom facilities for female patients.</P>
      <P>This unit will be replaced by a new psychiatric unit in the new hospital development which is currently nearing completion. Patients in unit nine will be relocated to the new unit, which will provide improved patient facilities and services. The new unit will be a 56-bed one comprising 44 acute psychiatric beds, six high observation beds and six psychiatry of old age beds. It is envisaged that patients from a 22-bed unit at St. Brendan's Hospital will also move to the new unit.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Northern Area Health Board that it is engaged in discussions with the staff in relation to this process and a snag list is being compiled and is to be discussed at a meeting to be held later this week. I understand that the transition programme to the new acute psychiatric unit is on schedule and a programme of handover dates is being followed. Working groups are working closely with the commissioning group and the project management team. This is the process which has been put in place to ensure the smooth transition from the old hospital to the new buildings. All matters which need attention, including matters relating to the psychiatric unit, are being dealt with within this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to security matters, the Northern Area Health Board has advised that a security team is permanently in place at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown. Security personnel patrol the hospital complex 24 hours a day, every day. The hospital recently appointed a full-time head of security to co-ordinate and man<Col N="191" />age security on the complex. The existing psychiatric unit is constantly monitored by the security team at the hospital and the nurses there carry personal security alarms which, when activated, alert security and the assistant director of nursing on duty.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Northern Area Health Board that the new psychiatric unit is spacious, bright and provides an expanded range of facilities for patients. In the interests of patient care I <Col N="192" />hope that all interested parties will co-operate with the process now initiated by the health board to progress the opening of the new unit. In this context, I will raise with the Northern Area Health Board the concerns mentioned by Senator Morrissey.</P>
