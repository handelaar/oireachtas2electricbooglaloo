      <P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the sudden closure on Wednesday, 25 June 2003 of the Glanbia meat processing plant in Rooskey; if the company had been paid Government grants; and what interventions, if any, were made by the Minister to keep the plant open.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on the urgent need to provide extra school places, in particular at primary level, in Lucan, County Dublin for September 2003 and future academic years, and also the need for additional second level provision in the area.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>The Order of Business today is as follows: No. 1, motion concerning the report of the Standards in Public Office Commission investigation into contraventions of section 21(1) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, which is available in the Library, to be taken without debate; No. 2, motion, the subject matter of which was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, which has completed its discussions, be taken without debate; No. 3, motion concerning the further opening of the electricity market with effect from 19 February 2004 to be referred to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for discussion, to be taken without <Col N="1674" /> debate; No. 4, Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 <i>[Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil]</i>&ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude at 12.30 p.m.; No. 5, Immigration Bill 2002 <i>[Seanad Bill amended by the Dáil]</i>&ndash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 2 p.m. This was scheduled to conclude at 4 p.m. but we have a further hour and, therefore, it will conclude at 5 p.m. There will be a sos from 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

      <P>If we needed any evidence from the Government that it was using the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 to suppress information, it comes in its starkest form from Mr. Justice Kinlen today in his excellent report as the new Inspector of Prisons. He must be congratulated for the very clear, precise and direct way in which he has used the report to highlight deficiencies in the prison service. I put the matter bluntly to the Leader: the Government, through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is not only giving Mr. Justice Kinlen virtually no support in his new role as Inspector of Prisons but it is trying to suppress the information that he seeks. On several occasions he has asked the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform specific questions about overtime and manpower levels in the service and he has not received answers. This eminent judge, who is doing an excellent job, is being undermined by the Government. This issue merits debate. He is to be congratulated for calling for the demolition of Mountjoy and Portlaoise prisons and for exposing inefficiencies within the service.</P>

      <P>Next, they will be banning booing. Can the Leader say when the legislation to put the post of inspector of prisons on a statutory footing will come before the House? </P>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that motion 34 on the list of non-Government motions be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business. I ask the Government to take this motion because from next Monday a whole raft of new charges will be imposed on people when they make requests under the Freedom of Information Act. The basic charge will be &euro;15, an internal appeal will cost &euro;75 and an appeal to the Information Commissioner will cost &euro;150, a total cost of &euro;240.</P>

Let us see the colour of the Government's money on this issue. It promised when the debate was taking place some months ago that there would not be massive hikes and charges. They are here now. People will have to pay &euro;240 if they appeal the decision.</P>

      <P>The new Minister for propaganda is doing a very good job. From next Monday these charges will take effect.

      <P>I second Senator Hayes's proposal. What disturbs me about the report by the inspector of prisons is that none of us appears to have received it before the press. It does not appear to have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, yet the press appear to have been able to get copies of it. I wish that sort of thing, which happens all too frequently, did not occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" />There are serious problems in the nursing profession. We had an excellent Commission on Nursing chaired by Judge Mella Carroll three years ago. When we resume, can we debate the progress made on implementing the recommendations of that commission? It will be noted from today's newspapers that the Irish Nursing Organisation states that by 2005 there will be a real crisis in nursing because no graduates will come out of college that year. It is reckoned that some graduates this year will not be able to get hospital jobs due to the cutbacks. They will go abroad immediately and it is most unlikely that we will get them back to work in our health service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not on the Order of Business. We will be short of time coming to the close of the half hour and delays such as this are the reason. I ask the Senator to concentrate on the Order of Business and to be fair to Senators offering later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Members opposite will refrain from interrupting me I will do my best to be as brief as possible. I fully support what Senator Hayes has said. There is no logic of any kind which can justify the scale of fees for appeals to the Information Commissioner. The only logic is that it is a deterrent, as the commissioner said. <Col N="1677" /> What we have is a deliberate attempt to deter people from pursuing their rights under freedom of information legislation. That is an attack on the concept of freedom of information, or perhaps it means that only the rich can have the right to freedom of information. That, perhaps, reflects the view of the party opposite as well. We should debate these regulations, dispose of them and reject them.</P>
      <P>The second issue concerns amendments to Bills made by the Dáil. One contains 30 amendments and it is 32 pages long, the other contains 62 amendments and is 36 pages long. Under a Standing Order of this House we cannot debate these amendments independently but as a single text. That Standing Order obviously envisaged minor amendments. I invite the Leader to move a motion to suspend that Standing Order so that we can have an intelligent debate and look at these 62 amendments, section by section, rather than dealing with 62 amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil is perfectly entitled to amend legislation and nobody is disputing that, but many of these amendments were barely discussed in the Dáil because of the guillotine. We cannot discuss intelligently 62 amendments if we can speak only once on them and it reduces spectacularly Government accountability. In the meantime I ask the Leader to look at a motion to suspend or to amend temporarily that Standing Order &ndash; we do it regularly here to cut short debate &ndash; so that we can have a proper debate on very complex amendments to legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate in the next session on the drug culture. I ask her to invite the new Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, to come into the House and give a full report.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger has been replaced by the magic dragon. Within the vicinity of this House on 24 June, two young men were viewed and photographed taking drugs in the Phoenix House car park overlooked by the new Millennium block. They were sucking or sniffing cocaine and were half-clad. They were sweating and were taking drugs for about an hour. The car number has been taken and the Garda has been notified. The photographs in my possession show them in action. That is only part of the problem and it is happening all over the country. There will have to be zero tolerance of drugs.</P>

      <P>When does the Government intend placing this position on a statutory basis? </P>
      <P>Senator Ryan made valid points regarding the two Seanad Bills amended by the Dáil. The Leader must agree that the relevant Standing Order should be suspended because, unlike the Dáil, this House has a fine tradition of not applying the guillotine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the evidence that the Government has appointed forthright, courageous and independent officers. I would be happy to engage in debate on the prisons issue.</P>
      <P>The standard charge for non-personal FOI requests is &euro;15, which is modest. The number who will want to make further appeals will be limited.</P>
      <P>One of the jobs of this House is to scrutinise the activities of European institutions. In six months time the Taoiseach will occupy the office of President of the European Council. The Order of Business should not pass without expressing concern about the unworthy remarks yesterday of the President in Office of the European Council. I admire post-war German democracy enormously and its tremendous achievements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mansergh that it was an inappropriate remark. I expect nothing much else from Mr. Berlusconi who has a murky background in his own country and used the law to escape from prosecution.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes's call for a debate on the prison system. While I welcome the proposals to demolish prisons, I am not so sure about rebuilding them. We ought to move away from the mania for custodial sentences towards a more community based programme for lesser offences. Some changes need to be made as it is inappropriate that we have Dickensian conditions with prisoners slopping out etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call for further debate on the Freedom of Information Act. The charges are wrong and the Act should be re-examined. I <Col N="1679" /> received notification of a request for information about the various allowances etc. that we get, as I imagine everybody in the House did. It is a perfectly fair request but when I rang to ask from where the request came, I was told that information was confidential. It is absurd that the newspapers can poke around legitimately. We should know which newspaper is involved in order that we can watch out for it and correct it when it is wrong, as it almost invariably is, or when it misinterprets facts because it does not understand the staged fashion in which the payments are claimed.</P>
    <P>In regard to information, I ask the Leader to examine our latest bulletin. I have brought to the attention of the House several times the fact that there are a large number of factual errors, for example, misattribution of debate contributions. My contribution in Private Members' time on domestic partnership law was attributed to my colleague, Senator Ross, who did not speak in the debate. I could multiply these instances. We should issue the bulletin once a year, showing the work we do. It should not be issued during holiday periods when nothing is done and should be properly vetted and proof read in order to do credit to the House.</P>

      <P>The case of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane has again come centre stage. The European Court of Human Rights has found Britain guilty of a breach of human rights because there was not sufficient investigation of the suspicion that there was security force collusion in the murder. I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the hope the inquiry sought by the Finucane family will be granted. We should have this inquiry because of the terrible trauma suffered by the family and in order to ensure there can be confidence in the security forces in the future. It is important it takes place soon because the longer the delay continues the less hope there will be of creating confidence in the security system in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry's call for a debate on nursing. The issue has been put in focus due to the tragic death of Róisín Ruddle. Our hearts go out to her family. There are 45 nursing vacancies for the 115 intensive care nurses required in Crumlin Hospital &ndash; a scarcity which resulted in the child being referred home. The consultant has stated this could happen again because of the shortage of nurses. There is a problem with recruitment which will probably have to be solved by providing extra funding to pay nurses more for this highly skilled job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point which has emerged is that there seems to be lack of liaison between Temple Street Hospital and Crumlin Hospital. Temple Street Hospital has facilities for intensive care beds. It is reported in the newspapers today that a senior person in the hospital said if there was proper <Col N="1680" /> liaison between both hospitals, it might have been able to accommodate such a situation and the tragic death might not have happened. We cannot allow this to happen again. That is the reason I support Senator Henry. There is already a scarcity of nurses. This must be addressed or we will, regrettably, have more tragedies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We should welcome the report of the inspector of prisons and places of detention. The Leader should arrange a debate on the report early in the next session. The attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to make a political, partisan point is unworthy of him. If he consults his colleague, Senator Terry, he will be aware that the Minister has invited the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to visit the prisons in order that its members can assess the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Committee members will see that there is no attempt other than to adopt a totally transparent approach. If the Senator kept in touch with his spokespersons, he would be better informed.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Freedom of Information Act, those of us involved in local government are aware of the additional cost imposed on them. It is just one sector of the public service to which the Act applies. Sections have been set up and staffed to deal with the matter. Anybody who has kept in touch knows that certain individuals are inveterate applicants to the units for all sorts of information. There is a huge cost involved, which the public pays. It is only appropriate that a small charge should be applied in order that people would be more selective in regard to the information they seek.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan in regard to large numbers of amendments coming to us on Report Stage from the Dáil. While it is probably not possible for the Leader to do anything at this late stage in regard to the Bills before the House, the issue should be looked at to ensure that when significant changes are made to legislation which returns to this House from the Dáil, adequate time is made available to scrutinise and deal with the legislation to the satisfaction of the House.</P>

      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Ryan, in regard to the number of amendments which have come before us this morning. I am concerned at the speed at which it appears we are being forced to deal with them. Will the Leader consider a temporary amendment to Standing Orders to allow us to deal with the Bills section by section? There are 62 amendments to the Protection of the Environment Bill, some of which are comprehensive and propose to make major changes to the Bill as presented to the House some weeks ago. It is difficult to adequately <Col N="1681" /> examine those amendments as we are entitled to and should do.</P>
      <P>I support the comments in regard to the Freedom of Information Act and the charges for requests. I hope the Government takes on board the views of the Information Commissioner on this matter, although I suspect it will not. I note, in his report on prisons, that Mr. Justice Kinlen stated that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to have difficulty dealing with the Freedom of Information Act, a fact which was obvious from early on.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the requests of Senator Henry and Senator Finucane for a close examination of the supply and availability of nurses, particularly at ICU level. We have clear evidence of the problem and a warning of a pending crisis. Are we going to stand by and let this happen or will we do something about it? This is an issue to which we must return as a matter of urgency at the earliest available opportunity.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the Equal Status Act, which comes within the remit of the Equality Authority? A tragic case in Sligo has been brought to my attention regarding a 17 year old boy who lost his sight as a result of an operation to correct his failing eyesight. He is now back living at home, having gone through rigorous training with his guide dog. Two weeks ago, the boy, his parents, trainer and guide dog turned up at a restaurant and were turned away because the guide dog would not be admitted.</P>
      <P>I wish to highlight the Act in the House next term so that it might act as a deterrent to restaurant owners and a warning that they cannot inflict pain. The law states that restaurant owners and suchlike do not have the right to do what was done in this case. Pain was inflicted on a child who is already burdened with pain. I raise this issue this morning because we are in the wake of what I called the greatest week in the history of the State, namely, the Special Olympics. In that regard, I stated that we should put our money where our mouths are. Therefore, will the Leader arrange a debate on this matter next term to ensure people do not inflict pain on people with disabilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wish to raise the issue of the report by Mr. Justice Kinlen which casts a grim shadow over the condition of our prisons. It calls for the demolition of Mountjoy and Portlaoise Prisons, given that it describes the conditions for prisoners there as unacceptable. We need an urgent debate on this matter and it is a pity we cannot have it before the summer recess. However, we should have one early in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is some months since I raised the issue of prison visiting committees, yet we have heard nothing about any reforms. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform accepted many of the points which I made to him in committee, but <Col N="1682" /> we have not seen anything concrete. We need that legislation before us to enable a full debate on prisons.</P>
    <P>I wish to respond to Senator Jim Walsh who, unfortunately, is not in the House.</P>

      <P>In the past number of years there has been increased enforcement of the litter laws, which has brought about a welcome change on the streets of our villages, towns and cities. Many litter wardens are doing heroic work while facing verbal and physical abuse. Much good work has been done. The Garda has the power to enforce the litter laws but how many prosecutions have been brought? I welcomed the helpful plastic bag levy. The Seanad should show leadership by taking statements on the issue to ensure the good work continues. In that context, I request a debate on this serious issue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the measures taken by MEPs last week in regard to the fight against road deaths and injuries. I understand that the European Parliament is to introduce welcome new changes in design and new technologies are to be used in motor vehicles to eliminate blind spots. I have noticed a variation in the view available in the rear view and wing mirrors on my car. It is an anomaly which must be addressed. Our MEPs are insisting on it and, therefore, it is important we have a debate on the matter in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in regard to the report of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention and the Freedom of Information Act. The fact that the report was published in the public domain before it reached Members of the Oireachtas demonstrates that the Government has too many spinners.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, referred to the report of Mr. Justice Kinlen on the prison service and his recommendations for the demolition of the prisons in question. As other Members said, it was the Government of the day which appointed Mr. Justice Kinlen and it would not have done so without being aware that he was an upright and forthright person. That was clearly in its mind when he was appointed. Although the Senator did not condemn the report&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;he condemned the Government which appointed Mr. Justice Kinlen. The Senator sought to have the inspector's position established on a statutory footing. I do not know when that Bill will be before the Houses but I will make inquiries. Together with Senator Henry, the Senator also sought to have No. 34 on the Order Paper, regarding the statutory instrument governing charges for freedom of information requests debated in the House today.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry also queried the reason we did not get copies of the report of the inspector of prisons and places of detention. I wondered about that also but it is the way of the world now that reports are released to the press before others. The Senator also raised the problems in nursing. It is very important that we have a debate on the matter to ensure adequate information about whether there will be a shortfall in the numbers graduating in nursing and about Miss Justice Mella Carroll's proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan raised the issue of the new charges under the Freedom of Information Act. He also wanted me to change Standing Orders governing the manner in which we discuss Bills initiated in this House which have been amended by the other House. It is a difficulty if a Bill initiated in this House is heavily amended by the other House, as both Bills being discussed today have been. We will have to raise the matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and bring it to the reform committee because it is clear that great changes have been made to the two Bills, especially the Immigration Bill, which we debated at length in the House. That said, it is not within my powers to change Standing Orders to take account of this. As it is, they will&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Leyden raised the issue of the drug culture and referred to the Phoenix House car park with which I am not familiar. The Senator requested that the Garda Commissioner attend a debate on the issue in the Seanad. I do not think that is possible. We will certainly discuss the drug culture.</P>

      <P>Senator Mansergh was delighted that Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen, who is a courageous person, expressed his views in such a forthright manner. We are all delighted he did so because that is how circumstances are changed and improved, when people of Mr. Justice Kinlen's standing see fit to give a forthright report. Senator Mansergh has pointed out that an initial query under the Freedom of Information Act costs &euro;15, which could not in any way be regarded as punitive, and that one is entitled to seek personal details for free. The Senator also condemned the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, for his remark on the second day after Italy had assumed the Presidency. It was so obnoxious and out of kilter with what the European Union is about that I hope Mr. Berlusconi gets a good rap for it. The Senator also said he admired post-war Germany and what it had done in difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris agreed with Senator Mansergh and raised another issue regarding freedom of information. Like him, I was subject to a freedom of information request about my statement of accounts or whatever it is called. I inquired as to who had made the request and the nice young man at the other end of the telephone said he was not allowed to tell me because it was private but that it would come out in time. I thought that was humorous. Senator Norris should submit a freedom of information request to find out who made the request.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Murchú raised the issue of the Pat Finucane case and asked me to raise it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs to see if a public inquiry into the issue could be secured. I agree that it will undermine belief in the security forces if it is not attended to.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane supports Senator Henry's call for a debate on issues relating to nursing and what he perceives as a lack of co-ordination between Temple Street and Crumlin Hospitals that could address some of the inadequacies were it rectified. We passed a vote of sympathy on the death of the young child in question and should all vow that it should not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh welcomed the report of the inspector of prisons and places of detention and said the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights would visit the pri<Col N="1686" /> sons. Senator O'Meara disagreed with the amount of time allocated for the two Bills to be discussed today and also agreed with the call for a debate on issues relating to nursing. Senator Feeney requested a debate on the Equal Status Act because a young man and his family were denied access to a restaurant because he had a guide dog.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry wants to debate the report of the inspector of prisons and places of detention and said she was the only committee member available to go on the trip to Templemore. It appears, however, that because a Whip was enforced in the Dáil on that day, Deputies were not allowed to go. That is a different matter as Senator Jim Walsh made clear.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan raised the issue of littering and the enforcement of litter legislation while Senator Bannon commended MEPs for bringing forward ideas which will help towards alleviating the number of road deaths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be here to report on the amendments that were made to the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 during its passage through the Dáil. However, before I do that, I wish to make two broad comments. First, the Bill has genuinely benefited from the consideration given to it in both Houses. This has resulted in significant amendments to the text by the Government but also as a result of changes proposed by the Opposition. Second, the improvements to the Bill are in no small way related to the length of time given to its consideration by the Houses since publication of the Bill last January.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been considered for over 40 hours in the two Houses and this is an indication of our commitment both to the environment and to the legislative process itself. The extensiveness of the amendments may well provoke comment. In response, I point out that the production of legislation is not an everyday matter. It takes time to draft and it is often problematic to find time for debate in the Houses. It is right that, when an opportunity such as this Bill presents itself, we should take that opportunity to deal with as many issues as possible for the benefit of the environment. In view of the significance of the amendments, Senators will understand if I deal with those of substance and leave to one side those that are purely technical or consequential. If Members have queries on amendments not specifically referred to, I will be glad to elaborate on them later.</P>
      <P>Changes that were made to the Bill in the latter stages of its consideration in the Dáil are contained in amendments Nos. 25, 32, 46, 51 and 52 which provide for the transposition of European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles &ndash; commonly referred to as the ELV directive &ndash; and for a legislative framework for its implementation in Ireland. The amendments are primarily concerned with providing enabling powers to facilitate the satisfactory implementation of the ELV directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive incorporates measures aimed at meeting new ELV recovery and recycling targets of 85% reuse/recovery by 1 January 2006 &ndash; 80% materials recycling &ndash; and 95% reuse/recovery by 1 January 2015 &ndash; 85% materials recycling; ensuring that all ELVs that come within the scope of the directive can be deposited free of charge by their final owners at authorised treatment facilities and then dismantled, treated and recovered in an environmentally sound manner; introducing systems whereby certificates of destruction are notified to the competent vehicle registration authorities on the deposit of ELVs at authorised <Col N="1689" /> treatment facilities for appropriate treatment and recovery; and minimising the use by vehicle manufacturers of hazardous substances in vehicles.</P>
    <P>In simple terms, the directive requires producers to take financial responsibility for the free take-back and recovery of ELVs with effect from 1 July 2002 in respect of vehicles put on the market from that date and 1 January 2007 in respect of all vehicles. Thus, the final owners of ELVs covered by the directive will be entitled to deposit their vehicles at permitted dismantlers free of charge from not later than 1 January 2007. This will be a far cry from the current position where responsible ELV owners generally deposit their vehicles at vehicle dismantlers or shredders for treatment and recovery, incurring, in a significant percentage of cases, a gate fee in the process. The implementation of the free ELV take-back provisions of the directive should result in a reduction in the number of ELVs abandoned by their last owners, thereby reducing their availability for joy-riding and other anti-social purposes. This should ease the burden on local authorities who have had to deal with the collection and recovery of abandoned vehicles from their own resources.</P>
    <P>Significant costs will be involved in upgrading dismantling facilities to the standard required by the directive. It is generally acknowledged that there are significant deficiencies in the vehicle dismantling and shredding sectors and these issues will have to be addressed to ensure that these will be capable of meeting the onerous new standards which the directive will impose. These matters have been, and will continue to be, the subject of discussions with the economic sectors concerned with a view to the early introduction of workable arrangements which will be not only in the interests of the environment, but also of road safety and car owners generally.</P>
    <P>In relation to the transposition of the IPPC directive, one of the key underlying aims of the Bill is to enhance environmental compliance. Of particular importance in this regard is amendment No. 8, which introduces a revised section 63 to the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992. The purpose of the revised section is to ensure that local authorities can, and do, exercise their environmental responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The original section 63 foresaw the EPA providing advice and assistance to local authorities for the purposes of environmental protection and, where necessary, requiring local authorities to act in a specified manner. However, the general supervisory role for the EPA envisaged under section 63 did not develop as originally foreseen. This was due in part to some rigidities in the wording of the section and, in part, to a &ldquo;let out&rdquo; clause which left room for argument about financial resources available to local authorities to perform the functions in question. The new section 63 is an instrument for real action by the EPA and local authorities in cases where this is necessary to protect the environment. It provides for a <Col N="1690" /> graduated series of actions by the EPA, initially relying on a partnership approach, where it is concerned as to the environmental performance of a local authority.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency will be able to request information from local authorities; carry out broader assessments of local authority performance; provide advice, assistance or support; where appropriate, issue for comments a proposed direction to the authority to take specific action within a specified timescale; and amend or confirm the direction following consideration of any views offered by the authority or decide not to confirm it. In addition, where an emergency arises or is imminent the agency will be able to issue a direction immediately to ensure timely action. Other important amendments aim to improve environmental enforcement and compliance.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6 requires the courts, in imposing penalties under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, not only to have regard to the risk or extent of damage caused to the environment arising from an offence, but also to have regard to the remediation required. The issue of remediation is also dealt with in amendment No. 10 which precludes the agency from issuing an IPPC licence unless it is satisfied that necessary remedial measures will be taken if an accident occurs.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of pursuing environmental compliance, amendment No. 9 makes provision for implementation in Ireland of possible future EU legislation to secure better implementation and enforcement of EU environmental legislation. One of the results of the work to date in this regard at EU level has been a recommendation of the Council and Parliament on minimum criteria or standards to be followed by competent authorities in the carrying out of environmental inspections. The new section makes appropriate provision for its implementation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The application of IPPC licensing to the intensive agricultural sector was raised in this House. Some changes were made in the Dáil on foot of these discussions, namely, in amendments Nos. 12, 14, 58 and 59. The key points are that the threshold at which licensing becomes mandatory for pig breeding units has moved for sows from 650 places to 750 places and in relation to integrated units licensing will occur at 285 places rather than 275 places as originally proposed. It has also been made mandatory, rather than discretionary, for the EPA to operate the special concession in the directive which allows practical considerations to be taken into account in the licensing of intensive agriculture. It has been clarified that the EPA may require information in relation to lands proposed to be used for land-spreading of slurry.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the Bill relates to the enforcement provisions of the Waste Management Acts. These are being strengthened through a number of important amendments made in the Dáil. The fines for offences under the Acts have been <Col N="1691" /> increased significantly by virtue of amendment No. 27. As in the IPPC code, the courts will have regard to remediation when deciding on the penalties.</P>
    <P>Under amendment No. 28 a new provision is being included through which landowners can, having regard to certain factors, be deemed to be complicit in illegal dumping activities on their lands until the contrary can be proved.</P>
    <P>The powers of authorised persons to stop, inspect and detain vehicles under the Waste Management Acts are also being strengthened by virtue of amendment No. 29. In addition, in support of more effective involvement of the Garda Síochána in certain enforcement cases, amendment No. 26 enables the Garda Commissioner to appoint members of the Garda Síochána to be &ldquo;authorised persons&rdquo;, ensuring that the powers under the Acts can be made available speedily to individual gardaí, where necessary.</P>
    <P>In relation to enforcement issues, amendment No. 49 provides that the courts, when addressing the costs dimension to orders under section 57 of the 1996 Act, can make provision to cover the costs incurred by the agency in carrying out investigations associated with the section 57 order application.</P>
    <P>The Dáil also made amendments which introduce a number of improvements to the licensing provisions of the waste management code. Amendment No. 36 explicitly requires the agency, in making decisions on licence applications, to have regard to the policies of the Minister and the Government in relation to waste. In addition, the matters in relation to which the agency must be satisfied before granting a licence have been expanded, under amendment No. 37, to include a number of additional issues, largely mirroring the IPPC code.</P>
    <P>Given that waste licences issued by the EPA include provisions in relation to post-closure after care of waste facilities, it is no longer necessary that the EPA should be required to review a waste licence in every case where an activity ceases. Accordingly, amendment No. 42 changes the current mandatory requirement in this regard and gives the agency discretion in the matter. At the same time, however, amendment No. 45 provides that while licences shall cease to have effect after three years have elapsed since the cessation of an activity, it makes clear that the cessation of a licence does not affect or diminish the conditions, obligations or requirements the licence places on the licensee.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 35 introduces an important mechanism for resolving any dispute as to whether a particular waste activity is licensable by the agency or permissible by a local authority. In the event of such a dispute, the agency will make the final determination on the matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the licensing provisions of the waste code, amendment No. 55 includes a provision which sets out the transitional arrangements to apply in moving from the waste manage<Col N="1692" /> ment code as it now stands to the new scenario following the commencement of the relevant provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the charging provisions of the Bill, amendment No. 33 clarifies that the power of local authorities to refuse to collect waste can be invoked not just where there are unpaid charges under the new regime to be introduced under the Bill, but also in relation to charges under the existing regime which remain unpaid. In addition, amendments Nos. 33 and 54 will ensure that the making and enforcement of waste charges by the local authority manager cannot be frustrated by actions taken by the elected members under other provisions of the local government and waste management codes.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 makes a number of changes in relation to issues connected with the interface between planning and waste. In response to circumstances which have arisen in one local authority area, whereby the elected members have adopted a development plan which includes provisions designed to undermine the regional waste management plan, the amendment provides that in such circumstances the provisions of the waste management plan must prevail. In addition, to support the continued growth in recycling activities, the amendment introduces a requirement that new developments make appropriate provision for modern waste management facilities.</P>
    <P>This is important and extensive legislation which has benefited greatly from lengthy consideration in both Houses. As the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, stated at the start of the Second Stage debate in this House: &ldquo;Legislation alone is not enough, but without a strong framework of rules and regulations we will not achieve the environmental quality to which we aspire and to which the Government is committed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I seek clarification of a matter. The Minister of State has presented a report to the House on the amendments made by the other House. I do not consider his statement to be a full report as it does not include commentary on several amendments. I do not know what the technical amendments mean, as required of me as a legislator.</P>
      <P>I request that the Acting Chairman ask the Minister of State to make available to the House, before the end of the debate and in adequate time, an explanation of the technical amendments. Failing this, I ask that the debate be adjourned until such time as the requested explanation is available. As a legislator, I am not in a position to judge the technical amendments and their effects as we have not been given a full report.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the time allocated to this Stage, especially given that 62 amendments, covering 35 pages, have been made by the Dáil. It now appears that the Bill was not thoroughly thought through at draft stage. When it was debated in the House, Members on this side submitted numerous amendments, probably as many as were submitted in the Dáil. Many of them were guillotined. I am glad to see that, on reflection, the Minister changed his mind in that he accepted in the Dáil a number of amendments he refused to accept when moved in this House. We do not like piecemeal legislation of this kind. Rushed legislation makes bad law.</P>
      <P>I abhor the manner in which the Minister has used the legislation to remove functions from local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the provisions of amendment No. 54, the Minister's next step will be to abolish local authorities. As it is, he is reducing the functions of local authority members on a daily basis, despite the fact that they seek a mandate from the people every five years. They are the voice of the people at local level. The Local Government Act has also further depleted their powers. It is a shabby way to treat the bedrock of local democracy.</P>
      <P>I am gravely disappointed at the manner in which this Bill is presented to the Seanad on the penultimate sitting day of this session. I support my colleagues in seeking additional time for debate. We cannot realistically be expected to accept the Minister of State's report, especially in view of the number of amendments made to the Bill by the Dáil. Matters have been compounded by the fact that Members received copies of the amendments only this morning. Mistakes have been made in the past by rushing legislation through the Oireachtas. Several Bills have had to be amended in consequence and I have no doubt that amending legislation will be required to rectify the mistakes inherent in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State indicated his intention only to explain the purpose of the main amendments made by the Dáil. However, in fairness to the public, all amendments must be fully explained. The Minister must explain why he accepted an amendment in the Dáil which he emphatically rejected when proposed by this side <Col N="1694" /> of the house on Report Stage. It extends the threshold at which licensing becomes mandatory for pig breeding units, from 650 places for sows to 750 places, while licensing for integrated units will occur at 285 places rather than 275, as originally proposed. On Report Stage, we pointed out that the 750 places and 285 places, respectively, were a requirement of a European Union directive. Why did the original draft contravene these requirements?</P>
    <P>Several other amendments require detailed explanation, including those dealing with the right of local authorities not to collect household waste. Will the Minister of State indicate who will make people comply with waste collection charges? Senator O'Meara, the Minister of State and I travel to this House from counties Tipperary, Donegal and Longford respectively and we see the way in which fields, pavements, roadsides and ditches are littered owing to indiscriminate dumping from cars and so on. When will this problem be addressed? It is the most often discussed issue among foreign visitors. Indiscriminate dumping in the countryside gives them a very bad impression. It will only increase if local authorities are not obliged to collect refuse.</P>
    <P>There are no provisions for waivers for the elderly and others who are not in a position to pay the full charge for the collection of waste. When this becomes law, the cost of domestic waste collection will greatly accelerate. The less well off will not be in a position to bear the brunt of the charges. The waste will have to go somewhere and the result will be more indiscriminate dumping. The matter must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Funding to implement the provisions on waste collection and dumping, such as the provision of cameras on cul-de-sac roads, is required. Most local authorities do not have the money to provide the necessary infrastructure to implement this and previous legislation. It is several years since there was a national anti-litter campaign. It is time all local authorities were encouraged to combine their efforts in all-out campaign against indiscriminate dumping in the countryside. The Minister should be proactive in this and should ensure that the necessary assistance is provided. He could, for example, ensure the availability of freephone numbers to enable members of the public to highlight instances of illegal dumping.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the short time allocated to consider the 62 amendments made by the Dáil to the Bill. I would appreciate if the Minister of State could explain them in more detail and highlight the major changes. Perhaps he would consider our request to give more time to this Stage. Rushed legislation makes bad law. We do not want to waste the time of the House in having to consider amendments to the legislation at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this extremely important legislation. I cannot understand why Senator Bannon feels there has not been adequate time to discuss <Col N="1695" /> the Bill when 40 hours have been devoted to it in both Houses. As the Minister pointed out, he has dealt in great detail with the main amendments and I have every confidence in the Members of the Dáil and in the Department's officials. By addressing its technicalities, they can only have enhanced and strengthened the Bill.</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendment which addresses end-of-life vehicles. Dublin has long had a huge problem with abandoned cars and vehicles which are commonly referred to as &ldquo;company cars&rdquo;. Children as young as 12 years of age can buy an abandoned vehicle for as little as &euro;50 and take it onto the roads. It is a major problem. The amendments made in the Dáil deal comprehensively with this issue and this is to be warmly welcomed. The achievement of the goal of 85% recycling of materials by 2007 can only be of benefit to everyone. A person with a vehicle which has reached the end of its life can bring it to a centre without incurring a charge as the cost is borne by the original supplier of the car. The person can be secure in the knowledge that cars left at such a centre will not return to the roads under a different registration or in the hands of a child of 13 or 14 years of age. This provision is also welcome.</P>
      <P>When this Bill was discussed in the House previously, particularly on Committee Stage, I felt the Minister paid very close attention. It is obvious now that he did. While he is under no obligation to accept Committee Stage amendments in the Seanad, during the time which elapsed before the legislation came before the Dáil a process of discussion and democracy in action took place. Changes were made on foot of that process. While a Minister may reject an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad, a similar provision may be produced after a period of discussion within his party and with other parties and outside bodies. The changes made through this process can only strengthen a Bill. In this instance, the Minister is to be commended for making the changes he did to the Bill while it was before the Dáil. In many cases the changes which have been made serve to strengthen the hands of local authorities in the area of waste management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a huge problem with the issue of charges, particularly in Dublin where certain political parties have hijacked for political purposes the fact that people are now required to pay for waste removal. Their motives have nothing to do with the good of the environment or of the people who produce the waste. These parties have used people's fears to score political points, but it is not working. Since wheely bins were introduced, the streets have been cleaned up. On estates in the suburbs, the bins can be seen outside houses on collection day. The vast majority of people have no problem with paying to have their waste removed. They realise that we will reach a point at which charges will be imposed according to the weight or volume of waste, which is an encouragement to begin to recycle. If <Col N="1696" /> my children see me throwing out a newspaper, they point it out to me as a result of changes in the educational process.</P>
    <P>The amendments made in the Dáil serve only to enhance the Bill. When the legislation was first before the Seanad I gave it a warm welcome. As the Minister pointed out, it represents part of an overall strategy to improve our environment. Senator Bannon spoke of driving across the country to see streets which are littered with rubbish, but there have been vast improvements in the past three or four years. No one can argue with that. The plastic bag levy has worked and the revenues being generated are being invested directly in waste management. Only this week, the world's foremost waste water management facility opened in Ringsend. Such are the changes taking place. I commend the Minister on the introduction of the Bill. As part of our overall strategy, it will strengthen the effects of the changes being made to our environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed my unhappiness at the manner in which we are dealing with this legislation. I stated on the Order of Business my dissatisfaction with the time allowed, but I am also unhappy with the way in which information is being imparted to us. I am not happy that we are not addressing technical amendments. I have not been provided with the information necessary to do that. While I hope the Minister covers the technical amendments in his reply, the unsatisfactory nature of the procedure in respect of this Bill means we will not be given an opportunity to respond to any issue raised. I am very unhappy about that and I intend to take the matter further. At the very least, spokespersons should be briefed on all amendments before coming to the House in time to be able to consider them actively. The Minister's statement should have been circulated well in advance of this Stage.</P>
      <P>During yesterday's discussion of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002, many Members on all sides expressed concern at the treatment of the House. Unless we stand up for ourselves, we will continue to be walked over. I do not approve of the way we are operating this morning. Clearly, it is a poor way to approach legislation. I will raise the matter with the Leader of the House and my colleagues on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and ask that departmental officials brief Members. On this Bill alone, there are 62 amendments, most of which the Minister says are technical. We have no way of knowing if he is correct. Sometimes a Minister tells the House an amendment is technical which subsequently turns out not to be. At the very least, ministerial statements should be circulated in advance and a briefing should be available. Departments have no problem with briefing Members generally and when a scenario such as this occurs, that should be built into the process. We have such a scenario in two instances today and it is simply not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" />I would not be at all surprised if problems were to arise in respect of this legislation at a future date. The Bill was substantial when it came before this House originally and it has been considerably amended by the Dáil. Major elements are contained in this important legislation which have significant implications, particularly for local authorities and the way in which they do their business, especially in terms of the environment. It also has huge implications for householders and major implications for the role of local authorities which we have, in effect, emasculated. I am still a member of a local authority and my colleagues and I have been carved out of the process. One wonders why anyone would wish to be elected to a local authority when one sees the extent to which powers have been undermined and abolished, particularly in relation to waste. Local authority members have been undermined in terms of how they may speak and act on behalf of their communities.</P>
    <P>The last amendments referred to by the Minister, particularly amendments Nos. 35 and 54, are draconian and should be challenged under the Constitution. Unfortunately, I will not make that challenge but they should be challenged because they are far too wide ranging and draconian in their intent and effect.</P>
    <P>This legislation was designed to do two things in general, to transpose the directive and remove from local authority members the power to impose charges for the disposal of waste, particularly household waste. It was designed to give the manager superpower status in setting charges and ensure that people who do not pay them do not have their bins collected. However, the legislation that has returned to this House is a more powerful measure.</P>
    <P>There are some welcome amendments, such as the ELV amendments. I am relying on the Minister's interpretation of these amendments but I will give him the benefit of the doubt. The amendments relate to the ELV directive and the recovery and recycling targets for ELVs. The disposal of ELVs is a thorny issue and has become more so with the introduction of the NCT. I have had experience with this problem in a wooded area where I go walking when I get the opportunity. One day I counted five dumped vehicles in this beautiful environment, damaging it considerably. Happily, when Coillte was alerted to the situation, it dealt with the disposal of the vehicles at its own expense.</P>
    <P>Old vehicles are regularly dumped. One often gets calls from residents' associations, for instance, to notify one that a car has been abandoned in an estate or on the side of the road. In some cases, when a car is abandoned, the local authority collects it and leaves it in a local authority yard. That is not acceptable or fair. It is an uncivil thing to do and I hope the provisions in this legislation will discourage people from damaging their environment and being uncivil to their communities in this way. However, as with litter and dumping, there are some people who will not <Col N="1698" /> comply with the law, regardless of how easy compliance is made for them. Nevertheless, I hope the framework in this legislation will work.</P>
    <P>Who will carry the burden for implementing these provisions? The Minister referred to the original producers. I am glad there is an attempt to ease the burden on local authorities but the Minister also spoke of the &ldquo;significant costs involved in upgrading dismantling facilities&rdquo;. I presume we will be lobbied about that as well. Who will pay for it and will it be free to the user who will, ultimately, pay for the upgrading of dismantling facilities and the disposal of ELVs?</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 deals with the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities. This is one of the more substantial amendments to what is, in effect, a new Bill. The amendment looks good when one reads it. However, how will it work in practice? It gives the Environmental Protection Agency considerable powers to direct a local authority to carry out certain functions, reports and so forth and to act in a particular way. In general, that is a solid and good proposal. I support giving the EPA such powers. However, what will the effect be on local authorities?</P>
    <P>The issue of resources is critical. The main reason that local authorities are unable to carry out their statutory functions in relation to the environment is lack of resources in terms of personnel and money. I can give one example, although it is not a particularly good one because it relates to old mining activity, which is not covered by the waste management legislation. I have raised this matter on several occasions in the House. There is a severe environmental problem in the Silvermines area outside Nenagh which is caused by the old mine sites that were abandoned by Mogul Ireland and other mining companies. The EPA and the local authority have roles in dealing with it but, ultimately, it is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The Department is currently working on it but, unfortunately, at a snail's pace, which is not as fast as I or the community would like.</P>
    <P>The local authority has the role of monitoring pollution from the tailings pond but I do not believe it has sufficient resources, in terms of personnel and so forth, to carry out that function. If the local authorities are being given such a major role in environmental controls relating to pig farms, dumps and the like, they must be resourced to carry out that role. Giving the EPA the power to force the local authorities to act in a certain way sounds good in theory but we must ensure that the local authorities are not placed in an unfair position due to lack of resources. The framework in the legislation is stronger than it was originally and I accept the Minister's comments on the need to strengthen it.</P>
    <P>We have to conclude this debate at 12.30 p.m. and I am aware that other Members wish to contribute and the Minister will have to reply. However, there is a great deal to discuss in the amendments. I will limit my remarks but I must <Col N="1699" /> comment on amendment No. 54, a draconian amendment which provides that &ldquo;a local authority shall not, by resolution, . . . . . require any act, matter or thing to be done or effected where the effect of such direction or requirement would be contrary to, or inconsistent with, this section and any such resolution purporting to be passed under the said section 140 which contravenes this subsection shall be void.&rdquo;  It further provides: &ldquo;The manager of a local authority may make an order prescribing that waste placed for the purposes of its being collected. . . . . In so far as there is any inconsistency between the provisions of an order under this subsection and bye-laws made by the local authority . . . . . the provisions of the order shall prevail.&rdquo;  Paragraph (c) provides: &ldquo;The manager of a local authority may by order amend or revoke an order made by him or her under this subsection. . . &rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is, according to the Minister, to ensure that the making and enforcement of waste charges by the local authority manager cannot be frustrated by actions taken by the elected members under other provisions of the local government and waste management codes. It is designed to ensure that elected members cannot do anything the manager does not wish them to do with regard to waste management and collection. The manner in which the amendment is devised goes so far as to undermine local government completely and to deliver an unprecedented blow to the role and powers of local authority members. In that regard, it cannot be supported.</P>
    <P>I could say more on these amendments but I will defer to other Members who wish to speak. The manner in which we are dealing with this Bill is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the amendments made during the 40 hours of discussion on the Bill since it last came before this House serve to strengthen it. Senator Bannon spoke about the agricultural sector and the amendments in that regard are welcome. The Minister also took note of the discussion in this House. Many of the amendments that were made in the Dáil had previously been discussed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the EPA, the powers of local authorities and local elected members were mentioned. I, too, would like to see how this Bill will be operated by the EPA because its responsibilities are enormous. The elected members of local authorities agreed the waste management plans which county managers are now implementing, with very little change. Where councillors identify problems within their own area, it is important that the EPA act as a judge in terms of how the local authority members view the Waste Management Bill and the county manager operates it. We look forward to seeing what happens. County managers have a responsibility to take into account the views of the elected members of local authorities and only a very unwise county man<Col N="1700" /> ager would implement something that did not have support in his or her own area.</P>
    <P>Many changes may be made to environmental legislation in the future. This is an honest attempt by the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas to implement the most important and fundamental legislation to come before the Houses in many years, the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003, transposing EU law into Irish law. We recognise the tremendous responsibility of local authorities and Members of the Oireachtas to protect our environment. Many tributes have been paid to the youth of the country who have played their part in the past. Old age pensioners currently benefit from the provision of free services such as electricity. Given that the cost of waste disposal is so high, this issue should be examined, perhaps not under this Bill but in the context of the Finance Bill and the free schemes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on implementing these changes and look forward to dealing with the amendments in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In my introductory statement I stated clearly that I would focus on amendments other than those of a technical, textual or consequential nature. Examples of such are amendments Nos. 1 and 2. Since the Bill was first introduced, the title of the Minister has changed to include heritage. Amendment No. 4 is a correction to the text &ndash; it is more appropriate to refer to the 1992 Act as a whole rather than the preliminary part of the Act. In amending the Bill we will capture all parts of it. Amendment No. 17 is a correction to the syntax of the Bill by replacing the word &ldquo;for&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;of&rdquo;. This is merely a flavour of the textual amendments. We do not have much time. That is the reason I focused on the more substantive amendments.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an important one and all Members of both Houses appreciate the necessity for it. We differ on various sections and amendments but it has the effect of strengthening the law on industrial and other activities which have the potential to damage the environment. Its provisions impact for the good of all. The key environmental media are given an enhanced focus for action by the Environmental Protection Agency to secure energy efficiency and regulate greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change. The Bill also contains new provisions to improve the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation. It contains a number of key decisions which are essential in order to further strengthen our approach to waste management. In short, the Bill is significant and a substantial addition to Ireland's environmental legislation and signals the Government's determination to ensure the environment receives the protection it deserves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU directive on end-of-life vehicles is a major addition, one which is welcomed by all. The Minister and I were very anxious to take this opportunity, if the House will forgive the pun, to use the Bill as a vehicle to transpose the EU directive into Irish law. Senator Brennan is right <Col N="1701" /> in saying we have problems throughout the country in relation to this. This will ensure there will be a structure in place. We will sit down with the stakeholders and vested interests with a view to working out what is best for Ireland before the Minister signs any regulations.</P>
    <P>It is a credit to this House and the Members of this and the other House that changes have been made in relation to the issue of pigs and sows. Senator Brennan and others were anxious that such changes be taken on board. We did not make the changes here on the day in question but took the opportunity to reflect on what Senators had said. We also tried to take into account and include other suggestions to strengthen the Bill as best we could and make it much more practical.</P>
    <P>In regard to indiscriminate dumping, we took the opportunity in Part 4 of the Bill which comprises a number of amendments, to improve and further strengthen anti-litter action. Legislation is being implemented but I am sure everyone would agree that it is not enough. Citizens have a major role to play. All of us should call on our own people up and down the country. The country does not belong to the Government, the Seanad or the Dáil. The counties do not belong to the councillors. They belong to the people who have a responsibility to ensure the environment is protected. The buzzword is &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo;. This applies to employment also, not just the environment. It also applies to social and economic factors. The people are responsible. We are the custodians of the environment and must pass on this country in a better state than we found it. We have a broad framework of legislation within which we must work in relation to the collection of waste.</P>
    <P>I served on a local authority for many years and my county is a microcosm of the rest of the country. I know from experience that it is not the less well-off who do not pay their rates or meet their commitments. They are anxious to do this. What they want is a good service. The privatisation of waste collection has resulted in a reduction in some counties. Sligo is a typical example. If people are unable to pay, they can make a case to the county manager, if it is being collected by the local authority, to consider granting a waiver. If it is being collected by the private sector, a case can be made to the community welfare officer. Generally, there are not many people who cannot pay and county managers or community welfare officers should try to deal with these cases. It would not be right not to pay to let waste built up in the front garden in the hope it will be collected some time. That will not happen. It would be sending out the wrong message if we allowed people to think that.</P>
    <P>In considering the Bill both here and in the Dáil the Minister and I were open to and accepted Opposition amendments, including amendments Nos. 58 and 59 to which Senator Brennan referred on the question of farming interests. We had a long debate in our own party about this. The Minister thought long and hard <Col N="1702" /> about it and agreed to introduce these amendments.</P>
    <P>The question of waste charges has been discussed at length. Waste charges must be levied. We accept the polluter pays principle. It is a matter of EU law. This cannot be avoided, even if we wished to do so. Neither can I allow a situation to materialise where some elected representatives may attempt to frustrate the manager in collecting charges. Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 will address these concerns. We know from recent experience that some councillors have attempted to undermine their own plans.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred, in particular, to amendment No. 8 and issues concerning resources. Such issues are important and are being addressed. However, there is a danger that doing so can become an excuse for inaction in specific cases. We, therefore, need a general instrument for the EPA to supervise local authorities properly in crucial cases which will not be a daily question for it.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to waste plans, since I am aware of the time constraint.</P>

      <P>Making the design of waste management plans an executive function has already been discussed at length in both Houses. Our approach is fully vindicated by the recent attempts on the part of a small number of councillors to undermine their own waste and development plans in Galway. We cannot allow further stalling. The plan currently in place must be implemented as soon as possible. We simply cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>As I said in my opening remarks, the Bill has received extensive consideration in the Houses, from which it has benefited greatly. Other than in a relatively small number of respects, it has been generally well received. This reflects the fact that care for the environment is a key responsibility for everyone. As I said, we are all custodians of the environment and cannot point the finger at local authorities. We all have a responsibility when we see people flicking the cigarette packet, the bottle, the plastic bag or whatever it may be, which brings me to the major success of the plastic bag levy. When we see this happen, we have a responsibility to report those concerned. We cannot have local authority representatives at every crossroads to police matters. First and foremost, this is our country and we have a responsibility to ensure we pass it on in a better state than we found it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that the Bill completes the transposition into law of the 1996 EU directive on integrated pollution pre<Col N="1703" /> vention and control. The control licensing system operated by the Environmental Protection Agency since 1992 is generally acknowledged to have secured a substantial improvement in environmental performance in industrial and other activities, for example, reduced air and water emissions, energy savings, and a movement to more environmentally friendly processes and lower noise emissions. The Bill will build on our success in implementing integrated licensing in Ireland in advance of the directive. We had the vision to look further ahead when introducing <Col N="1704" /> legislation some time ago, even before the directive was introduced. We are achieving substantial compliance in advance of its deadlines.</P>
    <P>I thank the Leader for her proposal to grant me a few extra minutes to elaborate. I deliberately decided to focus in my introductory statement on the substantive amendments to the Bill which have greatly improved it. The other amendments, as Senators will find if they go through them, are textual, technical or consequential.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration,&rdquo; the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. They may speak only once on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to present a summary of the amendments made by Dáil Éireann to this Bill which was initiated in this House in February 2002. In doing so I propose to concentrate on the amendments which I consider to be of most importance. If there are any points of detail not addressed in this opening contribution, I will be glad to facilitate Senators who raise any of these during the debate in my closing contribution should time permit.</P>
      <P>The carrier liability provision at sections 2 and 3 of the Bill has been refined to facilitate the payment of the fixed penalties which carriers may pay in order to avoid court proceedings for contravention of section 2 at places other than Garda stations. This change, brought about by amendments Nos. 2 to 5 in the list, has an analogue in road traffic legislation enacted since 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 6, relating to section 4, has two effects. First, it replaces section 4 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad which, Senators will recall, provided for the new offence of employing a non-national without an employment permit as well as restating the corollary offence committed <Col N="1705" /> by non-national employees. That provision was overtaken by an almost identical provision in the Employment Permits Act 2003, promoted by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. As it is now law, the provision is surplus to this Bill. It also provides a modern law on the powers of gardaí and immigration officers to enter and search premises in the context of breaches of the Aliens Act 1935 and the Aliens Orders made thereunder, and extends the scope of these powers to the enforcement of deportation orders under the Immigration Act 1999.</P>
    <P>Search powers under section 7 of the Aliens Act 1935 apply in relation to all breaches of an Aliens Order or an order made thereunder. This includes such matters as illegal entry to the State, breach of conditions of stay, failure to register with the local aliens office and the like. The search powers also applied to the situation where a breach of a deportation order was being investigated, since deportation orders were &ldquo;orders made under an Aliens Order&rdquo;, in the terms of the language used in the Aliens Order 1946. However, these orders are now made under the Immigration Act 1999, an Act which does not contain its own search and entry provision. This amendment remedies the position.</P>
    <P>The provision in the amendment is modelled on that at section 7 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 and avoids the archaic and draconian language of the 1935 original. For instance, the power to &ldquo;interrogate . . .  all or any persons found in such place&rdquo; in the 1935 Act is ameliorated in the Government's proposal to a power to ask a person's name and address. In the same vein, the text in the amendment is informed by the concept of reasonableness, a word that does not feature in the 1935 provision in any context.</P>
    <P>In section 5 amendment No. 7 inserts a new section in the Bill which restates the law governing removal of persons refused leave to land and in doing so gives effect to certain of our Schengen obligations in this area. Every state that operates immigration controls at its borders has provisions for the follow-through on those controls, namely, ensuring people who have been refused leave to enter the state are removed &ndash; usually back to where they have just arrived from &ndash; as soon as possible. Without this, the controls are meaningless. There is broad acceptance that Ireland must have immigration controls. Accordingly, we need to ensure the removal process for those refused leave to land works effectively.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Amsterdam treaty and in line with our policy of participation in the Schengen convention to the greatest extent possible consistent with maintaining the common travel area arrangements between us and the United Kingdom, we have opted into Articles 26 and 27 of the convention and thus the various Council directives which supplement those articles. Article 26, in particular, concerns itself with the operation of entry controls, as does the associated <Col N="1706" /> Council Directive 2001/51/EC. The provisions at sections 2 and 3 of the Bill fulfil Ireland's obligations under these two instruments as far as carrier liability is concerned, and this new section will implement our remaining obligations under the instruments. These obligations relate to removal of persons refused leave to enter the State and the role of carriers in facilitating that process.</P>
    <P>Let us look briefly at the provisions of the amendment. Subsection (1) is more or less in line with present law. It sets out the persons to whom the arrangements apply. The proposed section will not apply to anyone who last arrived in the State more than three months before coming to notice: the removal of such a person must take place through the deportation process.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides a power of arrest and detention for an immigration officer or member of the Garda Síochána in respect of a person refused leave to land. This is also in line with present law but with one important exception set out at paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the subsection. This paragraph excludes persons under 18 years of age from detention, an exclusion which has been a feature of immigration legislation enacted in recent years but which has not until now been a feature of immigration law generally.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) is also modelled on provisions in the Immigration Act 1999 relating to the deportation process. It makes it clear that detention under this provision is for the purposes of removal, which should take place as soon as practicable, and that detention cannot be for a total of more than eight weeks. It sets out, similar to the deportation provisions, the periods not to be included when reckoning the total.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) is also modelled on the deportation provision and concerns the question of detention where court proceedings are taken challenging the removal. Subsection (5) sets out the choice of places, based on the Schengen instruments, to which a refused person may be sent back. The most usual situation, at paragraph <i>(a),</i> is where the person is returned to the place from where he or she last embarked for the State. The remaining paragraphs set out the other possibilities, in line with the international norms.</P>
    <P>Subsections (6) and (7) address the logistics of the actual removal in the same way as at present. Similar provisions are in the 1999 Act for removal in deportation cases. Subsections (8) and (9) require co-operation with the removal, also as at present, and make it an offence to hinder the process.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) is a new feature which provides a power to an immigration officer or a member of the Garda Síochána to issue directions to a carrier for the purpose of returning a person brought in by that carrier, where known. This is the case in the majority of refusal of leave to land cases. These new powers are an enhancement of the present powers and the enhancements arise directly from the Schengen instruments. Most importantly among these new features, paragraph <Col N="1707" /> (<i>d</i>) of subsection (10) allows alternative arrangements for the removal to be made where the carrier fails or is unable to comply with a direction. Under paragraph (<i>e</i>) the costs incurred in these alternative arrangements in terms of maintenance, detention or removal may be recovered from the carrier as a simple contract debt through the courts. Under subsections (11) and (12), failure to comply with a direction will be an arrestable offence.</P>
    <P>We now come to the additional amendments to the Refugee Act 1996, which I had signalled to this House when last I contributed on this Bill and which had been sketched out by my predecessor on Second Stage in this Chamber. I will address the more significant of these here but will be glad to offer further explanation on the details in my closing contribution, if Senators wish. The explanatory memorandum which my officials prepared in the context of the Committee Stage debate in the Lower House shows, in particular, the bulk of the amendments to the 1996 Act before us today set into a consolidated text of the Act itself. Copies are available this afternoon for the information of Senators.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 avails of the opportunity presented by this Bill to bring the statutory definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; more closely into line with that in the Geneva Convention, which the Act implements, as regards the exclusion clauses at Article 1F of the convention. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has welcomed this change.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 pushes out to 2005 the first year in which the Refugee Advisory Board is to produce its first biennial report. This change arises because of the passage of time since the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 is to permit more flexible arrangements to be put in place where it is necessary to require asylum-seekers to reside in specific locations and to report their presence on a regular basis. The change allows persons authorised by the Minister to make such requirements and to be reported to, and will facilitate this responsibility being given to the staff of the reception and integration agency, which provides accommodation and caters for the other needs of asylum-seekers.</P>
    <P>We do not, as a matter of routine or policy, detain asylum-seekers while their applications are being investigated, but we do expect them to hold themselves available to co-operate in that investigation, and these provisions will ensure that asylum applicants observe that requirement.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 extends from ten to 21 days the maximum interval between court appearances in the exceptional cases where it proves necessary to detain an asylum-seeker. A person detained under section 9 of the Refugee Act as it stands must, as soon as practicable, be brought before a District Court judge to have his or her detention reviewed. If the judge is satisfied that any of the grounds set out at section 9(8) <Col N="1708" /> apply to the person, then he or she may commit the person to detention for a period of up to ten days. If the judge is of the view that section 9(8) grounds for detention no longer exist, then the person must be released. A person committed to detention in this way may be committed by a District Court judge for further periods of up to ten days, and each further period of detention is subject to review in the same way.</P>
    <P>The existing requirement in section 9(10)(<i>c</i>) of the Act that the person be brought before the courts as soon as the grounds for detention no longer apply, allied to the court review arrangements, are to my mind sufficient safeguards against anyone being detained for longer than is necessary. However, I am concerned to ensure that where the last resort of detention is the appropriate course, it should work in a way that not only secures the protection of the rights of the detainee but also does so with a reasonably efficient use of resources.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that there is no policy of mass detention of asylum-seekers either in being or in contemplation. By way of illustration, of the 25,000 or so people who claimed asylum in Ireland since the Refugee Act came into effect in November 2000, only about 30 have been detained under these provisions &ndash; a minuscule 0.01%. The provisions of the Refugee Act regarding detention of asylum-seekers are specific and targeted at situations where there is a real risk on public policy grounds that the interests of Irish society and the State can be adversely affected. That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 restates the present provisions of the Act regarding fingerprinting of asylum applicants. Fingerprinting is a valuable and non-intrusive technique for ensuring that the process for investigating asylum applications is not abused by people who make claims in multiple identities and in many countries. However, for some time I have been concerned at the growing evidence of &ldquo;child-swapping&rdquo; among asylum-seekers as well as the worrying growth in the number of unaccompanied minors arriving in Ireland. The present law forbids the fingerprinting of anyone under 14 years old, which limits the possibilities for investigating both frauds based on inflated child benefit claims and the very much more worrying concern of trade in smuggled children.</P>
    <P>The changes brought about in this replacement section permit the fingerprinting of applicants under 14 years of age, but with two important safeguards: it can only be carried out in the presence of a parent, a person <i>in loco parentis</i> or a person appointed by the health board to make the asylum claim on the child's behalf; and the decision to fingerprint must be approved by either a person designated by the Minister or a senior garda. These safeguards ensure that the child's rights are secured. The present rules about destruction of fingerprints after a certain period of time are reproduced without change in this new section 9A.</P>
    <P>In general terms, I do not accede to the prop<Col N="1709" /> osition, which is the philosophy of this section and other provisions of our law, that fingerprints should be destroyed after a certain period on civil liberties grounds. I have never been convinced of that argument. If my rights have been infringed by my prints being put in a drawer somewhere, they are not really restored by the knowledge that they have been destroyed after some period of time, although I acknowledge others may hold a different view.</P>
    <P>The principal change of substance in amendment No. 15 is in the replacement for section 11(3) of the Refugee Act. This will have two effects. It will put on a statutory footing the right of the UNHCR representative to attend any interview under the section, which has happened hitherto only on an informal basis; and it will relieve the Refugee Applications Commissioner of the need to wait in every case for seven working days to elapse after the interview before a recommendation on the application can be made.</P>
    <P>Matters which might have been raised in representations made during that period can instead be raised on appeal where a negative recommendation is made. The provision as worded does not prevent the commissioner from considering matters raised by representations made in the interval between the conduct of an interview and the making of the recommendation. In fact, representations made after the interview are made in only very few cases. However, I see little merit in delaying the progress of every case for almost two weeks in circumstances where the provision is little used and where the right of appeal in any event more than satisfies the requirements of fair procedure.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 inserts three new and important sections into the Refugee Act. The first of these, new section 11A, sets out the circumstances where, by contrast to the more normal shared burden of establishing whether an applicant is a refugee or not, that burden is to rest on the applicant alone. In particular, where an applicant comes from a country like, say, Poland which is generally regarded as safe and not a generator of refugees, this section will give rise to a presumption, rebuttable by the applicant, that he or she is not a refugee. It does not say that in such circumstances that person is never a refugee, but it puts the onus on that person to show it. I will come shortly to the process for designating countries as safe countries of origin.</P>
    <P>The second new section, 11B, inserted by amendment No. 17, sets out a range of matters to which regard is to be had when assessing the credibility of an applicant. These are largely a matter of common sense and serve to put beyond doubt what factors are relevant in assessing credibility, a matter so often critical to the success or otherwise of an asylum claim. The new section 11C puts on a statutory footing the requirement of the applicant to co-operate in the investigation of the claim and, in that context, to give all information at the earliest opportunity to the investigators.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" />We now come to what I regard as the core provisions of my proposals for reform of the Refugee Act, which are at amendments Nos. 18 and 19, with consequential matters dealt with at Nos. 15, 16, 20, 22 and 23. Between them, they offer a complete replacement for the current provisions in the Refugee Act 1996, for the foreshortened investigation of certain applications. The replacement scheme provides for the prioritisation of applications at first instance by reference to a range of criteria and the acceleration of the appeals process for negative recommendations at first instance, which have certain characteristics.</P>
    <P>In overview, the current provisions of the 1996 Act imply a foreshortened first instance investigation process for an application which comes within one of the categories set out in the current section 12(4) of the 1996 Act, with a recommendation under that section by the Refugee Applications Commissioner that the applicant should not be declared a refugee.</P>
    <P>Such a recommendation, that the application is &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo;, in the expression used in the present Act, can be appealed to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, but the appeal must be made within ten working days of the recommendation rather than the normal 15 working days, and the appeal will be determined on the papers with no oral hearing. The tribunal under the current section 16(2) may either affirm the commissioner's recommendation that an application is manifestly unfounded or set it aside and refer the application back to the commissioner for investigation.</P>
    <P>A difficulty with the current provisions is that it is often not possible to determine whether an application comes within one of the categories set out in the current section 12(4) until it has been fully investigated. The power on appeal to remit such a case for a second full investigation can lead to duplication of work for the commissioner and possibly for the tribunal if the matter is appealed after a negative recommendation following that second investigation. Far from being an accelerated procedure, it can end up in some cases being protracted and unnecessarily so. What was thought of as a fast-track process for manifestly unfounded claims turned out to be a loop which added considerably to the length of many cases.</P>
    <P>The proposals in these amendments are designed to replace these provisions with arrangements that have a number of significant features. They provide for the priority investigation of selected classes of applications at first instance, and those classes are at paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>n</i>) of the new section 12(1) in amendment No. 18. There is a power for the Minister to designate the classes for priority treatment in the new section 12(1).</P>
    <P>Selection for priority treatment at first instance does not carry any implication as to the soundness or otherwise of the basis for the application. One may compare, for instance, paragraph (<i>g</i>), providing for prioritisation of applications which are likely to be well-founded, with paragraph (<i>i</i>) <Col N="1711" /> which provides likewise for applications which on the face of it show no basis for the contention that the applicant is a refugee. Both these are classes of cases which should, if possible, receive priority treatment over the normal run of cases.</P>
    <P>Neither does selection for priority treatment mean anything less than an examination of the merits of each case. This point is worth stressing because it is an important departure from the implication of, if not necessarily the practice under, the current section 12. The Minister has the power to designate for priority investigation applications relating to safe countries of origin, and to designate those safe countries of origin having regard to the criteria set out at new section 12(4) and following consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister can at amendment No. 16 prescribe different procedures for the investigation of different classes of cases. In every case the investigation is of the merits of the claim. Following investigation of the merits of the application, whether as a matter of priority or in the normal course, the commissioner produces a report setting out the findings of the investigation and recommending whether the applicant should be declared a refugee. If the report of the investigation contains a negative recommendation and also includes a finding of any of the types set out in new section 13(6), any appeal made in that case will be dealt with in an accelerated way with the following characteristics.</P>
    <P>The time for making an appeal will, as for manifestly unfounded cases under the current section 12 of the 1996 Act, be ten working days instead of the normal 15 working days, and the appeal will be on the papers only and there will not be an oral hearing. This is similar to the current provisions of the 1996 Act for manifestly unfounded cases.</P>
    <P>The findings in the new section 13(6) are broadly comparable with, though not necessarily equivalent to, certain of the &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; criteria in the current section 12(4) of the 1996 Act. The Minister may under the new section 13(7) direct that certain classes of cases be dealt with under a special procedure with the following features.</P>
    <P>Applicants whose cases are to be dealt with under this procedure are to be notified at the start of the investigation that their cases are being dealt with in this way, and if following investigation the commissioner makes a negative recommendation and the application has one of the characteristics set out in the new section 13(6), any appeal against the recommendation must be made within four working days from the recommendation as against ten working days for other such cases, and the appeal will be dealt with on the papers without an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Appeals Tribunal's power to remit certain cases will no longer exist because it will not be necessary, and the tribunal may not set aside the commissioner's negative recom<Col N="1712" /> mendation unless it is satisfied that the applicant is a refugee. This measure is to be found in the new section 6(16A) in amendment No. 23. The tribunal will as a matter of priority deal with appeals having one of the characteristics set out in the new section 13(6).</P>
    <P>The prioritisation of cases will have to be done in a careful and balanced way. To designate everything as a priority would mean that nothing would be a priority. We have to be careful not to place an intolerable burden on the commissioner. However, proper application of this provision will result in more streamlined and effective management of the caseload of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, and that is something which will benefit both institutions and those in need of asylum from persecution.</P>
    <P>The power to designate safe third countries, to which I have already referred briefly, is a significant addition to asylum law. Its purpose is to address the increasing number of asylum claims from countries generally considered safe and from where the overwhelming majority of asylum claims are found to be without foundation. Such claims are an unnecessary burden on the asylum determination process and delay the recognition of those genuinely in need of protection. The safe country of origin concept is well recognised internationally and is a feature of asylum systems in many European Union member states. That a person comes from a designated safe country manifestly does not mean that he or she could not possibly be a refugee but it will lead to the following legal consequences.</P>
    <P>An applicant from a safe country of origin will, by virtue of the new section 11A, be presumed not to be in need of protection, a presumption which he or she can rebut. It will be a factor which may be taken into account by the Minister in deciding whether to prioritise cases under new section 12. In the case of a negative recommendation at first instance under the new section 13, it may result in his or her case being treated in an accelerated manner under that section.</P>
    <P>If a person claims that the Canadian Government is persecuting him or her, it may possibly be true and no one can deny it, but it is more likely to be untrue in light of experience because we do not believe that the Canadian Government persecutes people. In such circumstances, the applicant would take on the onus of establishing this fact. If the Minister was of the opinion that such applications were being made simply to gain a foothold in Ireland with a view to disappearing into the woodwork and never processing the claims, he or she could direct that they be prioritised and the appeal would be speeded up.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that a person who comes from a safe country is not to be denied access to the asylum procedures, and it is only after the investigation of the claim results in a negative decision that it will be subject to the accelerated appeals procedure provided for in later amendments. This is only right. If a person does not need protection, <Col N="1713" /> he or she should be dealt with fairly and swiftly but should not be allowed to delay unduly the claims of genuine applicants.</P>
    <P>Section 13(6), to which I have referred briefly already, is in effect the replacement for the &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; categories in section 12(4) of the Act as it stands. The findings set out at the new section 13(6) are broadly comparable with, though not necessarily equivalent to, certain of the &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; criteria under the existing law. They cannot be treated as equivalents in particular because these findings would apply only after negative recommendations have been made following investigation of claims to establish whether applicants are refugees, and do not necessarily go to the core of the negative recommendation. The broad correlations or comparisons are set out on page nine of the explanatory memorandum prepared by the Department.</P>
    <P>The question whether a finding listed in this subsection is to be included in the report only arises where, at the conclusion of the investigation, the commissioner's recommendation is negative. Thus, for example, the fact that an applicant did not apply as soon as reasonably practicable after arriving in the State and had no reasonable cause for applying late, as at paragraph (<i>c</i>), would not be relevant if the commissioner's investigation of the claim led to a positive recommendation that the applicant was a refugee and would not affect that positive recommendation. Findings of the type listed in the subsection form a basis for accelerating the hearing of the appeal only where a negative recommendation has been made by the commissioner. They are not necessarily a basis for a negative recommendation <i>per se.</i>Subsection (7) of the new section 13 enables the Minister to specify classes of applications to be dealt with at first instance by the commissioner under the special provisions of the new subsections (8) and (9). What is in mind here is that for a category of cases specified in a direction under this subsection there will be a special team of the staff of the Refugee Applications Commissioner dedicated to dealing with applications coming within this category within a matter of days of the application being made.</P>
    <P>Selecting the category by reference to a safe country of origin or a small number of safe countries of origin will mean that the commissioner's interviewing and decision-making staff can be expert in the background information on those countries and, with the economies of scale that this brings, can address the protection issues of the applications in the selected category quickly and directly. If, on the other hand, we were to proceed on the basis that there was no prioritisation and no specialisation, it would mean that, on a random basis, officers considering applications would have to mug up on the facts of every country without taking the elementary step of concentrating those types of application in the hands of one person or a team of persons who <Col N="1714" /> would develop a specialised knowledge of their subject.</P>
    <P>Other practical features of such a system will be the ready availability of legal advice to applicants, and, where necessary, the ready availability of interpreters to service the needs of both consultations and interviews under the Act. Applicants in this stream will be notified early in the investigation, under subsection (8) of the new section, that if the investigation results in a negative recommendation and that negative recommendation includes a finding of the type listed at subsection (6), they will have four working days within which to appeal, as opposed to ten in respect of other recommendations with such findings. Any appeal will be dealt with as a matter of priority and without an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>For this system to operate fairly and with a fast turnaround time, it is likely that the applicants selected for this high priority process will be accommodated in specific locations within the direct provision system, and required under section 9(5) of the Act to reside there and report at regular intervals to an immigration officer at that location; this arrangement will facilitate the hand-delivery of letters and notices to applicants and their legal advisers and thus help to ensure expeditious processing of the applications.</P>
    <P>Overall, this is a fair and balanced approach to the types of rejected cases envisaged in subsection (6), namely, flimsy claims; claims where the applicant lied or suppressed the truth in a gross fashion; failed claims made in order to prolong or postpone deportation; failed claims where the applicant had already applied for asylum elsewhere; and claims made by persons who live in safe countries. As with all other cases, I emphasise every such case will be examined on its merits at first instance, and if the examination shows that the applicant is not a refugee, in these special instances we will demonstrate, by disposing of the appeal in an accelerated way, that we are serious about not letting our asylum process be abused.</P>
    <P>I have also taken this opportunity to facilitate greater flexibility for the Refugee Applications Commissioner in deploying RAC resources to reduce the burden of paperwork by making certain technical changes, including the transfer of provisions from current section 11 to the new section 13. They do not impinge on the substance of the commissioner's investigative process or the fairness of the procedures as far as the applicant is concerned.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 25, as well as repeating for drafting reasons the provision already approved by the Seanad regarding consent to the identification of asylum seekers in publications, adds a new provision to section 19 of the 1996 Act which will facilitate the publication, suitably anonymised, of selected decisions of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. That is a matter Senator Tuffy and I debated when the Bill was last before this House.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 replaces section 22 of the Refugee Act, the section that enables the imple<Col N="1715" /> mentation of the Dublin Convention. The replacement provision will not only facilitate the operation of the Dublin Convention and the agreement extending its operation to Norway and Iceland but also any future agreements which Ireland may enter into with other safe countries of transit &ndash; possible other examples might be Switzerland and Canada &ndash; for the return of asylum seekers where the two countries agree to accept asylum seekers who have arrived from the other country. This is an important process. It is a safe third countries process. It will also enable the necessary domestic law provisions to be put in place to cater for the coming into effect next September of the Council regulation which is to replace the Dublin Convention.</P>
    <P>All of these instruments have in common the principle whereby those fleeing from persecution in their own countries are expected to seek protection in the first country that can offer a safe haven &ndash; a principle known as the safe first country principle, the first country being the country of origin and the second country being that where refuge is being sought. Leading academic commentators, both at home and abroad, on human rights and refugee law acknowledge that the right to seek asylum does not imply a right to seek it where one pleases. It follows that the right is satisfied if the individual in need of protection has the opportunity to obtain protection wherever it is that the individual finds himself or herself, and it is a matter for the individual to seek to avail of that opportunity. Provisions on safe third countries are, to my mind, an essential feature of any asylum system. They bring an element of order and rationality internationally to the question of providing protection for those who need it; they pose no threat to the genuine refugee and act to reduce the prevalence of multiple asylum claims and related abuses of national asylum systems.</P>
    <P>The differences between the current section 22 and the proposal in this amendment are set out in some detail in the explanatory material which my officials have supplied to Members of the House and, in particular, in the consolidated text of the Refugee Act and its footnotes on pages 38 to 41 of the appendix. Most of those differences are merely technical changes to allow for the additional instruments to be implemented under the section. I do not propose to go into them. Instead I will concentrate on the more important innovations in the new section.</P>
    <P>The first new feature is at subsection (2)(<i>a</i>), in combination with subsection (4)(<i>a</i>). These provide that the decision at first instance whether to send back an asylum applicant may be taken by the Minister, the Refugee Applications Commissioner or an immigration officer, as may be specified in an order under the section. Under the Act as originally passed in 1996, those decisions were taken by an authorised officer of the Minister; since the 1999 amendments came into effect in November 2000, they are dealt with by the Refugee Applications Commissioner. This pro<Col N="1716" /> posed change will cater for the possibility that for applications made at a point of entry into the State, the first instance transfer decision could be made by, say, an immigration officer, while for applications made inland, the responsibility could be left either with the commissioner, if it came to her attention, or by staff in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should it come to the Department's attention. This will offer more flexibility in devising procedures to deal with different streams of applications.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) provides for the possibility of an appeal against the transfer of an application being non-suspensive, in other words, a decision to transfer an application to a convention country or a safe third country can have immediate effect, even in cases where an appeal has been made, on the basis that sending the person there will not put him or her at risk of persecution and the country will be processing the person's claim for asylum, in the case of convention countries, or consistent with analogous terms of any future agreement that might be negotiated with a safe third country. This means that if we have such an agreement with, say, Switzerland and if somebody gets off a Zurich flight into Dublin, an immigration officer will be in a position to say we have an agreement with Switzerland and the person must go back to Switzerland. If the person says he or she wants to appeal against that decision, the officer will say he or she will have to appeal against it from Switzerland. He or she cannot appeal against it in Ireland. That is what a non-suspensive appeal means. It does not mean one cannot make an appeal; it just means he or she cannot put his or her foot in the door and keep it there in circumstances where we are equally satisfied that the foot would be just as safe if the door was shut against the person and he or she stood outside.</P>
    <P>Where an order provides such non-suspensive effect for appeals in these cases, it will be without prejudice to the outcome of an appeal in any particular case. Thus, if an appeal resulted in a determination that the application should be processed in Ireland, the applicant would be taken back into the State for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (<i>d</i>) of subsection (2) provides for a power of detention not exceeding 48 hours for a person who arrives in the State directly from a convention country or safe third country pending a decision on the matters set out at paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (2), those matters being whether the application should be examined in the State or transferred to a convention country or a safe third country. The purpose of this provision is to allow for the temporary detention of an asylum applicant, usually at a port of entry, while the question of transfer to another convention country or to a safe third country is being explored with that country. In other words, if a person arrives on the Zurich flight, we cannot just send that person back to Zurich if the Swiss authorities, if they were part of this agreement, were not sure if the said person actually was on the Zurich flight in <Col N="1717" /> the first place. There has to be a period for negotiation and a co-relative period of detention to enable that administrative process to take place. At present, such inquiries can take a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Dublin Regulation&rdquo; provides for the possibility of individual member states agreeing to put in place, as between themselves, arrangements for the rapid exchange of information, in particular fingerprint data and responses to requests for taking back applications. We would envisage that where such arrangements are in place there would be a fast-track process whereby the two countries would communicate by fax with each other and a quick decision would be made about a person, which would enable them to be sent back to the safe third country. Such agreements have also been entered into by certain states that are parties to the Dublin Convention, for example, Denmark and its neighbours. Prompt return of an asylum applicant to the appropriate state where the claim should be determined can be achieved when rapid response arrangements are in place. If they are not in place, the whole system breaks down in a kind of bureaucratic nightmare. Any appeal can be determined after the return and the person can be detained for a short period in order to facilitate the return.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the present section 22, which is not being reproduced in the new provision, is the present subsection (5). That subsection requires the prior agreement by a convention country to accept back an asylum application before the State may transfer it. The Dublin Convention contains provisions which fix a convention country with responsibility for dealing with an asylum claim if it fails to respond to a request for information or a request to take back the application within certain time periods. This provision prevents Ireland from availing of those provisions in the event of default by another convention country, in other words, if we get no response, we can put somebody back on the plane, which means people do not have the option of making the convention non-operative by the simple expedient of failing to respond to requests made under its auspices. For applications coming in the other direction, the State itself is nonetheless fixed with responsibility in any case where it is in default. This unique anomaly among Dublin Convention signatories serves no useful purpose and I do not propose to perpetuate it in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27, the last of the Refugee Act amendments in this Bill, addresses the question of how the new and amended provisions of the Refugee Act are to apply to applications on hand at the time that the amendments commence. Having considered the matter carefully, I am satisfied that the crucial point for applications on hand at that time is whether or not the investigative interview under section 11 has taken place. If the interview took place before these changes come into effect, then the Act will continue to <Col N="1718" /> apply to those applications as if the changes had not been made. In other words, if the interview has started the person will be dealt with under the old Act.</P>
    <P>This means that the existing Act will continue to apply to cases on hand where, at the commencement the Commissioner is in the process of deciding what recommendation to make after the interview; the Commissioner has given a negative recommendation and the time for appeal has not yet expired; the applicant has appealed the recommendation and the case is before the tribunal; the case is being re-investigated by the Commissioner following remittal by the tribunal under the existing section 12 &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; process; the Minister is about to make his decision under section 17, whether or not to grant a declaration that the applicant is a refugee.</P>
    <P>In all of these cases, the applicant had necessarily been interviewed before commencement of this new Bill. If the applicant has not yet been interviewed at the time of commencement, then the Refugee Act, as amended by this Bill, will apply, and subsection (2) of this section ensures fairness by requiring that every applicant who is to be affected by the changes will be given a statement describing the changes and pointing out how the rules under which their application has been dealt with have been altered. That has to be given to the applicant before he or she can be interviewed under the new rules.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to place in statute form the duty of public bodies to share information in their possession for the purposes of the Refugee Act 1996 or of the administration of the law relating to the entry, presence in the State and removal from the State of non-nationals, and for the purpose of the operation of the Social Welfare Acts. There is currently no such statutory requirement on public bodies. However, on the basis of common law, as affirmed by the courts in Desmond <i>v.</i> Glackin ([1993] 3 IR 67), it can be asserted that, in the absence of a clear statutory bar on disclosure of information between Government bodies, such bodies are permitted and indeed expected to share all relevant information. Having regard, however, to the variety of statutory provisions in this matter, among them data protection legislation and social welfare legislation, and the duties of confidentiality arising under those, I regard it as prudent to make a provision putting the matter beyond doubt as regards non-nationals in the State.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendments on the list deal primarily with drafting or merely technical matters. I am aware that I have gone on at some length, but it is necessary, I think, to put on the record what has happened in the other House since it did not happen in this House.</P>
    <P>The Bill approved by the Senators contains important measures designed to give the State more effective immigration control processes and, in the area of asylum law, amendments <Col N="1719" /> designed to make the process of establishing who is and who is not a refugee more efficient. Before the Bill had left this House, I had given clear indications of my intention to ask the other House to include further amendments motivated by these two concerns. There has been criticism that I should allow one Bill to go ahead and start off again with another Bill. This is a fluid situation. There are developments internationally and in Europe. There are developments on asylum law on an international basis. It is not practical for me to bring in a succession of Bills. To some extent I am dealing with a moving target. I do not use that phrase dismissively. The situation is not static. Since my officials initiated the 2002 Bill, before the last election, many new things have developed, including draft legislative proposals being placed before the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Council. We, therefore, have to anticipate these developments. I say this because we enjoy a common travel area with the United Kingdom. As a consequence, if we fall behind or diverge from the international norms, or exclude ourselves from access to important legislative tools, we will become the place of last resort, because our laws will be the most inadequate.</P>
    <P>We have to keep pace with international developments. Whereas I would love to spend many months considering every single section and paragraph of this Bill, and stand here in this House, if time and Senators' patience permitted, on this occasion, bearing in mind the requirements of the legislative calendar, if we were not to attempt to deal with these issues now, it would simply not be possible to persuade the Members of either House to give me sufficient time to re-address the issue with separate proceedings and separate Bills in the foreseeable future. It would be at least 18 months, probably, before I could get the train to leave the station and go to the other end of the line with further legislative changes.</P>
    <P>Some people may be critical of Bills mutating as they go through the legislative process. That is provided for in the regulations and rules of both Houses. I am not ashamed of taking advantage of that, because what I am trying to do is have a safe, effective and fair law. In the context of moving targets, I have to keep up with the pace of events. I hope Members of this House and the other House share my view that Ireland must be at the forefront of having an effective law.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise one other point, which I have always made when I speak on these issues and I reiterate it here today, lest it be said that by not doing so I am contributing to a general climate of misunderstanding. The great majority of non-Irish people whom we encounter in our day-to-day lives, 80% or more, have nothing to do with the asylum process and are here as of right, as people invited to take part in the Irish economy. As anybody involved in trade and industry knows, they are playing a huge and valuable role in making this State prosperous. They <Col N="1720" /> have contributed hugely to that. Therefore, I deprecate the tendency to regard everyone who appears to be foreign or speaks with a foreign accent as part of an amorphous mass of refugees or asylum seekers. This is simply not the case. The notion that everyone who is, in effect, different is somehow a product of the asylum seeking process reflects a thought pattern which one frequently detects in public discourse and, unfortunately, sometimes even in media comment.  </P>
    <P>Non-nationals in Ireland are welcome. The people have extended a warm hand of welcome to tens of thousands of non-nationals who come to our shores and work in our economy. I deprecate anybody who somehow conflates this entirely predictable pattern of international migration with the abuse of the asylum process which occurs in some cases. The great majority of foreigners are welcome, here as of right and not in any sense abusing either our hospitality or legal system. On the contrary, they are making a valuable contribution, in many cases one which Irish people are insufficiently skilled or unwilling to make.</P>
    <P>I emphasise to Senators that this legislation will not turn the country into fortress Ireland. The great majority of foreigners have no connection with its provisions. Its intention is to make our asylum and immigration law coherent and workable and ensure State resources are not misdirected by having a weak and ineffectual law.</P>
    <P>Having an effective asylum law is a question of political and social morality. Annual expenditure on asylum seeking is estimated to be &euro;340 million. It would be wrong of me to convey to the House other than the plain, unvarnished truth that the great majority on whom these sums of money are being spent are found in the end of a fair process not to be entitled to asylum protection. These funds could be spent in many other areas, including overseas development assistance or assistance to people living here, whether foreign or Irish, who need it.</P>
    <P>Anybody who approaches this legislation from the moral high ground that anything which is restrictive of the right to abuse our asylum law is somehow draconian, repressive, ungiving and mean-minded should think again. If one considers the enormous amount of resources involved and bears in mind that it is the duty of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Houses of the Oireachtas to have in place a workable law which distinguishes between those who are entitled and those who are not and deals efficiently with that distinction in order that it has factual consequences, the moral choice is to do what I am proposing in this House and have proposed in the other House, that is, to have a workable, up-to-date, modern, common sense system which separates the wheat from the chaff, if I may use that phrase, distinguishes between the abusive and genuine application, brings the genuine applicant to the top of the queue and carefully and fairly rejects the non-genuine applicant. That is all I am doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" />We have a moral duty to have our law as workable as possible. Some of those who have criticised the measures I have taken have ascended a moral pulpit which is rather rickety. When we are talking about resources of this nature, we should bear in mind that we are making moral choices consequent on the obligations which abuse of the asylum system has imposed upon us. Nobody can escape this and anybody who seeks to do so is making a mistake.</P>
    <P>This legislation has nothing to do with inclusivity, multiculturalism or having a broad and inclusive view of society but everything to do with having a law which works and has the respect of the people. Nothing is more conducive to negative stereotypes and potentially racist undercurrents in our society than the apparent failure by the State to have a law which makes the distinctions proposed in the Bill. Nothing is more likely to engender dislike, smouldering resentment and all the tinder on which racism could easily be ignited than to fail to take measures such as those proposed.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the patience they have shown in allowing me to explain the amendments made in the other House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been on his feet explaining the amendments for more than 50 minutes. If so much time is required to explain their contents to the House, something is seriously wrong with the Minister's approach. There are 30 amendments running to 32 pages. This is not the first time the Minister has tried to ram through legislation as quickly as this. The practice of putting legislation through the back door in this manner is unacceptable. I remind the Minister that this is a democracy, for which we should have respect, and in a democracy a free debate must take place before any legislative change is enacted. It should also be given sufficient time, which the Minister has not done in this case.</P>
      <P>The Minister's approach to dealing with the Bill is appalling. I accept this is important legislation and agree with many of the proposals in the amendments but let us have respect for them and give them the necessary time. To come to this or the other House with amendments of such importance and treat them in such a shoddy fashion is unacceptable in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister chose to deal with legislation of this nature in such a fashion. I remind him, as others have done in the Dáil, that during his election campaign he compared the Taoiseach with the former Romanian dictator, Nicolai Ceaucescu, who would have been proud of the Minister's legislative prowess.</P>

      <P>The explanatory memorandum was left on a table &ndash; I do not know when &ndash; to be picked up by Senators as they entered the <Col N="1722" /> Chamber. What benefit is it to us to receive such an important document when entering the House? It would have been helpful if we had been given it in time to study it. If the Minister believes he is fulfilling his obligations by providing us with information as we come through the door, he is not doing justice to himself or Members of the House. As I said, it is a shoddy way to deal with important legislation of this kind and shows a lack of respect for democracy.</P>
      <P>I will deal briefly with a couple of the amendments. Amendment No. 26, a comprehensive proposal which runs to five pages, proposes to introduce a new section to allow the Garda Síochána or immigration officers to arrest and detain non-nationals who have been here illegally for more than three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They must have been here for less than three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>If this severe proposal is enacted, the Minister will ethnically cleanse the country. The conferral of powers to carry out such functions on immigration officers must be questioned. Surely this is work for the Garda. Will the Minister explain the reason they are being conferred on immigration officers?</P>
      <P>Section 5(3)(<i>a</i>) allows for people to be detained for a period of up to eight weeks prior to their removal from the State. The detention of innocent civilians without trial for such a period is contrary to any basic human rights and the Constitution. I ask the Minister to address this. It is excessive and could surely be reduced to a maximum of two weeks.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with this Stage in a shabby manner. The debate should take the format of the Second Stage of a new Bill. If the Minister was unable to introduce these amendments at an earlier time, he should have incorporated them in new legislation. Too much has been added at the last minute, which is an unacceptable way of dealing with legislation.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot be blamed if Standing Orders of the House do not allow us to deal with the matter more effectively by considering each amendment in turn, as on Report Stage. It is for the House to regulate itself, a matter raised on the Order of Business. I hope the Cathaoirleach and members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will take this on board. Dealing with the amendments in this fashion is not the most satisfactory way to proceed. It is churlish and wrong to blame the Minister for this because it is for us to correct it. However, I concede the point made by Senator Terry that to deal <Col N="1723" /> with so many amendments in a composite manner is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>A number of common sense amendments have been made to the Bill. In the past I have criticised the Department for its failure to address adequately the issue of asylum seeking. However, in view of the experience gained, we are perhaps learning more effective and efficient ways of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's policy that genuine asylum seekers should, in their own interest, be dealt with as efficiently and expeditiously as possible, given best standard practices for processing. It is the only sensible approach to take. I have met some asylum seekers who been under stress while awaiting decisions. Much of this has arisen because so many are in the country seeking asylum status without foundation. It has significantly drained resources for the processing of applications.</P>
      <P>The amendments were fully debated in the Dáil, presumably on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>They have strengthened the Bill. Improved processing of applications was required because people have an entitlement to expect that they will be dealt with in a speedy manner.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made a valid point in that if 90% of applications are subsequently found to have no validity, there is a significant cost factor in maintaining a slow process of determination. I would welcome anything that can be done to accelerate it.</P>
      <P>Some of the amendments are sensible. For example, the Minister may now designate categories of applications, including categorising those that are well or ill founded. Perhaps he will clarify if a sequence of ill founded applications must be processed on an individual basis or can they be dealt with in a manner that will expedite the processing of genuine applications, while maintaining fairness.</P>
      <P>Previously, the Refugee Applications Commissioner had to wait for seven days after an interview to allow for further representations. However, given that little happened in this time period to alter decisions made, this provision has been abolished. This will assist the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another amendment extends the period, from ten to 21 days, between court appearances seeking confirmation on grounds for detention of detained asylum seekers. This is a sensible arrangement. It is also a waste of time and <Col N="1724" /> resources to return prisoners to court at regular intervals to confirm their detention status.</P>
    <P>There will be an accelerated process for designating categories. There are provisions to safeguard the rights of asylum seekers who will be given legal advice and provided with interpretative facilities to ensure they are well represented when making their application. The fact that the hearing will now occur in three or four, rather than ten or 20 days, will not diminish their rights. When they come to the country, they establish the grounds on which they are claiming asylum. In view of this, they should be in a position to present their case at short notice.</P>
    <P>I am sure some in the civil liberties brigade will object to the fingerprinting provision. However, it is appalling that there should be certain child swapping activities among asylum seekers. Given the need to protect children, they should not be condoned or facilitated in any way. The fingerprinting of those under the age of 14 years, especially when done, as provided, in the presence of a guardian and approved by a senior member of the Garda Síochána or a person designated by the Minster, will avoid these activities, which are done with the intent of abusing the facilities for asylum seekers. Genuine asylum seekers would want to respect the facilities and procedures if they intend to become citizens of the State. They would be welcomed as such. Those without such regard would not make good citizens.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; has been adopted as a principle, as has the welcome concept relating to those who come from a safe country of origin. The Minister dealt with the matter adequately in his address to the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry raised the powers which have been given to immigration officers to allow them to return people to the country from which they came. It is common sense to provide this power. If people turn up who will not qualify in the opinion of the immigration officer, they will be returned. We should remind ourselves that we are on the north west periphery of Europe. Access to the island is difficult and options for travelling here are limited by comparison to those available in the rest of Europe. The first country to which an asylum seeker arrives must accept its responsibility rather than allowing us to assume the responsibilities it has in the first instance. The expectation that an applicant should seek refuge in the first country that can offer a safe haven should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>If this was the case, it would alleviate the backlog here in the processing of people. Other factors besides costs, to which I referred earlier, come into play and these underline the need for an expeditious handling of applications. Like other towns and counties, the one in which I live plays its part in hosting many asylum seekers. We should bear in mind that these people are unemployed and have a great deal of time on their hands, which, unfortunately, can make them easy targets for unsavoury elements in the community <Col N="1725" /> who introduce them to fund-raising activities to supplement their wherewithal. This is not the road down which we should allow them to travel. The quicker the process is handled, the less likely these people are to be exposed to those unsavoury elements within some of our communities.</P>
    <P>The amendments which have been included in the Bill by the Dáil serve to strengthen it. Genuine asylum seekers will benefit from the speeding up of a process from which they have nothing to fear. Those people who do not qualify will have that decision conveyed to them more quickly. They will be returned whence they came, which is the sensible approach to take.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank him for his very clear explanation of the amendments before us. I am one of those who feels it would have been better if the Minister had rewritten the Bill &ndash; to see why, one needs only compare the size of the original Bill to the number of amendments. The House would have given the Minister the necessary time. We are very quick workers around here as the Leader has us on a very tight rein. We must leap along. The Minister says people must keep up with his pace which, I bet, we could have done.</P>
      <P>I am irritated by the way these amendments have been brought before the House and I hope the Minister notes the dissatisfaction among Senators of the Government parties in this respect also. Over the last few weeks I have received a couple of lectures from the Minister and one from his Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, regarding the supremacy of Parliament. These lectures pertained to my proposal that remedies be provided before the courts for those whose social and economic rights are abused. The Minister and the Minister of State informed me that Parliament had to be supreme and that the courts could not be allowed to bring forward rights of that nature. The manner in which this Bill is being brought before the Seanad today is not respectful to the House and it fails to acknowledge the supremacy of Parliament.</P>
      <P>We could easily have got through the Bill if the Minister felt it was urgent. I have no argument with a great deal of what is contained in the legislation and there is not a huge number of Senators interested in the question of immigration. Had he requested it, the Minister would have received co-operation from all sides to allow him to put the Bill through. Despite Senator Walsh's comments, the Bill has not been examined properly in the Dáil and the same is to be true of its passage through the Seanad. It is very difficult for us to explain to people why we have agreed to such legislation when we have had no opportunity to discuss it or to hear further arguments on points we wish to raise. It is regrettable and unhelpful to bring legislation before the Houses in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The asylum process is important and we do not wish to see it abused. However, we wish to ensure <Col N="1726" /> that the legislation we introduce is seen as fair by those seeking asylum. I am concerned by some of the amendments which have been made. The extension of the detention period from ten to 21 days in section 9 makes that period very long. A judge will not review the legality of the detention during that time. No other European state has legislation of this sort as it is not considered best practice.</P>
    <P>Having had dealings with many asylum seekers, it is a matter of grave concern to me that after seeing a commissioner a person can be deported within four working days. Many asylum seekers have fled persecution and torture. I presume the Minister has visited the residence on the North Circular Road for those who have been tortured abroad and spoken to those who are dealing with them. It is difficult to get full stories even after people have been staying at the centre for some time. Some have already been granted refugee status which is why I am extremely anxious about the speed with which deportation can take place.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere, the Bill provides that an interpreter will be provided if one can be found. Amendment 15(ii)(2) provides that the commissioner shall, where necessary and possible, conduct an interview with the assistance of an interpreter. Unless the commissioner speaks many languages, it will be extraordinarily difficult to get much sense from the interview process. Surely, it is essential to ensure that the asylum seeker knows what is happening. This provision is extremely lax.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 to section 11B which addresses credibility is also of concern. The Minister must have spoken to people who have attempted to obtain asylum status in which case he will certainly be aware that one of the first things they are told is to get rid of false documents. Provisions in this regard are made under sections 11A and 11E. It is unfair to decide a person is manifestly unworthy of asylum due to lack of documents given that those fleeing countries in which they are being persecuted are unlikely to go to the border with their own passport. The provisions of this section are patently ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about section 11B(<i>c</i>) which refers to applicants who have provided a full and true explanation as to how they arrived in the State. They will not give that information because it might put the lives of their family and goodness knows who else in danger. I am dismayed that this and the credibility of their case will be taken into account rather than the merits of their case. I cannot see how these measures will help to prevent the abuse of the asylum procedure. All they will do is put people more in terror of getting themselves into such a mess that they will be thrown out of the country.</P>
    <P>Section 5 makes good allowances for children, and rightly so. However, I am concerned, especially in view of the recent case where a woman gave birth on the high seas, that a heavily pregnant woman should be given some consideration and that there should be discussion of her <Col N="1727" /> case with the health board. In the most recent case, the good actions and training of the employees on the ferries, the fact that there was a doctor on board and the fact that the woman was normal and healthy meant that she and her child were safely delivered. However, when a woman is obviously pregnant, she should not just be put on the boat and sent back. There should be some discussions with the health authorities about her. I was sorry to see what happened in the recent case.</P>
    <P>The new concept of safe third countries is being introduced into the Bill. This was not included in the Bill as initiated. Countries which might be safe for me and the Minister might not be safe for other people. Sending people back to other Dublin Convention countries might not mean they will be deported to what the Minister and I would consider a safe third country. I have spoken about this issue previously in the House and given a number of examples. Some years ago, for example, I occasionally appealed on behalf of doctors from Iraq. One of them, a surgeon, had fled the Iraqi army because he was being asked to amputate the limbs of deserters. I was told that Iraq was a safe country to which he could return. Shortly afterwards, however, half of the world had to invade Iraq because it was so dreadful and had weapons of mass destruction which could be shot at us in 45 minutes.</P>
    <P>Another case involved a woman, a midwife, from Nigeria, an area where <i>sharia</i> law is enforced. She had spoken out against female genital mutilation. I got as far as the appeals commission with her and was told it was perfectly safe for her to return to Nigeria, yet we are encouraged to write to the Nigerian ambassador to protest at the stoning to death of a young woman who has had a child outside matrimony. I do not know how safe it will be for a woman who spoke against female genital mutilation to return to Nigeria. She fled despite having a good job there. She has not been able to work in this country even though we are desperate to recruit midwives. She was at sister tutor level and I have attended lectures she has given.</P>
    <P>What is a safe country for one person will not be for another. Look at the United States of America. If the Minister goes there, he will not be put in Guantanamo Bay, although I do not know about me. What happens in the case of somebody from Pakistan or Afghanistan seeking refugee status here? Would it be wise to send them back? How safe would those countries be for them? The Minister, alone, makes that decision, with a little assistance from his friend, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. That is not a good idea.</P>
    <P>We should have debated this legislation in greater detail because it might have been possible to omit some of the provisions. It would have made the legislation easier to understand for the public. I am glad the Minister said foreigners are welcome here. If they were not, the health service <Col N="1728" /> would collapse and, possibly, much of the retail and hotel trade. We need to treat foreigners in this country well but this Bill does not appear to accord much respect to those who are in most need of being treated well in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy" hpid="Ms Tuffy Ms Tuffy">
      <NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unhappy with the way this legislation has been dealt with by the Minister and the Government. The Minister is correct to point out that legislation is always changing. We are not criticising that but we are criticising the level of change to the original legislation and the speed with which those changes were made.</P>
      <P>The changes limit the input of Members of the Oireachtas and interest groups on this issue. This legislation impacts badly on the role of Senators. We did a great deal of work on the Bill when it was initiated here. The debate took place over a number of days and amendments were made. Now a huge number of additional amendments have been made and we have had no input into that process and only a limited debate on them. The Human Rights Commission described the additional amendments as amounting to virtually new legislation. Various provisions were removed from the Bill in the Dáil, because of the work permits legislation, while 22 pages of amendments were added on Committee Stage with a further ten pages of amendments added on Report Stage yesterday. Again, the opportunity to debate them in the Dáil was limited. Various interest groups and bodies, such as the Irish Refugee Council, contributed to this legislation on Committee Stage in the Seanad but they had no opportunity to do so with regard to the new substantial amendments.</P>
      <P>On a positive note, I welcome the fact that changes were made on foot of Labour Party proposals in the Seanad and the Dáil. The Minister criticised the Labour Party in various fora and accused it of somehow filibustering this legislation. He should acknowledge, however, that the Labour Party was most proactive in terms of trying to improve the legislation and acted in good faith. In accepting a number of our party's amendments in both Houses, the Minister acknowledged that fact but it should be acknowledged today too. The time limits for applications, for example, were extended on foot of my suggestion, even if they were not extended as much as I would have wished. The Labour Party raised the issue first in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party still has many concerns about the legislation. I have raised a number of them, including the huge responsibility these new provisions impose on carriers, including non-commercial carriers. We also expressed fear that the new provisions will deter genuine asylum seekers from seeking asylum or endanger them because they will seek non-legitimate ways of getting access to this country. They might not even get here and we should not wish that to happen. I am also critical of the provisions whereby applications can be deemed withdrawn and that there is no appeal process, save through the Minister. <Col N="1729" /> The applications can be deemed withdrawn despite the difficult deadlines that must be complied with in the application procedures. I have serious concerns about the provisions in relation to safe countries and the fast tracking procedures. I also have problems with some of the provisions in the new work permit legislation.</P>
    <P>The overall approach of the Government in this legislation is negative, as can be seen in the legislation's negative provisions and framework. It reflects the way the Government deals with the immigration issue. It is a crisis management approach. This can be seen in the way the legislation has been handled, in the way whole rafts of amendments were introduced at various stages and bits taken out of the legislation, and in the urgency with which the legislation on work permits was dealt with. That is a crisis management approach which is required because of the negative framework in place. I urge the Government to reconsider its approach and introduce a more comprehensive and positive overall framework for immigration legislation which puts economic immigration on a proper footing, that treats asylum seekers fairly and ensures they are protected and encouraged to seek asylum here and that also ensures efficiency and prevents abuse of the immigration system.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party has such a comprehensive immigration policy based on a green card system which was broadly welcomed by interested groups, including the Refugee Council, when we launched it a couple of years ago. Such legislation would tackle many of the current abuses. It would put a proper economic immigration system in place, there would be less reason for legitimate applicants to abuse the system, and the Government could become heavy-handed with those abusing the system. However, many of those who currently abuse it do so because they have no choice, given that the system is so bad in terms of their coming to this country when they have good reasons for coming here.</P>
    <P>The Minister has hinted in the media that he is examining the Labour Party's idea of a green card system. I urge him to do so. I reiterate that I am very unhappy with the way the legislation has been presented to the Seanad. It treats the House unfairly. For that reason, I oppose the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Senators for their contributions to this very important legislation. In relation to a few points that have been made, the explanatory memorandum, prepared by officials in the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, has been on the Department's website since 23 June. Since then it has been available for scrutiny by Members of both Houses, interest groups and all members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Terry appears to have misunderstood the effect of amendment No. 7 which merely restates, with some enhancements, the present law regarding the return of people who have been <Col N="1730" /> refused leave to land and are deemed to have been so refused. She might have acknowledged that the new provision rules out the possibility under present law of detaining under 18s. Immigration officers, mainly members of the Garda Síochána, have always had these powers and the new provisions extend them to all gardaí, not the other way around, as she seemed to suggest.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh raised the question of combining unfounded applications for the purpose of processing. I stress that every applicant will obtain an individual consideration of his or her application on its merits. That is as it should be. However, central to the new provision is the introduction of accelerators to speed up the processing of abusive claims. What we are dealing with is prioritisation, provision of shorter periods for appeals and generally for streamlining of procedures and documentation.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the question of interpretation. The position is that interpretation will always be provided, where practicable and possible, having regard to the fact that for certain languages there is a limited number of interpreters available within the State. However, where no interpretation is available immediately in the State, UK interpreters have been used or, in rare cases, applicants have had to wait until interpreters have become available.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry also mentioned the situation in Nigeria which has a very brutal legal system which involves stoning people to death for adultery. A number of sentences have been passed. I do not know to what extent sentences have been carried out. It is my understanding this only applies in the Muslim part of Nigeria and that people have the option of moving to the other part of country rather than making the 3,000 mile trek to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy raised the question of the Labour Party's input into the legislation. The Minister acknowledged, both in the Dáil and the Seanad, that the Labour Party had helped to improve the shape of the legislation. However, what the Senator said rather defeats her other argument because the Labour Party made a number of considered amendments, suggestions and proposals, some of which the Government accepted. The Labour Party seemed to understand this very well, which implies there was ample time to study the legislation quite closely and get a good grasp of it. In the Dáil Deputy Costello objected to the first amendment in the name of the Minister. He said he did not have time to study it, yet he was able to table 30 amendments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be too contentious but there is a certain level of hypocrisy. I have attended public meetings in my constituency and elsewhere, not necessarily about immigration, where <Col N="1731" /> the question of immigration arose from the floor. The general tone at the meetings was critical of the Government for not doing enough to control illegal immigration. It was pointed out, not unreasonably, that we were spending about &euro;350 million a year on immigration and that 90% of cases were unfounded. Some are patently unfounded, yet it is costing the taxpayer &euro;350 million a year to operate the system. I have been accompanied at those meetings by elected members of Senator Tuffy's party, and they are the first to agree with the crowds that the Government is not doing enough and should be doing more. We are doing more and thank everybody who is supporting us.</P>
    <P>The views of various organisations have been mentioned. I know and respect those organisations. I have friends within them. I believe I speak for the vast majority of the Irish public, supporters of all political parties, when I say there is a very strong strand of public opinion that we need to do something to control the flow of illegal immigration. We are doing this. Second, even the <Col N="1732" /> human rights organisations agree that we should do something that would enable us to dispose quickly of manifestly unfounded applications and deal properly with those who have a genuine case to be considered refugees within the terms of the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy's suggestion that people make false asylum claims because they have no other choice is based on a fallacy. We have means for those who immigrate into Ireland on economic grounds to do so legally. Her line would encourage people who do not meet the legal requirements to tell lies in order to circumvent them. This damages the interests of those who need the protection of the State as well as the interests of the State and Irish society as a whole.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody who commented on the legislation in the Seanad and the Dáil. I thank those who have made constructive suggestions which the Government has been able to take on board. This legislation will bring about enormous improvements to the processing of asylum applications.</P>

      <P>The Glanbia workers in Rooskey and the surrounding areas are disappointed with what has happened. Up to 400 jobs have been lost in the Longford-Roscommon-Leitrim areas. Many small farmers, whose livelihoods depended on the plant, will be ruined and shops and community businesses, etc, will be adversely affected. Following the deferral of Cardinal Health last year, this is a blow too many for our area. At the same time, I welcome Abbott Laboratories to Longford. This company will provide worthwhile jobs in the county. Longford County Council has moved fast and efficiently in granting it planning permission.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter in the hope that the Minister will make a full and open statement as to what Government grants were made to Glanbia and what intervention measures were taken by the Government to attempt to keep it open. The people of Longford trusted the Government promises that Glanbia would be rebuilt. They deserve a detailed breakdown of the measures that were presumably taken in an effort to save the plant. Nearly 14 months after the Glanbia plant was destroyed, the company finally stated that it would not reopen the Rooskey facility but would instead invest in its plants at Edenderry and Roscrea. This has left the Rooskey workers in a precarious position, with over 400 families affected. Over and above those who worked in the plant, shopkeepers and other sections of the community have been affected.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that the cost of rebuilding the plant would be in the region of &euro;30 million. A similar sum is now being invested in the other two facilities. Does this sum represent Government grants given specifically for Rooskey? Did the Government offer any financial incentives to Glanbia to retain the Rooskey plant?</P>
      <P>I do not need to go over the number of promises to the midlands this Government has broken. They are too numerous to mention. The figures speak volumes and they have been documented in both local and national newspapers since the Government returned to office. Even during the previous five years there was little or nothing delivered to this area. It deserves better treatment than it is getting.</P>
      <P>Generations of local people have worked at the Rooskey plant since the 1940s. There was a great pig processing plant there which was a source of regular local employment. I compliment the Hanley family from Rooskey which provided those jobs for the area during bleak times. The plant was later taken over by Irish Country Meats and latterly by Avonmore which became Glanbia. All that is left of this once thriving plant is the cannery facility. As the rest of the 40 acre site lies idle, it is important a facility is put in place. We must ensure that Cardinal Health comes to Longford when it comes on stream. It has been promised and a huge workforce is available.</P>
      <P>The grim news for Rooskey follows the closure of the Atlantic Mills factory which is only six miles up the road from Rooskey in the Tarmonbarry-Clondra area. It employed over 500 workers at its peak. These closures show a total disregard for the counties of Longford and Roscommon. I call on the Minister to face up to her responsibilities to the people of Longford and Roscommon. Adequate measures must be put in place to assist workers, and their dependent families, affected by this closure. I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Bannon for sharing his time. Senator Feighan also tabled a motion in the last few days on which he agreed to share time with me.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the 350 workers in Rooskey, County Roscommon who have lost their jobs. The cannery remains but we do not know for how long as canneries require raw material to stay in business. The Hanley family was in operation for the last century and left a great legacy. The workers have provided great products and a tremendous service to the people. As a former Minister with responsibility for trade, I worked in Japan selling Irish pork from the company which was ahead of its time and whose products were held in high regard.</P>
      <P>The Glanbia building burned down and the insurance company should insist that the building is restored. The money cannot and should not be moved to Edenderry or Roscrea to build up the plants there. I was a Deputy when the UMP factory in Ballaghadereen was destroyed. Both I and the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, ensured that Avonmore bought it over and rebuilt it in Ballaghadereen. At the time I said that the Government would not be responsible for its closure but would be responsible and involved in the reopening of the plant.</P>
      <P>Glanbia should not receive any grant support if it does not rebuild the plant. It is needed in Rooskey for the suppliers in Monaghan, Cavan and the north west who have been loyal to this company over the years. This is a serious situation. There is a public meeting next Wednesday night, which I intend to attend. I publicly appeal to Glanbia plc to reconsider the situation, re-build the factory in Rooskey and provide the jobs that are so badly needed in the BMW region. Roscommon has not received its fair share of jobs in the past number of years. The IDA has let us down in that regard. I appeal to the Government not to support Glanbia's proposal to develop Edenderry and Roscrea.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Bannon for sharing his time with me. I was at a meeting in Rooskey last Wednesday night at which great anger and concern was expressed that this factory could be lost to the area. Just 13 or 14 months ago, before the fire, this factory had been due to expand and its workforce increased. There is a suggestion that the main reason the factory is moving away from Rooskey is that Government Ministers represent the constituencies to which it is proposed to move the factory's capacity. I ask the Minister of State to refute that suggestion. Will the Minister of State ask the Tánaiste to set up a special task force to replace the jobs in this area, which has become a black spot? We have cross-party support on this matter in the Seanad, which is as it should be. In Roscommon, Longford and Leitrim, we are all wearing one jersey and will campaign vigorously to ensure that these jobs are replaced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who wants me to thank Senators for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Since the fire at Glanbia Meat's plant at Rooskey, County Roscommon in May 2002, the company had been examining the possibility of rebuilding its pig slaughtering plant. Unfortunately, the outcome was the announcement by the company last week that the rebuilding of the Rooskey plant was not going to proceed. The company had indicated, subsequent to the fire, that it was its intention to re-build the plant. However, despite extensive exploration of options by the company, it proved to be uneconomic to do so.</P>
      <P>According to Glanbia, the restoration of lost capacity into the existing facilities at Roscrea and Edenderry was seen as a better long-term solution for the company and its producers. Senators will appreciate that the re-building of any plant is a matter for the individual company itself. While the Glanbia decision, based on commercial considerations, is not to rebuild the Rooskey facility, it will develop the existing Roscrea and Edenderry plants. Decisions on the future configuration of its operations are entirely a commercial matter for the company itself. As part of a proposed &euro;27 million investment in the rationalisation of slaughtering facilities with a view to improving competitiveness, an additional 150 jobs will be created between the Roscrea and Edenderry plants.</P>
      <P>In effect, plans are now being developed to reshape the business, using the fire as a catalyst for change. Glanbia Meats has been in detailed discussions with Enterprise Ireland, seeking support for the proposed investment with a view to maximising the level of value addition that will take place in Ireland. This proposed investment is seen as critical in order to establish a sustainable strategic position for the Irish pig meat industry, matching international competitive and best practice standards. The plant in Rooskey has received grants of &euro;3.4 million from Enterprise Ireland. In addition, it also received financial assistance under the EU FEOGA programme.</P>
      <P>A voluntary redundancy scheme has been agreed with the workers at Rooskey and 290 people have already left the company on that basis. Most of the redundant workers have registered with FÁS, which is offering them the full range of services available, including skills analysis, job placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable courses. The existing Glanbia Meats cannery at Rooskey, employing some 95 people, will be developed and a number of growth initiatives are being explored.</P>
      <P>The State development agencies are fully committed to addressing the adverse situation arising from the job losses in Rooskey. IDA Ireland is committed to playing its part in the development of the Midlands by maintaining the maximum number of existing jobs in overseas industry and by attracting new foreign direct investment into the region. The agency has strengthened its commitment to the midlands by establishing its health care division, together with part of its property and regions divisions, in Athlone. Enterprise Ireland will work with the management of Glanbia Meats to assist any staff members who wish to pursue starting up their own businesses. This will be done in co-operation with FÁS and the county enterprise board.</P>
      <P>The State development agencies are fully committed to the promotion of employment creation in County Roscommon. The agencies work closely with each other and with the development bodies in the area, including the Roscommon County Development Board and Roscommon County Council, as well as other local bodies and interests, in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development. This existing co-operative framework can be used effectively to deal with job losses and job creation in County Roscommon.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State ask the Minister for Education and Science to give us an update on the urgent need to provide extra school places in Lucan, particularly at primary level, for this coming September and for future academic years as well as the need for additional places at second level? It is urgent that this matter is addressed in time for September, when children should be starting school. It is a matter of emergency in Lucan, which is the fastest growing area of the country according to the Central Statistics Office. It is evident that primary school provision has not kept pace with development in Lucan. I have met parents who have had to travel with their children to school up to now, but it is an ever-growing problem. I have been in contact with all the schools to get a picture of the situation and there is no doubt from the information I have received that there will be a shortfall unless emergency action is taken by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>A number of families do not yet know whether they will have a school place for their children in September, including children who are well into school-going age. Many are being told to look outside Lucan, but that is not acceptable. Public transport provision to other areas from Lucan is bad and it is only right that children can attend their local primary school. My understanding is that they have a right to do so. Some pupils are being asked to defer their education until they are older and I am aware of a case in which one sibling has a place in school but that there will be no places for the younger siblings. Schools are turning people away on a daily basis, which is stressful for school principals who are struggling with the situation and doing a huge amount of work to try to get it dealt with by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Having consulted with others, the solution I suggest is that the Department should, in the short term, provide temporary additional accommodation for September, including prefabs or alternative buildings. A new school in Lucan was trying to get access to a site which is reserved for it. The Department should have made sure that the school had access to that site for September so that it could erect a prefab and take two new primary school classes. If the Department does not act, the school will not be able to take additional students. That means there will be many parents who have no option as regards educating their children in Lucan. I do not understand why the Government cannot adopt the policy of borrowing for infrastructure such as school buildings. It is an investment in the community and there is a building at the end of the process. One cannot simply accept that costs are a reason for not providing for children's education.</P>
      <P>Accommodation for secondary schools is also set to become a major problem. The local community college held a lottery for secondary school places and, from the available figures, it appears there will be a shortfall. When adjustments are taken into account in the schools in which people have applied for a place, there will be secondary school students who will not have a place in the Lucan area this coming September. That is a situation that will worsen unless the Government starts to act now. I would like to hear the response of the Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position of the Department of Education and Science on this issue. The Minister for Education and Science is fully conscious of the issue raised by the Senator.</P>
      <P>Lucan is the fastest growing area in the country. As a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for school places, particularly at primary level. In order to meet this demand the Department of Education and Science has taken steps to increase the capacity of existing schools in the area by way of the provision of permanent and temporary accommodation. Building projects have recently been completed at Scoil Aíne junior school and St. Thomas's senior school to increase the capacity of each of these schools to 16 classrooms. Construction of the new Lucan Educate Together national school will be finalised for September this year. The capacity of the school will be 16 mainstream classrooms with an autistic unit. The Department is also arranging for the installation of a prefabricated unit at Archbishop Ryan national school. This unit will be installed over the summer and available for September.</P>
      <P>A new school, Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school, was established in the Lucan area in September 2002. The school is currently located in the Scout Den in Lucan village, which accommodation is insufficient to meet the school's needs for September this year. In this regard, officials of the Department are in communication with the school authorities with a view to having alternative accommodation in place for September.</P>
      <P>As the Senator is aware, the local authority, at the Department's request, reserved a site in the Griffeen Valley area for primary school purposes. The Department has instructed the property management section of the Office of Public Works to enter into negotiations with the owners with a view to acquiring the site. The Senator will appreciate that in view of the commercial sensitivity of the site acquisition process I am not in a position to comment further on the matter at this time. However, at this stage, it is not expected that the site will be available for the forthcoming school year.</P>
      <P>Primary provision in the Lucan area, in particular south Lucan, will continue to be monitored by the Department. At post-primary level the Department has already responded to the demand for additional school places in Lucan by approving major extensions at two schools in the area, both of which are under construction. A new permanent building for Coláiste Cois Life is also in architectural planning.</P>
      <P>The Senator will also be interested to note that following consultations with the Department, South Dublin County Council has also reserved a site for post-primary school purposes in the Adamstown strategic development zone. This is intended to assist in catering for the future needs of the Lucan area. It is expected that the measures outlined will alleviate pressure on primary and post-primary school places in Lucan.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 4 July 2003.</P>
