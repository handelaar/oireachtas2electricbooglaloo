      <P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the reason for the decision to close Newtownforbes secondary school on the outskirts of Longford town.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mansergh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to indicate the steps she will take to find replacement jobs following the job losses at the Pall Corporation factory in Tipperary town.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism to encourage the airline and hotel industries to adopt a more flexible approach to cancellation charges in view of the crisis in the tourism business.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the folowing matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to intervene with Teagasc to ensure the decisions it has taken regarding office closures will be reversed.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Bannon, Mansergh and Henry as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Feighan as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 2 be deleted. On Thursday the Government proposes to take Report Stage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill in the House at the same time that a committee of the Houses is considering the matter. This is an unprecedented move. If the Cathaoirleach had allowed me to finish, he would have heard me say I believe an amendment to Standing Orders is required if such a move is to be considered. That is the reason an emergency meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should now take place. Senators O'Toole and Ryan made this request on Friday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time the Government took the House seriously. We will go through a charade this afternoon. Two members of the Government are no longer with us and we would have more success were we to have a live link with the paddocks at Cheltenham. It is most unfair to Members that the Minister and Minister of State responsible for this legislation will not come before the House today. A Minister with no responsibility for the legislation will come here to defend it. It is utterly wrong that this procedure should be upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this is not the view of the Leader and I know she is under instruction. We object to this procedure in the strongest possible terms. I ask the saner members of the Government to recon<Col N="1529" />sider this issue. This is not the way to conduct business; it is, in effect, the Government giving the &ldquo;Harvey Smith&rdquo; to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Brian Hayes's proposal. In my 15 or 16 years in the House, it is without precedent that a request from three groups for a special meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges would not be conceded. While I accept the Chair has the authority to do this, I do not think it is correct. The issue was raised out of concern about the way business is conducted in the House. This is a real issue and the House will be brought into disrepute in the business it will deal with this week.</P>
      <P>The committee system and structures and the relationship between Members and the legislative process are important. It is unacceptable that a committee of the House is consulting on a Bill without considering either what we have to say or the outcome of consultation. This is appalling and I can find no logic in the Government's position. We are awaiting the outcome of those negotiations. Under the terms of the original Act, the Information Commissioner is entitled to give a view on the operation of the Act and he will do so within the next 12 hours. That we are not to have that available to us when we are dealing with Committee Stage cannot be accepted or justified. It is completely wrong. We are ignoring the Information Commissioner, users and a committee and rushing the Bill through the House without the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to Ministers taking time off &ndash; they are hard working and entitled to do so. They can be away and we can defer considering the legislation. There is no need to deal with the Bill this week. Let us not become involved in an argument regarding their whereabouts. If they have to be elsewhere, for whatever reason, that is their business. However, they should be here to bring the legislation through the House. The effect of this is that no amendment will be accepted. The Minister dealing with the legislation will take the brunt of the Opposition's opprobrium and will not be in a position to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Colleagues on the Government benches hold views on this legislation that are not dissimilar to mine. I know this because I re-read the debate on the original legislation, which came before the House in 1997. I know the view Members hold, but they have been silenced and told what to do. It is like &ldquo;The Silence of the Lambs&rdquo; on the Government side. The fact that they do not have views to offer indicates that something is wrong.</P>
      <P>The last time something was rushed through in this way was when we dealt with the rod licence legislation. What we are doing is utterly wrong and we will pay the price for it. It does not reflect well on any of us. It is distasteful that we find ourselves in this position. I firmly believe that Members from the Government parties hold my view and that there are things which could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" />I wish to make one final point. There is a degree of goodwill on this side of the House. There are certain changes to the Act that must be made and it should be acknowledged that time and again Members on this side of the House have said as much. They agreed that changes would have to be made and said they would support them. There were issues relating to Cabinet confidentiality which had to be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>New Senators might not be aware of this but there is nothing written anywhere to prevent long speeches on the Order of Business, except that it takes time from other Members. The record shows that a former Leader of the House spoke for 45 minutes on the Order of Business. It can be done, although I do not intend to do so at this stage.</P>
      <P>The image of the House is at risk and the way we conduct our business has been brought into disrepute. This is food for the cynics. I second the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment before the House. I do not support the Order of Business which is a farce, nothing more, nothing less. A Bill of such magnitude which deals with the accountability of Government decisions is being rammed through the House with speed and in the absence of the Minister involved. Not only is he absent &ndash; he also has shown his contemptuous attitude by publicly declaring that he is leaving the country while the Bill is being dealt with in this House. The House and the legislation are being treated with utter contempt.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed, a Chathaoirligh, that you were unable to respond to the request from this side of the House to convene a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to discuss the matter. It is reprehensible to commence Committee Stage of the Bill while we are awaiting the results of the discussions at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on the legislation. It is unprecedented to proceed with Committee Stage of legislation before an Oireachtas committee has discussed the matters at the heart of it. The legislation deals with extremely serious issues, of which the most fundamental is the accountability of Government decisions. The decision of the Government to ride roughshod over a fundamental principle of our democracy, because it can, is an abuse of power and cannot be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Freedom of information does not appear to be required when documents and reports are being leaked prematurely from the <Col N="1531" />task force on medical staffing. Will the Leader of the House give a commitment that when the report is published, it will be brought before the House and the Minister will be invited to the House to discuss it? It is causing great concern. The leaked report, published in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, indicates that some hospitals will be downgraded. This is causing unnecessary anxiety to staff and patients, particularly in hospitals such as Roscommon County Hospital where &euro;8 million is being spent on the development of an accident and emergency department. Other developments are on stream as part of the major development of the hospital.</P>
      <P>The same applies to Portiuncula Hospital which the Western Health Board bought in 2001 for &euro;14 million. I was chairman of the board at the time. It is obvious that the Government will not buy a hospital for &euro;14 million and then decide to remove some of its services. That would be ludicrous. I am amazed that these reports&mdash;</P>

I am appalled by organisations and those who mischievously leak reports to try to undermine them before they are published. It is a matter for the Government and the House. I ask the Leader of the House to deal with this issue in March, if possible.</P>

      <P>I find it rather strange that the Information Commissioner, whose remit includes the freedom of information legislation, was not even consulted when the report came out.

I abhor the fact that the Minister and Minister of State, who piloted this legislation through the House earlier, will not be here to deal with it this week.

      <P>I wish to raise an issue that I know is of concern to many Members and to the wider community. I refer to the plight of our elderly emigrants, particularly in Britain, many of whom feel deserted and are living in deprived, insecure conditions. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, raised this issue yesterday and went as far as to say that it was payback time for these emigrants.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that over the years such emigrants invested up to £2 billion here in repatriated earnings, which many people consider provided the seed capital for the affluence we enjoy today. It would be wrong of us to ignore them and turn our backs at this stage. They are entitled to a dividend from the prosperity we currently enjoy. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, should attend the House to discuss the matter with us.</P>

      <P>I endorse the comments made on both sides of the House about leaked documents. A serious issue arose yesterday concerning a leaked document on the penalty points system. It appears that some sabotage is going on regarding a very important programme that was launched by the Minister for Transport. We have heard that RTE obtained a report on the penalty points system, which seemed to spin in favour of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>If there is any question of the Garda Síochána spontaneously sabotaging a Government policy which aims to save lives, it is a serious matter. If that is the case, it is time we had a debate about the role of the Garda Síochána and what they are up to. Let us hope they are not acting as some sort of autonomous republic, independent of the Minister to whom they are answerable.</P>

It is important that we have a proper debate on this issue and not one in which Members will be hoodwinked.

I understand that other hospitals are to suffer the same fate. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the Hanley report.</P>

      <P>I join previous speakers in raising the issue of leaked documents, particularly the document leaked by gardaí in recent days. This is a serious issue given that gardaí are trusted as the custodians of the security of the State and its institutions. If such leaks are taking place, I ask the Leader to inquire from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform if it is his intention to hold an inquiry into the matter. Regardless of the contents of the leak, the fundamental issue is that, as Senator Ross stated, custodians of the security of this State leaked a document. There are serious questions regarding the motives behind this leak. On the other hand, we should congratulate the Garda, regardless of its motives, on its efficiency in carrying out a review in such a short period. Considering that the penalty points system was only introduced in November, one begs to question the motives behind the review and the purpose of this leak. I ask the Leader to take up this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a matter of urgency.</P>

There is a serious reason that such a motion should be taken. Questions were recently asked in the Dáil about Tibet and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, gave the following reply:</P>
      <P>On 3 December I set out the approach of Ireland and our EU partners to Tibet. There has been no change of policy in this regard. In common with its EU partners, Ireland regards Tibet as an integral part of China and the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legal Government of China.</P>
      <P>That is not true. It is time we called the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House to explain why such a violent and undiscussed change of policy has taken place.</P>
      <P>When we entered diplomatic relations with China in 1979 no mention was made of this in the discussions or exchanges of documents. The former Fianna Fáil Minister, the excellent Frank Aiken, in debates at the United Nations in 1961 and 1965&mdash;</P>

      <P>I look forward to the debate on hospitals, a matter in respect of which I am in absolute opposition to almost everything which has been said so far. I hope people do not play politics with hospitals because they are far too important. We should not toss around words like &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo;. It is a question of whether one wants five or six hospitals in the premier league or two dozen in the third division. I know which option I would take.</P>
      <P>I find it ironic that Members are getting into a lather about leaks and freedom of information. It is an indication of the complexity of the subject. In a previous incarnation, I used to investigate leaks and I generally found they were more a case of the reservoir overflowing than of information being deliberately leaked. I would not put all the blame on the press.</P>
      <P>The last point I wish to make has been made more difficult by Senator Norris because I do not want to throw accusations around. With regard to the dignity of the House, it is a pity the relevant Minister will not be here when serious legislation, the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, is being taken.

This is a worrying development which throws the health strategy into chaos. When the main hospital in Dublin is cutting jobs and beds it calls into question plans to improve services and increase bed capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If implemented, the findings of the leaked report would mean that counties such as Kerry, <Col N="1538" />Mayo, Donegal and Kilkenny will have no regional hospital. I ask Senator Maurice Hayes to consider the recent case of a woman from Carlow who almost choked while driving to hospital in Kilkenny with a bone stuck in her throat. How would she have felt if, as a result of the implementation of this leaked report, she had to travel to Waterford? </P>
    <P>I am appalled by the Minister for Transport's reaction to the leaked report of the Garda internal audit. He seems to be more concerned with the leak than with the report's contents. The Minister has not come before the House for some time. We should debate this issue. We were given an assurance that a Garda traffic corps would be established, yet we now have reports that these plans have been dropped.

      <P>Senator Brian Hayes proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, on which I expect there will be a vote. He spoke about the Minister with responsibility for the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill not <Col N="1540" />being present. An excellent Minister of State will come into the House to deal with the Bill and I know all Senators will observe the courtesies in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole seconded Senator Brian Hayes's motion. He spoke about the Information Commissioner and the fact that useful amendments were often tabled on Committee Stage which made good changes to legislation and wondered if that would happen on this occasion. Senator O'Meara agreed with the two earlier speakers and said it was an abuse of power.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden raised the matter of the Hanly report referred to in the newspapers today. I understand there are two major reports, the Brennan report and the Hanly report, and as soon as they are officially issued, they could be the focus for a useful debate in the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucane supported Senator Brian Hayes and said that while some Senators were not critical of the Ministers' absence, he was on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Murchú, echoing a speech which I understand the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs gave in County Mayo, spoke about the plight of elderly emigrants who, he said, were now entitled to a dividend from our current prosperity. Senator Tuffy supported Senator Ó Murchú on the question of emigrants, in particular the housing needed for elderly emigrants returning to this country. We will ask the Minister when he can come to the House to talk about the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross raised the issue of the penalty points report which he said appeared to have been leaked by the Garda. We do not know who leaked it&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Bannon talked about hospitals and asked about the need to treat patients outside the country when reports were <Col N="1541" />being issued about hospitals here. I would welcome a debate on the Hanly and Brennan reports when they are issued. Senator Kitt referred to the position in which Portiuncula Hospital found itself following the report in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan referred to the leaked Garda report. It appears that way but we must await developments in that regard. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was quite explicit. As I understand it, he did not berate anybody but simply made clear that he had not been asked for extra resources. Senator Norris asked whether it was the Garda which had leaked the report. We should suspend judgment until we know more. The Senator also called for a debate on No. 14 on the Order Paper, an extensive motion about Tibet. He also supported Senator Brian Hayes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Terry mentioned the Garda report. However it came about, it is a very serious matter because of the effect it could have on behaviour on the roads which was motivated in the main by the possibility of being caught speeding and picking up penalty points. The Senator also wel<Col N="1542" />comed the opening of the National Aquatic Centre. It is wonderful that it will be available for the Special Olympics. I will leave her to take up with the Taoiseach the question of how he got from one place to another.</P>
    <P>From his extensive knowledge of hospitals and public administration, Senator Maurice Hayes spoke about the need to have a debate in the House. He regretted the absence from it of the Minister concerned for a serious Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne also mentioned the Garda report and the dangerous side effects it could have while Senator Paddy Burke asked the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss the overrun on transport projects. Senator Coonan said the Government was attacking the Garda Síochána. I did not hear any Minister attacking the force in any way. We, in the House, are careful to say we cannot state categorically who leaked the report.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (6), to delete from and including &ldquo;(6) Where&rdquo; in line 45 down to and including &ldquo;it.&rdquo; in line 49 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Where in an application under <i>subsection (1)</i>&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) the High Court has fixed the reasonable market rates, or an arbitrator has issued an award under <i>subsection (4)</i>, and prior to the High Court making a final order in respect of the application, or</P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) in the circumstances referred to in <i>subsection (2)</i>, the High Court indicates that it will fix the reasonable market rates for coverage of the event after the event has taken place, and prior to the event taking place,</P>
      <P>the qualifying broadcaster may withdraw the application. The High Court may in these circumstances, having regard to the intention of the broadcaster making the application, award such costs to such party or parties to the application as it considers appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This substitute amendment No. 2 amends section 4(6) of the Bill by making it clear that a qualifying broadcaster may also withdraw its application to the High Court for access to a designated event in circumstances in which the court has indicated that it will, in accordance with subsection (2), fix reasonable market rents after the event takes place. The intention in the original subsection (6) was to ensure that the finding of the High Court with regard to reason<Col N="1545" />able market rates would not be binding on a qualifying broadcaster where it decides not to broadcast the event.</P>
      <P>However, the conditions under which a broadcaster may withdraw its application to the High Court are very specific. It may do so after the court has fixed reasonable market rates, but before the court makes its final order. This construction would not allow a broadcaster to withdraw its application in circumstances in which the High Court has decided to allow access to an event and to fix reasonable market rates after the event has taken place. This might be too big a risk for a broadcaster to take as the High Court may have set a rate that the broadcaster would not have been prepared to pay in the first instance.</P>
      <P>Substitute amendment No. 2 also deals with the subject matter of amendment No. 3, proposed by Senator Finucane. I agree that it is to be expected that a qualifying broadcaster should only proceed with a bona fide application to the High Court. It is helpful to include guidance for the court on the factors that should be considered in determining how costs should be awarded. The High Court should have regard to the intention of the broadcaster making the application and, accordingly, I propose this amendment to give effect to the principle that when awarding costs pursuant to subsection (6) the High Court should have regard to the intention of the broadcaster making the application. This deals with the matter raised in amendment No. 3 and I hope Senator Finucane agrees.</P>

      <P>I accept the spirit of what the Minister said, which I felt was in accordance with the reason I tabled amendment No. 3. The context of amendment No. 3 is that with Sky Sports removed from the equation when it comes to broadcasting sporting events, it will be between TV3 and RTE to do so. RTE always has a good war chest &ndash; up to &euro;150 million a year when the recent &euro;43 increase in licence fee is taken into account. An organisation like TV3 would not have the same financial resources. Going to the High Court is a very expensive process. The spirit in which an organisation went to the High Court in the first instance should be taken into account and the evaluation should be made with regard to determining the cost afterwards. I accept the spirit of the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 21, after &ldquo;arrangement&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and may at his discretion forward the agreement to the Competition Authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment suggests that the Minister may, at his discretion, forward a report he receives to the Competition Authority. At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources, I asked the Minister about advertising. It is claimed by TV3 that RTE 1 often engages in predatory advertising. The Minister said at the time that he did not have any role in the matter and that responsibility for it lies with the Competition Authority. However, in light of the recent increase in licence fees it received, RTE should be asked to adhere to a code of good and fair conduct. There could be a role for the Minister in certain instances, if there was a doubt in his mind, to send it on to the Competition Authority at his discretion. I ask the Minister to accept the spirit of the amendment because it is put down in good faith. There may at times be decisions in respect of which the Competition Authority might become involved.</P>

      <P>I take it that the aim of the amendment proposed by Senator Finucane is to ensure that in the circumstances in which there is a possible competition issue relating to a contract, the terms of the contract could be brought to the notice of the Competition Authority. I do not consider there is a need for an explicit power in the legislation to achieve this. The Competition Authority has its own powers under the Competition Acts and may act in accordance with the provisions of those Acts, if it so wishes. Accordingly, I do not agree to the amendment.</P>
      <P>As stated on Committee Stage in the Dáil, I have no role in relation to the issue of competition between one broadcaster and another. That is the effective remit of the Competition Authority. In the area of commercial advertising &ndash; which is not referable to the licence fee increase &ndash; if another broadcaster has a complaint, it would be its prerogative to take that complaint to the Competition Authority. There is no provision within the broadcasting legislation, nor do I think there should be, for this to be part of the remit of, for example, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The section contains the phrase, &ldquo;The Minister may, where he or she considers it is in the public interest&rdquo;. How does the Minister intend to satisfy the public interest in the context of a report he receives directly? To what degree would he use that report to satisfy the public interest? Surely, in instances in which he intends to satisfy the public interest, there would be validity, in certain cases and at his discretion, in referring the case to the Competition Authority.</P>

      <P>The Minister may, where he or she considers it is in the public interest, direct an event organiser who has entered into an agreement or arrangement with a broadcaster in respect of the broadcasting rights to a designated event to give to the Minister, at the Department of Communications the Marine and Natural Resources, within such period specified in the direction, a copy of the agreement or arrangement.</P>

      <P>It is at the total discretion of the Minister to decide whether something is in the public interest. This is geared towards arrangements in which there is a contract between an event organiser and a non-qualifying broadcaster. The contract would be available if one was dealing with TV3 or RTE. However, if an arrangement is made with a non-qualifying broadcaster outside the State, as was the case with the event which caused the Bill to be brought forward, the operation of the law is somewhat constrained.</P>

      <P>One remaining imponderable factor is the contractual arrangement between the FAI and Sky Sports. I do not know in what way it will hop.

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section. To do so <Col N="1549" />might appear strange, particularly in light of the fact that section 1 is the definition section and provides the Title to the Bill. The latter is entirely incorrect. While the Bill is called the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003, it contains little that applies to freedom of information and represents an emasculation of the principle of freedom of information contained in the 1997 legislation. In that regard, the explanation of the Bill is incorrect. This legislation should be more correctly termed the &ldquo;Freedom from Information&rdquo; Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill was debated at length on Second Stage. A great deal of media commentary has been generated by Government's extraordinary action to bring forward this outrageous legislation. It does not surprise me that it has generated such heat. At its heart, the Bill represents an abuse of power and rolls back a right that was given to the people in 1997 by a Government clearly mandated to formulate the statutory right of freedom of information as part of our democracy. In undermining the fundamental principle of freedom of information, the Government is undermining a foundation stone of our democracy and rolling back a core principle of accountability in public decision-making. This represents one of the most extraordinary elements of the Bill. The Progressive Democrats campaigned for a mandate to keep the Government honest, clean, and, I presume, open. It is extraordinary to observe the manner in which the Progressive Democrats are rolling back a fundamental principle of openness after less than a year in office.</P>
      <P>At its heart, the Freedom of Information Act 1997 was about ensuring accountability to the public for what is done in its name. It is a fundamental abuse of power to in any way dilute the principle of accountability that is so strongly established in the Freedom of Information Act. One can only assume that the primary objective of the Government, as evidenced by this Bill, is to roll back the principle of accountability. What does this say about a Government that does not want accountability, openness in how it reaches its decisions or the ability of the public to know, through the media or public representatives, how it makes decisions? Freedom of information has become an embarrassment to a Government that lied to the people during the election and continues to do so. It signals a Government that is determined to control information by spin and leaks. It is the mark of a Government that wants the people to know only what it wants them to know; it is not the mark of a democratic government.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents an early landmark in the lifetime of the Government. It is symbolic of an arrogant Government that has allowed power to go to its head and thinks it can ride roughshod over the fundamental and basic rights of the citizens who elected it. I hope the day will soon come when the Government will rue bringing forward this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public realises what is happening. It <Col N="1550" />realises it has one of the most right wing and arrogant Governments this country has ever seen. It is also one of the most contemptuous in terms of how it treats not only the Houses of the Oireachtas but also the public. This is personified in the way the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who have a duty to be in the House today, have acted in a high-handed and contemptuous manner and gone to watch horse racing in the adjoining state. What could be more insulting to this House and the people than to have two Ministers, duly elected and appointed, act in such a cavalier and contemptuous way towards the public interest and the public good?</P>
    <P>The public interest is not at the heart of what the Government does. Defining and upholding the public interest were at the heart of the 1997 legislation. At the time it was a radical inclusion to provide for a public interest override in the legislation. The secrecy of decisions by State agencies and the institutions of State and the public's right to know were guaranteed by what was called &ldquo;the public interest&rdquo;. That created a fundamental principle in the statute which is being diluted and undermined by this amending legislation.</P>
    <P>That is the reason we oppose the section. The vast majority of sections in the Bill will be opposed today. This is not a freedom of information Bill but a freedom from information Bill. It is indicative of a Government which wishes to wrap itself in a blanket of secrecy and prevent the public, through the media and public representatives, from knowing how it makes decisions. The Government is obsessed with controlling information on how it makes its decisions. It wants to make them behind closed doors and does not want anybody to know how they were made. It wants to present them through its 81 spin doctors in a controlled, leaked fashion and in such a way that it can determine public reaction and opinion. In that regard, it is wrong.</P>
    <P>As we said on Second Stage, it is our objective to oppose the Bill section by section and the amendments brought before us.</P>

      <P>My elevation then was a good deal easier than my election this time. Senator O'Meara's points are valid. The definition section of a Bill must describe the intention of the legislation. If the Government had described it as the Freedom of Information Act 1997, as filleted by the amendment now before the House, there would have been more honesty in the section. There is no accurate definition in the section concerning the intentions of the Government. The Senator's argument has merit and I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's views on this point.</P>

It consists of appropriate amendments which have been brought forward by the Government on the recommendation of an independent committee representing the Departments which made certain suggestions. Everybody agrees that the Act must be amended, particularly with regard to Cabinet information. Five years is far too short. Many matters would not even be finalised in that time. From the point of view of the business of the State and its confidentiality, it is vital that information not be released within the five year period and that the period be extended to ten years.

    <P>It was the same Administration which provided the necessary funding for the Act. However, I doubt that any Member would accept that a request from one individual should cost over &euro;100,000 to carry out the required research. It cost &euro;127,000 to deal with one request from an <Col N="1553" />individual under the Act. That is an abuse of the legislation. Furthermore, the Minister has not so indicated and, contrary to some media reports, the level of fees has not been decided upon. However, such provision was made in the original Bill. It will be a matter for the Government and the Minister to decide on the implementation of this section. Before the ball has even been thrown in for the start of the game, however, the Labour Party wants to pull the plug.</P>

      <P>We are commencing the Commit<Col N="1554" />tee Stage debate on the Bill. Section 36 of the principal Act deals with the powers of the commissioner, one of which is to keep the operation of the Act under review. That is part of his functions. The commissioner has now prepared a review of the Act, which is to be &ndash; or may already have been &ndash; published. Section 36(7) makes it an offence for any person or body to hinder or obstruct the commissioner's functions. If rushing this Bill through the House does not undermine that aspect of the commissioner's functions, it certainly treats it with absolute contempt and disrespect.</P>
      <P>All Senators who have spoken on the Bill acknowledged that certain changes should be made; that is not the issue. We are ready to deal with changes to the Bill, but the Information Commissioner has not made his input in a formal manner. He has, however, produced an annual report on how the legislation is working. It is possible for the Government to make a specious argument saying it was interested in what the commissioner said last year, but it has now decided to disregard his current review which is about to be published. It has not been taken into consideration in any way, shape or form by the Government side in preparing the proposed amendments. I believe that attitude is wrong at all levels. However, before developing that argument I would like to hear some satisfactory explanation as to why the Government considers this to be the correct way of doing business.</P>

      <P>I would inform the Minister of State that the commissioner's report, The Application and Operation of Certain Provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, is available and is quite riveting. As Senator O'Toole said, it is manifestly wrong in these circumstances to embark upon a debate on Committee Stage of a Bill which has such fundamental implications for people's right to access information. This debate should not proceed because the sponsoring Minister has not deemed it worthwhile to agree to a deferment of the Bill until next week, when the Cheltenham festival has concluded and when he could personally take us over the hurdles. In addition, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who took part of the Second Stage debate last week, is not here.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that the Minister or Minister of State responsible for the legislation are not present. I have great respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, but the Bill does not come within his Department's remit. Given the fundamental importance of the legislation, the Minister of Finance should have come before the House. If he could not be here, his Minister of State should have attended the House.</P>

      <P>The House should adjourn because it is wrong to proceed in these circumstances. The Information Commissioner was not granted the courtesy of having an input by the so-called expert committee. I have scanned quickly through the Information Commissioner's report and it is extremely important. It provides a good overview of the legislation along with a critical analysis of its sections, including the one dealing with Government committees. We should not proceed with the debate until we have had an opportunity to digest the commissioner's report.</P>
      <P>I agree with one of the points made by Senator O'Meara concerning the Title to the Bill. I know we are talking about the principal Act, but it is a misnomer to call it the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. It should be entitled the &ldquo;Restriction on the Freedom of Information&rdquo; Bill because it drives a coach and four through the 1997 Act, setting many of its provisions at nought.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware that the commissioner's report has now been published. We should not proceed with the debate until we have had an opportunity to study the report, which provides a critical analysis of core sections of the Bill. The commissioner has presented his report, both as a former civil servant and as the citizens' referee, on how the original Act is being dealt with. The report also has implications for this Bill which seeks to trample on people's rights.</P>
      <P>The House should adjourn until after 8 p.m. to deal further with this matter. It would be manifestly wrong to proceed without first studying the commissioner's report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, although I do so in a muted fashion. I know him of old; he is a thoroughly decent, upright and competent man, but it is a disgrace that he should be placed in this position. Perhaps the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has an input, but I cannot imagine what it might be. It is most invidious to place the Minister of State in this position. When Senator O'Toole asked a question, the advisers had to come into play. That is ridiculous. When we asked if the Department had access to this important document from the Information Commissioner, the Minister of State in charge did not have a clue. Of course he did not; I cannot expect him to because it is not his Department. It is an outrage that when we are discussing a serious matter such as this the senior <Col N="1556" />Minister involved is off gallivanting after the nags. In the circumstances, the title of the Bill is a complete misnomer; it should be called The Glorious Uncertainty of the Turf Bill, the Turf Accountants Bill 2003 or something like that. It is a complete and utter farce.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made an extremely important and serious point. Within the terms of the Bill there is a statutory position allocated to the Information Commissioner. In the conduct of this debate the Minister of State is trampling upon and treating it with contempt.</P>
      <P>We heard from Senator Mansergh that there were five distinguished independent persons and so on. They were senior civil servants for which they are entitled to respect but I would not regard them as totally independent. The Information Commissioner is of at least comparable rank within the Civil Service. Therefore, he certainly knows what he is talking about, yet we are having this debate in the absence of his report. When somebody raised a query about it, my colleague, Senator Mansergh, said that he had done this. He may have but the person in charge of the debate in this House on behalf of the Government does not know anything about it. We have not had access to it. We do not know anything about it and do not believe it has been published. It is a little too glib to say he has done it; he has produced one report but we do not have the one for the current year, the one being talked about. If this is the way in which the Government treats information in terms of the Seanad debate, the people have considerable need to be worried.</P>
      <P>In terms of the conduct of the debate, there may be some examples of that very Hibernian phenomenon, the digression, in the contributions and perhaps the more academically tinged on the other side may wonder at this&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is this the Minister of State's reward for having so intelligently and sensitively brought through this House the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill at very short notice? Did he draw the short straw or did the Government decide, on the basis that he got through that one so well, that it would put him in the firing line once again? I gather on that occasion he had about a quarter of an hour's notice to review the brief on which he was complimented both inside and outside the House on how well he did. Is it his reward that he must face our wrath? </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is even more magnified when we discover that the report on the application and operation of certain provisions of the Freedom of Information Act is in our pigeonholes. I can read quite <Col N="1557" />quickly. Why can we not take Senator Higgins's suggestion to heart, that we should adjourn until 8 p.m. and then resume? From even a glance at the general overview contained in the report, I note there is a large and important section dealing with section 19. There are also references to section 20.</P>

      <P>We should abandon this discussion in order to allow Members to have at least the advantage of having read the report. I have complained repeatedly in this House that we seem to think that when we get reports, we have done something but that is not the case. They must be read and we have to use the information contained in them. I have never seen more reports from Departments than in the past five years, particularly the Department of Health and Children. However, it is quite difficult to get information from the Department of Finance. If we are going to the trouble and expense of producing and paying for reports &ndash; the taxpayer is doing so &ndash; it is asinine to proceed without us having a chance to look at them and ascertain what may be of value to us.</P>

The report being referred to is utterly irrelevant to the section.</P>

      <P>If we spend this amount of time discussing the section, we will certainly have plenty of time to absorb the report before we reach the sections to which it refers. It is worth pointing out that the Information Commissioner is a public servant which means he is a servant of the Houses of the Oireachtas and subject to the legislation that we choose to pass. He has issued four reports on the operation of this legislation. I was looking at the fourth only last night. People are considerably oversimplifying the question of consultation. From my experience as a public servant, I am aware that one often gets to hear of something relevant and one then makes an inquiry. When the Information Commissioner made an inquiry in this instance, specific observations were invited. In effect, therefore, he was consulted despite suggestions to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Order of Business, while it would have been ideal if we could have had the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance present, I welcome the Minister of State. We should not lose sight of the fact that the Government is an entity with collective responsibilities which bind Ministers <Col N="1558" />and Ministers of State. The Minister of State is competent to give a reply on behalf of the Government and take in the points made in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I utterly reject the statement made by Senator Norris about a corrupt Government. That sort of statement should not be made when there is no evidence whatsoever to that effect. In the past five years there was not even a suggestion of corruption in relation to any single act of Government. There is no concrete suggestion in relation the present Government either. It does not raise the standard of debate to throw around tabloid type accusations of that kind in this House.</P>

      <P>I have never in the relatively short time I have been a Member of this House encountered a situation where information of such critical importance to the discussion of a Bill before the House was not available. I had to run downstairs to get the report in the middle of a debate on an amendment. It is outrageous that I had to draft amendments without the information which has now come before the House. That is unacceptable and intolerable. We should adjourn the debate in order to give us time to read the report of the Information Commissioner. Clearly, the Government has not read it. From a glance at the first few pages, we will have quite a discussion on the amendments when we reach them.</P>
      <P>I have been remiss in not welcoming the Minister of State. I apologise and hope he will take my apology in the spirit in which it is intended. I have not engaged with him at this level previously. I put it to the Minister of State and Government Senators that it is unacceptable that we do not have time to read such an important commentary on a Bill we are discussing, nor can we use it to shape the amendments before the House.</P>
      <P>The Acting Chairman, as a neutral observer, should listen to the points that have been made. Any independent observer would view this as an outrageous and intolerable situation. The fact that the Government will not listen to us on this issue is indicative of how determined it is to put through this draconian amendment to the freedom of information legislation.</P>

When did the Government decide to amend the legislation?</P>

      <P>The Chair and I have served together here for some time. I am speaking at length on section 1 because I am trying to prevent a travesty of the democratic process, which is what is taking place. The Chair has plenty of common sense and I appeal to him to recognise that what we are doing is wrong. The most central person in this matter, the person who is effectively the fulcrum of this legislation, has produced a report which deals with and passes judgment on every amendment &ndash; he says of one that it would have the effect of pulling back on information which is accessible at present. At another stage in the report he states: &ldquo; . had the Secretary General been in a position to certify that the records related to an ongoing deliberative process I would not have been in a position to review the matter.&rdquo; He shows time and again that there are issues involved here which concern him greatly.</P>
      <P>I can go through every one of these issues &ndash; I am sure we will do so &ndash; but I am trying to convince the Chair that in this document&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator knows well that the Chair cannot comment on the contents of a document.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor am I asking the Chair to do so. I am discussing the process.</P>
      <P>The Government took a decision last week to go ahead with business when it did not have this information available to it. It still does not have that information, as the Minister of State confirmed to me 20 minutes ago. We now have the odd situation where everyone on this side of the House has access to information which is vital to the process we are undertaking but it is not available to the Minister or his advisers. For God's sake, this is an utter joke.</P>
      <P>We can get into the schoolboy debate of whether we discuss this under section 1 or section 2 if that is important to people but the same issues will arise. It is safer to do correctly but in order to do things correctly, it is not accurate to describe the Information Commissioner as a public servant. He was a civil servant of the Government when he worked in the Department of Finance and he has now moved across to another job &ndash; he is now a civil servant of the State. If Members take the trouble to look at sections 11 and 12 of the rag we are dealing with today they will see that distinction is made clear for the purposes of covering people in their meetings with the Government. It is not fair to refer to the Information Commissioner as being in some way lesser in making&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am responding to an issue.</P>
      <P>The Information Commissioner has experience of both levels: at Secretary General level in a Department of State when he was a civil servant of the Government and now as a civil servant of the State. That distinction is not often made but it is a distinction and we should make it clear he has been both. The legislation also refers to those two groups of people.</P>
      <P>The Information Commissioner has courageously produced this document, presumably to be helpful to all who are dealing with the Bill. Is the Chair telling me it is correct to go ahead? I am not asking the Chair to comment on the report and I feel safe asking the question as the Chair does not have to know the contents of the report. However, he does know it exists&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am happy to present it to the Chair to ensure he has access to the information the rest of us have. How would one explain this to someone in one's local pub tonight? How would one explain this in one's sitting room? A visitor in the gallery would say: &ldquo;What is this? The person who operates the Act has given his view but we are deciding to ignore it?&rdquo; By going ahead we are deciding to ignore that view.</P>
      <P>That is why I oppose section 1. It is outrageous that we should continue, but to make a greater travesty on this we must now deal with the operation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which will meet the Government's chief operators of the Bill on Thursday. We set up the committee system to advise the Houses but here we have decided to ignore the system and to forget the committees. Our decision means they will have no input. We now have the two most important pieces of information but we are ruling the first piece out completely and we are half way to doing so with the second. I hold in high regard the people meeting the committee on Thursday and they have already advised the Government on its policy, but we cannot judge how they arrived at their decisions until we hear from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How would the Minister of State or the Chair explain this to Pat Kenny tomorrow so that ordinary people would understand it? The most <Col N="1561" />important person is being ignored. Is it any wonder people are cynical about politics? Is anyone going to talk to anyone else about this nonsense or do we have to go on? Will someone tell me my interpretation is wrong? Will someone tell me I am not mad in what I am reading but that this makes some rational sense and is an appropriate way of doing business? Will someone tell me this is good parliamentary practice and that it is a legislative process which is safe and sound and reflects those we represent?</P>
    <P>How can we continue on this basis? It is utterly wrong. Over the weekend I tried to come to a conclusion on why this is being rushed through, but I cannot find a rational explanation. In another life I used to say that if things looked wrong they probably were wrong. This may just be a total cock-up, with none of these matters being anticipated, but I ask the Chair to intervene. Will he indicate whether it is possible to stop what we are doing here?</P>

Why did the Department not make the appendix known to Members of the House, particularly in light of the <Col N="1563" />obligations arising from the constitutional provision that the Houses of the Oireachtas are vested with the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us debate the legislation, line by line and section by section. It has been fully considered by the Government.</P>
      <P>I resent the comments made about the Minister of State consulting his officials. He is perfectly entitled to do so, as I was in the past when I had excellent officials. We do not want a Minister coming into the House and going through a Bill in an arrogant manner. Every Minister requires the support and assistance of experts in the field to guide him or her while a Bill is passing through either House of the Oireachtas. This has always been the procedure and there is nothing different with regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I ask the Chair to put the section to the House. It should be part of the Bill. We should proceed to debate the legislation and if others outside the House have observations to make, they can be considered during the course of Committee Stage which will continue until Thursday. Surely Senators are capable of reading the recommendations made by the Information Commissioner? They will be duly taken into consideration by the Government as the Bill goes through the House and the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Having read most of the newspapers at the weekend, I know the tune to which Senator O'Toole is dancing. He is appeasing the NUJ and journalists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the reason Senator Mansergh appeared to believe that a Member on this side was querying the competence of the Minister of State. I have congratulated the Minister of State on his intelligence already in bringing through a previous Bill. We do not harbour personal resentment towards him. He is a competent Minister of State. The question, however, is whether the Bill was purposely sent into this House because the Government was ashamed to introduce it in the other House and has now left the field for other pastures?</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the report, which has just come into our hands, the Information Commissioner states:</P>
      <P>I am conscious that many commentators would like me to state my views on the proposed legislation. I do not intend to do so. It would be entirely inappropriate for me to engage in public debate on the merits or demerits of the Bill. The Constitution provides that the sole and exclusive power of making law for the State is vested in the Oireachtas and it is the role of the Information Commissioner in relation to the Freedom of Information Act to implement the legislation passed by the Oireachtas in an independent and impartial manner.</P>
      <P>He then states:</P>
      <P>Given the importance of the proposed changes to the Act, however, and having regard to my statutory reporting relationships with the Houses of the Oireachtas, I have decided to publish a commentary under section 39 of the Act. Section 39 provides that:</P>
      <P>The Commissioner may prepare and publish commentaries on the practical application and operation of the provisions, or any particular provisions, of this Act, including commentaries based on the experience of holders of the office of Commissioner in relation to reviews, and decisions following reviews, of such holders under section 34.</P>
      <P>How could anyone on the Government benches want to proceed with this legislation when the person of most importance in terms of considering the workings of the Act has provided us with this information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made only one freedom of information request, which was on an issue of importance to me and all the young women of this country. I will explain the answer I received and the reason I am so concerned about what is now happening in terms of what could be described as the Freedom from Information (Amendment) Bill. There is a degree of concern about home births here. Statistics are not kept as to the infant mortality rate, which, it has been suggested, is higher than in hospital births. Many women are transferred <Col N="1566" />to hospital very late in labour and perhaps because of difficulties during labour&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is going way off the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, and I will quickly explain the reason. This is a very important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevance to section 1 is extremely tenuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude quickly. We wanted to get information because those figures could be included under deaths in hospital. I could not get them from the Department of Health and Children, so I put in a request under the Freedom of Information Act and it was refused on a technicality. It said I could try the Central Statistics Office but while the CSO would know the place of death of the person, it would not know the place of birth. That was not much help.</P>
      <P>I will explain the reason this is so important. An area in the Bill now before the House is heavily criticised in this report, which I have to speed read. Under the section in the report on section 22(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>), if one asks a question about one body and the answer could impinge on the activities of another body, it will not give an answer. It is even worse than the position previously when the Department of Health and Children said it would not give me information of such importance. What is more important, apart from the maternal mortality figures, than the perinatal mortality figures? They are the essence of the health service, yet I could not get those figures. We now have no hope of getting them because it will say it impinges on the workings of some hospital or something like that.</P>
      <P>This report states that the sections are to be amended by providing a revised wording for paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) to the effect that the principal Act will extend the protection available to any public body, not just the public body that is the subject of the request. That is the reason we should not go on&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is a report of major importance, through which I am trying to speed read. I am giving you an example of where I have already had difficulty with the original Bill. The Department said I could appeal the decision, but an appeal would take six weeks to three months. That is one example which I could pick out immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" />There are parts of the original Bill which are being amended by this Bill of which the commissioner is not critical but on which he gives a totally different answer from what is suggested either in the Bill or in the explanatory memorandum. I believe we are behaving in a farcical manner, and that is not the wrong word to use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard what Senator Henry had to say as extremely germane to the Bill and she made an impressive and practical case. There is no doubt this is the sort of reality in which people operate and if somebody in her responsible position finds it impossible to get the kind of information on which proper decisions about the health of the country will be made as a result of the operation of this Bill, it is a complete and utter disgrace. It is appropriate to say that because Senator Henry is arguing, as are the rest of us, for a cessation of this farcical debate so that we will be placed in possession of the information necessary to construct a proper debate in this Parliament. Every word she said was completely and utterly relevant.</P>

      <P>I was challenged by Senator Mansergh about my use of the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;, and it appeared he was gathering himself up to see if I would withdraw it. I will not withdraw it and I will tell him what I mean by &ldquo;corruption&rdquo;. Corruption occurs where healthy tissue deteriorates as a result of injury, abuse or disease. That is what is happening in the democratic process. It is corrupt. I found his contribution very engaging because he let slip the mask when he said there had not been corruption for five years. Was he suggesting there was masses of it in the five years preceding that terminal point?</P>

      <P>There is a very good piece about this in <i>The Irish Times</i> today in which the word &ldquo;corruption&rdquo; figures prominently in an analysis of the Bill by Fintan O'Toole. It states, &ldquo;A corrosive public cynicism is eating away at the bonds between State and citizen.&rdquo; Is that not a form of corruption? I am not talking about financial corruption; I am talking about corruption of the body politic by the inappropriate use of muscle by this Government. It further states:</P>
      <P>The response of the Government? Go into hiding. Neuter the Freedom of Information Act. Batten down the hatches. It is a perfectly rational strategy. Halfway through a 10-year stretch in power, the Government has no ambition beyond survival. It is not interested in engaging with the public. It is interested in hanging on until those who voted for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats last May will have forgotten their sense of betrayal and those who didn't will have sunk into weary apathy.</P>
      <P>He goes on to talk about the confidence that they can get away with it. I will not put the whole article on the record because that would be rather tedious, although I might return to it in the later hours of the evening when I imagine we will still be here.

      <P>We had a long discussion this afternoon. In the meantime we have had the opportunity to read the report of the Information Commissioner. What undermines our work today is that part of his report, appendix 2, contains a long list of amendments to the Act. No Members of this House saw these until this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In order to validate the process of legislation, I intend tabling each of these as an amendment to be considered on Committee Stage. Four or five of them have already been tabled in my name and that of Senator Henry. In deference to the debate and to the safety of the legislation, it is crucial that we discuss these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am not saying necessarily that the Information Commissioner is right in everything he is suggesting, nobody can argue that his recommendations should not at least be considered, discussed and disposed of by this House. Therefore I have sent these to you, a Chathaoirligh, and I have indicated to the Clerk that there will be more to follow. While I recognise that <Col N="1570" />Standing Orders require amendments to be in by a certain time, I also recognise that you may allow amendments at your discretion and sometimes that has to be with very little notice.</P>
    <P>I cannot justify to Members of this House ignoring these recommendations. Having looked at several recommendations affecting both the principal Act and the Bill, very few have been included by the Government. Of the first 15 recommendations I read, three are included, one is perhaps included and 11 have been ignored.</P>
    <P>Members of the House should have a debate on the proposals of the Information Commissioner. More importantly, the report contains his views on the amendments which we have not had time to include in this debate. The most critical part of what he has to say is as follows:</P>
    <P>I note that in proposing this change, the high-level group has taken a different view. It is clear that my view of the intention of the FOI Act as originally framed differed from that of the high-level group.</P>
    <P>I will not impose on you now, a Chathaoirligh. I will come back to those issues.</P>
    <P>I am making these points to validate my argument that it is wrong to rush this through at this stage. All the amendments I am now putting to you, Sir, should be considered as part of the Committee Stage with a proper discussion. The Government side may say why something should not be done and we can come to an agreed position. Crucially we should have the Information Commissioner's views on each one of them. While that is not to say he is right and other people are wrong, I ask you, a Chathaoirligh, to include the amendments in the names of Senator Henry and me.</P>

      <P>The Information Commissioner. The commissioner's commentary gives a general overview of the main proposals in the Bill and a statement of his views on how decisions taken by him in the past would have been affected if the Government's proposed amendments had been operating at that time. The commentary is made under section 39 of the 1997 Act, which provides that the commissioner can prepare and publish commentaries on the practical operation of the provisions of the Act. On the first page of his commentary, the commissioner makes clear that he is not stating his view of the proposed legislation, as he says it would be entirely inappropriate for him to engage in public debate on the merits or demerits of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The commissioner's document is quite long and complex and I am sure the House would agree it is not possible or appropriate for me to give a response to it at this early stage. After an initial examination it appears that many of the points he makes, particularly those in his general overview of the amendments to sections 19 and 20 of the 1997 Act, can be dealt with by preparing appropriate guidelines for Departments on how to operate the new amended Act. These guidelines are issued from time to time by the Department of Finance and have proved very effective in ensuring the implementation of the Act.</P>
      <P>The commissioner's report will be studied by the Government. The commissioner has an important role to play in administering the Act and ensuring the procedures it lays down are properly implemented. His views clearly take account of his wide experience in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" />The Government has already considered its proposed legislation carefully. The high level group was established by the Government to examine the working of the 1997 Act in some detail. The group considered the position, as it was required to do by the Government, taking account of reports and studies, including those issued by the commissioner, and drew up recommendations which formed the basis for the Government's own preparation of the legislation which is now before the Seanad. The Department of Finance met the commissioner's office and considered some technical amendments put forward by the commissioner, a number of which are incorporated in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister of State have an opportunity to study the commissioner's report during the suspension of the House? It would appear from his comments that he did not. He said he had a general overview but in appendix 2 of the report, the commissioner makes a detailed analysis of the Bill, line by line, including the Long Title, and gives a critique of every section. His comments were available to the Department of Finance on 3 February 2003. Did the Department reply?</P>

      <P>I wish I had thought of making a freedom of information request to find out what it costs to run the Office of the Information Commissioner because we are getting very good value no matter what the cost. The amount of work that has gone into this report is incredible but we are to ignore it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I am worried that the Taoiseach does not understand what is in the Bill because he said in the other House that it will make no difference to individuals. The commissioner's report makes clear that changing the wording from &ldquo;relate&rdquo; to &ldquo;contain&rdquo; will make a huge difference to the amount of information an individual can obtain under the Freedom of Information Act. It is not just about collective responsibility at Cabinet level, as we have been told.</P>
      <P>Bringing up the amendments that Senator O'Toole has tabled on Report Stage is not the same thing as bringing them up on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The commissioner is not a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the Government. This is a Bill introduced by the Government to the Oireachtas. The commissioner stated clearly that it would be entirely inappropriate for him to engage in public debate on the merits or demerits of the Bill. He said that the Constitution provides that the sole and exclusive power to make laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas and that it is the role of the Information Commissioner, in relation to the Freedom of Information Act, to implement the legislation passed by the Oireachtas in an independent and impartial manner.</P>

      <P>I may be jumping the gun and I do not want to be involved in a filibuster. It is regrettable that the time of the House is taken up in this way. We are digging ourselves into trenches when there could be easier ways of getting through the Bill.</P>
      <P>I respect the position of the commissioner and take his point that he is not contributing to the legislative process. I was concerned about a section later in the Bill that deals with the extension of the definition of &ldquo;Government&rdquo; to take in all manner of people. That holes that section below the waterline before we even reach it. If we could agree that is the case, it would be unnecessary to fight our way through every other section until that one. The Minister said this could be effectively dealt with by way of departmental guidelines but that is not a good way to legislate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up the point made by Senator Maurice Hayes because it is crucially important. The Minister referred to the possibility of using departmental guidelines. That completely misunderstands the nature of some of the <Col N="1574" />comments and recommendations of the commissioner.</P>
      <P>The commissioner says the very constitutional definition of Government is at stake, that doubt is being cast by the way it is being redefined in the Bill before us. He says some of the definitions could create serious legal and other problems in future and have the potential to result in costly litigation, possibly involving his office. These are not trivial matters that can simply be dealt with by regulation.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Government will consider the views of the commissioner as set out in the report produced today. That raises the obvious question as to why has the Government not already considered the views of the commissioner.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden is being disingenuous in his attitude towards the role of the commissioner. The role of the commissioner, and of the ombudsman before him, was always to get stuck into the business of Government. That is what such people do; they get involved in ensuring that the administration of Government is carried on in an appropriate way. The commissioner has taken it upon himself &ndash; correctly &ndash; to comment on the working of the Act as it exists and to make recommendations on how it could be improved. He rightly says he will not tell Government what to do but he does not stop much short of that. It is proper in the circumstances to take that upon himself and he has done so.</P>
      <P>It is not possible for us to take into account, however, the experience of the one person who knows most about the operation of the Act when deciding on the Bill because his report arrived in our pigeon holes only half an hour before Committee Stage. I appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, is playing with a ball he would prefer to avoid but we should adjourn this debate until we have an opportunity to look at the report, consider it and give the Government an opportunity to consider if amendments are appropriate, even at this early stage.</P>

      <P>The commissioner has published four other reports and is involved in ongoing consultation, a two way process. From what I know of the way Government works, his views have been taken into account and incorporated. We are at the beginning of a legislative process that will last a few weeks and there will be plenty of opportunities for the Government and others to review the report. If anything has been missed it can be accounted for then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understood Senator O'Meara correctly, she wants to incorporate many of the amendments. <Col N="1575" />That would be totally inconsistent with the amendments the Labour Party has tabled that simply oppose sections. Opposition Senators need to decide whether they are simply opposing most clauses of this Bill on a blanket basis or adopting a more constructive approach.</P>
    <P>My final point, in response to Senator Brian Hayes, is that when, for example, Mr. Dermot McCarthy sits opposite Senator Joe O'Toole and the other social partners, he, for that purpose is representing&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regret to correct Senator Mansergh a second time this afternoon. The reporting requirement of the Information Commissioner is not only to the Government but also to the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is crucially important to this issue. It is not co-government &ndash; that is not what I am suggesting. It is for precisely that reason that we are the ones who are required to take account of his report, whatever we do with it. Accordingly, I believe it is, at the very least, a discourtesy if we cannot deal with it.</P>
      <P>I heard what the Cathaoirleach said about my amendments and, while I do not agree, I have to accept his ruling that they cannot be taken this evening. However, is the Chair also saying those amendments cannot be debated tomorrow on Committee Stage? Is he saying that none of my amendments can be taken at any time during Committee Stage of the Bill?</P>

Time and again, on the Government and other sides of the House, when Committee Stage has continued for a couple of days, it has been quite in order and acceptable for amendments to be taken during the course of that process. I accept that, for practical reasons, it might be unfair to expect that what I submitted within the last half hour should be dealt with immediately. That is the reason I suggested we should take time to do it. However, it is not fair or acceptable that the amendments may not be dealt with on Committee Stage but only on Report Stage where we cannot have the detailed discussion this requires. I cannot accept that.</P>

I understood the Chair to have ruled that Senator O'Toole's amendments could not be put down at this stage but they could be put down at Report Stage. Those amendments simply could not have arisen until the report was given to Senator O'Toole. The Cathaoirleach's position is that he is forbidding discussion on the amendments because on Report Stage a Member can only speak once. I believe that is a dangerous ruling to the operation of this House.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh, there is no way we can go on at this stage. I want it clearly understood as to what we are now doing. The Information Commissioner, as I believe is required of him under section 39 of the principal Act, is reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas with certain suggestions. We have tried to bring those suggestions before the House on Committee Stage tonight but, for whatever reason, a ruling is now making that impossible and the only way these amendments can be dealt with is on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Section 2 is a standard interpretation section that defines the words &ldquo;record&rdquo;, &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;, &ldquo;factual information&rdquo; and &ldquo;week&rdquo;. These definitions are necessary to clarify and improve the operation of the FOI Act and I cannot accept the Senator's amendments. For the record, the amendments to which Senator O'Toole is referring have been available on the Internet for the past three weeks, so he could have seen them there if he had looked into it.</P>

      <P>I will not take smart-ass answers from anybody. Either I get a clear, honest answer, or we will not do business. I would like the Minister to explain whether he thinks I should check around with all the people in here, not knowing that various things had happened, and then go checking around the whole world in case there is something the Department of Finance should have told me but did not, reckoning I could find it somewhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This gives a clear indication of what the Government is trying to do &ndash; to pull a cloak of secrecy over things. How does it cover what the <Col N="1582" />Department of Finance is doing? It shows it on a different website, hoping somebody will not see it. It is absolutely outrageous. If that is the view of the Department, it reflects very badly on it. The Department is incompetent to deal with this issue if this is the kind of reply we get. I do not accept that kind of outrageous rubbish. It is disrespectful and unacceptable. The Cathaoirleach should rule out the Minister of State's comment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, a Chathaoirligh, but I will not accept that it is appropriate for a Government Department to say to me that information it should have given to me is available on somebody else's website. The Minister is taking advantage of his position and I want it clearly understood that it is not good enough. If this is accepted as a method of communication, we might as well all go home. This is a Government that talks about e-Government. Is this its attitude towards freedom of information &ndash; that it will ride roughshod over the rest of us, treat us like dirt and make smart-ass comments when we raise serious issues? It is unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>After that peroration, section 2 seems a bit of a comedown. Nevertheless, we will plough on. There are three different parts to this section, one of which at least is totally non-controversial: the definition of a week. It strikes me to wonder why it is necessary to redefine it at all, since it did not seem that there was any lack of clarity about it in the original Act.</P>
      <P>There are substantive points to be made, however, about the other two parts of the section. It is interesting that the Minister, obviously working from his prepared brief, tells us that these are essentially technical points. The Information Commissioner is a little more helpful. He points out that the definition of &ldquo;photocopy&rdquo; is specifically intended to overturn a High Court decision, which found that under the existing Act a photocopy can be considered to be an original record and is therefore discoverable. This only matters in circumstances in which the original record was made before the implementation date of April 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does the Government consider it necessary to bring in a specific provision to overturn this decision? It seems that the High Court decision, in these circumstances, was quite right. The Commissioner points out that there were two elements in that High Court decision. The other relates to the creation of records in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that are retained in another office of the State. Why has the Government chosen to address one issue <Col N="1583" />brought up by the commissioner and not the other?</P>
    <P>The final part of section 2 appears to be innocent in so far as it simply redefines &ldquo;factual information&rdquo; to include, for example, statistical and econometric information. This is relevant because factual information in relation to a decision of Government is treated differently from memorandums for Government in that statistical or factual information can be released under the existing Act and, for that matter, under the new Act. The definition is broadened and to that extent it is a good thing. I wonder, though, what exactly it means.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report, for example, contained a huge amount of statistical analysis and information and a certain amount of econometric and economic analysis, which clearly directly informed decisions made by two Government Departments and rubber-stamped very shortly thereafter by the Government. Does that fall under the definition of &ldquo;factual information&rdquo; as redefined in section 2 and therefore for the purposes of section 19?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party opposes section 2, yet its members' arguments are based on the recommendations or suggestions of the Information Commissioner. Section 33 of the Act states that the commissioner shall be independent in the performance of his or her functions. That notwithstanding, some Opposition Senators have brought the independence of the Information Commissioner into question by adopting, without question, suggestions he has made under section 39 of the FOI Act, which itself states that the commissioner may prepare or publish commentaries on the practical application and on the operation of any particular provision of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important. The commissioner's role, provided for in section 39 and as stated by the commissioner himself, applies to the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and not the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003, which is before the Oireachtas. It is extraordinary that Opposition Senators are adopting the recommendations of a commissioner on a Bill which has not yet been enacted. The role of the commissioner is totally independent, but Opposition Senators are adopting an independent role as if the commissioner had the same power as the Oireachtas to change an Act. As has been stated <Col N="1584" />clearly, the Government has the sole right to bring legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The commissioner may prepare a report on the results and effects of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 when it is enacted, rather than prior to its becoming an Act of the Oireachtas. That is a fundamental difference and it is important people realise the role of the commissioner, which point the commissioner has made himself. He would be embarrassed to know that Senators are tabling amendments based on his view of a Bill that is still before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, none of the amendments I tabled is in that category. They arose from the commissioner's assessment of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, which he will see if he looks at page 75 of the commissioner's report. The sections referred to are sections the original Act. The Cathaoirleach can confirm to the House that all the amendments I tabled, which were ruled out of order, make reference to the original Act rather than the Bill before us. I wish Senator Leyden would recognise that fact.</P>

      <P>I am delighted with the commissioner. It is the original Act he is referring to on page 75 of the report. Senator O'Toole's amendment, which I seconded, will not be brought up until Report Stage and one must allude to it on Committee Stage. On section 2, the interpretation section, of the original Act, &ldquo;person&rdquo; should be defined under the Interpretation Act 1937. The commissioner suggests the following amended definition: &ldquo;The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as importing a body corporate (whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole) and an un-incorporated body of persons as well as an individual;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the Minister of State may have had less time than I to examine the report, even on this section of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Remembering how he was briefed so quickly on the Industrial Development (Science Foundation Ireland) Bill, I am sure he knows why this change has been suggested. Has there been a problem with people being refused information <Col N="1585" />because something was described as a body corporate and that, because a public body was a body corporate or a corporation sole, it could claim that it was not a person? </P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support comments made by Senators O'Toole and Henry. It is obvious that Senator O'Toole's amendments refer to the original Act. There is no doubt about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is usually a sympathetic and reasonable figure, but it was extraordinary for him to remark that we could have seen the amendments on the website. Is he suggesting that we go on a fishing expedition to websites all over the Internet in order to find information? That was a totally inappropriate remark which brings our debate to a very low level. The Minister of State should have the decency to say he made the remark in the heat of the moment or based on poor advice, which may be the case. It strikes me as similar to a remark made in the Dáil, when a Deputy was told he did not ask the right questions. This is wrong. It is bad parliamentary behaviour and should be recorded as such in the House.</P>

      <P>The Freedom of Information Act 1997 states that the definition of a &ldquo;record&rdquo; applies to records created after 21 April 1998. In a High Court case, some doubt was cast on whether or not an exact replica of a record was a new record for the purposes of the 1997 Act. The commissioner has drawn attention to the potential difficulties if this was found to be binding in law. For example, a record created before 21 April 1998 could, merely by being photocopied, be brought within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act, which would create an anomaly which this amendment seeks to address.</P>

      <P>While we are addressing the Bill we are not sticking to its text and are drawing in other things. It is interesting that the commissioner is being blamed for doing something while simultaneously being blamed for not doing something. Section 2(<i>a</i>) is quite sensible and reinstates the position as the commissioner <Col N="1587" />thought it was before the High Court indulged in certain semantics. The subsection referring to the local authority is also fine.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will explain why it is necessary to extend the definition of factual information to include &ldquo;information of a statistical, econometric or empirical nature, together with analysis thereof&rdquo;. That sort of information is generally regarded as being neutral, a technical finding, and could be of great value to people who are commenting on the quality or nature of the discussion. It is a pity to apply this to something that is almost academic in nature. While factual information should, by all means, be protected, I am puzzled as to why it needs to be so widely extended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tease out the issue of factual information that no one other than Senator Maurice Hayes has touched on. The definition is of most importance in section 19 of the original Act. Currently, it is open to a head, usually the Secretary General or deciding officer, to release factual information, irrespective of whether it was submitted to Government. The Government is seeking to define what factual information is. I would like to think that, for example, minutes of meetings and the analysis provided by the tax strategy group would be published. We have got used to seeing this analysis in the past four or five years. I am not sure that would be allowable within the current definition of factual information. I accept there is a certain amount of doubt.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of this Bill refers to statistical and econometric information and it is conceivable that it would be allowed. I would like the Minister of State to reassure the House that he thinks it will be. If he is not in a position to give this reassurance, as I think is the case, we will seek to table an amendment on Report Stage to clarify the point. It is important that we still have access to reports that underpin Government decisions, such as that of the tax strategy group, since a veil is to be drawn over so much more of what is decided in terms of Government memorandums.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party has taken the approach of opposing the entire Bill because we did not want to be compromised by suggesting less restrictive &ndash; but restrictive nonetheless &ndash; provisions would be acceptable. There are certain amendments we will seek to raise on Report Stage that we believe we can usefully stand over.</P>

      <P>In the Long Title, it has been suggested that we can bring forward amendments to the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. This entire Bill is amending the original Act. The commissioner, for whom I have great admiration, suggests references to members of the public should be changed to &ldquo;persons&rdquo;. This is obviously an important step he wants us to take. What is the view of the Department of Finance on this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to an earlier question from Senator Henry, the Minister of State said that when the Department looked at the commissioner's proposals concerning the new incorporation of the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;, there were, to use his words, legal and practical difficulties in the application of this. Will he illuminate what some of those difficulties are? When the Department had discourse with the commissioner's office on this point, what was its response?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator McDowell that it is desirable that the tax strategy group papers should continue to be published. The tax strategy group is not a Cabinet sub-committee, rather it is a committee that is summoned into existence by the Minister for Finance. Over the past four years, we have seen the papers, except in cases <Col N="1589" />where the deliberative process is continuing. The budget usually terminates the deliberative process. I interpret the legislation as permitting the continued release on the same basis as over the past four years and informal discussions I have had give me some reassurance on this.</P>

      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes raised a question on factual information. The Freedom of Information Act does not define this and the amendment seeks to rectify it. It is not an exhaustive definition as this would not be appropriate. The amendment is not intended to restrict the understanding of factual information, rather it seeks to clarify it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all trying to be constructive. The Minister of State used the term practical and legal difficulties in response to the proposal on this new use of &ldquo;person&rdquo; made by the commissioner on 5 February. Can he give some examples of that? What was their response to the Department's observations on it?</P>

Are there other websites we should look at for information? Are other pieces of information, that are germane and relevant to this Bill, published in other places? I am seeking a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer. The most important issue, however, is to know what the practical and legal difficulties are because I want to examine them before Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I tried to elucidate for the Minister, obviously not well, was the issue of factual information. This is critical. The Government is effectively bringing down the veil on a huge amount of information that is currently available to us, particularly in relation to Government decisions. We need clarity on this.</P>
      <P>Let us take the example of the tax strategy group papers. I am not reassured by Senator Mansergh's comments. My reading of the Bill is that papers of committees or sub-committees of officials, and the word &ldquo;official&rdquo; is defined to include advisers, will no longer be available as a matter of course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>To be clear, I am referring to section 2 and to page 75 of the Information Commissioner's report. He proposed this amendment on 5 February. I have not taken in the import of the Minister's reply on practical legal difficulties. When he reverted to the commissioner's office, what was the reply? If the only example he can offer is in respect of whether a journalist is acting on his own behalf or on behalf of his newspaper, it is a limp excuse. What was the response of the Information Commissioner to that explanation? I am assuming the Minister referred back to the commissioner on this and that his officials had discussions with the commissioner's office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is crucial. The Cathaoirleach ruled that we could discuss the amendment but we could not put it before the House. It was read out by Senator Henry. The amendment is almost the same as in the Interpretation Act 1937. It states:</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;person&rdquo; shall, unless the contrary intention appears, [those few words are not being proposed here] be construed as importing a body corporate (whether a corporation aggregate or a corporation sole) and an unincorporated body of persons as well as an individual;</P>
      <P>Two things have arisen. First, the Department is saying that using that definition without the words &ldquo;unless the contrary intention appears&rdquo; creates practical and legal difficulties. I will get just one shot at debating this on Report Stage and I want to know where these legal difficulties originated. Did they come from the Office of the Attorney General or did they emerge from within the Department of Finance? What precisely were these legal difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The example the Minister gave did not encompass practical and legal difficulties. The Minister mentioned somebody requesting information and its being unknown whether it was a newspaper or a person. I do not understand the legal or practical difficulties involved there, if that <Col N="1591" />was the reply to my question. I need to know the legal difficulties that are worrying the Department.</P>
    <P>Let us separate the legal difficulties from the practical difficulties and discuss the legal difficulties first. Then we can move to the practical difficulties. What legal difficulties are emerging as a result of using the definition in the 1937 Act? If it is creating difficulties here, it must be creating difficulties elsewhere. Perhaps the Minister will outline them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to press the issue I have tried three times to raise with the Minister. If I raised my voice, the Minister might be more inclined to address it. He has not addressed it yet. I am seeking a reassurance that papers such as the tax strategy group papers will be defined within the term &ldquo;factual information&rdquo; and could, at least at the discretion of the head of a Department, be made available to the public as they currently are. That reassurance is most important. It does not just apply to the TSG papers but to a number of other papers on economic analyses and so forth.</P>
      <P>The Government chose to publish the Bacon report at the same time as it implemented its recommendations but if it had chosen not to, it would have been possible to suppress it under this legislation, as it has been with the high level group that recommended changes in the Freedom of Information Act. Does the Minister believe, as Senator Mansergh has told us, that the TSG and similar such papers underpinning Government budgetary decisions will be available and are comprised within the definition of factual information?</P>

That concerned section 2 of the principal Act. The Minister of State is now telling me, however, that that briefing material is not available, which is amazing. This illustrates why we needed to have a break to allow Government and Opposition Members to prepare for this debate.</P>
      <P>I have asked a reasonable question about a central part of the Bill, which the Cathaoirleach has ruled that I may discuss, yet it is a one-sided discussion because I cannot get a simple, straightforward answer.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start off our trenchant opposition to this appalling section.</P>
      <P>The section eliminates the need for a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in relation to the delegation of the functions of the Minister or the Secretary General. On the face of it this appears quite reasonable but unfortunately it creates doubt as to who exactly is dealing with a particular application. My understanding of the current procedure in the bigger Departments is that principal officers are the designated officers for applications which affect their particular sections. Everyone knows this and it is clear &ndash; the name usually appears on the initial response people get. People then know who is dealing with the application from the start until the initial decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Removal of the notification procedure means we will not know who is dealing with the request <Col N="1597" />and it will be possible for the Secretary General, acting on behalf of the Minister, to appoint a different person to deal with an application, depending on the circumstances and nature of the application. This does not give us the level of certainty we require, neither does it give us the level of continuity desirable for the operation of the Act in a particular Department.</P>
    <P>If someone is the FOI officer or deals with FOI applications for a particular section he or she develops an expertise, almost a jurisprudence, over time. He or she can make decisions more easily and those applying have a better idea also of how their applications are likely to be received, which adds generally to the efficiency of the system. It is important that people know those dealing with their applications have experience. If it is considered necessary to remove the formal notification by way of <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> that has to be replaced by some other method by which someone is designated and remains designated for the course of an application. A particular individual, a principal officer or otherwise, should be designated for different types of applications. <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> may not be the best way to do this but there must be some means by which people are designated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is in my name also and jumps out at one straight away. This provision seems to impede people's right to know who had what jurisdiction or function within the operation of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>The principal Act states:</P>
      <P>4.&ndash;(1) A head may delegate in writing to a member of the staff of the public body concerned any of the functions of the head under this Act (other than this section and <i>section 25</i>).</P>
      <P>(2) A delegation under <i>subsection (1)</i> (&ldquo;a delegation&rdquo;) may&ndash;</P>
      <P>(<i>a</i>) relate to functions generally or specified functions or be in respect of records generally or specified classes of records or specified records, and </P>
      <P>(<i>b</i>) be to a specified member or specified members of the staff of the public body concerned or to such members who are of a specified rank or grade or of a rank or grade not lower than a specified rank or grade, </P>
      <P>Subsection (3) then states:</P>
      <P>A delegation may be revoked in whole or in part or amended in writing by the head for the time being of the public body concerned.</P>
      <P>The subsection it is proposed to delete states:</P>
      <P>(5) The head concerned shall cause notice of a delegation or of a revocation or amendment under <i>subsection (3)</i> to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> not later than 4 weeks after the making of the delegation, revocation or amendment, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" />It is obvious, as Senator McDowell said, that this cuts across the process of informing people about who exactly has what responsibility. It is wrong that we should deprive the public in any way of the knowledge of who exactly has decision-making powers. Until now <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> was the Bible beautiful but now it seems that if this power is removed, then it has effectively been stood down as an organ of information regarding who has what responsibility within the public service.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Information Commissioner, who stated that this provision places too great a burden on various bodies in the public service when it comes to publishing details of those who have particular responsibilities. It seems fundamental that one of the basic tenets or instruments in this area is that one provides knowledge regarding who has responsibility. If someone is stood down from that responsibility, to whom is that function transferred? That is what we are referring to here and removing it is a very negative measure. That is why I join with the Labour Party in opposing the removal of subsection (5).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4(1) of the original Act states that a head may delegate in writing to a member of the staff of the public body concerned any of the functions of the head, and so on. If the head is delegating to a member of staff in writing then that is &ldquo;FOI-able&rdquo;. If I or any member of the public rang the county secretary of Kildare County Council and asked who the FOI officer was, that information would be readily available.</P>
      <P>It is unnecessary bureaucracy to have to publish this in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. The number of people who read <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is quite small and they are probably the people who know who the delegated person is anyway. From a common sense perspective I see no necessity for subsection (5). It is sensible to amend it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>This may appear an innocuous deletion on the surface but it goes to the heart of the principles of the 1997 Act. The then Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, was trying to make Departments more open and transparent and one of her approaches was to make it as easy as possible for the public to access information. Those of us who deal with Departments on a daily basis forget how intimidating it can be for the public to approach a Department and to get information. This section of the original Act deals with that.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis's comment regarding the delegation in writing by a head of department being &ldquo;FOI-able&rdquo; is a little mad. Would one have to make an FOI request to find out to whom the head of the Department has delegated functions?</P>

      <P>The listing in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is an important function. It underlines the principle of Departments being open, accessible and accountable in that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> is in the public domain and can be accessed, even on the Internet, by anybody who so wishes. While this may appear to be an innocuous deletion, it is anything but. It is one of the amendments which will make it more difficult for members of the public to obtain information, which, as we know, is the object of the exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful to illuminate the discussion by outlining how freedom of information legislation works in a Department. The deletion has probably been proposed because the current clause does not correspond to the reality of the operation of the Act. In practice, freedom of information requests are handled <i>de facto</i> by a person in each of the divisions. Clearly, it is difficult for a formal co-ordinator of requests, in, for example, the Taoiseach's office, to make a decision on a matter which comes within the remit of the economic or European division. The same person could theoretically make a decision on a cultural or information society issue. In practice, however, a person who is familiar with the subject matter of the section or division in question has to make the decision.</P>
      <P>Although consultation takes place among a number of individuals, normally a person in a middle-ranking position in the relevant section or division takes the decision, unless the matter is of major importance and must be referred to the Secretary General of the Department in question. It is unrealistic to assume that only one person is responsible overall. If authority is delegated, it means that the Secretary General of the Department is the identifiable person responsible. As such, the person who acts as the post office in the Department is immaterial. This is probably the reason the clause is being deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Following Senator Mansergh's useful contribution, I am more convinced than ever that we should try to retain the section. Surely a person must type up replies to freedom of information requests. Therefore, someone must take responsibility for them. If replies are made by committee, where will it take us?</P>
      <P>I expected the Government to accept this amendment as I could not see a problem with it, particularly in view of the fact that, with regard to section 3 of the principal Act, my new found friend, the Information Commissioner, proposes even greater openness in respect of requests. He suggests there should be &ldquo;an obligation on the Minister for Finance to collect, collate and publish (within two months of the end of each calendar) relevant statistics in relation to FOI usage in the relevant year, and . an obligation on public bodies to provide the Minister with such statistics, and in such manner (including timescale) as the Minister determines, in relation to FOI usage in the relevant year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" />These proposals would provide us with material of a &ldquo;statistical, econometric or empirical nature&rdquo; and thereby ensure we know exactly what we are talking about when we raise the issue of factual information. It would be a good idea to keep such factual information in the Act.</P>

      <P>The Information Commissioner's recommendations assist us in this respect. On section 4(5), he states:</P>
      <P>It appears that this provision is not being observed and is a burden on public bodies. As the provision has no obvious value and could be used to highlight non-compliance on the part of public bodies, it is suggested that it should be removed from the Act.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the Opposition is not happy with the Minister's decision to remove this provision from the Act. The last occasion on which I debated <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in the House was with former President, the then Senator, Mary Robinson. We had a great debate on its merits in relation to the removal of the word &ldquo;illegitimacy&rdquo; from the law of the land. Since my return to the House last July, I have not received a copy of it. However, when I served as a Deputy, I received a copy on each occasion it was published.</P>

      <P>Perhaps other Senators receive it. I used to find it interesting to read. If I want to find out who is the designated information officer of the Midland Health Board, I would telephone the board.</P>
      <P>Is the Opposition living in the real world in opposing the Bill and the removal of this section? The amendment is progressive and the removal of the provision is recommended by the commissioner. The Opposition adopts his recommendations when it suits and ignores them when it does not. Senator Henry, for example, did not even mention the commissioner's recommendation on this section, but instead quoted one on another section to support her arguments. It is about time this farce came to an end as it is obvious every effort is being made to prolong the debate and denigrate the Bill by raising objections to relevant and practical points. To think that <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, a document which no longer appears to be circulated in the House&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is gorgeous irony in Senator Leyden's approach. He argues that it is somehow odd that Members on this side adopt a different position from the commissioner on some aspects of the Bill, without realising that he is doing precisely the same from the opposite perspective. I love the irony of this, although the fact that it is wasted is a little depressing.</P>
      <P>This is an important moment to examine this issue because it proves the point made earlier. I am also glad the Senator found the end of the book in relation to the commissioner's recommendations on the original Bill. It shows we have covered a substantial amount in the past five minutes. The point Senator Leyden makes is that each of the Information Commissioner's recommendations should be considered, addressed and decided upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator Mansergh stated, the commissioner is not the Government and, therefore, does not decide on the content of legislation. From this we can logically conclude that, as he reports to the House, it is important we discuss what he has to say on the Act. Having closely examined his recommendations, this is one of the points on which I do not agree with him. We are not slavishly following the lead of any person outside of Parliament, no more than we accept what is <Col N="1602" />handed down by Government. We deal with each issue as it comes.</P>
    <P>I went through the Bill at the weekend before I knew of or had sight of the document we are now discussing. My objection is based on my experience of dealing with FOI requests to Departments. In another part of the principal Act, as Senator Mansergh stated, it is stated a head, meaning a section head, may delegate any of these functions to various people but what is required under the section we are now proposing to delete is that a record be kept and that it be brought to public attention. What does this mean?</P>
    <P>In a previous existence if I, as general secretary of a teachers' union, had wanted to make an FOI request, I would have made a simple check to find out who was the FOI officer dealing with the matter and the request would have been made to that person. Contact with <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> would only have been made if the person's name was not on the list sent by the Department of Education and Science. In other words, one would have known where to go for the information. That is important because it was the spirit of the legislation that the FOI officer would almost always be a person of middle or lower rank, certainly not senior rank, in the Department. That gave a sense of objectivity because the person concerned decided on whether the information was to be sent without making a judgment beyond what was required of him or her.</P>
    <P>I have two concerns. If I was the head of a Department and as I am a person who is inclined to take short cuts to get from here to there&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was head of a Department and a request came in from a journalist, I might consider it an irritation that he or she should be looking for the information in question and might decide to hand it to my colleague, Dr. Henry, who deals with the particular section because she would know what to do with it. I might pass on the next request to somebody else. Eventually it goes up the line and happens in a way which is not amenable to the spirit of the Act, although there is nothing particularly bad about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what Senator Mansergh said. In the same way as the head is the Accounting Officer in other ways in this situation he or she is the accountable officer but a record should be kept somewhere of who is responsible for each area, which not be changed week after week. That is important because when the Act came into operation and requests began to be made &ndash; I ask Senator Mansergh to confirm this because he worked closely in this area &ndash; they were difficult <Col N="1603" />for civil servants to deal with in terms of the amount of information that should be provided and where to look for it. There is a build up, not just of jurisprudence, as mentioned by Senator McDowell, but also of practical experience which is equally important.</P>
    <P>My father used to say the worst kind of law was a law which was ignored. In that sense I am taken by the Information Commissioner's view that this area is not being dealt with and is being ignored. He came to the conclusion that we should get rid of it. I can understand that tidies up an Act but I am not attracted by that argument. I would prefer to make it mandatory.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear a response to the point made earlier. If a record is not kept here, there should be a record somewhere of who is responsible for each section. The same applies to every Department, not just the Taoiseach's. In the Department of Education and Science various officers deal with primary and post-primary schools or whatever. That would also be the case in a Department like the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment where there are three obvious divisions. It is important that there are officers charged with responsibility for this area on which they will build practical experience as well as jurisprudence. There would then be officers recognisable in the role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced of the utility of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as a means of conveying information on anything to anyone, particularly to those who might be looking for information on personal circumstances or whatever. I shed no tears over that particular subsection. If it is not being used, that is the end of the matter and the world has not come to an end.</P>
      <P>I was a member of the committee which dealt with the strategic management initiative in the last Seanad and for years we encouraged Departments to be more user friendly and let people know who was responsible for particular areas. What we are talking about is ensuring best administrative practice without being too heavy-handed.</P>
      <P>There is also merit in the point made by Senator O'Toole in that it is worthwhile to have one person dealing with these matters. As Senator Mansergh said, in a large Department responsibility will be farmed out but there is something to be said for building expertise and maintaining continuity of approach and decisions.</P>
      <P>It is also important to guard against what might be called either arbitrary delegation to a particular person or the arbitrary removal of delegation in another. Ideally, Departments and bodies should have a directory containing the names of those to whom powers have been delegated under the Act. Will the Minister of State give an assurance that this will be done? While it would be helpful if a way could be found of expressing this on the face of the Bill, I agree that it is not worth dying in the ditch for <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator O'Toole, training is provided. In my experience, Departments take FOI requests seriously as they do not wish to be in breach of the law. Obviously, there is an information officer co-ordination point but inevitably decisions require a great deal of judgment as to how one applies the rules in the specific instance. I participated in decision making on FOI requests when people would come to me for advice. I do not believe any legislation will ever cover this. That is also true of the National Archives Act. One can be of a liberal frame of mind and decide that one will issue, within the parameters, the maximum possible information or one may be the type of person who tends to play safe &ndash; perhaps, in the judgment of many, too safe. While I am not sure that any legislation, however written, will remove that area of judgment, I hope the amended legislation will be interpreted in a liberal spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief point. I keep thinking of the freedom of information officer whom I know in the local authority. It appears, from reading section 4 of the principal Act, that if the freedom of information officer goes on holiday or becomes ill and somebody is appointed to act in his or her place, there will be a legal requirement under the Act to communicate this to <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. That is unnecessary and bureaucratic.</P>
      <P>The Administration Yearbook and Diary contains information on freedom of information which is not universal. To be practical, that would be a far more appropriate place. Far more people read that than read <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and it is a standard reference book for most people involved in administration. I am not saying there needs to be a legal provision for that, but it would be useful if it were universally available in a book like that which is much more accessible to the public, rather than in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.</P>

      <P>In my previous experience I would have known who the freedom of information officer was. I cannot understand how an ordinary citizen seeking to get information about his or her personal case would be motivated to order <i>Iris Oifigiúil </i>to find out the name of the information officer when it is easier to telephone the Department. Why should people have to figure out where to get <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and peruse it thoroughly or even to get a diary as mentioned by Senator Dardis? That is all very cumbersome. Who would tell ordinary people about <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>? It is a very elitist way for people to get information. People simply phone the Department and ask for the information officer.</P>

      <P>While I have never worked in a Department, from what I have heard the information officer is not necessarily the person who will write the reply. Based on what Senator Mansergh said, the work is delegated to different people. It is great to be able to find out who is dealing with a specific request.</P>
      <P>It is not so long since civil servants were not allowed to give their names. I remember phoning a Department and asking for the person's name so that I could phone her back. When she told me she was not allowed give her name I asked how many people worked there and was told there was only one other person, who was called Miriam. When I rang back I had to ask for the person who was not Miriam. Based on what has been said by Senator Mansergh and Senator O'Toole, quite rightly one person in the Department is the expert on giving information on one subject. Simply getting the name of the freedom of information officer does not mean getting the name of the person who dealt with the case, because there is obviously considerable delegation.</P>

I made two 15-minute phone calls today to the Companies Office, but could not get through because of lack of staff in that office. The same is true in every Department and the problem is spreading to local authorities. It is not possible to ring without being put on hold for hours. We need some place where all those things are written down and we can identify the person responsible. We probably have the facility of having phone numbers that allow us to get straight through. However, ordinary people who ring up get an answering machine requesting them to press a different number depending on the section required. It does not work in a straightforward manner.</P>

If I wanted to find that, would I have to go through every edition of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> from 1998 to 2003? I can simply ring 0903 62100 and ask for the name of the information officer. I can ring the Midland Health Board and get the same information. As a former chairman of the Western Health Board, I know the health boards take this Act very seriously. There is a particular officer designated under the Act who has responsibility to co-ordinate information across all departments and he or she will deliver the information to the requester.</P>

However, it is important the information be available both for ease of access and, as Senator Maurice Hayes put it, to avoid the arbitrary designation, re-designation or un-designation of individual people. There should be some obligation on the part of a Department to make known who is dealing with applications in a particular section above and beyond the publication in the manual, which unless I am mistaken is a once off. I am not bothered about whether that is done on the website, by laying it before the Dáil or by whatever means of publication is most useful. There should be a means by which the Department or public body has an obligation to say who is dealing with it. I will introduce an amendment on this on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>This section represents a substantial change, although it is touted as something perfunctory. In reality it changes the requirement on the part of public bodies to provide personal information to individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" />Previously, any record which contained information related to an individual had to be disclosed. Now there is a much tighter requirement that the record must contain personal information. The commissioner's very helpful report points to a number of cases where the definition has been of critical importance in determining what can be released. He is in no doubt that this section will restrict the personal information to which people will be able to gain access. This is of great importance to individuals, as opposed to people who want to find out what is happening in the political system. The personal information provision is vital. There is an onus on the Government, if it is restricting the availability of personal information, to tell us why it believes it is necessary to do this. I have not heard any persuasive argument why this should be tightened up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised when I heard it reported on RTE news that the Taoiseach said the Bill would not affect individuals. This is the area where it will have most effect. The words &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; are totally different from &ldquo;contain&rdquo;. They are much broader and changing them represents a huge diminution of the amount of information people can obtain about themselves. This is terribly important where people need to make corrections to records. False impressions may have been given, but, because something did not directly contain personal information, a person would be refused access to the information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; is a more precise formulation than &ldquo;relate to&rdquo;. I can imagine, as a civil servant who has had to contribute to decision-making, having awful judgment problems about whether something relates to something else. It is vague and ambiguous. The word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; is much more precise. Precision in legislation, which makes it easy for people to apply, has merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fine for the people who will dispense the information, but those seeking information about themselves will face huge consequences. The individual will be more restricted in the personal files he or she will be able to access. He will only be allowed to access files, subject to 11 exemptions, that contain information about him. Records that do not contain personal information, as defined in the Act, will be excluded. That is a specific exclusion and the danger is that civil servants will use this provision to create mirror records on individuals who will then be unable to amend the information if it is incorrect because they will not have access to the records.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications are serious. The word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; looks innocuous and more precise, but that <Col N="1609" />precision is not in the best interests of individuals seeking records on their own personal welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 amends section 6 of the principal Act by substituting the word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; in subsection (5)(<i>v</i>). This amendment is necessary to clarify that a personal record created prior to the date of commencement of the principal Act, 21 April 1998, can be accessed if the information in the record satisfied the definition of personal information contained in section 2 of the principal Act.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this provision is not to restrict information but to achieve clarity. The use of the words &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; carries the potential for inconsistent application because different public bodies may interpret what &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; means in different ways. When dealing with personal information it is very important that decision makers have a clear understanding as to what constitutes personal information.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Act contains a definition of personal information that is comprehensive but not exhaustive. This definition provides that personal information means information about an identifiable individual that would, in the ordinary course of events, be known only to the individual or members of family or friends of the individual, or is held by a public body on the understanding that it would be treated by it as confidential.</P>
      <P>Without prejudice to the generality of these two conditions, the definition then lists comprehensive categories of information that is to be considered personal. By replacing &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; with &ldquo;contain&rdquo; a decision-maker only has to examine the definition of personal information I have mentioned and satisfy him or herself that it meets the definition rather that having to decide whether a record relates to personal information. In short, &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; is simply too vague a formulation in this important and sensitive area. The meaning of &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; has already been the subject of an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act to the High Court.</P>
      <P>This is a sensible provision designed to achieve clarity. I reject any assertion that it is designed to restrict information. I note that a leading authority on freedom of information in Ireland, Maeve McDonagh, was quoted in <i>The Sunday Times</i> on 9 March as saying that she saw no difficulty with this amendment and I believe it is reasonable.</P>

      <P>I understand what the Minister of State is saying. It can be very difficult and awkward, especially if somebody else within the family might be affected by the information being given. I take Senator Mansergh's point that it is far simpler for the person giving the information to have a word such as &ldquo;contain&rdquo; used but it also takes away the discretion if one can see that there is something which could be very useful perhaps to the person seeking the information. That no <Col N="1610" />longer applies under the Bill. Although one might see that the best interests of the person seeking information would be best served by giving him or her the information, one would not be in a position to do so. I do not believe it is a matter of trying to batten down the hatches or draw a fresh veil of secrecy over information. The intention is as the Minister of State said but I question the wisdom. Is it not taking away discretion from the person giving the information, although it may be simpler for them? It is perhaps depriving a person seeking information of something which could be extremely useful to him or her.</P>

      <P>The effect of this section &ndash; the Minister of State does not appear to disagree &ndash; will undoubtedly be to restrict information. It will mean that information which could previously have been released will not or may not now be released. Whatever the intentions of Government, it must address the reality of what will happen as a result of its amendment. Given this reality, there is an onus on the Minister and Government, which has not been discharged, to explain the reason it is considered absolutely necessary to do so. Will the Minister of State give an example of circumstances in which he believes a civil servant or administrative official has been &ldquo;used&rdquo; and the adverse reaction or damage which has resulted? I grant, as Senator Henry did, that it allows a certain discretion to those who have to make these decisions but what is wrong with this? If the discretion is used, subject to the various exemptions, to give people information on themselves, I cannot see that any harm is done by leaving a certain measure of discretion and retaining the somewhat looser phrase in the Act.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on elaborating in such detail on this section. The explanatory memorandum sets out the reason for this proposed change and I respect the advice given to the Department by experts in this field. I am glad the debate has moved on to the detail and substance of the Bill, rather than trying to avoid it. Why is the section being opposed by the Labour Party? It has not elaborated on the reason. Why not propose to delete a word, or whatever, rather than simply opposing the section completely? That approach is unfair and adds nothing to the debate.</P>

      <P>In my experience of tabling amendments when in opposition, it is a simple matter to present an alternative wording to the Minister's proposal. The Minister of State has elaborated very well on the matter. It has never been my experience, either as a Minister of State or Member of either House, that I have had to rely on a document just published on the day of a debate. As that &ldquo;bible&rdquo; does not give any guidance on this section, I assume there will not be <Col N="1611" />any amendments from Senators O'Toole or Henry in this regard in the absence of any recommendation or advice from the Information Commissioner.</P>

      <P>If the Senator finds it difficult to understand the reason things have been done in a particular way, that bears no comparison to the surprise on this side of the House on having perfectly framed amendments ruled out by the Chair. We also have to cope with major meetings of committees taking place at the same time as Report Stage in this House and not being provided with full information on issues. There is a great deal of new experience and the Opposition is learning all the time. Some of us have been out of government for 16 years.</P>

      <P>It is quite incredible to suggest that this Bill does not restrict information &ndash; it does. Irrespective of whether it is a good or bad idea, it certainly restricts information on a substantial scale. I will give a few examples as to how it would operate. The classic example would involve people seeking access to information arising from a complaint. In other words, a person could have a major interest in a complaint made about a close colleague, into which the person, by inference but not by name, could be drawn. This example relates to situations which I have observed many times. It has been a regular practice for Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to use the FOI Act to obtain information for constituents who considered they were being unfairly represented in correspondence, possibly, though not necessarily, involving a complaint. A person may be misrepresented in a manner which does not necessarily involve being named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another example could involve a general report such as a school report which might not name individuals but people could see themselves as being clearly identifiable from the manner in which the report was written. While it would not contain personal information, it would contain <Col N="1612" />information that could relate very closely to individuals, professionally and otherwise. I could give many more examples. It is absolutely incorrect to say the Bill does not restrict information. It does. Perhaps there is a reason for this, though I do not accept the argument made by the Minister of State. However, there can be no doubt that information will be restricted.</P>
    <P>With regard to today's report by the Information Commissioner, I draw Senator Leyden's attention to the third part. In the earlier parts the first three or four pages dealt with the background followed by a general overview. At the very end there was a piece on the original Act which Senator Leyden quoted to good effect. I now draw his attention to page 10 in which the commissioner did what the Senator considered inexcusable by passing comment on the current Bill. He saw this as part of his function under section 39 of the existing Act and commented on it in some detail. He referred to the High Court judgment to which the Minister of State also referred. The report stated, &ldquo;Where the record does not name or has no expressed reference to the requester, a substantial link will be established if the record relates to something in which the requester has a substantial personal interest&rdquo;. That is the important aspect. That is what is in place at present, as distinct from something in which the person has an interest as a member of a general community or a large-scale class of people. In that sense, it would not be a matter on which the person could make demands. One can see that a very clear distinction is made in that regard. The commissioner went on to state, &ldquo;It is clear that records which &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; personal information as currently provided encompasses a broader category of records than records which &ldquo;contain&rdquo; personal information&rdquo;. That is perfectly logical and nobody can argue with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State argued that a judgment has to be made. I agree but that was always the intention of the Act. If people felt that they were not getting personal information in the correct way, then it was up to them to appeal that or try to find another way around it, and that is also built into the Act. Therefore nobody lost out in that sense.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's point that at times this could be a difficult judgment call and sometimes people could get it wrong, but that is not the issue here. People are entitled to get things wrong. If they get it wrong, then there is an appeal process which they can follow, and that is also built into the legislation.</P>
    <P>None of those points contains a substantial validating argument for bringing in this amendment. I certainly remain to be convinced on that issue. Where is the problem being created? Apart from their need to make a judgment, what happens next?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <P>I must repeat that the purpose of this provision is not to restrict information. The provision is causing considerable uncertainty. <Col N="1613" />Case law now requires, for example, that a decision-maker try to determine what was in the mind of the person creating the record in relation to a particular person. As I mentioned earlier, there is case law in an appeal to the High Court. As a result, it has been necessary to bring in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Is it incorrect then to state the interpretation given here, that there must be a decision made as to whether there was a sufficiently substantial link between the requester's personal information and the record in question? Is that incorrect? They ask a question and the FOI officer goes through the information available and has to make a decision as to whether it is appropriate. The officers do not have to get into anybody's mind. They simply work on the basis of the question.</P>

      <P>Since the Taoiseach patently thinks this Bill does not affect individuals, because he obviously would not have said that if he knew there is to be such a change in the way applications must be made and the way information can be given out, could the Minister of State look at this between now and Report Stage? I have heard it reported on the news that the Taoiseach said this Bill will not affect individuals. Because the Taoiseach is a busy man, he may not know that this part will affect individuals and nobody else. No corporations will be affected. Nothing like that will be affected. Could the Minister of State do that between now and Report Stage?</P>

      <P>In defence of the Taoiseach, the Opposition has entirely failed to demonstrate that there is, in terms of practical end effect, a difference between &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; and &ldquo;contain&rdquo;. <Col N="1614" />The superiority of the word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; is that it is legally precise. We should not, in this case, keep language in legislation which is ambiguous and ambivalent. Whether it is &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; or &ldquo;contain&rdquo;, the officer concerned must make a judgment. I doubt if in practice, whether either word is in use, it will make much difference, except in this respect, that &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; is ambiguous and could raise uncertainty. It is capable of a potentially wide definition, including stuff which is semi-irrelevant to it. In terms of precision, &ldquo;contain&rdquo; is much the better word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On Senator Mansergh's point, the words &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; are all over legislation, as the House will be aware. Whether it is ambivalent or otherwise, it is well used. It is no more ambivalent than the words &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo;, which appear in every piece of legislation I have ever seen. Somebody has to make a judgment about it and come to various conclusions. The reality is that we are now going to close down information. Even if it is only potentially wider, &ldquo;contain&rdquo; has a very contained meaning, whereas &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; has a much wider meaning. If they both have potential, there is just no comparison in terms of scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people seeking information and the quality of their access is being extraordinarily restricted and constrained by what is being pro<Col N="1615" />posed. Nobody has denied that. It may well be that there are difficulties. It may well be that people have to come to certain conclusions. It may well be that the officer must say it is hard to decide whether a file, containing information about a certain group of people but not mentioning Joe O'Toole by name, is telling the world in no uncertain terms what a not very nice person I am, for example, but because my name is not contained in it, then the file does not become accessible.</P>
    <P>When the legislation was enacted in 1997, I spoke on this section. I pointed out that part of the section the Minister of State quoted, section 2, the definition of personal information, or else section 12, rules out personal records of a human resources or personnel nature. Gardaí have had an arrangement for many years whereby they have full access to all their files after a period of five years. The original Act was more restrictive than what was available to gardaí at that time, and they would be people who would be dealing with sensitive information in sensitive places. In the light of what we have learned in the meantime and in the light of the difficulties which Senator Higgins is dealing with on our behalf, perhaps it should have been even more open.</P>
    <P>For us to say that in future information must be proven to contain the person's name is overly restrictive, particularly in the light of the interpretation given to it by the commissioner, to the extent of saying that a substantial link had to be established, and that is the burden of proof, the height of the bar.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister of State, as he can well imagine, that I will be on to the Office of the Information Commissioner tomorrow morning to ask him why he was so selectively quoting from the judgment if there were issues of importance of which we were not told. I will also get my hands on the judgment to read the whole lot of it, just to see what we are missing.</P>
    <P>This is my third time to ask for a legal definition. Could the Minister tell us what were the issues in that judgment which we have not been told about? We will put those on the record and discuss them when we come to Report Stage. <Col N="1616" />What exactly was in the judgment that we have not heard about?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh" hpid="Dr. Mansergh Dr. Mansergh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to remember that we are talking about personal information. I do not accept that the people making the decisions will necessarily decide in a restrictive manner just because the word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; is used. It gives a firm basis, but there has always been room for discretion and judgment when it comes to supplying information that might be helpful. I do not see that there is a problem, but if there is, it will be a problem regardless of the language used. No legislation can solve the problem of the difference between officials who interpret law in a restrictive and minimalist fashion and those who interpret and apply it in a liberal fashion.</P>

      <P>In this section we are talking about the right of people to personal information. There should be no ambiguity about the information that is supplied. The word &ldquo;contain&rdquo; would ensure no ambiguity, whereas &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; would allow for ambiguity. The case to which I referred dealt with what was in the mind of the person creating a record relating to another person.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that if there were some servants of the State who were predisposed to act, in Senator Mansergh's words, in a minimalist and restrictive fashion, what we are about to do is to make it ten times easier for them to operate in this way? We are actually giving support to people in that frame of mind. If people were of that viewpoint it would be better if they were to deal with the words &ldquo;relate to&rdquo; than the word &ldquo;contain&rdquo;.

      <P>I offer my condolences to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has clearly had a bad day. It started with the Garda leaking information against him and he has now launched a vicious attack on one of the major offices of State, namely, that of the Information Commissioner. I can understand why he is feeling sore, but he would do us all a favour if he kept it to himself.</P>
      <P>Section 5 is relatively innocuous, but there are some causes for concern in the way it operates. The section seeks to provide a mechanism whereby people can withdraw applications they have made. I know from experience that some Departments and certain individuals have a difficulty working within the Act and prefer to work outside it. I do not have a complaint about that, so long as we are getting full and frank information. It is acceptable for an official to request that one withdraws a formal request for all the information on a particular subject, in return for him or her supplying one with the specific information one wants.</P>
      <P>The same applies to certain Departments, which prefer to work outside the limiting context of parliamentary questions, such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Some Departments also prefer one to withdraw FOI requests and deal with them outside the scope of the Act. However, I would not like to see officials bringing pressure to bear on individuals and telling them that if they apply for information outside the scope of the Act, they will be responded to more quickly and efficiently. This will result in people feeling obliged to withdraw formal applications in circumstances where they might get a fuller picture if they left them in the system.</P>

      <P>With respect, this is an entirely reasonable section. It prevents unnecessary work by civil servants if someone, for whatever reason, decides to withdraw a request. It would be wrong if someone was pressured into withdrawing applications and ended up with less information, but one cannot provide for every informal eventuality. We must not waste too much time on this part of the Bill. I would prefer us to debate the more substantive sections. There are real things to debate, illuminate and clarify and the sooner we deal with them, the better.</P>

      <P>I am taken with the reasonable nature of what Senator Mansergh has said. Would that it were so. I thought it entirely reasonable that, to help the House, I produced a series of amendments which I saw as crucially important, given that they flowed from the view of the most important officer in this part of the work of the State. I thought they would raise reasonable issues which it would be helpful to discuss and I thought it unreasonable that I did not get to do that. Decisions have been taken that make it impossible for me to do my work as I see it and this is utterly unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I wish we could have a reasonable approach. Perhaps the Acting Chairman will tell me if he is prepared to intervene with the Cathaoirleach in order that my amendments may be taken tomorrow. It is not an unreasonable&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important that we hear the Minister of State's view on the document published today by the Information Commissioner. Does he find it outrageous that the senior officer of the State should have made this available to us to facilitate debate? Does he find it outrageous that the senior officer of the State who is charged, more than anybody else, with the implementation of and the workings of this Act, would take the trouble to help Members of the Oireachtas with information, a commentary and views that would help us come to a conclusion? While I find this to be helpful, it seems to reflect a view of Government that such information is dangerous in the hands of mere public representatives. We are entering a new era if this is the case and it is something we need to worry about.</P>
      <P>I hope Government Senators would worry about this as much as I do. I do not feel comfortable in adopting moral positions because I know my flaws and would be afraid others might start mentioning them too often. If the State feels threatened by this, or feels we should not have a report of this nature, then I would be very worried about the viewpoints in which this legislation is rooted.</P>

Is it best used to discuss questions of substance, or is it, to use the Senator's words, best used to discuss questions that are &ldquo;apparently innocuous&ldquo;?</P>

      <P>It looked like one of the extraordinary omissions in the 1997 Act that no mechanism for the withdrawal of a request was in place. As we all know, much horse trading went on. One would receive a telephone call from the Department saying that information would be given to a person more quickly if he or she would withdraw the request. Certain Departments have been extremely facilitating in this regard. Senator McDowell mentioned the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Not only did it provide information under the Freedom of Information Act, it had a special section that encouraged Members to withdraw parliamentary questions on the basis that one would receive the information within a day or two rather than the mandatory four or five days.</P>
      <P>It looks good and seems sensible to put the mechanism in place, yet by enshrining this in legislation the danger is that it could lead to intimidation. A Department could say that if one did not withdraw a request, it would drag out the process interminably. While there are upsides and downsides to this, the measure seems sensible.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide for an amendment to section 7 of the principal Act. It provides that a member of the public can withdraw a request, as set out in section 5 of the Bill. This is in line with provisions in section 14(<i>8</i>) and 34(<i>5</i>) in the principal Act whereby a member of the public may withdraw an application for internal or external review by the Information Commissioner. This amendment also provides for the head of a public body to notify a member of public in writing that the request has been withdrawn. A substantial number of freedom of information requests are withdrawn and are reported as such for statistical purposes.</P>

      <P>I would hate to let what Senator Leyden said stand unchallenged. Section 39 of the principal Act refers to what we are discussing. It reads, &ldquo;The Commissioner may prepare and publish commentaries on the practical application and operation of the provisions, or any particular provisions, of this Act.&rdquo; We are discussing this in amending the principal Act. That it is coming in the guise of a Bill is relevant, I am sure, but should not preclude the commissioner from making a comment. I do not accept that he can be precluded on the basis that he cannot speak on a Bill but can speak on a report. The commissioner is doing what he is entitled to do. I presume the difficulty is a reflection of his exclusion from the assessment. I do not know what the difficulty is and do not know the relationship between the commissioner and the Government.</P>
      <P>This proves again that if the House had been given the opportunity to discuss the issues I wished to table by way of amendment then we would not have these difficulties. Senator Leyden would have much less difficulty and I am sure he would have agreed with a certain number of them. I have no inclination to be co-operative in dealing with this as I have found myself being ruled out on, I believe, unfair and inequitable grounds. I have been told the ruling applied to me will not apply to other legislation that comes before the House.</P>

A newspaper cannot seek the information because somebody's name has to be put down on its behalf. I presume that when one puts in a freedom of information request, somebody's name is attached to it in the first instance. Who would own the information afterwards? The Minister of State is saying only the person whose name is on the request has leave to <Col N="1626" />withdraw it. I am more confused now than I was when we were dealing with section 2.

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a substantive issue at stake in section 6 which deserves serious attention. This section is technically worded and takes time to get to grips with, but it is worthwhile doing so. This is one of those sections that could be used &ndash; although whether it is intended to be used or otherwise is another matter &ndash; to pull down the veil on a great deal of information that should properly be available to the public.</P>
      <P>The normal procedure for securing the release of information is that one makes a request which is either granted or denied. In the event that one is not given the information requested, under most sections there is an obligation on the person refusing it to provide reasons for doing so. On those occasions where there is a public interest test, there is an obligation on the Secretary General or whoever is making the decision to tell one why it is not in the public interest to give one the particular information requested. That is a very important guideline and provision which gives a certain amount of security to people making requests. It ensures at least that proper consideration is given to requests because a reason must be given for a request being refused.</P>
      <P>Under the 1997 Act there are four sections where there is no obligation on the person making the decision to give a reason or disclose whether the information requested exists. In essence, it is a neither confirm nor deny response. The reasoning behind this is relatively obvious. However, there is a problem with this type of provision because it is not possible to make a serious appeal if one does not know that the information exists in the first instance. It is not possible to test whether something is in the public interest if one is not being told whether such information exists. I understand that some of the existing provisions &ndash; such as those relating to security in Northern Ireland, international affairs, etc. &ndash; are already governed by the type of neither confirm nor deny response to which I refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no idea why the Bill seeks to extend the circumstances in which one can be refused information or why there is no obligation to explain the reason for such refusal or to tell one whether information relating to the category in which one is interested exists. The categories to which it is being extended relate to commercially sensitive information, information given in confidence to a <Col N="1627" />Department of State or to a body that is covered by the Act and personal information.</P>
    <P>To take the example of the category of information obtained in confidence, as it is termed in the Act, the relevant section in the principal Act states that the head of a Department should refuse to grant information if the information had been given in confidence to a Department of State. It also states that if the head of a Department decides to refuse to grant information, he or she must set out the reasons, in the public interest, that he or she made that refusal. In effect, by allowing a head of a Department to give a neither confirm nor deny response, it will not be necessary &ndash; certainly it will not be open to independent scrutiny &ndash; for the head of a Department to decide to set out why he or she is making a particular decision or to what the public interest test that has been applied amounts. In many cases, it could amount to virtually nothing.</P>
    <P>I will provide an example in respect of information given in confidence. If a person makes a representation to the Department of Finance seeking a particular measure in the Finance Bill or in the budget, it would be normal practice for the Department to disclose that information, regardless of whether it was given to it in confidence. That would be good practice and I suspect it is the normal practice in a Department. However, it could be argued by the individual who made the representation that he or she never intended that it would be known to the public and, in many cases, this would not be the case. The deciding officer has discretion to allow that information enter the public arena in the public interest and, in most instances, we would all agree that it is in the public interest.</P>
    <P>If we agree to this extension of the neither confirm nor deny provision, it will not be necessary to do any of that. It will not be necessary for the head of a Department or the person making the decision to set out why he or she chose not to release information and I suspect that a good deal less information will be released because none of us would know whether it was there in the first instance. There will be an option for the Department of Finance, in this particular case, to close off the information by neither confirming nor denying that a representation was made because that is the easiest option. There might be circumstances in which the Department would be tempted to actively seek to conceal such information.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind in respect of commercially sensitive information. I refer here to information relating to semi-State bodies. While I do not want commercially sensitive information that would be of use to competitors of, for example, Aer Lingus, to be in the public arena, it is in our interests, given that these are publicly owned companies, to know a certain amount about their activities. The discretion to release such information in the public interest should be retained. While I appreciate that this section is not being deleted, <Col N="1628" />it will be unenforceable in circumstances where the deciding officer can have the option of neither confirming nor denying whether the information exists in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The third area into which this is being extended is the area of personal information and this relates directly to the release of personal information to third parties. At present the general presumption is that if I make a request for records which contain personal information about someone else, normally I will be refused, but there is discretion on the part of the head of section or the person making the decision to release that information if he considers it in the public interest to do so. The exercise of that discretion will be unnecessarily and immediately curtailed if we bring in the provision in the first part of this amending section.</P>
    <P>There is a second part to this section but I will leave it at that for continuity of thought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to ensure that in cases of a refusal to confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of a record, the provisions of sections 19, 20 and 21 of the Bill are invoked. Public bodies are not obliged to disclose the existence or non-existence of such records in a notification to a requester.</P>
      <P>This amendment is consequential on amendments proposed to sections Nos. 19, 20 and 21. It deals with situations where the mere acknowledgement of the existence of a record would reveal sensitive information. As the Senator said, it covers personal information, information obtained in confidence and commercially sensitive information. An example would be medical records, where merely acknowledging the existence of a record could reveal sensitive personal information &ndash; for example, a requester asking for all records held on a third party by a hospital. It is obvious that it could be harmful even for the hospital to reveal it holds records.</P>
      <P>There is a public interest test in the new refusal to confirm or deny provisions. Before one can refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records under the three sections the decision-maker will be obliged to consider the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that it is impossible to know whether the head actually considers the public interest or not. In effect this cannot be appealed as one does not know that the information was withheld. If the response one gets neither confirms nor denies that there was information there, then one is not really in a position to appeal it and obviously one cannot scrutinise in any way how the public interest provision weighs with the person who made the decision. We should be very slow to go down this road because it allows something very close to a class exemption. We have already given class exemptions to the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform on pretty much everything they do, as they are effectively allowed to neither confirm nor deny that they hold par<Col N="1629" />ticular information and are therefore not open to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>We are now bringing this provision into three other areas and I make these points so trenchantly because it is not at all clear to me why we need to do so in the three areas set out in the Bill &ndash; third party information, information in confidence and commercially sensitive information. Surely it is sufficient to allow the current position, where the deciding officer can use discretion on where the public interest lies rather than a provision which neither confirms nor denies.</P>

      <P>To address one point made by Senator McDowell, we should operate on the assumption that public servants, according to their lights, will administer the vast majority of cases with integrity rather than on any other supposition.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell gave the example of a budget submission containing commercially sensitive information. I find it hard to conceive of a budget submission looking for a change in the Finance Act that would be commercially sensitive and therefore could not be released. One is dealing with general legislation and I am not sure if that is a real danger.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is where my difficulty lies. It is almost impossible for someone to appeal a refusal of information if they have not been told that information exists in the first place. If I go to the Department of Finance looking for these budget submissions and the Department neither confirms nor denies that there are such things, how can I test whether or not a public interest test has been carried out? How can I test what went through the Secretary General's mind in refusing my application if he is not telling me he had information in the first place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>But one does not know what has been refused. Surely when people are making a decision to appeal or not they must have some basis on which to appeal; that means they must have some basis to assess the decision that was made. If they do not know what has been refused to them or they are not even told they have been refused particular information, then they may just be told they are getting nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come at this from a different angle, as I am getting nowhere with this approach.</P>
      <P>There must surely be an onus on Government to justify the extension into these three additional areas. The Minister of State has said nothing yet which would justify the extension of the &ldquo;neither confirm nor deny&rdquo; provision into these three areas. Why is this being done?</P>

      <P>The point is that no convincing argument is being put to answer Senator McDowell's points. If one reflects on what Senator Mansergh said about the need for certainty, accuracy and lack of ambivalence, this provision is full of shades and there is no way one can see it operating to help those who will be seeking information. It pulls another cloak over this operation and is another regressive step. Senator McDowell and I accept the Minister of State's point about commercial interests and one can see the reasonableness of dealing with these issues, but it can also be dealt with another way. The way we are going into this creates a puzzle within a puzzle and one gets lost in the middle.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;neither confirm nor deny&rdquo; provision is an easy way out and will not only be used, it will be overused. It is like saying that certain sections of the Offences Against the State Act would not be used; it would be worthwhile looking at that again, as such provisions may have a different intention than they had when put together. It would be easier to use this option than to make someone get information together for two weeks if that were necessary and that is understandable. It is not acceptable but it is understandable. This provision makes it possible for that to happen. It will be the easiest option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how this would be acceptable. Are the people who put these proposals together committed to more access or less access to information? Every proposal closes down access. Where does that leave us? I cannot connect this with the articulate points made by Senator Mansergh about the culture of wanting to make freedom of information provisions work. I know freedom of information officers who are very committed to what they are doing but they will <Col N="1631" />be implementing the law as they find it. What we are doing is stepping backwards and closing this down. There is a change of culture here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher. In discussing the future of St. Joseph's secondary school in Newtownforbes on the outskirts of Longford town one cannot avoid looking beyond its proposed closure to the broader issue, namely, the repeated use of education as a political tool by the Government. Unfortunately for the people of Newtownforbes, we are once again faced with a scenario which is becoming all too familiar, that is, pre-general election promises being broken and local communities being left to pick up the pieces.</P>
      <P>In this case the promise came from the Taoiseach when he travelled to Newtownforbes to meet the St. Joseph's steering committee in the lead-up to the general election. The committee accepted his word and believed he meant what he said. Prior to his visit it had received numerous representations from his office. There has been nothing but the sound of silence ever since. The general election is over and the Government has been re-elected but the students and parents of Newtownforbes have definitely lost out as they and others like them are left to suffer the consequences of the Government's mismanagement.</P>
      <P>I turn to the events leading up to the current impasse in relation to St. Joseph's secondary school. More than two years ago the Sisters of Mercy announced their decision to relinquish trusteeship of the school. This news came as a great shock to the people of the locality as the nuns had a long and happy association with education in Longford. An independent assessor was appointed in 2001 to determine the viability of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite numerous attempts, the steering committee was unable to secure a meeting with the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods. It was not until it staged a two day protest outside the Department of Education and Science that he agreed to a meeting. At the time the people of Longford were disappointed that the matter had to go so far before he agreed to such a meeting. The Taoiseach had also intervened to facilitate a meeting and half promised he would do his best to continue providing education in Newtownforbes. Was it his intention to get safely <Col N="1632" />beyond the general election? The subsequent outcome proved this to be the case.</P>
    <P>Following the meeting the consensus, both in relation to the Department of Education and Science's file on St. Joseph's secondary school and Dr. Tom McCarthy's report, was that the green light would be given to keep the school open to cater for the growing number of students in the area. Allied to the visit and promise of the Taoiseach, this gave great hope to the people of Newtownforbes.</P>
    <P>The combined capacity of the other three schools in Longford town is approximately 1,555 pupils. There are 625 places in St. Mel's College, which is for boys only. We are all aware that Scoil Mhuire, which has 630 places for girls, recently turned away some 25 students because there were no places for them. The school is already overcrowded and has no space for expansion. I understand a similar problem arose last week at St. Mel's which was unable to accommodate all the students who turned up for enrolment and in Moyne, north County Longford. The vocational school has 400 places, 155 of which are already taken up on PLC courses.</P>
    <P>Projected enrolment, a combination of normal projections, housing developments and improved employment prospects brought about by the announcement of Abbots of a commitment to create 600 new jobs in the Longford area, is approximately 2,225, which leaves a shortfall of 670 places for secondary level students. If we were to look further afield to Cardinal Health which, despite deferral, hopes to provide 1,300 jobs by the end of 2005, the shortfall would increase significantly. Allied to this, the recent census of population shows that the population has increased substantially which will leave us with an even greater demand for places in the future.</P>
    <P>These figures back up our case and put the onus on the Minister for Education and Science to rescind his decision to close St. Joseph's secondary school. In a recent letter to me he appears to base his decision to close the school on figures and projections totally at odds with the accurate and well researched ones I have just outlined. I put it to him that his figures are not based on facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated in his letter: &ldquo;I acknowledge that a small number of pupils may be disappointed at not gaining access to their first choice of post primary school.&rdquo; Far from affecting a small number, the closure of St. Joseph's secondary school would cause major hardship and disruption to all the students of Newtownforbes and the surrounding area. In addition, pupils have traditionally travelled from outside the county to attend the school.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the efforts of the two Dáil Deputies for Longford in this matter. They have let down the people of Longford and the Minister, whom they fed inaccurate information on needs and population. They were wishy-washy in their approach, which is a polite way of saying <Col N="1633" />they did very little to assist Newtownforbes and failed the students, parents and teachers of the area.</P>
    <P>Even based on such erroneous information, it is a serious indictment of a senior Minister to suggest, as the Minister for Education and Science did in his letter to me of 28 February 2003, that the population of Longford will remain static until 2009. If the decision to close St. Joseph's secondary school is based solely on such unusual statistics, God help Longford. The other secondary schools in the county do not have the capacity to take an increase in students. Will the Minister allow the children of County Longford to be transported at all hours of the morning to secondary schools outside the county? This would impose a huge burden on their parents who would have to pay extra transport costs. Why is there not a coherent policy to keep children in schools in their own county, rather than travelling to schools 40 miles away?</P>
    <P>On behalf of the people of Longford, I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision on this fine school which has put Longford education on the map for many years. I have a petition on the retention of the school signed by all the councillors on Longford Town Council and in mid-County Longford. I intend to hand the petition, which has the support of the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats parties in the area, to the Minister. A public meeting on the matter will be held in Longford in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to outline to the House the position on St. Joseph's secondary school, Newtownforbes, County Longford. The school is one of four post-primary schools in the area and was established in the early 1950s. Formerly an all girls boarding school, co-education was introduced during the 1970s. In 1989 the boarding element was closed.</P>
      <P>Enrolments at the school peaked in the early 1990s at over 450 pupils. However, ten years later there had been a steady decline in numbers to a level of 173 pupils in September 2000. Based on this pattern of decline, future intakes of less than 30 pupils per annum could have been anticipated. In December 2000 the school trustees, the Mercy Sisters, western province, announced their intention to effect a phased closure of the school over two years with final closure at the end of the 2002-03 school year. Accordingly, there has been no intake of first year pupils since September 2000 but all current pupils, including the 2003 examination pupils, were facilitated in completing their junior or senior cycles, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the trustees announcement of closure, the Department of Education and Science received representations from a local steering committee which was set up with a view to keeping the school open. The case for the retention of the school has been ongoing for some time and has been the subject of several reviews in the <Col N="1634" />Department and also by an independent facilitator.</P>
    <P>The Minister met representatives of the retention committee in October last and, notwithstanding all previous reviews, undertook to have his officials re-examine all the issues, including the most up to date demographic data from Census 2002, housing and planning applications data from the local authorities, pupil movement into and out of the catchment area and the capacity of the Longford town schools. Following this review, the Minister arrived at the definitive conclusion that there is no basis for the retention of a second level school in Newtownforbes. The Department is satisfied that there is sufficient capacity overall in the remaining schools in the catchment area to meet the projected post-primary education needs of pupils in the Longford-Newtownforbes area.</P>
    <P>Enrolment trends in the Longford-Newtownforbes catchment area will be carefully monitored during the coming years. In the event that industrial and housing developments generate additional pupils in excess of existing capacity, the issue for the Department of Education and Science will be how to make good that shortfall within the capacity and potential of the Longford town schools. As resources permit, any requirement for capital investment will be concentrated on the Longford town schools.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. There was a deep sense of shock in Tipperary town last Thursday afternoon when the workforce, and then the population at large, were informed that in the principal factory in the town 150 out of 230 people would lose their jobs between the end of May and October. Pall Corporation was a replacement industry for Tambrands, which closed some years ago.</P>
      <P>This announcement came completely out of the blue, particularly as only a few months ago there were discussions about expanding the plant rather than reducing it. It has been acknowledged by everyone concerned that the workforce is excellent. There were no complaints of any kind about the quality of what was produced. One part of the plant produces medical filters while the other part produces industrial filters.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, visited the town on Thursday before the meeting took place. However, he was alerted that something was happening and he took the trouble to talk to IDA Ireland about the problem, both when he arrived and before he left. The decision was taken by the company headquarters in New York, without awareness of the devastating consequences for the people of the town. I have heard the decision described as shameful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industrial filter section of the plant is being retained and I hope Pall will consider adding some other line, if it is not possible for it to restore the line it has shifted to Mexico and <Col N="1635" />Puerto Rico. I note the announcement today in Waterford that a software plant is to be shifted to India. It is perhaps a sign of some of the dangers we face. Nonetheless, industries need access to the European market and Ireland still has one of the most competitive bases, both in terms of taxation and costs.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland and the Government have had some success in getting replacements relatively swiftly for towns like Roscrea and, some years ago, Clonmel. Part of the south-east region, particularly Tipperary, is concentrating on health and pharmaceutical plants. It has emphasised the pressing need, although it is not strictly relevant to this issue, for the town to benefit from decentralisation. Obviously different people will be involved in that.</P>
    <P>Tipperary is a town of tremendous potential which, unfortunately, has not yet been realised. It has excellent sporting, cultural and artistic facilities, but assistance is needed from the Government and IDA Ireland to promote the town. I detect in the reaction since this announcement that Tipperary is now a high priority in terms of completing an advance factory, finding somebody to fill the now mainly empty Pall work plant, refurbishing the industrial park and finding a use for the Namco plant. There is certainly plenty of space for a company to occupy.</P>
    <P>Tipperary is one of the best towns in the country in terms of self-help. I could refer, for example, to the West Tipperary Enterprise Group &ndash; which is located in the Station House &ndash; the new technology park, the Excel heritage centre, the Canon Hayes sports centre, the Knockarawley resource centre and Tipperary Community Radio. There are many examples and they are mostly supported by voluntary community effort, often with some difficulty.</P>
    <P>A delegation made up of councillors and public representatives is hoping to meet Pall representatives in New York next week. The Tánaiste has been asked to meet a deputation and no doubt she will make contact as advised by IDA Ireland. Obviously, by one means or another, replacement employment is needed as quickly as possible and before the 150 people lose their jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mansergh for raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste learned with grave disappointment of the recent decision by Pall to close its medical filter manufacturing operation in Tipperary with the loss of 155 jobs. The Tánaiste understands that the parent company has made a decision to transfer this line to Puerto Rico. The company currently employs a total of 230 people in the manufacture of medical and industrial filters in Tipperary town. While these job losses are regrettable, the Tánaiste is heartened that the remaining 75 people involved in the manufacture of industrial filters will continue in employment in Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to cease the manufacture of the <Col N="1636" />medical filters results from over capacity in the market place. The manufacture of medical filters will transfer to Puerto Rico, where Pall Corporation has an existing facility which is three times the size of the Irish plant.</P>
    <P>FÁS has already been in contact with company representatives to discuss a detailed programme to assist those who are being made redundant to find suitable alternative employment. FÁS has offered to make available its full range of support services including skills analysis, jobs placement, guidance and counselling interviews, identification of training needs and suitable training courses. FÁS will also ensure ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.</P>
    <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland's south east region office, in association with the management of the Tipperary Enterprise and Technology Centre and Tipperary South Riding County Enterprise Board, is currently planning a clinic for the staff of Pall who wish to consider self-employment. The resources of all three bodies will be used, as appropriate, to give assistance to those employees who wish to set up their own enterprise.</P>
    <P>In regard to positive developments in south Tipperary, the Tánaiste understands that the ALZA Corporation is currently building a 60,000 square feet facility in the IDA Ireland business park in Cashel. Scheduled to open later this year, the facility will manufacture patch technology products. Current employment is 22, but this is expected to grow to 100 employees at production stage. Total investment in the project is expected to be &euro;162 million.</P>
    <P>South Tipperary has a good range of foreign direct investment companies in the growing pharmaceutical and health care sectors. IDA Ireland will continue to promote Tipperary to potential investors, and the agency will also develop its business park in Tipperary town as an additional attraction. Planning permission has recently been secured to carry out an upgrade of the park by improving the entrance road and landscaping the site. An advance technology building of 16,000 sq. ft. will be built on the park this year. Additionally in the town, the former Namco building of 60,000 sq. ft. is available and being actively marketed by the agency.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland will focus on the growth sectors of international services, healthcare and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the information and communications sector is likely to have potential for the county in the medium and longer term. The IDA will work with existing clients in the county to encourage further new expansion activities. In the case of Pall, the company has indicated it is willing to be flexible in relation to future use of its building. This could free up an additional 170,000 sq ft of space, including 20,000 sq ft of clean room space, which can then be marketed to a new healthcare investor.</P>
    <P>The Tipperary Enterprise and Technology Centre is now fully operational and nine micro-enterprises have set up to date. It is hoped a num<Col N="1637" />ber of new enterprises will commence in the centre in the near future. In terms of increasing County Tipperary's attractiveness as a location for investment, the County Tipperary institute is currently operating two campuses, one in Clonmel with 300 students and the other in Thurles with 500 students. The Clonmel campus commenced courses in 2000 and is expecting the first graduate output in 2003. It is hoped to develop the institute's range of courses to take on more business and science students.</P>
    <P>The State development agencies under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are fully committed to the promotion of employment creation in south Tipperary, including Tipperary town. The agencies work closely with each other and the development bodies in the area, as well as other local bodies and interests in facilitating an integrated approach to enterprise development in south Tipperary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and at this late hour will not keep him long. Since he comes from a county where tourism is so important, he will understand what I am talking about.</P>
      <P>There is apparently a huge downturn in the tourism business. I have received figures which show that bookings are down by 30% to 50%, mainly in sectors which would have booked well in advance such as the corporate sector, conventions and large groups. I keep hearing those involved in the tourism business appealing to the Minister to do something. I wondered if they could not do more themselves.</P>
      <P>I have frequently been involved in bringing conferences to Ireland which is a very popular destination. These sorts of groups which are coming for a specific purpose are less likely to be afraid to come because of President Bush's proposed war in Iraq than many casual tourists. I am involved in one conference where the date of closure before incurring a cancellation fee is 14 March. No decision has been made in the United Nations regarding whether the United States will go to war in Iraq, regardless of whether there is a second UN declaration. It is very hard to get people to put their money down if they know they will lose it in the event of war and they feel they should not travel.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will encourage the airlines and large hotels and conference centres to be more flexible over cancellation fees. All they need do is extend the dates by one month. It is particularly important that they do so because our competitors in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Canada have done just this. I know the Minister cannot make private enterprises do anything but perhaps he will suggest they look to helping themselves on this very important issue. I am expecting a group from William and Mary University in July. It is important to recognise the corporate groups which come to conferences are very big spenders. Not only are we losing numbers of visitors, we are also losing big spenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" />The airlines, hotels and conference centres must reconsider cancellation fees and be more flexible. We may end up with no one, just the cancellation money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment. It gives me little pleasure to speak about the challenges facing the tourism sector when, for the third year in a row, the industry is facing economic and financial pressures caused by events completely outside its control. The Senator's motion calls for encouragement of the airline and hotel industry to adopt flexible practices in relation cancellations during the current volatile market situation. Obviously, this is a commercial matter for each business to decide, as appropriate, given its particular circumstances and relationship with its customers.</P>
      <P>As Members of the House are aware, responsibility for the airline industry falls within the remit of the Minister for Transport and his Department. Obviously, as air access is key to tourism development, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is keeping in close and regular contact with the Department of Transport as contingency plans evolve for a possible Gulf conflict. The Minister has been informed that Aer Lingus is following recent practices adopted by US carriers in order that customers wishing to postpone their travel plans to and from the United States will be issued with vouchers that can be used at a more opportune time. To date no changes are envisaged in other markets and the relevant companies are keeping the situation under review.</P>
      <P>As regards the hotel sector, only last week the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism attended the annual conference of the Irish Hotels Federation where he heard at first hand the very latest developments and approaches being adopted by hoteliers in order to sustain their business this year. I know they have responded very positively to calls for flexibility and I am confident they are unlikely to take any action which would weaken the very good relationship they have with tour operators whom they regard as valued customers. I understand each hotel will decide on what practice to follow, which will protect their business in the longer term while meeting their customer needs as best they can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that the tourism industry has learned a great deal from the recent experiences of foot and mouth disease and the events of 11 September 2001 which should stand it in good stead. Similarities with the previous Gulf War do not necessarily apply now. In the early 1990s the US consumer felt safer at home. Whether that is still true to the same extent, having regard to the impact of the events of 11 September 2001 and other terrorist attacks worldwide, is difficult to judge. Today's more well informed independent traveller might not be as easily deterred from travelling as previously. The tourism sector in Ireland is a mature and resilient industry which has a proven capacity to deal with external shocks. The major difference between the pre<Col N="1639" />vious two crises and the Iraqi situation is that the industry has had good notice.</P>
    <P>No one can predict with confidence how the current situation will unfold or how long it will take to resolve. We are, however, forewarned and the Minister is confident the tourism agencies and the industry are well placed to implement whatever contingency plans are necessary to deal with the difficulties and challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>As the House will know, the Minister recently initiated a major review of tourism policy and performance under the chairmanship of Mr. John Travers, the outgoing chief executive of Forfás, in order to chart a new direction for tourism. This is the first such review in ten years and the Minister is particularly pleased that such an eminent group drawn from within and outside the tourism industry have given their services to undertake this important work. The group is consulting <Col N="1640" />widely and the agenda is wide-ranging, covering product utilisation and innovation; business capability; competitiveness and standards; marketing; access transport; infrastructure and environmental requirements; research and planning; and institutional arrangements, including regional structures and the co-ordination of support measures. The Minister looks forward to receiving the report of the review group later this year.</P>
    <P>The industry is facing genuine difficulties but the resilience that it has clearly demonstrated over the past two seasons has proven its capacity to address external shocks. I am certain that it will be sensitive to the Senator's call for flexibility in relation to cancellations arising from a possible conflict in the Gulf and that it will take careful note of her suggestions which I will bring to the attention of the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30&nbsp;a.m. on Wednesday, 12 March 2003.</P>
