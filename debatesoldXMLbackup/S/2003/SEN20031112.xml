      <P>Last week many colleagues raised the issue of embryonic stem cell research and a pending decision of the European Council on potential funding in this area in the future. The Leader said she would do her best to see if a debate could be organised, particularly given the current position of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this matter, which seems to be at variance with a committee of the House. I know the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will go back to the committee, but a debate in plenary session of this House would be very important. Could that be organised over the next week or so or at least prior to the decision on 27 November?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On an entirely different matter, as part of the benchmarking awards, local government in this country will have to shell out &euro;161 million to pay for this award locally. The Government's latest position is that this would have to be found from existing resources in local authorities throughout the country. If that remains the position, as I understand it does, every householder in the country will have to pay at least an additional &euro;130 next year to fund this new award. If the <Col N="890" />Government decides not to bail out the local authorities they will have two options, one to hike up charges and the other to cut back services. What are we going to have next year? </P>
    <P>I would like the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come into the House for a debate on local government funding. Benchmarking was put to the people as part of the brave new world beginning on 1 January next, but it is the taxpayers who will foot the bill, nationally and locally. The Government is not giving one additional cent to the local authorities in this regard. We need a debate on this issue as soon as possible and I urge the Leader to act on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>Yesterday, Senator McCarthy sought a debate on the prisons issue. We need to know what is going on in this matter. Can the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House to explain to us what he is thinking of doing? It may be that he has the answers but I do not understand the issue, no one else does and I have been trying to get information on the row between the prison officers and the Department or the Irish Prison Service.</P>
      <P>The Prison Officers Association has put forward a proposal to save &euro;30 million annually in prison overtime and this is not being discussed by any of the parties. There may be issues here that I do not understand. I am very slow to get involved in industrial relations issues on the floor of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed. These things are better left to the experts, however, I would like to hear why, with such goodwill on both sides, a resolution to the problem cannot be found or why it cannot be dealt with by a third party. It seems that people are taking strong positions unnecessarily and that we are walking ourselves into trouble, which we do not need to do.</P>
      <P>People talk about the closure of some of the prisons and Spike Island is one that comes to mind. Spike Island is a very successful prison and there is a huge educational and rehabilitative element in much of what it is doing. It would be a huge loss to the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not purport to be an expert in this area but I see there are issues which need to be addressed. The Prison Officers Association is making serious attempts to move the matter forward. The association may not be completely right and the Minister's ideas may not be completely right either. It is time we heard the argu<Col N="891" />ments on both sides so we can come to a conclusion as to how the matter should be moved forward before we find ourselves in another huge mess.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Toole on the prisons issue and on what was said here yesterday. I am at a loss to know who will run the two prisons to be withdrawn from the supervision of the Irish Prison Service. Will it be a management consultant? What is going on?</P>
      <P>I am discomfited by Ministers who produce diversions. For the past 12 months the smoking ban controversy took the heat off the Minister for Health and Children. I suspect this issue is intended to take the heat off the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at a time when many of our urban areas are terrified by rampant gangland crime, which is apparently making huge parts of the country ungovernable. It creates a wonderful smokescreen to raise the issue of prison officers' overtime, which obviously needs to be resolved.</P>
      <P>Last week I asked for a debate on embryonic stem cell research. This matter urgently needs to be debated before the Government makes a decision about how it is going to deal with an EU proposal. This is necessary for a number of reasons. First, it is wrong in principle for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to become the arbiter of ethical decisions. Second, after the shock of the first Nice treaty referendum we thought we had moved away from the secretive EU decision making that characterised our relationship with the EU. It is still not clear whether the Government believes it needs to have the approval of the Oireachtas before it decides an issue like this. If the Government believes it can make whatever policy it likes in Europe without reference to the Oireachtas that is a recipe for trouble down the line. Ireland's attitude to the EU will be damaged and people will believe they have no say in the decision-making process. It is urgent that we have a debate, not at some vague time in the future but before 27 November, when this decision will be taken. An Oireachtas committee has already made its views known. It is time the Oireachtas was heard on the issue. It would be profoundly wrong to do otherwise.</P>
      <P>It seems increasingly necessary that we have a debate on Aer Rianta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unclear what motivated the decision to go the route chosen by the Government. Neither business, commercial nor other logic supports it. Ideology is a factor, but that is a bad basis on which to make pragmatic business or political decisions. One should pick what works. All the published advice says this is not a good business decision. We do not know what other advice is available because the Minister for <Col N="892" />Transport will not publish it. Therefore, I would like us to debate the matter. I ask the Leader to ask her good friend, the Minister, to publish all of the background information.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil yesterday the Taoiseach said new primary legislation would be needed to help the Health and Safety Authority to enforce the smoking ban. We now have two Bills dealing with insurance and one dealing with smoking which are due to be passed by both Houses before Christmas. Does the Leader know when any of them will be published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on the issue of advertising to children? The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has invited submissions on this matter. If the Oireachtas debated this issue, particularly at this time of year when we see the continual daily intrusion into the lives of children and their exploitation, Members could put their views on the record and these could be submitted to the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, I requested that the Minister come to the House to answer questions on the Irish Prison Service. I have read in a newspaper a statement from the Prison Officers Association that more than 600 prisoners are on the run. They have absconded from open prisons, failed to return from temporary release, left hospitals, left their escorts or escaped in a number of other ways. Is this true? If so it adds a worrying dimension to the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the call for a debate on the question of levies on the building of new houses. In today's newspaper I read of a proposal to impose levies amounting to &euro;28,000 on stand-alone properties. Galway County Council has confirmed that there are proposals for a levy of between &euro;5,000 and &euro;8,000.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of the amount of the levies, we should debate this issue. Levies and development charges have been introduced with no explanation as to the services being provided, apart from water, roads, sewerage and other such amenities. When we debated the issue of bin charges, reference was made to paying for a local authority service. In the case of building levies, however, people do not see what service they are paying for. It is important to debate this issue when levies have risen to the present level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I call Senator Ross. As many Senators are offering I ask for brevity. I am not saying this because you are rising, Senator Ross. I refer to every Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Cathaoirleach wants to continue I will not interrupt him. I support the call by Senator Ryan for a debate on Aer Rianta as <Col N="893" />it is important to hold one at this time. I travelled through Dublin Airport on Monday. It is a complete shambles. While Senator Ryan and I might not agree about the direction Aer Rianta and airports should take, the consumer is suffering as a result of the political paralysis and the extraordinary carry on that is going on at the top level.</P>
      <P>It is time the House faced up to the fact that some strange things are happening. When the Minister declared yesterday that there are forces frustrating what he wants to do, the House is entitled to know what he is talking about. This matter is of great importance to tourism, imports and exports and all sorts of areas that are vital to the economy. Forces that we apparently do not understand are frustrating this. I ask the Leader to consider inviting the Minister for Transport to the House to explain what he means by saying forces are at work, why he is being frustrated and, particularly, that he identifies the source of leaks from Cabinet that are obviously frustrating the wishes of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the call for a debate on the prison issue. While prison officers do a difficult job, it must be recognised that changes are long overdue. Given there are more prison officers than prisoners and costs exceed those anywhere else in Europe, it is important that we look at this issue.</P>
      <P>I couple this with the call for the debate on Aer Rianta and the difficult industrial relations circumstances regarding the implementation of Government policy. This highlights the need for a debate on the broader issue of trade unionism in the public services. The progressive and constructive relationship between trade unions and employers in the private sector that has evolved during the years of partnership has not been replicated in the public sector. There is a need for debate on this. We might get a more enlightened approach from trade unionism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins Mr. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the call from all sides of the House regarding the debate on the proposals on prison reform made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister responded to the gangland murders in Limerick and the collapse of the Limerick murder trial by saying he would not be goaded into a knee-jerk reaction. However, his announcement yesterday is a typical knee-jerk reaction. He is facing a major confrontation. I agree there is a need to deal with the issue of overtime for prison officers, but we also need an urgent debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the omissions from the Minister's recommendations relates to prison visiting committees. We have called time and again for a debate on this matter. Some time ago, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, suggested it would be a good idea to include former reformed inmates on restructured visiting committees as they could bring their unique insight, expertise and experience to bear. <Col N="894" />The idea was castigated by elements in the media. While I support it, it needs to be done in the context of a clear, crisp and analytical debate.</P>
    <P>Last week we debated the ESRI's mid-term evaluation of the NDP. The Indecon report, commissioned by the Government, makes riveting reading regarding the gross discrimination against the Border, midlands and western region. The report needs to be debated as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>Two Senators have called for a debate on stem cell research and I agree with this. Senator Ryan mentioned the Oireachtas having an input into decisions made in Europe. This is important, particularly in the question of embryonic stem cell research and EU proposal 2003/390/EC, which deals with funding requests. The Oireachtas committee made a decision that has received unanimous support from both the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties. We live in a representative democracy and every issue does not go before the people. There was spontaneous opposition to this proposal in committee. While the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not a member of my party, I suggest that she reflect that democratic view and become part of the minority blocking group against this proposal.</P>

There are currently several plans in the public domain yet nobody knows where we are going on this.</P>

We have called on the Minister &ndash; we have debated this matter many times &ndash; to outline to this House how he intends dealing with this problem. All the Minister can say at a time when there is so much crime on our streets is that he is to close some of our prisons.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes's call for the Minister with responsibility for local government to come to this House to outline how it is our local authorities will pay benchmarking Those in the commercial sector will have to foot this bill.

We now face the situation where teachers and parents on boards of management at primary school level are to strike until they get the refurbishment programmes promised for the past two years. We are led to believe there will be further cuts in spending in this area. There are also proposals at third level for drastic cuts in funding for capital work. The end result will be that graduates, which we badly need in certain specialised areas, will not come through the system to regenerate our economy. There is an urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline to this House his policy on funding of capital works in the education sector.</P>

I now hear rumours, from a very good source, that it is to be deferred until after the next local elections. It is disgraceful that we have been strung along in this manner. It is pathetic that <Col N="899" />Fianna Fáil and PD Senators and Deputies have published statements in local papers in this regard and yet they have done nothing about it in concrete terms.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that motor tax increases were introduced approximately one year ago. That increase was, at the time, passed off as of benefit to us in terms of our roads. It has now emerged that not one extra penny was spent on our roads. I agree with the comments of colleagues on development charges. It is outrageous that on the anniversary of the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant we are now faced with a first-time buyer's tax. Every local authority in the country will increase its development charges by thousands of euro.</P>
      <P>I also ask that the Leader request the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to meet with us in this House. We have learned today that &euro;108 million will be spent on CPOs for the new Kilcullen-Waterford motorway. What is the position of the Progressive Democrats on this motorway? Is it to go ahead? I cannot obtain a reply to that question. The signals coming from the Progressive Democrats are conflicting. We are speaking here about taxpayers' money.</P>

It will be difficult to find a Minister who can deal with the issue but I will continue to seek one out.</P>

      <P>The Estimates will be published on Thursday. There has been a great deal of debate on the need for finance in various sectors. We should await publication of the Estimates in which, I am sure, the increases needed will be included. Senator O'Toole said that he cannot <Col N="900" />understand why there are not co-operative talks between the two sides. Each has ideas, but they do not seem to be coming together on them. We will see what develops over the next few days on that. Senator Ryan raised the question of who will run the two prisons, Loughan House and The Curragh, which are to be taken from the prison service. He wondered if it was a tactic to divert attention from the everyday issue of crime. For a long time, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, and his Department have sought a useful debate with the prison officers, but neither side seems to have arrived at that point.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also raised embryonic stem cell research, a matter on which I am in complete agreement with him. I am sure all Senators are getting letters, e-mails and faxes on the issue. Everyone is getting very worked up about it. We must have the issue explained. The Senator referred to the secretive EU. I fully agree because we have been talking about that in our own committee. We must know on most issues what exactly the European Union plans rather than have it pounce something on us about which we are not clear.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also asked about the possibility of providing time for a debate on Aer Rianta. We have been informed that an Aer Rianta Bill will be published next week. We have also been told that it will be taken in the Seanad. The Senator has asked for a debate and that will take place. I do not know what is happening, since what has emerged can only have come from one level, as we know. We have been told that the Bill is due next week, and that it will be taken in this House. We must wait to see if that is correct.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox asked for a debate on advertising aimed at children and how it affects them. There have been many calls about that, and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, also spoke about it. Senator Finucane read that 600 prisoners are on the loose for various reasons, perhaps not having returned after parole. I do not know if that figure is correct. It was in the newspapers, and we can seek to clarify it. If it is correct, it seems a huge number. Senator Kitt asked for a debate on the development charges. I have a note on that, received from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government this morning, which I will read at the end. Senator Ross wants a debate on Aer Rianta. He said that forces were frustrating the Minister, the same claim made in a newspaper this morning. Documents were released, I assume from the Cabinet or its environs, as Cabinet documents come to the Cabinet table and are then taken away again. The Minister would probably like to know himself where they came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh is keen to have a wider debate on public sector employees, particularly the prison officers and Aer Rianta. Senator Higgins asked for a debate on crime. The Minister had said that there should be no knee-jerk reaction to this matter. The current debate about prisons seems to him to be a knee-jerk reaction. I <Col N="901" />hope that more details will emerge in coming days. There is a strategy involved on both sides. One hopes that they can get align their strategies to bring matters to a proper conclusion. The Senator quoted the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, who suggested that there should be ex-prisoners on prisoners' visiting committees, only to be shouted down. I thought that a very sensible suggestion, as no one would know more about what goes on in prisons than ex-prisoners. The Senator asked about the Indecon report commissioned by the Government. I hope that we will get a chance, now that the legislative pace is accelerating, to debate the report.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin also asked for a debate on stem cell research. Everyone is seeking that now, so we will have to have one. Senator O'Meara asked which Minister is involved. The Cathaoirleach dealt with that matter, but I admired her chutzpah in raising it.</P>

      <P>Senator Leyden asked about development charges. He was in fine form, if a little noisy. Senator Bannon asked about benchmarking and the whole issue of planning and development charges. We will have to arrange a debate on that, as it is too big a topic for an Adjournment debate. Senator McCarthy asked about a disability Bill. The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill is on Second Stage in the Dáil. We have asked about the major disability Bill on several occasions, but have no idea when it is coming or what it will contain. I know from people who have taken part in the process that consultations involving those who will be affected by the Bill are ongoing. I do not know if it contains what the Senator referred to, but there was a debate this morning. Professor Brian Nolan has come out with a report, but I am not clear from it whether he is in favour of rights. The report seems to go half way towards that stance. The Senator went on to talk about the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry spoke about the naked crime on the streets. There is truth in that. I have spoken to people who feel they are no longer safe. I suppose that some of us always have that feeling, but it is particularly prevalent now. The Minister informed me that he wishes to come into the House to discuss the issue. However, society has a role too. Senator Terry also spoke about benchmarking. The Estimates are due to be published this week. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said that his Estimates will show a fair increase in funding for Garda activities. We look forward to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coghlan asked about Coillte. I can confirm that it is to move to the Department of Agriculture and Food. Everyone I wish to address has vanished, although I do not single out the Senator. I do not know when the move will <Col N="902" />occur. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill will be a Seanad Bill. That will be taken next week, and we should have the Bill today. It is a very long Bill and will require much debate when it comes here. Senator Coghlan also supported Senator Ross's comments on Aer Rianta.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be in the Seanad to report on the amendments made to the Containment of Nuclear Weapons Bill 2000 during its passage through the Dáil. I have said that some time has passed since the Bill was passed by the Seanad. Senators will recall that it was passed by the House in May 2000 and it passed Second Stage in the Dáil in February 2001. An issue arose at that point, however, concerning the administration and implementation of the requirements of the Bill as they relate to the national authority <i>vis-à-vis</i> the role of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. These issues necessitated consultation with, <i>inter alia</i>, the European Union, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The fact that the State initiated legal action against the UK in respect of Sellafield around that time, when taken with the heightened pressure on emergency planning and management arising from the terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001, meant that resources in the Department were stretched beyond capacity at that time. This, in turn, resulted in a delay in progressing the Bill to Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress was delayed because the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment had reservations about the role accorded to them in <Col N="904" />respect of administrative and implementation issues arising from the Bill. They saw little or no role for them, in effect, in implementing the provisions of the Bill, most notably in the context of the completion of the Internal Market of the European Union. Nevertheless, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department have information about imports, if any, into Ireland from outside the EU and about exports, if any, of equipment and materials specified in Annex II of the protocol.</P>
    <P>It was agreed following consultation between my Department, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the implementing regulations to be made when the Bill is enacted will stipulate that the information required to be provided by persons engaged in any of the activities set out in the protocol and the Bill should be provided to the national authority, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. It is not intended at this time, therefore, that the implementing regulations will stipulate a role for the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The matter will be reviewed, in consultation with all parties, some two or three years after implementation. Any adjustments necessary or desirable can be carried out, arising from that review, based on actual experience. This has been agreed between the parties as a sensible approach in the circumstances. The Bill resumed its passage through the Dáil when the issues were resolved as indicated. It passed Committee Stage on 8 October and Report and Final Stages in the Dáil on 5 November last.</P>
    <P>Although this is a comparatively straightforward Bill and one on which there is a high degree of consensus, it is nevertheless very important. The enactment of the Bill is necessary to enshrine the necessary provisions in Irish law to enable Ireland to ratify and implement its obligations under the protocol to the existing 1973 nuclear safeguards agreement between the 13 non-nuclear weapons states of the European Atomic Energy Community, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Atomic Energy Community itself. The safeguards agreement is a key element of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons treaty, which is the cornerstone of international nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. The safeguards agreement provides the mechanism by which the IAEA, and through it the international community, can be satisfied that states are fulfilling their obligations under the non-proliferation treaty.</P>
    <P>The protocol to the safeguards agreement was signed up to by the 13 non-nuclear weapons states of EURATOM in 1998. It aims to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing safeguards regime by bringing specified equipment and material within the scope of the safeguards agreement. The protocol relates to equipment and material which are ostensibly for the peaceful production of nuclear energy, but which could be used by rogue states, <Col N="905" />for example, to produce nuclear weapons. The ratification of the protocol is in line with Ireland's long-standing position in respect of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.</P>
    <P>I have given an overview of the background to this Bill and, with the permission of the Chair, I would like to discuss the first group of amendments made to the Bill in the Dáil. The amendments in the first group are amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, 5 to 7, inclusive, 9 and 10, 13 and 14, and 19 to 24, inclusive. Senators will have noted that a large proportion of these amendments are of a drafting and presentational nature. They have not altered the substance of the Bill in any way. I am sure Senators will understand if I do not deal with the amendments in question individually, but I will mention a few of them. I will be happy to clarify the position in respect of other amendments if Members so desire.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 relates to the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;. When the Bill was passed by the Seanad in May 2000, responsibility for nuclear safety matters rested with the then Minister for Public Enterprise. Subsequent changes in ministerial functions and responsibilities mean that responsibility for nuclear safety now rests with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Hence, this amendment was necessary.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10, which are also Opposition amendments, relate to section 4 of the Bill. This section refers to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, or such other body as may from time to time be prescribed as the national authority in place of the institute, as the designated national authority for carrying out the State's obligations under the protocol. The amendment, which deleted the text in subsections 4(1) and 4(2) referring to &ldquo;such other body&rdquo;, was accepted on the grounds that the inclusion of the text in this section was superfluous because it was already covered in the definition of national authority in section 2.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21, also Opposition amendments, concern the protocol which is scheduled to the Bill and effectively delete all the foreign language text from that part of the protocol relating to the signature of the respective States to the protocol. They have the effect of making the text clearer and more comprehensible and have no impact on the legal meaning or interpretation, according to legal advice. The English language text is retained in full. These amendments should also be seen in the context of amendment No. 7, which relates to the definition of &ldquo;Protocol&rdquo; in section 2.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24 all relate to the Title and provide for the insertion of the dates when the protocol, the safeguards agreement and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons were signed.</P>
    <P>I have listed the detail of the changes effected through the amendments in the first group. They do not change the substance of the Bill in any way and they are very much textual. Many of <Col N="906" />them resulted from my acceptance of Opposition amendments on Committee Stage. They have improved the substance of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his explanation on the background to the Bill. It is three years since it was last dealt with in the House. Does it adequately address the issues of today? Much has happened since, such as the events of 11 September 2001.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister of State took advice from the EU Commission on the implementation of the Bill. I am concerned about the pro-nuclear undercurrents of many EU directives that have come before us in recent times and I am fearful of the advancement of the nuclear option in a number of proposed directives. We discussed one recently at the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. What we were led to believe is happening throughout Europe with regard to storage of nuclear waste, etc., is alarming. It is important we cover this matter adequately in a Bill at some stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome any directive, Bill or amendment thereto that will bring about better safety standards. Will this Bill do so? Does it include acceptable solutions with regard to the management of nuclear weapons? I was not a Member of this House when it last considered the Bill and therefore I am at odds with regard to the safety elements. Maybe the Minister of State could give some guarantees in this respect.</P>
      <P>We have inadequate storage systems. I understand many local authorities are storing radioactive materials and I am concerned about this. Much has happened since we first considered the Bill. There has been a huge rise in the level of radioactive waste, as evidenced in several areas of research, etc. Apart from the issue of nuclear weapons, that of hospital, medical and industrial waste must be considered. Perhaps the Minister of State will update the House in this regard.</P>
      <P>I raise these issues because we live in a fast-moving world and much can happen in a period of three years, as was the case in the past three. It must be asked, therefore, if this legislation is adequate to cover what has happened in the interim.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his clarifications. He is correct that the amendments under discussion are purely housekeeping in nature. I am a member of the committee of which Senator Bannon is also member and I agree with him that we must take this issue very seriously. Despite the length of time it has taken to deal with this Bill, it addresses the vast majority, if not all, the issues involved. I thank the Minister of State for outlining the amendments proposed in the Dáil which were accepted. Many of them were Opposition amendments, which gives an idea of the cross-party support that exists for the Bill. I await the Minister of State's remaining remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question raised by Senator Bannon, the Commission advice was solely on administrative details and clarified how other member states proposed to deal with the administration. Changes that have taken place since the Bill was initiated in the House, such as those pertaining to radioactive waste, are totally outside its scope. The legislation is unaffected by the delay in its passage. It is only concerned with implementing the protocol and has nothing to do with other EU directives.</P>
      <P>The protocol cannot come into force in the Union until all 13 member states without nuclear weapons &ndash; of the 15 member states, France and the United Kingdom have such weapons &ndash; have the necessary requirements in place for enforcing its provisions. Ireland and Italy are the only two states that do not have these in place. The moral authority of Ireland's traditional position on nuclear non-proliferation would be seriously undermined if we did not ratify the protocol. It is necessary that we have the implementing provisions enshrined in Irish law before the end of the year and before we assume the Presidency of the EU. We intend to lead from the front and we are doing so in the national interest.</P>
      <P>As soon as the Bill is enacted, the protocol will be ratified and there will be no delay in signing the regulations. Given the Bill's passage through the House today, I hope the protocol, for which there is almost unanimous support, will be signed and brought into force before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The second group concerns the subject matter of amendment No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now elaborate on some of what can be regarded as the more substantive amendments. Some of these are a consequence of other amendments. In saying that they are of a more substantive nature, I am assured, on the basis of legal advice, that they do not alter in any way the original thrust or scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4, which has been categorised in the second group of amendments, was an Opposition amendment to amend the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo; in section 2. The purpose of the amendment was to include in the definition the term &ldquo;land covered by water&rdquo;, which would widen the previous definition to include lakes and rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now refer to amendments Nos. 8, 11, 12, 15 and 16 which, with the exception of amendment No. 12, relate to penalties, that is, fines and or imprisonment, for offences under the Act. In the Bill as passed originally by the Seanad the provisions relating to penalties were set out in sections 7(9), 14(1) and 14(2). Section 7(9) provided for penalties for obstructing an authorised officer in the exercise of his powers under the Act or for providing false or misleading information to an authorised officer. Section 14(1) provided for penalties for breaches of the other provisions of the Act. Section 14(2) related to penalties for <Col N="908" />the continuation by a person of the offence referred to in section 14(1) following conviction.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 was effectively a combination of an Opposition and Government counter-amendment. In effect, it inserted in a new section 3(2) the penalties originally mentioned in section 14(1). This amendment was agreed in the Dáil because it was accepted that the level of penalties mentioned in section 14(1) arising from conviction on indictment were more appropriate to breaches of the provisions of section 3 than breaches of other provisions of the Act. As a consequence of this amendment and on foot of amendment No. 15, section 14(1) was amended by the insertion of penalties arising from summary conviction for breaches of other specified sections of the Act, including penalties for breaches of section 7(9). Amendment No. 11 had deleted the original penalties provisions in section 7(9).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 was a Government amendment which effectively deleted section 14(2) relating to continued offences as this subsection was deemed to be unnecessary on the basis of legal advice received by my Department. On foot of amendment No. 8, the reference to Annex III of the protocol in section 3(a) of the Bill, and the whole of section 3(c), which also relates to Annex III of the protocol, was deleted on the basis of legal advice received by my Department on the grounds that Annex III is essentially an administrative annex dealing with exchange of information and would not come within the scope of the penalties inserted in section 3(2).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 relates to an amendment to section 9(b) of the Bill and is consequential to the amendment to section 3(a), now section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) mentioned in amendment No. 8. Amendment No. 12 was a Government amendment which essentially brought the text in section 9(b) into line with the text in section 3(1)(<i>a</i>), apart from the reference to annex III which is retained in section 9(b).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is two years since the Bill was before the House and the penalties were laid down, during which we have had the changeover from the punt to the euro. It is evident that penalties are a deterrent to crime in society. The financial penalty laid down in section 14(1) of a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 is too low. Will the Minister of State increase it to a minimum of &euro;5,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated the penalties in detail on Committee Stage. The level of penalties laid down in the legislation has been endorsed by the Department's legal advisers. It fits the crime whether on summary conviction or indictment. When Senators raised the issue of the appropriate level of fines during the debate on other legislation, the Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2001, I informed the House that I expected the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce a fines Bill, which would link fines to inflation or create some form of index link. Many <Col N="909" />of the current fines throughout our legislation are much too low. The forthcoming legislation will encompass all fines in all legislation and link them to the consumer price index or another structure. To answer the Senator's question directly, our legal advisors have informed us that the penalties are acceptable and should not be changed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17, a Government amendment, concerns section 15 of the Bill which relates to forfeiture to the State of the materials or equipment listed in Annex I or Annex II of the protocol. Amendment No. 17 correctly restricts this forfeiture provision only to offences in respect of section 3 because this section relates specifically to the activities involving Annex I and Annex II equipment and materials. This amendment had been tabled on the basis of legal advice received by my Department.</P>

      <P>Although we are incorporating the protocol into our legislation, thankfully we do not have the materials to which the Deputy refers, apart from a small amount in some of our universities, namely Cork University and, possibly, University College Dublin where they are handled transparently. When one considers the materials used by the nuclear industry, the world would be a safer place if all other countries emulated the position obtaining here.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18, an Opposition amendment, relates to clarification of the District Court district to which an authorised officer may apply for a forfeiture order for any of the equipment or material listed in Annexes I or II.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate on this legislation. The amendments proposed in the Dáil and accepted in the Seanad have improved the text of the Bill, consistent with the requirements of the protocol and our national position on nuclear non-proliferation. This is important legislation which has benefited from the consideration given to it in both Houses. The enactment of the Bill will further reinforce Ireland's stance on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and will ensure that Ireland and the other non-nuclear weapons states of the EU can implement the requirements of the protocol.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will be enacted, the protocol will be ratified and the regulations signed by the Minister before Ireland assumes the Presidency of the EU. It is expected that Italy will ratify the protocol before the end of the year, after which the protocol will have been ratified by all 13 non-nuclear states in the EU.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;Irish ship&rdquo; is defined in the 1999 Act. The Bill, as published, provides in section 35, paragraph (<i>b</i>), for the revised definition, namely, those above a certain threshold. This amendment, together with the deletion of section 35, paragraph (<i>b</i>), proposed by amendment No. 27, leaves the existing definition in place and introduces a separate definition to cover those Irish ships which are required to prepare and submit plans in accordance with this part of the Bill. Separate definitions have been introduced as all Irish ships, regardless of size, are being required in section 26 to report pollution incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distinction between Irish ships and relevant Irish ships was not required when the 1999 Act was made. The requirement to prepare plans, etc., in respect of oil was already in place through SI 44 of 1994, which was made under the 1991 Act. The extension of this requirement to hazardous and noxious substances in the protocol has meant that the Bill needed to provide for Irish ships above a certain threshold to prepare plans, etc. As regards HNS, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, when drafting the Bill, recommended that the requirement for relevant Irish <Col N="913" />ships in respect of both oil and HNS should be set out in this legislation.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides for the insertion of new paragraphs (<i>d</i>), (<i>e</i>), (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>) in section 3(2) of the 1999 Act. The new paragraphs extend to non-Irish ships the requirement to have emergency plans on board. Paragraph (<i>d</i>) pertains to ships registered in countries which are party to the convention, while paragraphs (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) deal with ships registered in countries which are not party to the convention. Paragraph (<i>g</i>) sets out the threshold above which this requirement is to apply, which is the same as for Irish ships.</P>

      <P>What about the &ldquo;ghost ships&rdquo; which are currently the subject of controversy? Does <Col N="915" />this amendment cover these? If there was a pollution incident involving one of these ships outside Irish territorial waters, does this legislation empower the Minister to take any action? How would an incident such as this be handled? The marine environment is threatened by this new development. These ships, which are coming from the USA, do not appear to be covered under this international protocol.</P>
      <P>If there was an incident, what action could be taken by the Irish authorities to deal with it? Would it be covered under the convention? Would the incident be dealt with by other member states along with Ireland? The ships are travelling outside the Irish jurisdiction so it seems the legislation we have is not adequate to cover them. Where there are hazardous vessels within the vicinity of Irish territorial seas, there is the likelihood of a major incident because of gales and so on. Do we have legislation to empower Irish authorities to take action to deal with an emergency such as this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator's point is important. These ships will finish up in Hartlepool in England, which is about 250 miles from our coastline. If we wanted proof of the type of gale force winds that have been experienced in recent times, we need only listen to the master of the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>, who said his journey was troubled by force 10 winds. The ships mentioned by Senator Daly are coming from the USA, 4,000 miles away, and contain noxious substances such as PCBs, asbestos and heavy fuel oil. They are a time-bomb for our coastline. The intention was for 13 of these ships to sail to Hartlepool over a period of time and they have quite rightly been dubbed &ldquo;ghost ships&rdquo;. The Minister has had discussions with the British authorities on this issue and is meeting the British ambassador today.</P>
      <P>Legislation such as this is important in its own right. Much of the emphasis in recent legislation has been on sea pollution, particularly from the point of view of conforming to European Union protocols. We may conform to EU protocols, but what restrictions apply to the USA? Is the EU making it known to the USA that it is not prepared to accept vessels such as these approaching its coastlines? There should be an embargo on this activity. If the USA has a problem with vessels made in the early 1960s which are no longer viable, it should resolve it within its own country. It is big enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is audacious of the American Government to send these ships here. When it comes to environmental issues President Bush always gives the two fingers to the rest of the world. This has happened in the case of the Kyoto protocol and other European rules to which Ireland must conform. The Kyoto protocol is extremely important. This is another example of the Americans being irresponsible. The European Union should state firmly that it will not tolerate this. To what degree do protocols and provisions such as these apply <Col N="916" />to American ships? They should not apply at all because the USA should not be allowed to scrap vessels in any European country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. J. Browne Mr. J. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As it stands, any ship coming into Irish waters must have on board an emergency plan and any authorised officer of the State has a right to seek this plan. If the ships mentioned by Senator Daly and Senator Finucane were in difficulties, we would have our own emergency plans to deal with it. Ireland was notified of the passage plan of these ships and the fact that they would be travelling 35 miles south of Irish waters. We were kept fully informed all the way. It is to be hoped there will not be any problems because these ships are sailing close to the coast.</P>
      <P>Generally, ships have their own emergency plans on board which may be requested by authorised officials. We also have our own plans in place for emergencies and we have seen these swing into action in the past. Port authorities have their own plans, as do local authorities, and our own Department deals with tugs, transponders and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is disputing the provisions that exist in previous legislation or our preparedness for emergencies. Regardless of our plans, however, it has been ceded in the past that we do not have vessels suitable for towing away a vessel that is in distress. We can stall matters with regard to our marine research vessels. I am sure Senator Daly is wondering, as I am, what right these vessels have to come from the USA and put our coastline at risk, regardless of our level of preparedness. At EU level, in conjunction with the other EU countries that are part of this protocol, we should be making a stand on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Finucane, I compliment the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister of State and his staff on the way they have handled this issue and the representations they have made about it. However, I would like to be sure there is a mechanism to deal with an incident in which pollution is caused adjacent to our territorial seas. While I appreciate the legislation fully covers ships in harbours under the jurisdiction of the authorities within the State and probably within our territorial waters, what about the area outside this? It is important that this protocol is applied there and it is not clear to me whether it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should raise the issue at EU level, especially in the context of the international convention. If there was an incident involving one of these &ldquo;ghost ships&rdquo;, with huge expenditure arising for the State authorities, it should be possible to claim this back from the convention and from countries such as the USA which have some responsibility in this area. Those behind this outrageous act of irresponsibility should be held liable in the event of an occurrence which results <Col N="917" />in damage to our environment or fishing areas. If this or any other legislation does not hold the USA, which is the owner of these vessels, responsible or liable for damage arising from an incident involving them, some provision should be made to ensure it does hold them responsible, and to extend the terms of the international convention to cover incidents of this nature.</P>

      <P>We are not in a position to make regulations outside our own waters but as Senators Daly and Finucane stated, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has expressed serious concern on a number of occasions about the ghost ships. Obviously other EU countries are of like mind, but under international regulations these ships have a right of passage. We have expressed our concerns. The Coast Guard and all the port authorities are aware of these ships and are ready to spring into action if required, although I hope that will not be necessary.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister will be in Brussels next week and I will ask him to take on board the points raised by Senator Daly and hold discussions with people of like mind. As we can see from the newspapers and publicity generally, there is serious concern about the ghost ships moving so close to countries, including our own.</P>

      <P>I support Senators Daly and Finucane on this issue because from what we read, these ships may well have to turn around and head back to America. They constitute a major risk and they should not be moved at a time of the year when we are likely to experience severe storms. The people who intend to scrap them should not have been allowed to do it until a safer time of the year. There is a risk of some of them not being accepted and having to return to America, which would pose a double risk for this country. I compliment the Minister of State on what he has outlined and the steps he has taken but this country stands to suffer as a result of these passages.</P>

I do not know whether the other two will be sent next year. All of us would be concerned about the Americans sending such ships so close to this and other countries but that is a matter for a different forum. I am sure the Minister will deal with it. He has already raised his own concerns, the concerns of the Government and the public at a meeting last week in Farmleigh House with the relevant Commissioner.</P>

When European Union protocols are being introduced with regard to this, the argument should be made in the Commission that it is not right for a country like America to send here vessels carrying noxious and hazardous substances which put people's lives at risk. Will the Minister of State give an assurance that the Minister will take up the matter with the British Ambassador, although it should be raised at European Union level?</P>

      <P>Section 35, which provides for the revised definition, covers the area to which we referred earlier. The term &ldquo;Irish ship&rdquo; is defined in the 1999 Act. The Bill, as published, <Col N="921" />provides in section 35, paragraph (<i>b</i>), for the revised definition, namely, those above a certain threshold. This amendment, together with the deletion of the paragraph, leaves the existing definition in place and introduces a separate definition to cover those Irish ships which are required to prepare and submit plans in accordance with this Part of the Bill. Separate definitions have been introduced as all Irish ships, regardless of size, are being required in section 26 to report pollution incidents.</P>
      <P>The distinction between Irish ships and relevant Irish ships was not required when the 1999 Act was made. The requirement to prepare plans, etc. in respect of oil was already in place through S.I. No. 44 of 1994, which was made under the 1991 Act.</P>
      <P>The extension of this requirement to hazardous and noxious substances since the protocol meant that the Bill needed to provide for Irish ships over a certain threshold to prepare plans etc. in respect of HNS. The Parliamentary Counsel's office, when drafting the Bill, recommended that the requirement for relevant Irish ships in respect of oil and HNS should now be set out in this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference to garbage in this section and legislation has been introduced in that regard. I presume this Bill will strengthen that legislation because there is a still a major problem for communities in coastal areas with refuse washing up on the coastline. When the legislation was introduced in the House a few years ago, there was an indication that the wine bottles and bits of broken net would be covered by the legislation because it was to tidy up the situation where a huge amount of refuse was being washed up on the shore as a result of commercial ships and fishing vessels operating off the coastline.</P>
      <P>The situation has not improved to any great extent over the last couple of years. Many disposable nappies were washed up on the west Clare coastline last summer which came from a ship which lost its cargo off the west coast. There were sufficient disposal nappies in west Clare for a few weeks to take care of a lot of children.</P>
      <P>It is a serious matter. A lot of refuse and garbage is being dumped from vessels all the time. It is a problem for local authorities, because they have responsibility for clean ups, and for local communities involved in the Tidy Towns competition and so on. I understood there was legislation to control all of this and that ship owners and companies could be prosecuted under it for causing pollution. It appears the legislation is not working and it needs to be looked at again. If this Bill tightens it up, I support it.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator Daly's concerns. Earlier this year the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill was passed and it will deal with this issue. Port authorities, under an SI annex approved by Europe, have been asked to prepare plans on how to deal with garbage and waste. Those plans will be notifiable to Brussels. Action is being taken to deal with these issues through the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill and through port authorities having to prepare <Col N="926" />plans on how to deal with this which are notifiable to the Department and to Brussels.</P>

It is resulting in a large number of bottles and a huge amount of refuse generally from ships being washed on to the beautiful beaches and it is causing problems.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to revisit that legislation and if there is an issue that needs to be tightened up then we should have additional legislation.</P>

      <P>We have proposed an amendment to the section because the section as drafted seems to require the Minister to revoke all licences held by a person if he is exercising the power conferred by the section. We feel it is wrong that the Minister should have the power to determine that a particular class of licence should be revoked, in other words that the power of the Minister in terms of revocation is pitched too far.

The purpose is to ensure that where an individual holds a licence for more than one vessel and has been found guilty of an offence in respect of any one vessel, the Minister will have the power to revoke the licences for any remaining vessels that the individual may possess.

    <Title>Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Bill 2003: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum number of ordinary judges in the High Court is prescribed by law. Currently, the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 provides that the number should not exceed 26. I should add, for reasons of clarity, that when I refer to ordinary judges of the High Court I refer to judges of the High Court other than the President of the High Court. Hence, the use of the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; in this context. Furthermore, the number of ordinary judges of the High Court can be increased by one when, as is currently the case, the President of the Law Reform Commission is a judge of the High Court. The Bill before the House provides that the maximum number of ordinary judges can be increased by two to 28.</P>
      <P>The legislative cap in relation to the maximum number of judges provides for little if any flexibility in relation to judicial assignments and resources generally. If the Government wishes to appoint an additional judge to any court, primary legislation must be enacted. That is a rather cumbersome way of proceeding and there may be some merit in examining whether there is a more expeditious way of making provision for additional judges while ensuring the Executive is fully accountable to the Oireachtas in relation to such matters. I am having this matter examined in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that any reference to judicial resources raises in some minds the issue of delays in the courts. Perhaps I might briefly comment on that matter. The establishment of the Courts Service as an independent agency in 1999 represented the most radical reorganisation of court services since the foundation of the State. The mission statement of the agency is &ldquo;to manage the courts, support the Judiciary and provide a high quality and professional service to all the courts&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some element of delay is inevitable in the court system the situation differs from court to court. For instance, I am told there are little or no delays in the hearing of cases in the Supreme Court. In the case of the High Court the waiting time for the hearing of personal injuries actions is quite small, sometimes ten days between setting down and hearing. In respect of other cases, outside Dublin they are generally included in the next sitting of the High Court. The average waiting time for the hearing of a judicial review, however, is between six and nine months. Major efforts have been made by the Courts Service in conjunction with the Judiciary to reduce waiting <Col N="930" />times in criminal law and family law matters. Extra criminal courts have been held and waiting times have been reduced. Nonetheless, the waiting time in the Central Criminal Court is still a subject of great worry to me and to the Judiciary. I must address that delay because justice delayed is justice denied. Justice delayed sometimes is justice diluted in terms of the capacity of the State to bring forward prosecutions in a timely fashion.</P>
    <P>As I am not in charge of prosecutions, although from time to time some people seem to think I am, I have to bear in mind the negative effects of a substantial time intervening between the commission, detection and arrest of an offender and that offender's criminal trial. This is not a matter confined to the Central Criminal Court but since the Central Criminal Court deals, at the moment, with serious cases involving murder and rape, any substantial delay between the apprehension and charging of an offender and their trial has obvious social and political implications.</P>
    <P>As the Courts Service would see it, delay is the time period that elapses between a matter being brought to the court and its disposal by the court. On crime generally, there is a wider issue with which I must be concerned although it is not a matter in which I have either sole or major responsibility. It is the delay that exists after the detection and charging of an offender. I must be careful in what I say, but it seems to me, based on anecdotal evidence and on what one observes in the media, that Ireland's performance in that area is not as good as other states, particularly United Kingdom jurisdictions. The time within which an offence is committed and someone faces trial frequently seems to be much longer in this jurisdiction than in a neighbouring jurisdiction with a similar legal system.</P>
    <P>I am minded to have an inquiry held into that delay, which precedes court delay, with a view to establishing what it is about the Irish system that enables such a delay to take place. We have a much more liberal regime of bail. The Scots, I understand, have fixed times between people being arrested and charged and their trial, which can only be extended in certain circumstances. We have to ask ourselves whether, as a community, all the interested parties in the criminal justice process have put in place the best system for ensuring that trials are brought forward at the earliest possible time, bearing in mind the consequences of delay. I have been contemplating the possibility of having the National Crime Council carry out a study of this area because it is one that requires an objective, independent, high-grade study which would have the willing co-operation of all the interested parties, including the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions. Such a proposal may be required.</P>
    <P>Major efforts have been made by the Courts Service, in conjunction with the Judiciary, to reduce waiting times in criminal and family law matters. Extra criminal courts have been held and <Col N="931" />waiting times reduced. For its part, the Government has provided significant additional resources for the Judiciary and the number of judges attached to all courts has been increased in recent years. The waiting time had been 18 months in the Central Criminal Court. However, with four courts sitting throughout September, during what is normally the long vacation, this has been reduced to 12 months. Senators will also be aware that in July of this year the Central Criminal Court sat outside Dublin for the first time. People have criticised this as a number of those sittings were held in Limerick. It has been suggested that this was a misjudgment on my part as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I emphasise that, although I was supportive of it, the decision was made primarily by the Judiciary and Courts Service. Anyone who understands the system would understand that it does not lie in the hands of the Minister to direct that such a policy should be implemented. The decision was made by others; I supported it and continue to support it. Whatever difficulties have emerged had to be experienced and now have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to say the Judiciary and Courts Service were in some sense unwise to bring the administration of criminal justice out of Dublin and to the places where crimes were alleged to have been committed. The purpose of this was not simply to bring justice back to the community. One of the motives behind this decision was to alleviate pressure on local Garda resources and ensure that gardaí were not camped in Dublin for long periods. We learned from the experience and in these matters, it is a case of nothing ventured, nothing gained. Mr. Justice Carney, who primarily presides over trials in the Central Criminal Court, the President of the High Court and the Courts Service are to be commended for their willingness to introduce this initiative and progress it. Any setbacks that may have occurred do not establish that it was foolish to attempt this in the first place. However, it underlines other problems and it is for everybody involved, including the Oireachtas, to address these.</P>
    <P>Circumstances in the Circuit Court differ from venue to venue. In many venues, cases will be heard at the next available session. As regards the District Court, there is no delay in most districts in cases being brought to hearing. In the Dublin District Court, contested criminal cases take, on average, five months for a hearing. Those figures conceal a delay about which we must be frank. The first available return date for a summons is frequently months away. In this context, I reiterate what I told the House on a previous occasion. For public order offences and offences of minor violence, especially in the case of young offenders, to allow a long period to elapse between the detection and apprehension and prosecution is to devalue the immediacy and <Col N="932" />sense of proportionately and responsiveness of the criminal legal justice system. This is a matter that worries me.</P>
    <P>As regards family law, the Courts Service has advised me that the waiting time for the hearing of applications for divorce and judicial separation is on average four months in most parts of the country. In Dublin &ndash; where up to 40% of all divorces cases and approximately 25% of judicial separation applications are heard &ndash; there is a four week waiting time if the divorce is by consent and 12 weeks if the divorce is contested. However, there are some venues outside Dublin where waiting times are longer.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to refer to the work of the working group on the jurisdiction of the courts. As Senators may be aware, a working group on the jurisdiction of the courts was established last year. This is an exciting development which I fully endorse. It is only right that a courts system in place since the 1920s should be reviewed. Mr. Justice Fennelly chaired the working party whose report is now on my desk. Given the massive changes in Irish society since the foundation of the State, the case for such a root-and-branch reform and review is self-evident. Earlier this year I received the group's report on criminal jurisdiction and it contains many recommendations aimed at streamlining and improving the processing of criminal business before the courts. I am examining these with a view to their early implementation where feasible.</P>
    <P>There is nothing contentious in this Bill. As I have indicated, the current legislative method of increasing the number of judges is somewhat cumbersome. There may be a more expeditious way of doing so without losing any accountability and I will examine the matter further. It might be asked why the Government could not increase the number of judges by order and this might be the way forward. If such orders were to be made, both Houses of the Oireachtas would want to be notified and perhaps approve them in advance. Rather than having substantive legislation, there would be a system of an order being put in place, subject to prior approval of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The alternative, where the Government could decide on a given morning to put ten people on the Bench in a given court, might be regarded as insufficiently transparent or accountable for most people's taste. If we move from direct legislation stipulating the exact amount of judges to a more flexible one where this can be done by a regulation or order made by the Government, most Oireachtas Members would expect that they would be consulted before such a decision was made. There must be some relationship between democratic accountability to both Houses of the Oireachtas and the number of people that serve as judges.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their attention and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister. There is nothing contentious in this Bill and I support it as we are being asked to do a simple job. The Minister posed the question of whether we should be providing for more than two judges. While I accept there would be a lack of transparency if the Government were to appoint ten judges without reference to the Oireachtas, the figure of only two judges seems small. The Minister had to go to the trouble of providing legislation specifically for the provision of two further judges. I wonder whether he will have to come back to the House in 12 months seeking the provision of another one or two judges. As the Minister has said, this seems to lack flexibility. He has indicated that his Department is examining this and I hope it will be able to come up with a more flexible way of dealing with the matter in the future.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the appointment of one of the judges, Mr. Ryan, arises because of the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us who the other judge will be or maybe he is simply giving himself the room to have the option of appointing a judge if the need arises in the future.</P>
      <P>Many judges are currently taken up with work in the tribunals. Will the Minister tell us his thinking on this matter? I seem to recall the Minister saying in the past that he would prefer if this system worked differently and wondering if it was necessary to have a judge to head these tribunals. Perhaps a senior counsel would be qualified to do the job, thereby freeing up many judges. I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's intention to ask the National Crime Council to carry out a review of delays in bringing people to court. That is an area in which we would all like to see improvement. Once a crime is committed and an individual is apprehended, the sooner he or she is brought to court the better. I would welcome anything the Minister could do to speed up that process.</P>
      <P>I wish to put a question to the Minister about trials and the attendance of gardaí in courts although I am not sure if it is relevant now. Many gardaí have to attend the courts on a daily basis. Has the Minister looked at the possibility of gardaí making their statements in a way other than having to attend court? This practice is tying up Garda time, which could be better spent in the community. We continually speak of putting more gardaí on the street. Does the Minister know how much time is spent by gardaí in court attendances? Is there a way around this that would allow Garda time to be better spent?</P>
      <P>I welcome and support the Bill.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach chun an Bhille seo a phlé. I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the Bill the purpose of which is to increase by two the number of High Court judges. Currently, the maximum prescribed by law is 26 and that figure is to be increased to 28. It is obvious this amend<Col N="934" />ment is being made to allow for the appointment to High Court judge of the new chairman of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry made an interesting point, to which I subscribe to an extent, that senior counsel and people other than High Court judges could undertake chairmanship of the many tribunals currently being held. In this instance, however, the Government is correctly dealing with the matter because the tribunal in question is particularly important. Given its nature, it is vital a High Court judge is involved to provide the expertise required to process the system and to ensure the matter is perceived to have been dealt with properly and efficiently.</P>
      <P>There was a great deal of debate in both Houses and in the media on the replacement of Ms Justice Laffoy. That this inquiry might last for ten, 12 or 13 years &ndash; various lengths of time were mentioned &ndash;  places a serious question mark over the effectiveness of the process. It is essential that the Minister does all he can to have this matter dealt with expeditiously while ensuring the manner in which people are dealt with is fair and reasonable.</P>
      <P>The appointment of a High Court judge also demonstrates Government commitment in this area. Many of the tribunals are investigating important issues such as the ethical operation of State apparatus. Such matters are highly sensitive from a political point of view. As somebody who supported the establishment of the tribunals five or six years ago, I would have been slow to endorse them had I been aware of the length of time they would take and their cost to and imposition on the taxpayer. There must be a better way of approaching these matters. I am aware the Minister recently commented on the duration and cost of tribunals in the past. At one stage he indicated he was examining alternative mechanisms for dealing with important issues of public concern. We need to deal with these matters in ways that are not a drain on State resources and on the taxpayer while at the same time ensuring we achieve our objective more expeditiously than is currently the case.</P>
      <P>Decisions were made by the courts on the inquiry by an Oireachtas committee into the Abbeylara incident. Such parliamentary inquiries appear to operate well in other jurisdictions. I may not be as knowledgeable as is necessary to make a decision on them but they appear to operate with a degree of effectiveness and at a lesser cost. Perhaps that is something we could consider. We could also take a more inquisitorial approach to the performance of tribunals rather than introducing the advocacy system which operates in the courts. That might also contribute to speedier processing of inquiries. There is very fertile ground there to which the Minister could apply his intellect to avoid, as we witnessed in recent tribunals, a situation where many lawyers turn up to represent particular areas under investigation at enormous cost to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="935" />I agree with the Minister that delays in the system should be examined with a view to ensuring that efficiencies are injected without interfering with the proper conduct of the judicial process, which must be fair to both sides. Some years ago, when making representations to a Minister on a constituency issue, I was told the matter was being dealt with urgently. However, the Minister then added the caveat that his and my understanding of the word &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; differed greatly from that understood within the Civil Service. There may well be an element of this in the current situation.</P>
    <P>It is a little peculiar that the Bill offers no flexibility in that every time the Minister wishes to increase the number of High Court judges, he must introduce primary legislation to do so. The Minister's alternative is quite logical. Senator Terry has already offered her support in that regard. This is a short Bill which opens up many avenues for introducing extraneous, if not totally irrelevant, matters into the debate. I have a number of points I would like to raise in terms of the courts which might be looked at by way of any examination of the system.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the wearing of wigs and gowns in the Four Courts is a little peculiar for a Republic. It is, perhaps, something we inherited from the British. There may be a reason to maintain some distinction in regard to judges but I am not sure the same argument can be made for barristers. A colleague in the shipping business involved in a civil court case in Holland a number of years ago following a shipping accident here told me he met with the judge in a canteen before the trial. The case was heard by the judge in very modern surroundings.  He found it a much better way of dealing with the judicial system and was impressed by it. Perhaps we should examine how we do things here in that regard and see what we can learn from it.</P>
    <P>The fact that solicitors who have the power of advocacy can appear in the High Court without wearing barristers' garb is also interesting. It is a pity solicitors do not avail of that facility to any great extent. I am told there are several reasons for this, one being an apprehension that, somehow, they are treading on another part of the legal profession strongly represented on the bench. There is a fear that, in some way, perhaps even unwittingly, it might prejudice their client. We should examine such matters, since they are not appropriate to the proper operation of a republic. The Minister might consider that at some stage.</P>
    <P>In the same vein, the appointment of solicitors to the High Court is extremely rare. I believe there are a very small number in the High Court. In both avenues of the profession, there are excellent people who would be well qualified to fill those positions. I would like to see a balance within which we might ensure some element of competition. It has always struck me as anomal<Col N="936" />ous that the body empowered to administer the competition laws to ensure that all businesses operate in an open and competitive way is in some way outside that remit. There is no evidence of much competition among barristers, though there is an element of it among solicitors. If one seeks to engage a barrister at a very reasonable figure for a day's work, which may be a fraction of what is being sought, one has no hope of getting one. Yet we are told there are those in the Law Library who are unable to make a living from the profession, while a number are leaving it. There is something wrong internally in the system that gives rise to that. If people are leaving because of insufficient remuneration to support them, then obviously&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only starting, a Chathaoirligh. This area must be examined.</P>
      <P>The retirement age is another issue. A judge can continue in office to the age of 70. What is international practice in this regard? While I have no difficulty with the retirement age, court opening hours should be examined. I am aware that a great deal of work is done outside court hours by barristers and judges, but the limited hours during which the High Court operates is a cause of concern, particularly when people travel long distances. They would benefit from longer sittings as it would shorten the necessity for their stay in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The judicial council, to which the Minister referred in the Dáil, should be examined. Instances of people leaving the profession arose during the life of the last Seanad. Had proper procedures been in place, these could have been dealt with in a satisfactory manner without necessitating that. Minor offences can lead to people resigning or being impeached. There should be a halfway house, and a judicial council, incorporating a judicial conduct committee, could be important in that regard.</P>
      <P>I believe the Minister excluded the possibility of reviewing judicial decisions, which I fully understand. The president of the relevant court probably deals with that. However, from my involvement in business, I know solicitors will seek to place public injury claim cases with judges who they consider to be more sympathetic than others. Consistency in judgments is required to avoid such things.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse continuing its valuable work. This legislation will assist in that objective.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was going through the Dáil last week, the Labour Party proposed a couple of technical amendments which the Minister argued were not required. My colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Costello, accepted his argument and the amendments were withdrawn. We are not <Col N="937" />tabling any today. As others have said, the legislation is non-contentious, and it is appropriate that it be addressed without delay.</P>
      <P>Others have mentioned that the legislation is needed because there are so many demands placed on judges. Tribunals and commissions mean there is a need for more judges. I agree with the suggestion by the Minister and other Senators that we must consider alternative legislation to allow a more flexible procedure for regulating the number of judges. The need to examine alternatives to having judges head tribunals and commissions of inquiry was also raised in this and the Lower House. Will the Minister indicate if he has given the matter any further consideration and if he has considered the proposals by the Labour Party in this regard?</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined how the problem with delays in the different courts has been improved over the past year or two. He mentioned family law, in which I have some small experience as a solicitor, although it did not constitute a large part of my work. I found I did not want to practise in it. While much has been done in this area in an attempt to make court procedures more informal, such as judges and barristers not wearing wigs, it is still a very intimidating process based on conflict. We must find some way of adjudicating on family law matters that takes a less adversarial approach and which is less intimidating to the different parties. Such an approach would facilitate the speedy resolution of cases with as little conflict as possible. I make no criticism of the judges, the family law solicitors or any of the clients involved, but since the Minister has raised it, the matter should be examined in any reform of the court system.</P>
      <P>There is a perception among men that they are discriminated against in family law cases. This has been more publicised in recent years and many politicians will have been contacted on the matter. I find the argument difficult to refute although I do not have enough factual evidence on which to base my argument. However, when the point is made that the Government, through its policies, addresses discrimination against women, this matter should be considered in the in the context of a review of the court system.</P>
      <P>Senator Walsh mentioned the need to consider reform of court procedures, including wearing wigs and so on. The Minister should look at many aspects, and I am sure he is doing so. I have read that in France many issues are dealt with, in effect, by judges who are basically civil servants. They deal with matters such as parking fines. Breaches of the law in respect of television licences are dealt with in the District Court in this country. I feel that such matters could be dealt with in a different forum. It is something that the Minister should examine in the working group he has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to discuss the rules in respect of wearing wigs. A judge was recently reported to have criticised a barrister for not wearing a wig in <Col N="938" />the District Court, but my understanding is that it is not required. It is true that one does not have to wear a wig. Many barristers or senior counsel do not wear wigs. It is a matter of choice. The Senator who raised this matter was right to do so. A policy of recognising that people can be intimidated in court should be promoted to a greater extent. As part of the process of reform, we should recognise that it is desirable that ordinary people feel that the legal system is fair &ndash; they should have confidence in it.</P>
    <P>Some people whose relatives have been the victims of crime were interviewed in a recent RTE documentary. They felt they did not have anyone to turn to for advice. They said that the entire experience was very intimidating. As part of the court reforms, we should do more to accommodate those who are part of the process, although not officially so. We need to ensure that relatives of the victims of crime, for example, feel comfortable in the courts system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to the House. That he is one of the most frequent ministerial visitors to this House is an indication of the amount of legislative work he is doing. The legal system is central to the notion of what it is to work in a civilised society because it impacts on all our lives in one way or another. The Bill before the House will amend the operation of the system we have in this country, which has served us very well. The demands and pressures of society bring about a need for change in any legal system. It is only right that this legislation is being brought forward. We are fortunate to have a Judiciary which is held in great respect for its integrity, fair-mindedness and independence. It would be wrong of the Government to sit on its laurels and refuse to examine the needs and requirements of society. Certain measures should be put in place in the legal system to reflect these needs and requirements.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh said that the purpose of the Bill is to increase the statutory maximum number of High Court judges from 26 to 28. I believe that a previous Bill raised the number from 24 to 26 in 2000. We are here to change the provisions once more. The Minister has stated that the system needs to be examined in order to see what can be done about it. This need has arisen from the recent absence of Ms Justice Laffoy from the scene. It is right that a judge of the High Court should take on the mantle of chairman of the inquiry into child abuse. A person of some standing should be in charge of such an important inquiry. Senator Walsh said that this Bill demonstrates the commitment of the Minister and the Government to the outcome of the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all need to examine the entire subject of tribunals of inquiry. When tribunals were established some years ago, I do not think it was envisaged they would still be conducting their business this far down the road. I do not think anyone who knows the current terms of reference of the tri<Col N="939" />bunals would recognise the terms of reference given to them at that time. I recognise and acknowledge the fine work that has been done by the tribunals. They have exposed individuals and unravelled situations that have embarrassed all of us in this House and outside it. It is vital that we see some clearing or some opening at some stage, so that we can say the tribunals are nearing an end. I wonder if there is anything we can do at this stage. A single day's argument at a tribunal seems to lead to another branch of inquiry. A never-ending list of branches seems to be developing as a consequence. This area needs our attention.</P>
    <P>The practice of not allowing solicitors to be called to the High Court was amended in 2001. I think it was a very good move as it gave far greater scope to people who wish to apply for positions. It meant that much more of the expertise and experience that exists can be used. I imagine that some fine solicitors could do a very fine job at that level. The artificial divide between the two branches of the legal profession amuses those of us who are not lawyers, although perhaps &ldquo;amuses&rdquo; might not be the right word. The barriers need to be broken down because they do not serve the public well. Some of the barriers were removed from the system by means of legislation, but it seems they found their way back in by virtue of custom, practice and prejudice. I agree with the speaker who said that there is little, if any, flexibility, in respect of judicial assignments or resources. The sad fact that we are here, having to pass primary legislation in order to appoint two people to the High Court, is evidence of this. I am delighted that the Minister is examining this area and is prepared to do something about it.</P>
    <P>I am glad that all Members of the House are giving this legislation the green light. I look forward to the completion of the work of the commission of inquiry and I wish it well in that regard. I am delighted that this Bill will assist that process.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to this debate in such a constructive and supportive manner and those who attended the debate but did not contribute. I assume they support this Bill in a more practical way, by not delaying its passage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reflected on my time as Attorney General as I listened to the debate. One is not supposed to have an input into the formation of policy on many issues when one is Attorney General. It occurred to me at one time that there is a particular exponent among the political class of an art which is remarkably absent. The art to which I refer is the capacity to make three stories out of one action. It amazes me that if one is astute in one's PR management, one can announce the same measure three or four times and the media <Col N="940" />will pick up on it each time as if it were new. I am beginning to think that I have the opposite ability, as I do not receive enough bang for my buck.</P>
    <P>It is almost forgotten that in the dying days of the last legislative term, the Government printed and published the Commissions of Investigation Bill 2003 and an explanatory memorandum. The publication of this Bill made such a small impression on the body politic and the media, for some reason, that people continue to ask when the Government will publish its proposals in respect of this area and what it will do about alternatives to tribunals. I should apologise for this ignorance, as I suppose the fault must be mine. I have not ensured the maximum value for this legislative initiative. Perhaps one of the problems is that the Bill has not yet reached Second Stage in the other House. This leads me to believe that in the present circumstances I should be more keen to introduce primary legislation in this House where I will get some more bang for my buck.</P>
    <P>The Commissions of Investigation Bill is the Government's proposal to have an alternative system of inquiry to that of tribunals. It is interesting because it does not stipulate that judges must do this kind of work at all. In fact, it does not even stipulate that lawyers should necessarily do it. The interesting point about the new proposal is that adversarial advocacy, etc., would not be required in proceedings. Proceedings could be conducted in private, such as the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair or perhaps more like the more recent inquiry concerning the Iraq war. Iraq seems to be the constant fertile source of inquiries.</P>
    <P>The interesting thing about both the Scott and Hutton inquiries is that there was no need in either case for the compulsory powers of the tribunal because all the main actors could effectively be compelled by moral pressure to produce all their private records, diaries, mobile phone bills, etc., to establish who talked to whom or whatever else needed to be determined. This is the case if one is dealing with a matter of public importance. However, if one were to attempt the same thing in this jurisdiction, one might encounter legal objections almost immediately. It was with this in view that the Commissions of Investigation Bill was drafted, thus providing a statutory basis for Scott or Hutton-type inquiries in Ireland. One of the proposals of the legislation is that when any such inquiries, as opposed to tribunals, are to be established, the Houses of the Oireachtas would have to be given an accompanying statement containing an estimate of the costs, including legal costs, to be incurred by the commission in conducting the investigation and preparing its report, and a timeframe for the submission of its final report. This is one of the measures in contemplation and it is important.</P>
    <P>A danger exists in making it easier to have inquiries because there is a limit to how many inquiries a state can conduct at any given time. <Col N="941" />Although it is better to have cheaper and quicker inquiries, thus saving the Exchequer money and arriving at conclusions faster, there is an equivalent danger that there will be daily proposals for inquiries into various matters, especially if they are easy to establish.</P>
    <P>It strikes me &ndash; I say this with some circumspection &ndash; that the spirit of the day is one in which Ireland holds the shovel not to get on with constructing our future but to exhume the past. At some stage we will have to become much more prospective in our collective political focus. It is fashionable to talk about the need for full transparency, inquiring into events and bringing closure to them, but there is a limit to the extent to which the truth can be established in retrospect. There is also a limit to the extent to which any society should expend all its political and emotional resources looking backwards and trying to find out what happened when there are so many serious problems facing us in the mirror in terms of what we need to do in the future. While it is sometimes necessary to look back to prevent wrongs from being repeated, it seems that a successful, dynamic society has to have a focus on the future. This legislation, if passed by the two Houses of the Oireachtas, will make it easier to inquire into matters. I hope this does not mean the focus of political attention will be increasingly on the past because the fundamental purpose of elections and representative democracy is to plan our future and make sure it is successful.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry stated that one appointment was presaged in the debate on this legislation and asked if I could identify the second appointee. No decision has been made on this yet. The Senator also asked about the necessity for gardaí to appear in court and how much Garda time is spent in courts. It is very difficult for me to state a figure but a huge amount of Garda time is spent in courts. When I was starting out as a barrister, it was more or less expected by a trial judge of a jury trial that all the Garda witnesses would remain in court for the duration of the whole case. If, on the eighth or twelfth day of a such a case an issue arose regarding whether a garda had made a particular statement, there was a shocked silence if that garda was not available to come up from the bowels of the court immediately to be re-examined on the issue, as if there were nothing better for the garda to do.</P>
    <P>I know the Judiciary has become much more reasonable and is asking if there is a need for certain garda witnesses to remain in court. If not, it is prepared to allow them to go about their duties. We have to get to the point, especially in the criminal justice process, where the demands on Garda time are minimised and where a garda whose evidence is solely that he or she preserved the scene of a crime should at least be able to testify by a video recording, for example, if a written statement procedure, which exists under the 1984 Act, is not sufficiently vivid. We have to think in terms of getting people away from the court system when they are not really needed, <Col N="942" />subject to the right to cross-examine witnesses where their evidence is in issue. As I have stated before, I hope that in the context of the Criminal Justice Act we will have a system whereby minor public violence offences will be dealt with by cautions accompanied by fixed penalties so gardaí do not spend all their time dealing with them.</P>
    <P>I have had quite a considerable and fruitful discussion with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, on road traffic offences. There are many cases in this respect that need not involve the presence of gardaí in court. Gardaí could testify by written declaration. Why should a statutory declaration in respect of speeding offences not be acceptable unless somebody really wanted to challenge his or her case? Senator Tuffy questioned the point of requiring the presence of gardaí in procedures of this nature. Most of this kind of adjudication could be reduced to a fairly automatic process if we had the will to do so.</P>
    <P>We could change things for the better in respect of blood alcohol cases. The Minister for Transport and I are discussing whether it is possible to introduce a system whereby, if one were over the legal alcohol limit, one would surrender one's licence for administrative disqualification, after which one's conviction would be published in a public list somewhere, one would pay one's fine and stop driving on the road, subject to very major penalties if one were to breach the administrative disqualification. This would make it unnecessary to produce witnesses and certificates and there would be no need to book a court effectively for an afternoon, against the hazard that a clever barrister would defend a case. Such a system could lead to a huge improvement.</P>
    <P>Senators have asked if senior counsel could not discharge the functions now being carried out by tribunal judges. There is no requirement of any legal qualification although many senior counsel would be very suitable for conducting commissions of inquiry. The successful inquiry into allegations of child sex abuse in the diocese of Ferns carried out by George Birmingham, SC, the successful inquiry into the sexual abuse of swimmers carried out by Robert Murphy, SC, and the Kilkenny incest inquiry carried out by the then senior counsel, Catherine McGuinness, who is now a Supreme Court judge, show that a judge should not carry out every inquiry provided for or established by law.</P>
    <P>It is true this legislation has come before the House in the context of the decision of Ms Justice Laffoy to resign as chairman of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. Ms Justice Laffoy is now returning to the courts where she is a valued, highly respected judge. In other words, she is not being lost to jurisprudence. On the contrary, she is returning to a place in which she was sorely missed and is held in great respect. I say this in case by saying nothing on the subject, I would have been taken in some sense to be deficient.</P>
    <P>The role of solicitor advocates and the appointment of solicitors to the superior court judiciary <Col N="943" />were raised. Legislation enabling these developments to take place was enacted while I was Attorney General and I strongly supported the change. When the first such appointment was made I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I am pleased to have had a proposing role with regard to this development. Many members of the solicitors' profession would make excellent superior court judges. It is worth recalling, however, that one of the problems we face nowadays is persuading senior people of quality in either branch of the legal profession to put their names forward for positions of this nature. There is no overwhelming stampede to take on the job of High Court judge, the reason being that many leading lawyers, solicitors and barristers, are much more handsomely remunerated in private practice than on the Bench. In case anybody thinks a vast number of people are found to be suitable and later disappointed, I assure the House this is not the case.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that some solicitors are reticent about acting as advocates because the fact that the great majority of judges are barristers would lead to a knee-jerk, adverse reaction to this new role on the basis that it is regarded as barristers' work. If, in the past, some members of the Bench may have preferred to see barristers rather than solicitors before them, this attitude has largely evaporated. In the Circuit Court, where many solicitors now function on the Bench, nobody has ever been able to detect any change in attitude between solicitors or barristers appearing before such former solicitor judges.</P>
    <P>One must seek the true explanation in a slightly different direction. In the main &ndash; there are many exceptions &ndash; solicitors prefer to have barristers do their cases for them. The reason for this preference is that it is difficult for a solicitor, for example, one running a small practice, to commit to be present for the full period of a lengthy case, which may eventually double in duration, and stick with it from beginning to end. While some may argue that these are the words of a barrister, the reticence of solicitors to act as advocates is due to the fact that many sole practitioners and solicitors working in small firms do not find it practical, in terms of conducting a practice, to commit to do a case in court even in the event that is adjourned for a week as it would require them to put aside all their plans for closing sales, dealing with new clients and so forth for the week in question.</P>
    <P>The split profession, as Senator Kett described it, is not peculiar to our system but is also found in other countries. In France, for example, there is a similar difference between <i>notaires </i>and <i>advocats</i>. Even the unified legal profession in America divides into specialties of trial and non-trial or corporate attorneys. Most American attorneys, who do what we regard as solicitors work, would not dream of undertaking a criminal defence on behalf of a client because specialists effectively emerge as trial attorneys in the various areas. I <Col N="944" />accept, therefore, the comment by Senator Walsh that the public regards the distinction between barristers and solicitors as expensive and difficult to justify. There is also considerable merit in the Senator's comments concerning a perceived absence of competition. A substantial agenda needs to be addressed in respect of the transparency of the fees charged by the legal profession, particularly barristers.</P>
    <P>It is the function of a solicitor to act in the interests of his or her client. Obviously, he or she must engage a good barrister but it is also the solicitor's function to strike the best possible bargain on behalf of his or her client when doing so. Most people, including Senator Tuffy, will agree that while this is the theory, it is not translated in practice. In the eyes of the client, there sometimes appears to be a common interest between the solicitor and barrister in respect of fees, as opposed to a sense that the solicitor is performing the function of negotiating the barrister's fee to obtain the best value for the client. In my experience as a barrister, I never encountered in practice the theoretical notion that a solicitor would genuinely consider selecting one of three or four barristers to do a case and ask them in advance to name their price and effectively tender for the work in question.</P>
    <P>I accept Senator Walsh's point on the need for price competition and mechanisms to get legal services provided at the lowest price to the consumer. This is an important issue which I intend to raise with the legal professions once my workload, which is considerable, allows. It is on my agenda to approach the Bar Council and Law Society and request that these organisations address the specific issue of whether they are organising their affairs and performing their functions in a cost competitive manner or, on the contrary, operating on a basis that the legal profession's financial interest is given undue weight in dealings with clients.</P>
    <P>The retirement age of judges was raised. Judges now retire at the age of 70 years and while a number of them were appointed with a retirement age of 72 years &ndash;  I will not describe this group as a dying breed &ndash; the retirement age has now been fixed at 70 years. We have an anomalous and undesirable position that District Court judges are required to retire at 65 years, unless their contracts are extended on an annual basis until the age of 70 years. It should be unequivocal and clear to judges that they will hold their jobs until the day they retire. There should not be two categories of judges, in one of which judges are the subject of an annual review as to whether they are still <i>compos mentis</i> or functioning in a proper way.</P>
    <P>Our system of judicial appointment is dramatically different from the continental system. On the Continent, when one finishes university or completes a law degree, one makes a choice on graduating as to whether one wishes to go into the judicial arm of the state. Then one works one's way up through the judicial mechanism, <Col N="945" />sometimes to dizzy heights. That is not to say that all continental judges are appointed from that system because people from academia and practice are also appointed. In our system, which is different from the continental system, the judge is an independent arbiter on an adversarial basis. It is an important difference and it has dramatically different consequences for the way in which legal business is done.</P>
    <P>One of the great strengths of our system is we choose people of experience who have not worked their way up through the system, have not had all the corners knocked off them or have not become part of the grand State apparatus. They are chosen from outside the State apparatus and put on the Bench on the basis of their experience and qualities and are expected to act as independent arbiters between the State and the individual. That system, which operates throughout the common law world with different methods of vetting and so forth, is far superior, and I admit to being prejudiced on this, to a career judge system. I believe litigants in the common law system have absolute conviction that when they go before a judge appointed on that basis and who holds the scales between them and the State apparatus, they are not being confronted by a part of the State adjudicating their case in the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>It underlines and symbolises the independence of the Judiciary that its members are usually in their fifties when they are selected to serve as judges. In that context, having a retirement age of 70 rather than the usual retirement age of 65 is sensible. If one is selecting people at that stage of their career, one must give them a reasonable run. In any event, the age of 65 was selected as the retirement age in Bismark's Germany because most people did not live much longer. We now live in a world where many people, with a huge amount to contribute, live into their seventies. I am not in favour of mandatory early retirement.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the suspicion that some people engage in forum shopping, seeking particular judges for particular results. That suspicion is entertained not just in this House. It is obviously desirable that one judge should be the same as another. However, judges are flesh and blood and we expect them to be so. We also expect them to be consistent with each other. It is inevitable, nevertheless, that just as politicians, Ministers and Senators differ in their characteristics, there will always be judges who are softer or more inclined to see the small man's case, the State's interest or whatever. Judges will always have different characteristics and there is no way of avoiding that except to ask them to attempt to be objective and consistent with other judges, in so far as they can, in the standard of justice they administer.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy raised the issue of family law. I agree the need for mediation in this area is paramount. Adversarial family law should be the last outcome in a family dispute. It is so destructive <Col N="946" />and consuming of assets that the case Senator Tuffy makes is undeniable. I was called to the Bar in 1974. There was no free legal aid until after the Josey Airey case. The free legal advice centres were voluntary bodies which were manned by young men and women who were either students or recently qualified solicitors and barristers. They effectively provided the only system of legal aid in family law and they did it for nothing. That was a cornerstone of the FLAC philosophy. I did a great deal of work for the centres when I was a fledgling barrister. One could not take any benefit for oneself because it was done on a FLAC basis.</P>
    <P>Things have changed dramatically since then. Family law, which was an economic desert as far as practitioners were concerned, has now transformed into something dramatically different. Undoubtedly, the quality of family law has improved greatly since the time a young Master McDowell was attempting to improve his skills as a junior barrister in that area. Equally, however, the costs have grown phenomenally, to the point where fortunes are expended by people sorting out family differences. Any protracted litigation is an economic and familial disaster for the people who get caught up in the system.</P>
    <P>I endorse Senator Tuffy's comments that, however we do it, the emphasis must not be on adversarial family law but on people sitting around a table, facing up to the fact that they will not live together and somehow arriving at a mediated solution as to how they deal with custody, property and access issues. It could be done in an afternoon, compared with the lengthy discovery process to discover people's earnings, bank accounts, property transactions and so forth which goes on for weeks and months and achieves relatively little.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy mentioned that men feel the family law system discriminates against them. That perception is true. There is an almost instinctive reaction that where the custody of children is an issue, there is a presumption in favour of the mother. That is rebuttable but is infrequently rebutted. Men in those circumstances feel that they, rather than women, are at the receiving end of justice. What can I say about that? Women have suffered huge discrimination in many areas for a long time. Law, however, is one area where women litigants, in whatever capacity, have always been treated better than men, particularly in the area of criminal law. My experience, throughout my career prosecuting and defending in criminal cases, was that women were always given the benefit of the doubt in circumstances where a tougher approach was taken to men.</P>
    <P>When it comes to sentencing, the outcomes for men and women are dramatically different. If there is an inconsistency in how the genders are dealt with in the courts, that is one area in which, even in less so-called enlightened times than the one we now live in, women have been treated better. It is curious to examine the Victorian per<Col N="947" />iod and look at the returns for Mountjoy Prison and other such places. The number of women offenders was enormously higher then than now. The Victorians were much tougher on women, sending them to jail for theft, prostitution and other crimes. Now, the Judiciary has a different attitude when it comes to gender discrimination.</P>
    <P>The excursus on the irrelevancies that have been raised in the course of this debate is now complete.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive support of and interest in this subject by the Members of this House. Most of the things said about tribunals will come up for minute discussion when the legislation comes before the House. I hope the remarks I have made are not seen as stereotypical. We must be truthful with each other when we think about what has happened in the past and how things have changed.</P>
    <P>While our legal system is frequently criticised and deserves to be under constant sceptical scrutiny to see what is wrong with it and while I, as a lawyer and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, should be especially careful not to bring my previous baggage to a job in which the people expect me to be objective and sceptical about our system, the quality of our Judiciary and the fairness of our legal system are enormously high. One has only to look at cases in the European Union in terms of delay and effectiveness to see less desirable examples than the ones we have.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with wigs and gowns, but that is for another day. While we can make all types of criticisms of our judicial system and our system of criminal justice, most of which have a grain of truth in them, we should bear in mind that they command the confidence of the majority of people who regard judges as impartial and honourable people who are trying to do their best. Most sentences, although there are some exceptions, are regarded by most people as being reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>We must resist another feature of the present age, namely, a desire to always see things in terms of anger and disappointment. When we deal with victims, our system should be more supportive. I accept Senator Tuffy's point in that regard. There is a sense in which victims are merely seen as witnesses in an adversarial system. We must be careful about that. However, we must remember the other side of that coin, namely, that justice is public justice. It is not the right of a victim to select the punishment for the offender. Whereas the victim is entitled under our law to be heard on the issue, people want someone who listens to both sides and then selects a punishment. The dissatisfaction of any victim with a sentence is not the issue. If we had a system where every victim had to be satisfied with every sentence, we would surrender the sentencing process to the relatives of the victim in every crime. That is not what is needed in a fair system. We need an impartial arbiter to decide the sentence, having listened to the victim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" />I am always accused of being politically unwise in challenging anything the media does, but sometimes there is an over concentration on the victim's reaction to every offence and the way it is dealt with by the courts. We must also consider the family members of the accused. There are those who are dependent on and who love the accused. Their views are valid, not irrelevant. We must sometimes rise above the tendency of being able to report that the victim in a particular crime is outraged by the leniency of a sentence. If they are outraged and that is justified, it should be reported and commented on. However, it should not be commented on on the basis that the victim has an implicit right to be the arbiter of what is just or fair in relation to him or her.</P>

We look forward to the Bill dealing with the public inquiries. Like other Members, I had forgotten about it. Perhaps it might have been wiser to have brought it to the Seanad first because we would probably have disposed of it by now.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill, which is indicative of his interest in the legal process and in this inquiry, which everyone would like to see brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It will bring to a close a sad chapter in Irish society, although perhaps not to the satisfaction of everyone involved. We want to be able to deal fairly with the difficulties and problems faced by the victims so they know the State recognises them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann, conscious of the growing problem of drug abuse and drug-related crime throughout rural and urban Ireland, calls on the Government to tackle the escalating drugs culture by</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Fully implementing and resourcing the National Drugs Strategy,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Recruiting an additional 2,000 members of the Garda Síochána as promised by the Government,</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Reversing the savage cutbacks in CE and JI schemes, which have reduced the capacity of the voluntary and community sector, and</P>
      <P>&ndash;&nbsp;Ring fencing moneys from the Criminal Assets Bureau for the purpose of supporting communities dealing with the drugs crisis.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. The shocking results of the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs highlighted the fact that the amount of cannabis use in Ireland among 15 to 16 year olds is double that of 11 other countries involved in the project. The use of other drugs is also more common than average. Inhalant use is twice as common here and a slightly higher proportion than average of respondents reported the use of alcohol in combination with pills.</P>
      <P>It has been found that two fifths of the Irish prison population have a history of injecting drugs and nearly half of those continue to inject while in prison. Ireland has the highest levels of ecstasy and amphetamine use in western Europe. A United Nations report recently estimated that 66,000 people aged 15 and over take ecstasy at least once a year and 72,000 take amphetamines or speed. There are an estimated 14,450 heroin users in Ireland, the vast majority residing in the Dublin area. More than 50% of Irish prisoners are drug users, which compares very badly with the UK, where between 15% and 29% of prisoners use drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cut of 7% to 9% in health board funding in the last quarter of 2003 will particularly affect drugs services. No money has been planned for new services. Community and voluntary groups involved in drug treatment services argue that the implementation of the local drugs task force projects are being blocked at senior departmental level. The young peoples facilities and services fund is being reviewed, with no new initiatives currently being funded. Under the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, ten regional drugs task forces were set up in the ten health board regions in 2003, but they have only been given a minimum administrative budget &ndash; about &euro;60,000 &ndash; in 2003. They have no programme budgets. The regional drugs task forces are expected to publish action plans for the regions which will identify the nature of the drugs problems in their areas and <Col N="950" />the actions they intend to implement to tackle drug misuse. This is unlikely to happen without funding.</P>
    <P>The fulfilment of most of the Government's 100 promises under the national drugs strategy is behind schedule. The Government has yet to establish in the mainstream the projects set up in the local drugs task force areas as a result of the strategy. Most importantly, however, rehabilitation and after-care projects were to be established in every health board by the end of 2002. This has not happened. Instead, the health boards have had their health funding cut by up to 9% in the last quarter of 2003. The strategy set out targets, such as providing immediate access for drug misusers to professional assessment, increasing the number of treatment places and expanding the number of training and employment opportunities by 30% by the end of 2004. With the savage cutbacks already imposed in the last quarter of 2003 in the health board and drug treatment services, it is difficult to see how this can be turned around in 2004.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael continues to be supportive of the general principles and objectives set out in the national drugs strategy, which was originally set up by the Fine Gael-led rainbow Government. The strategy is divided into four pillars: supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research. Investment in all four pillars is essential if medium and long term strategies are to be successful. Performance indicators and ambitious targets were set out in the national drugs strategy review. However, targets are only achievable if the energy and will to deliver exists within Government, but there is much evidence to suggest the Government has failed to prioritise and tackle the problems of drug abuse and addiction.</P>
    <P>Ireland has the highest levels of ecstasy use in Europe, the third highest use of cannabis, the fourth highest use of stimulants, the fourth highest use of cocaine and the eighth highest use of opiates, including heroin. The problem is serious and despite the resources available to it, this Government has made little impact on the levels of drugs consumed. Unfortunately, the problem has got much worse.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael plans to make a difference by prioritising substance abuse and addiction as a crisis in need of management. In the area of drug supply reduction, Fine Gael will bring forward a proposal to increase international and European co-operation on drug trafficking, increase resources allocated to the Garda national drugs unit and local Garda drugs squads in all areas. It is difficult to believe that if gardaí in most rural areas want to carry out a drugs bust, they have to wait up to two or three months for a dog from the local drugs squad unit to be made available. Current Government proposals only plan to increase Garda resources in existing drugs task force areas, i.e. in Dublin and Cork, ignoring the remainder of the country. I am concerned that those areas are open to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="951" />Re-assessing policing policies in co-operation with the Garda national drugs unit is a proven method of supply reduction and there is a need to promote fresh approaches. Policies such as Operation Dóchas, Operation Cleanstreet, Operation Mainstreet and Operation Nightcap are aimed at preventing the supply of drugs in nightclubs and suspected trouble areas through undercover and surveillance works. Where positive results can be measured from policies, resources will be allocated to expand mainstream approaches.</P>
    <P>Our coastline is far too porous for traffickers. Ports, borders and airports need much tighter monitoring and increased manpower. We should increase investment in staff and equipment for the Customs and Excise drugs unit. This Government has failed to increase the staff numbers in the Customs and Excise drugs team, to continue to finance, promote and expand the Criminal Assets Bureau and to target the proceeds of organised drugs crime. In contrast, the Government has been responsible for the resignation of the key figure and legal adviser to the CAB. It has failed to introduce mandatory ID cards to help tackle a serious underage drinking crisis. Fianna Fáil in Government has failed to introduce a voluntary age card scheme. Even more worrying is the failure to increase the number of gardaí on the beat at night in known hot spots of drug dealing.</P>
    <P>We must lead from the front with a hard hitting national drugs awareness campaign aimed at targeting all ages, young and old, across the country. This Government has promised, but failed to deliver, an effective awareness campaign. Measures already being introduced through educational disadvantage will continue to be supported and broadened, where possible, but we need to create closer links between implementation bodies for the national drugs strategy team and other agencies. With assessment and treatment facilities in place, people will be able to access these services immediately. The State must be quick to respond and support persons who have made the choice to cease drug taking. We have to recognise the positive work done in the 13 local drugs task force areas and continue to support the various programmes.</P>
    <P>The number of young people experimenting with drugs in our towns, villages and cities is growing at an alarming rate. Unfortunately, this country is moving towards the normalisation of recreational drugs. Drugs are not just available in urban areas; they have been found in the smallest villages and townlands and dealers are prepared to go into any area frequented by young people. We now have 13 and 14 year olds coming into contact with drugs and measures must be put in place to address this.</P>
    <P>Drug dealing has gone high-tech with the advent of mobile phones. It is becoming increasingly difficult for gardaí to detect these drug dealers. Two or three years ago it was relatively <Col N="952" />easier but with the sophisticated technology available now, drug dealers can come from any area. Unfortunately, there is an acceptance of drug dealing among young people. Drug dealers are no longer the pariahs they once were. It part of the social circle. That acceptance is very worrying.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in a major town a businessman was approached by a young girl from a middle class background who asked for a loan of &euro;2,000. She explained to him that she wanted to buy ecstasy tablets. She was not looking at it from the perspective of the problem that could cause but as a legitimate business deal. In other words, if she borrowed &euro;2,000 she would have enough money to buy the designer label clothes and accessories and live the so-called high lifestyle of her friends who were already involved in drug dealing. This sickening trend must stop.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday night I attended the Roscommon Association dinner dance in Manchester. I have spoken frequently on the scourge of drugs facing our rural areas. One man called me aside and pleaded with me to do something about the scourge of drugs in Ireland before it is too late. He said he did not want to come back to Ireland and witness the scene of an agonising drug culture, which is what is associated with a city like Manchester.</P>
    <P>This is possibly the most serious debate this House has had since I entered it. I ask the Minister to pay heed and act and give the Garda the necessary resources. Otherwise the youth in our communities will pay a terrible price in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry" hpid="Ms Terry Ms Terry">
      <NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this important motion. Drug abuse is probably the greatest scourge the country is facing and it is threatening the lives of many of our young people. Either the authorities are not tackling the drug abuse problem adequately or they do not have the resources. One of my colleagues in the Dáil, Deputy Tom Hayes, tabled a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently asking him about the number of drugs seizures in County Tipperary since January 2000 until October 2003. The Minister replied that he had been informed by the Garda authorities that there have been 958 drug seizures in County Tipperary since 1 January 2000 to date and that the number of prosecutions that followed was 504. That is just in one county. I do not have the figures for Dublin with me. I dread to think what they are but I intend to secure those figures.</P>
      <P>A United Nations survey on drugs and crime published recently found that more young people in Ireland abuse amphetamines and ecstasy than any other country in Europe. That is a terrible statistic to have to read about our young people. What are we doing to tackle this problem? I want to give the Minister of State a few reminders of what his party said it would do to tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997, the Fianna Fáil manifesto said it would give priorities to a broadly based war against crime and that it would adopt a zero tolerance policy on all crime. That statement rings hollow <Col N="953" />today. The manifesto also stated that Fianna Fáil in Government would withdraw gardaí from routine civilian work and traffic duties and give those duties to local authorities. In 2002, the Fianna Fáil programme for Government stated that it stood for a society in which all people can feel safe in their communities, businesses and homes. The Taoiseach, in his Ard Fheis speech in March 2002, said Fianna Fáil had promised to cut crime by getting tough on criminals, and that it had done that. How can the Taoiseach stand over that statement? We can see that Fianna Fáil has not got tough on crime or on criminals. Twenty murders have been committed so far this year. Firearms were involved in most of those murders. How are criminals getting their hands on the firearms? While one does not want to prejudice any of these cases, drugs are at the root of much of this crime with which we have not got to grips.</P>
    <P>In its 2002 manifesto, Fianna Fáil said it would commit even more resources to tackling crime and that it would recruit an extra 2,000 gardaí and target them against street crime and drugs. It said it would complete the current expansion of the Garda Síochána and increase recruitment so that the numbers would increase by a further 2,000. What action has been taken on foot of these commitments? We have not seen any action, hence the level of the drug trade.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government stated that the Government would target the assets of all persons involved in drug dealing and, in particular, middle ranking criminals and that it would continue to target drug dealers at local level by making additional resources available to existing drugs units and for the establishment of similar units in areas of need. It said the Government would establish a co-ordinating framework for drug policy in each Garda district to liaise with the community on drug-related matters and act as a source of information for parents and members of the public. The programme for Government also stated that the Government would ensure that each Garda district and sub-district would be required to produce a drug policing plan to include multi-agency participation in targeting drug dealers.</P>
    <P>The 2002 Fianna Fáil manifesto stated that by the end of 2002, it would publish a plan to completely end all heroin use in Irish prisons and provide for the introduction of compulsory drug testing of prisoners, where appropriate. Instead, reported serious crime is up 22% while drug offences are up 23%. I could go on and mention all the other increases but I am trying to limit my comments to drug activity. The number of murders is up 33% in 2001 on 2000. According to <i>The Irish Times</i>, the allocation to the Garda for 2003 only went up 2%, which is below the rate of inflation. This Government, particularly Fianna Fáil, has not lived up to the promises and commitments it made.</P>
    <P>How do we address this issue? I will try to give a few short examples. We have consistently called for an increase in the presence of gardaí on the <Col N="954" />street with their deployment informed by rapid and continual analysis of street crime. We need to establish local partnerships which will enable rapid responses to public disorder, public drinking and the distribution and taking of drugs. We need to establish the commission for the gardaí urgently. The provision of additional gardaí is essential and it is something the Minister must do. Garda numbers are not increasing. Many gardaí are retiring and Garda numbers are not even keeping up with the numbers at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>I have more information, which I would have liked to outline. I support this motion and hope it will be supported by all sides because it is an issue that must be tackled by the Government. It has not done that so far &ndash; in fact, it has failed to live up to the commitments given to the people before the last election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;confirms its support for Government policies to tackle drug misuse through its ongoing commitment to, and implementation of, the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 and the 100 individual actions contained in the strategy which are being implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. The national drugs strategy is tackling not only a national issue but a worldwide phenomenon of an increase in the supply and misuse of drugs of all kinds. Huge channels of supply have been opened up around the world, mainly from areas such as Afghanistan, Colombia and Far Eastern countries. There is also a never-ending number of people willing to supply drugs. The USA spends billions of dollars each trying to tackle the drugs problem. We have to continue to fight these trends. The strategy put in place in 2001 goes a long way towards tackling those issues. There are examples of successes to date, including the number of ecstasy seizures which have quadrupled in the last year from 250,000 tablets in 2002 to almost one million so far this year. Drugs are available throughout the country; it is not just a Dublin or an urban issue. The gardaí, in particular, have had great successes in recent times thanks to investment in and enhancement of the drugs squads. This is a security issue not only for this country but internationally.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Terry regarding so-called gang-related killings. I would call the killings which have taken place recently drug-related killings. Co-operation between the gardaí and law enforcement agencies around the world is ongoing. Any worker in the area of drug treatment or any user of illegal drugs will say there will always be a market for drugs. Our objective and that of the strategy is to reduce those markets and to prevent new ones opening up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" />I would like to highlight some recent developments. There have been a couple of tragic cases recently involving young men suffering the consequences of the use of what are called snowballs or ice &ndash; a new methamphetamine that has huge potential to cause great damage, and has done so in other countries. It is described as a subtle drug but it is actually cheaper than ecstasy and has stronger psychological addiction qualities than heroin. There has also been an increase in the use of cocaine and crack cocaine.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned the four pillars of the strategy. Prevention has always been a matter of education. A percentage of young people will always want to experiment and we were all young once. However, the national awareness campaign has raised awareness in schools, particularly in the area of alcohol, which we must also recognise as a drug. Co-operation between schools, local task forces and gardaí has reaped benefits. Programmes in schools, such as the social, personal and health education programme, which was introduced in all schools in September, contains an element of education on drugs. Another relevant programme is On My Own Two Feet.</P>
    <P>In the area of treatment, we must recognise that drug addiction is one of the most difficult to overcome. Detoxification and stabilisation are only the first steps. Ongoing support and counselling are even more important. In this area, waiting lists have been drastically reduced. There are almost 7,000 treatment places available. Under the strategy, there is a focus on the number of people under the age of 18 presenting for treatment. There is an ongoing debate on the methadone protocol. I have talked to people working in the treatment area and the general consensus is that methadone works for some people but not for others. There are problems with methadone and the dispensing of it. In some cases, it is sold to buy other drugs or it is mixed with drugs. There are questions on the consequences for the health of people who are on methadone. This area is subject to ongoing debate and it should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>In terms of research, we need to have a greater understanding of why people misuse drugs. Most Members of the House will have stories of the devastation caused to families and communities. There must be an ongoing evaluation of all programmes in the strategy. I welcome the fact there will be a full review of progress by the end of 2004, which will give us a good idea of where we are going, where we have come from, and what is needed to continue the work. Indeed, the national advisory committee carries out ongoing research and evaluation in this area.</P>
    <P>The investment that takes place through the national drugs strategy, in particular in the young people's facilities and services fund, amounts to &euro;59 million, allocated among 350 projects to date. Even in my own area there are five or six projects which have proved to be hugely beneficial in <Col N="956" />preventing the misuse of drugs, particularly with young people. Under the national drugs strategy, the young people's facilities and services fund also supports the Irish Sports Council through the sports capital programme. This again has proved to be hugely successful, particularly with local community groups, many of which have been ring-fenced for funding and have been supported by community employment and jobs initiatives schemes. There has also been huge progress in reducing the availability of drugs in prisons, and local prison liaison groups have been included in this effort.</P>
    <P>There are no easy solutions to this problem. It is a worldwide phenomenon. We need to continue to invest in, and support, the national drugs strategy, which will continue to be rolled out over the coming years. There will always be more to do and we must continue to take responsibility in this area. We have listened to those communities and families that have suffered the consequences of drug abuse and will continue to support them as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I wish to concentrate on that part of the motion calling for a reversal of what it terms &ldquo;the savage cutbacks&rdquo; in community employment and jobs initiative schemes and which have reduced the capacity of the voluntary and community sector. Sometimes I wonder if the right hand of the Government knows what the left hand is doing, as there seems to be cutbacks in an area where great successes have been achieved and where departmental reports recommend that such community efforts should be supported. It is sometimes very difficult to see the point of producing some of these reports when it is unclear if the Government, when making its decisions, takes any notice of them.</P>
      <P>From my contacts in places like Carmichael House, the voluntary organisations will find the loss of community employment workers to be a serious matter. The Minister knows how important are these organisations to the parts of the city they serve. I understand that at present, approximately 1,000 people on community employment schemes are involved in drugs treatment programmes, counselling or various initiatives, which it is hoped will support the national drugs strategy. I ask the Minister of State to promise that these jobs will be definitely ring-fenced. It is ridiculous to promote the strategy while at the same time removing capable workers who have been shown to be doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great values of the community employment schemes was not only that they gave employment, but that those employed frequently came from the community, thus giving them an insight into the situation within communities which outsiders might have lacked. It is most fortunate that the unemployment rate is as low as 4.4% and I praise all those in industry, the Government, the trades unions and beyond who have played an important role in this achieve<Col N="957" />ment. However, we need to be careful that, having provided employment opportunities to the long-term unemployed, we do not take action which returns them to a state of unemployment. In view of this, I hope some effort has been made to consider those caught in this situation on a case by case basis. Given their involvement in their communities and their employment experience, they have frequently played an important role in reducing problems in their own community areas. The Minister of State will be aware that the long-term unemployed tend to come from the same parts of the city.</P>
    <P>Earlier I questioned if the right hand of the Government knows what the left hand is doing. On 29 October, the National Economic and Social Forum launched its most recent report on the value of social capital and how it can help local communities to better tackle socio-economic problems. If drugs and drug related crimes are deemed not to constitute socio-economic problems I do not know what kinds of activity would do so. The chairperson of the forum, Dr. Maureen Gaffney, in her press release, stated:</P>
    <P>Since the publication of Robert Putnam's work on social capital in 1995, there has been growing national and international interest in the concept. Social capital is defined as the social networks that, together with shared norms, values and understandings, facilitate collective action and co-operation within and among groups. Social capital can take many forms, having regular social contact with other people, trusting other people, feelings of mutual obligation, a willingness to reciprocate, engagement in your community, volunteering, a shared sense that you can effect change in your community, participating in the political life of your community, having trust in institutions.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of initiative we would wish to foster, yet the Government is cutting back on the very people who are involved in voluntary organisations within their communities and who would be promoting these efforts.</P>
    <P>There is growing evidence that there is a high level of social capital within Ireland and that there are significant benefits for individuals, families and communities. At community level, a high level of social capital is associated with economic growth, social equality and quality of public governance. In such high social capital communities, young people are less likely to commit suicide, drop out of school early or get involved in crime or anti-social behaviour. These are the things the Minister is trying to promote. At the level of the individual it promotes physical and psychological health, well-being and life satisfaction.</P>
    <P>We are well aware that young people frequently become involved in drugs because they have poor self-esteem and have dropped out of school. They see this as the only kind of path that will give them satisfaction in life. It was good to <Col N="958" />see from this report that, internationally, the country scored well on the level of social capital. Ireland is above average in most areas by comparison with its European counterparts. Irish people have a high membership of community and voluntary organisations &ndash; 65% compared with 48% across 32 countries. Rates of membership of sports and recreational organisations are at 28%, which is particularly high when compared with the European average of 16%. In this regard, credit must be given to the GAA and other organisations. Participation in unpaid voluntary work in Ireland, at 14%, is almost double the European average of 7%. Involvement in youth work, local community action groups and women's groups is also higher than the European average.</P>
    <P>Overall, there is a very good spirit in the country, as demonstrated during the Special Olympics. In view of this, why is the Government doing things like cutting back on the community employment schemes, which have been so important for many voluntary organisations? I speak of professional organisations as well. We have been able to take on extra workers in Cherish, for example. Why are these being cut back in such a drastic way when the Government has received a report which shows their great value in situations where drug abuse can be promoted? The people who are trying to work on the ground are being deprived of the help they need to do even better work within their communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank Fine Gael for tabling this motion, which allows the Minister of State to put forward the Government's proposals for dealing with the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>The level of drug taking is, in some part, due to the prosperity we have witnessed in the last number of years. With that prosperity has come a level of spending by our young people never before witnessed. We cannot overlook this fact. Recently, I was shocked to hear a national broadcaster, Eamon Dunphy, boast about his drug taking activities on a national television channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite" hpid="Ms White Ms White">
      <NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
      <P>It was disgusting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>What type of message does that send out to our young people? Is this the type of activity in which they should be taking part? I am surprised that Mr. Dunphy's statement was not more roundly refuted by everyone involved in this area.</P>
      <P>Drug taking is devastating for any young person, his or her family and the wider community. We have often seen communities refusing to facilitate services for dealing with the problem and forcing them to move elsewhere. We must welcome treatment centres in our communities if that is where the problem is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised by the suggestion in the Fine Gael motion that a better community employment scheme and more gardaí would solve the <Col N="959" />problem of drug abuse. Recruiting 2,000 extra gardaí will not solve this problem. Indeed, before we recruit 2,000 extra gardaí we should have a major overhaul of Garda management to ensure that its structure is more responsive. We have become a more urbanised society in the last few decades and with this has come an increased level of crime. I would like to see this overhaul progressed and I know that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to do this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced extra resources of &euro;2 million to help deal with gangland activity in Limerick and elsewhere. This amount has been decried by many in his House and further afield but it represents 55,000 Garda overtime hours. At the end of December, it will be interesting to see whether those overtime hours have been used up by the Garda Síochána. If they have not and if the money has not been targeted at the area for which it was given, it will be a salutary tale for all of us when we return to the House in January.</P>
    <P>The motion also refers to the Criminal Assets Bureau. The bureau is taking action with regard to criminal activity in Limerick and has taken successful actions in this area in recent years.</P>
    <P>Community employment was introduced in 1994 as a labour market programme and this has remained its primary focus. However, it is now accepted that community employment has become a multi-functional programme which continues to satisfy its labour market requirements but also provides essential local services and, in some instances, is the only employment opportunity for some categories of long-term unemployed and people with disabilities. There is widespread acknowledgement of the valuable role played by community employment and the job initiative participants in delivering local community services.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the percentage of long-term unemployed was 2.6%. It is now 1.4%. At the end of 1999 there were 36,500 participants on CE schemes. The average participation on CE programmes in 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,500, with a projected year end participation of 20,000. The number of CE projects has reduced from 2,274 to 1,503. In many cases projects have amalgamated into new entities, allowing the activity to continue on a smaller scale. The jobs initiative programme will have an average participation rate in the region of 2,466 during 2003 and a year end participation rate of 2,200. Participants exiting jobs initiative schemes may avail of the higher support process, which is designed to provide a flexible response for persons experiencing barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment in the open labour market and they may also avail of the FÁS local employment services with a view to securing further training and employment.</P>
    <P>Community employment projects are prioritised based on the services provided. Drugs task force activity and child care services are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in the <Col N="960" />RAPID areas are given priority. Current progression rates to employment do not generate confidence in the effectiveness of the CE programme as an active labour market programme and a review is called for. I do not see why, in a community centre in which I am actively involved, a CE scheme should be used to supervise people taking part in a bridge session. This is not an essential service and the Government should not provide a CE scheme participant for that kind of work. I would rather see schemes ring-fenced for the areas we are discussing tonight. That is what the Government is doing.</P>
    <P>I fully support the amendment. I am delighted the Minister of State is here to give us his views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion introduced by Fine Gael. However, I am always concerned by the huge emphasis placed on illegal drugs. I work in the third level education sector. For every third level student whose life is damaged by illegal drugs, ten are probably damaged, psychologically or physically, by alcohol. I say this as a lead-in to supporting the Fine Gael motion. As one who is more than partial to taking occasional drops of alcohol, I am acutely aware that alcohol will devastate more families and more people than all the illegal drugs put together. There is overwhelming evidence of this.</P>
      <P>There is an increasing rate of admissions of people under 25 to psychiatric hospitals because of alcohol. We must examine the general question of mood altering substances. I am not suggesting liberalising the law on any substance but to pretend that we can make a distinction between legal mood altering substances like alcohol and illegal mood altering substances is to retreat from the extremely important fact that we appear to have an increasing number of people in our society who will use mood altering substances knowing that the quantity and intensity of their usage, whether they be legal or illegal, will damage them physically and mentally.</P>
      <P>Apart from the legitimate issues that are raised in this motion about the appalling breach of promises by Government, there can have been few more headlined promises than that of 2,000 additional gardaí on the streets. The cynical retreat from this is worthy of the most unequivocal condemnation. The little phrase, inserted at the end of the manifesto saying everything was subject to economic conditions, has been repeatedly used by the Government to justify the multiplicity of broken promises. The difference between Government and the Opposition at the election was that the Government had information at its disposal before the election that made clear its promises were indefensible. They knew what was happening to tax revenue yet issued a manifesto and inserted a little get-out clause, the substance of which they knew to be true. One of the promises was the 2,000 additional gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numerous international gurus, based on the studies they have undertaken, have told societies <Col N="961" />that police on the beat do not necessarily reduce the incidence of crime. The presence of gardaí is required not just for the reduction in the quantities of crime, but because of the reassurance their presence gives people. Many of the crimes that most upset people in their communities are not those that even make the Garda statistics. Walking home through many of our housing estates and running into youngsters who are intoxicated or affected by some other substance and who are abusive and threatening is what frightens and worries people. While these youngsters do not necessarily beat up people, although some of them do, they make life miserable for everybody living in the area. This misery is compounded by the belief of people that gardaí are invisible in their community. If the same incident happened occasionally and people knew there was a continuous Garda presence in the area, they would not feel as threatened or that their world was undermined. This is the way people in many communities feel.</P>
    <P>While speaking about people being undermined, the way the Government has tried to pretend the community employment scheme as it was introduced at the height of an unemployment crisis is the same as how the scheme works now is astonishing. It was fashionable in the 1980s to talk about the middle way, neither public nor private. Community employment schemes fit firmly into that. Of course it was true that in many cases the scheme did not result in a higher uptake of jobs in what the Progressive Democrats would term the &ldquo;real economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know a man from Cork city who worked all his life and injured his back. He found a satisfying job he loved in a community employment scheme. His job was ended because a guru decided this labour market intervention was not producing the desired consequence of putting him into the real marketplace where he could not work because of his injury. He despaired and committed suicide because what had given him his own worth was taken away from him. Do not let me hear about labour market intervention measures. The community employment scheme has long ceased to be that. It is a system of providing employment for people who, for reasons of physical or other handicap, are no longer capable of working in a competitive economy. To close those schemes on the basis of economic analysis is to fly in the face of reality.</P>
    <P>It also takes away support from all sorts of group. I have no objection to a person on a community employment scheme helping people to play bridge. To my certain knowledge, the overwhelming bulk of people who play bridge are elderly. Among other things, bridge gives them a chance to get out, meet people and do things that they would otherwise not be capable of doing. It is a wonderful thing to spend taxpayers' money to give our old people the chance to get out into the community at night and meet each other in a place where they feel secure. It is astonishing that a Member of this House would think otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. As someone who cut my teeth with him around the streets of Drumcondra in our early political days, it is a pleasure to see him in the position he now holds. I wish him luck and congratulate him on the fine work that he has done so far.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion asks the Government to do something about the escalating drug culture. I counter that by congratulating the Government on the fine work it has done in tackling this dreadful disease. The drugs strategy was ambitious and was probably the most comprehensive attempt ever made in this country to deal with the issue. This was correct given that drug use had risen to epidemic proportions at that time. The strategy clearly set out its aims and aspirations for the various Departments and agencies charged with the responsibility of conducting the process. Key to this was the implementation of the 14 drug task forces set up in Dublin, Cork, Bray and Galway.</P>
      <P>The development of those task forces has been tremendous. I can speak for the task force in the north inner city of Dublin, the area represented by Senator Brady and me. Drugs have scourged the north inner city. The work of the local community voluntary groups, working in tandem with State agencies, has made tremendous strides in tackling drugs in the area. No one is suggesting for one moment that the problem is solved. However, positive signs are emerging from areas where the strategy is in place that work is being done and improvements are being made. Much of this is down to the additional resources that have been given to the ERHA for the expansion of its services. Someone mentioned that in 1995 there were 1,400 methadone treatment places. Tonight the Minister will tell us that there are now 6,800 places, 300 more than the target the strategy had set for the current time.</P>
      <P>The number of treatment locations has also risen. This is despite the fact that there was quite an amount of selfish behaviour by some communities when the health board attempted to locate treatment centres in their areas. By and large, I blame the health board for this. At that time the board had a propensity to purchase buildings, develop them and then leak to the community what the houses were going to be used for. Naturally, the reaction of communities was that they did not want such facilities located at their back doors. Therein lay the problem. I do not blame the communities totally for this. While there was a certain selfishness involved, I criticised the health boards at the time for the way in which they went about this.</P>
      <P>While treating those in our communities who are scourged with the habit of drug use is important, prevention is the most important thing. I know we are looking at an ideal world if we talk about cutting off supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we should try to cut supply in every way possible. The Garda Síochána and customs officers are to be congratulated for their efforts in this area. Senator Brady alluded to that earlier <Col N="963" />when he gave evidence of recent seizures of &euro;23 million worth of cannabis, &euro;1.5 million worth of cocaine and &euro;500,000 worth of ecstasy. These seizures are evidence that this country is being targeted in a major way by these drug barons. Current thinking is that as the Garda make progress in identifying the routes used, the drug barons are moving on to new ones. Africa and Afghanistan are often called mule routes in that regard. Credit must be given to the customs officers and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Organised crime is a new phenomenon in this country. It began to raise its ugly head in the 1980s and has its origins in illegal drug trading. The Government's response to it has been hard hitting as evidenced by the volume of legislation put through both Houses in recent months. I attended a meeting of the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights when discussing the Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill 2000 which had at its core the tackling of drug barons who brought their drugs here by sea. Our coastline is more than 3,000 kilometres long, a difficult coastline to protect. In attempting to protect it we also introduced the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003, the purpose of which was to bring about an association with various countries, liaising with each other in a cohesive and incisive way to tackle drug barons on the ground. The friendships and liaisons that have developed between our communities as a result of that legislation will benefit us greatly in the war against these individuals.</P>
    <P>The scale of drug trafficking was brought home to us last year when a seizure valued at &euro;25 million on its way to this island, North and South, was intercepted in Belgium. It was, apparently, on its way to paramilitaries whom we are advised are earning in the region of &euro;8 million to &euro;12 million in any given year. That is something to behold. It further indicates the seriousness of the challenge with which we are faced.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Ryan is not here. I listened to what he had to say about the promises made in the Fianna Fáil manifesto regarding the provision of extra gardaí. I am sick of hearing that. It is spouted out that Fianna Fáil promised 2,000 extra gardaí in year one of its term in office. That is not so. Fianna Fáil promised to recruit 2,000 extra gardaí in the lifetime of the Government. The Government is only <i>in situ</i> 14 months. It is disingenuous to say the Government is making false promises when it is not. I have no doubt the Government will fulfil those promises. The previous Government increased the numbers in the Garda Síochána by more than 900, up to the level of 11,700, during its term in office and it will honour its commitment to increase that number further.</P>
    <P>The number of gardaí on the street is not always what matters. Deployment plays a major role in this. I was recently told a story about a young girl and her two friends who were attacked <Col N="964" />following birthday celebrations in Temple Bar. They walked for 20 minutes before finding a garda to whom they could report the incident. On the same night a friend of mine was stopped by the gardaí in a spot check for tax and insurance. Those gardaí would be better deployed in trouble spots than in stopping individuals to check if their cars are taxed and insured.</P>
    <P>The motion before us implies that sufficient resources are not being committed to the drugs issue. Nothing is further from the truth. Only a small proportion of money seized by CAB is linked to drug seizures. That is, in any event, once-off money and one could not conduct any kind of policy on the basis that one may or may not have money at a given time. The Constitution requires and Government accounting principles provide that any public moneys spent are voted upon and approved by the Dáil. Any changes in that regard must be made by statute. I do not see a way forward in this regard and do not agree we should do so.</P>
    <P>I am involved in working with disabled people. CE schemes have been a God send in that area. Even though I have heard there are to be cutbacks, I have received no indication of that happening in the disability sector. Senator Brady said more than 1,100 drug users are currently working in CE schemes. All that has been said on this side of the House compliments the Minister of State on what he has achieved to date.</P>

      <P>Will these prove to be empty words yet again? Real power and real action need the necessary executive budgets to bring them to fruition. As we know this Government is bordering on bankruptcy. The Minister of State's Department stated: &ldquo;The Government is committed to a national drugs strategy.&rdquo; The statistics speak for themselves. A 2002 UN report estimates that 9.4% of Irish people aged 15 years and over took cannabis at least once a year, ranking Ireland joint first with the UK on a list of 23 western European countries in terms of prevalence. Ireland ranks ahead of all countries, including the UK, in terms of the use of amphetamines, otherwise known as speed and ecstasy, with prevalence rates of 2.4% and 2.6% respectively. On cocaine, Ireland ranks third, with a prevalence rate of 1.3%. On opiates, including heroin, it ranks joint tenth, with a prevalence rate of 0.3%. The national drugs strategy is great in theory but lacks any basis in effect or preventive action. The Government is totally unable to deal with the drugs problem or the attendant growth in organised crime. Contrary to popular belief, organised crime is not confined to Limerick, and many in our capital city live in deadly fear of the crime barons. We have similar problems in all our towns in the midlands. It is common knowledge that Dublin gangs are targeting surrounding rural areas on nightly raids. I have evidence of that, not merely from my own county, but my own parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said over and over again, and certainly bears repetition, that funding for local authorities for basic crime prevention measures such as adequate street lighting could go a long <Col N="966" />way towards thwarting and frustrating the criminal activities of those gangs. The collapse of the recent Keane murder trial was the most serious threat to our justice system since the murder of Veronica Guerin. The Minister's response has been robbing Peter to pay Paul, diverting &euro;2 million in funds from another area in his Department to fight a vicious generation of crime lords that has emerged under a more than inadequate watch.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is now outlining a series of responses, the most essential of which requires the Taoiseach to take a lead in rebuilding the trust between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the gardaí. Numerous actions and statements from the Minister have undermined and impinged upon the integrity of the force. Following that, the gardaí must be asked what resources they need to tackle the current extreme problems, and a special organised crime unit must be established. That unit must have the resources, manpower and firepower necessary to take those gangs off our streets. The law-abiding citizens of Limerick, Dublin and the rest of the country need to see a positive, if somewhat belated, response.</P>
    <P>Whether that response is best served by prison closures is debatable. If and when the gardaí get the necessary resources to combat crime, can the Government guarantee that there will be sufficient prison capacity to contain those criminals or will they escape a custodial sentence or gain early release owing to overcrowding? What sort of message will that send out? Perhaps it will reinforce what every criminal in Ireland already knows, namely, that organised crime is already effectively subverting our criminal justice system, and as it stands, the sky is the limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister may think he is winning the fight against crime but I suggest that he is in a minority of one. The Minister must immediately and without prevarication review the protection provided to witnesses in murder trials. He must establish an organised crime unit with the capability and specialisation to tackle violent criminal drug gangs, provide an urgent capital injection to expand the complement of the Garda Síochána, expand the emergency response unit, and hold all gangland trials in the Special Criminal Court. The Government has failed to prioritise Ireland's growing drug problem. It has slashed &euro;7 million from the national drugs programme. Most of the programme promised is behind schedule.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has seized approximately &euro;44 million from suspected criminals since it was set up by the rainbow coalition in 1996. That money is disappearing into the bottomless pit of the Exchequer. It should be ring-fenced for drug treatment and drug-related offences. Under the current legislation, money seized by the CAB in any given year can be released only seven years later. Fine Gael proposes that the waiting period be amended to three years to speed up the provision of a desperately needed service. It is not only those who can <Col N="967" />afford to live behind security gates who deserve protection. All our citizens have an inalienable right to live in their homes and walk the streets in safety, and I ask the Taoiseach to intervene and give people security in their property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to speak on this motion on behalf of the Government and to have the opportunity to refute categorically many of the claims made by the Opposition this evening. Whoever is in the Fine Gael research office is extraordinarily negative and can quote and misquote statistics to beat the band. Admittedly, a recent UN report was compiled from the data of the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs, or ESPAD. That is conducted in schools among 15 and 16 year olds, and we all know that that is not the most scientific method, since there is a little peer pressure, and everyone wants to claim that he or she is on everything.</P>
      <P>The report totally ignores the national population survey, which is very detailed and in-depth and has been conducted on an all-Ireland basis with the authorities in the North. It came out a few weeks ago, showing that, on an overall population basis, only 19% of people had ever touched any kind of drug, even once in their lives. That survey was conducted in line with best international practice. There were three basic questions, namely, whether respondents had ever, even once, touched an illegal drug, whether they had done so within the previous 12 months and whether they had done so within the previous month. That showed that only 19% of people had ever touched an illegal drug, even once in their lives. That was a very in-depth survey across people from 15 to 64 years of age. Contrary to what everyone is saying &ndash; that everyone is on illegal drugs &ndash; it clearly showed that four out of five people in the country had never been tempted by an illegal drug, even once in their lives.</P>
      <P>I ask people to get real. Of course we have a problem. There are 14,500 heroin addicts in the country. While the last survey showed that numbers had dropped slightly in Dublin, I will not allow myself to get carried away by those hopeful signs. We concede that we have a problem, but for God's sake let us speak factually. Exaggerating figures simply to prove a point serves no purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has a strong and ongoing commitment to tackling drug misuse &ndash; indeed, to tackling the broader problems of social exclusion &ndash; through the many programmes and initiatives it operates in disadvantaged areas. Tackling drug misuse remains one of the Government's key priorities. My Department co-ordinates the implementation of the national drugs strategy, which was launched in May 2001. The strategy brings together all elements of drugs policy in Ireland into a single framework, with <Col N="968" />responsibilities clearly assigned. As mentioned, it contains 100 separate actions across the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be carried out by a range of Departments and agencies. Objectives are clearly laid down and reported on to the interdepartmental committee which I chair. Progress is monitored on an ongoing basis through regular meetings of the interdepartmental group on drugs, as well as through six-monthly progress reports to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach. If we do not achieve great success at interdepartmental level, the Ministers are held to account by the Taoiseach in the Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations in the strategy is that regional drugs task forces, or RDTFs, be established throughout the country. The strategy proposes that RDTFs be established in each of the ten health board areas to develop appropriate policies for the regions. The RDTFs will be based on the local drugs task force model, which has been successful, mainly here in Dublin, for the last six or seven years. Members will be aware that local drugs task forces are operating in areas experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. They facilitate&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have answered questions asked by Deputy O'Dowd on this issue several times, but he continues to give inaccurate information. He has got six months out of it, so fair play to him, but the publication of the Estimates tomorrow will necessitate an updating of his speech.</P>
      <P>The local drug task forces facilitate the delivery of a targeted response to the drug problem. They bring together the key organisations in the statutory and voluntary sectors to work with the local community and elected representatives in developing responses appropriate to local circumstances. A key aspect of the local drug task forces is that they are not preaching down from on high. They are not telling people how to operate at local level. A good partnership arrangement exists between the Departments, the statutory agencies and the communities. The good work that has been done by local drug task forces in recent years has been properly funded.</P>
      <P>The Government has allocated over &euro;65 million in the last six years for the implementation of approximately 500 projects in the 14 drug task force areas. In addition to the moneys available under the action plans, capital funding has been made available under the premises initiative. This initiative is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in local drug task force areas. More than &euro;11 million has been spent on meeting the accommodation needs of 38 capital projects. The Government has spent almost &euro;60 million on the youth facilities and services fund because it recognises that telling young people not to fall into the trap of drugs is not enough. Alternative and healthy lifestyle options must be provided in many disadvantaged areas. Young people are encouraged to engage in sport or arts projects. Some &euro;59 million has been spent in recent years on the fund, which continues to do good work.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided to extend the task force model because it recognises that the drug problem now affects many parts of the country. While it is proposed to apply the same principle &ndash; an area-based co-ordinated response founded on partnership between the various sectors &ndash; it is recognised that adjustments will have to be made if the model is to be successfully replicated at regional level. The regional drugs task forces will operate from a wider geographic base than the local drugs task forces in Dublin. The regional task forces will serve diverse communities in urban and rural areas. The establishment of the regional task forces represents an innovative approach to tackling the drug problem on a regional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the regional task forces will be to research, develop and implement a co-ordinated response to drug misuse. The partnership approach that will be used will involve the statutory, voluntary and community sectors. The <Col N="970" />regional drugs task forces will assess the nature and extent of drug misuse in their areas, provide information on drug-related services, identify and address gaps in service provision with regard to the available evidence on the extent and specific location of drug misuse in the region and prepare action plans to respond to regional drugs problems. I am glad that virtually all the task forces are up and running and are meeting regularly. When I met representatives of a number of the forces in Portlaoise recently, they seemed to be quite happy with the progress being made. As a first step in the development of action plans, the task forces are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas and the level and range of existing services. Good work is being done in that regard.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the national drugs strategy team is consulting the national alcohol strategy task force about the establishment of effective links between drug and alcohol policies at national, regional and local levels. I do not mean to belittle the dangers of alcohol. Fine Gael's motion recognises that drugs are illegal and that alcohol is legal. The abuse of alcohol is a serious matter. The Labour Party tried, as it often does, to confuse the matters by saying, more or less, that drugs are not so bad after all. I accept that Fine Gael realises that drugs are illegal. A great deal of the Government's energy and emphasis is on trying to crack down on the criminal nature of drugs. We are trying to link the drugs strategy and the alcohol strategy at the preventative level. The strategies overlap at certain levels, particularly at the preventative level. When we speak to younger people, it is important that we try to link the preventative aspects of these matters. We should provide information and knowledge about both issues.</P>
    <P>I expect that the action plans for the regional drugs task forces will be developed in 2004. The task forces will then submit for approval their plans to the national drugs strategy team and, ultimately, to the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Inclusion. We will then be able to consider putting funding in place for them.</P>
    <P>Senator Kett mentioned earlier that the number of methadone treatment places has increased hugely in recent years. A great deal of emphasis has been placed in that direction. The number of places is just over 6,700 and many of the problems on the ground have been solved. That it is now easier to get a place on a methadone programme means that the methadone black market has been severely reduced. Approximately 50% of drug addicts are now on methadone. We have almost reached the limit of those requiring the service.</P>
    <P>I invite Senator Feighan, who discussed the need for a drugs awareness campaign, to look at a television because such a campaign is in place.</P>

      <P>The first phase of the campaign was very general but the second phase, which is due to be rolled out in the coming months, will specifically target parents. Guidelines to assist schools in developing a drugs policy have been developed and were issued to all primary schools in May 2002. A great deal of progress has been made in other areas, by the Customs and Excise and others. Good progress has been made in the coastal watch programme which has been launched. More than 1,100 recovering drug misusers are participating in the special FÁS community employment schemes. I have mentioned the all-Ireland survey of drug use and the prevalence of opiate misuse in Ireland. I recommend that all Members read the survey to ascertain the facts, rather than what they might hear from others.</P>
      <P>I want to address the issue of Garda numbers. The Government is committed to ensuring that the Garda Síochána is provided with the necessary resources, in terms of personnel and equipment, to enable it to deal efficiently and effectively with the challenges it faces. There were 10,800 gardaí when the Government took office in 1997, but that figure has since increased to 11,900. The Government is on target to increase the number of gardaí further to 12,200. The Garda training college at Templemore is operating at full pace. There are problems at present because many gardaí have reached retirement age. Perhaps the Opposition parties recommend a watering down of the&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is important that we keep the training college at full strength. I understand that 690 Garda trainees have been taken into the <Col N="972" />Garda college this year and that a new Garda recruitment competition is under way. I was in Norway recently and I asked how many policemen were in the country. I was told that there were only 8,000, yet it has a population of 6 million and a land mass that must be 20 or 30 times that of Ireland. Our Government is committed to having more gardaí but I wonder if the people are more law-abiding in other countries or whether those countries manage to make better use of their police forces.</P>
      <P>On community employment and the jobs initiative, the average participation rate on CE schemes is expected to be in the region of 22,500 during 2003, with a projected year-end participation rate of 20,000. It is true that there were reductions voted through during the year and we can only await the next Estimates to see what will occur in this respect next year. Some years ago we all recognised that there was a lot of fat in some of the CE schemes, which I feel is now more or less gone. I hope this indicates that the numbers have stabilised because many of the schemes do a lot of good work at local level.</P>

      <P>The Government is very much aware of the important contribution CE schemes <Col N="973" />and the jobs initiative have made to the development of services for local communities over the years. In this context, some reviews are currently under way.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry spoke about community groups and CE schemes and mentioned one body in particular. Opposition Members can be very selective. We announced what we call the White Paper money, the federations and networks money, during the year and gave it to a number of voluntary groups. A sum of &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million is to be paid out over the next three years. Senator Henry referred to a group that received money through one fund but not both. People seem to ignore the good work that has been done during the year. It is arguable, in the case of the group Senator Henry mentioned, whether it should be funded as a community group because many of the groups that are in the premises are under the Department of Health and Children, from which some receive good funding. If we can help them we will, but they should try to manage their own affairs as well.</P>
      <P>Ring fencing of Criminal Assets Bureau moneys was mentioned and was also raised in the Dáil recently. I accept that the Opposition spokespersons on this subject are reflecting what is said in the community, where there is a desire that Criminal Assets Bureau money be ploughed back into the areas it is perceived to have come from. It is important to state that the majority of assets frozen to date under the relevant Act did not come from the activities of drug dealers, and there is no logical link between those assets and drug programmes.</P>
      <P>Implementing a policy of ring fencing moneys obtained by the Exchequer and reallocating them for specific purposes runs contrary to the normal Estimates process. The Constitution requires and Government accounting principles provide that public moneys be spent only as voted or approved by Dáil Éireann. Of course, if I were to get money to spend in disadvantaged areas I could spend it.</P>

      <P>Equally, the sums available from the Criminal Assets Bureau might vary from year to year and might not be certain. Frankly, I do not care where the money comes from once it is given to us by the Department of Finance. If one builds up an ELS or a programme, one can count on the funding received year after year. Relying on a source like the Criminal Assets Bureau might be dicey and might not be guaranteed in the longer term. However, I agree that the Opposition is reflecting a demand from the community in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tackling drug misuse remains a key priority for the Government. The very considerable resources, the numerous initiatives and the ongoing prioritisation of the issue bear testament to that. Much good work has been done and <Col N="974" />many good programmes are in place. I go out and about and witness this good work. The Government cannot solve the problem of drugs. It can help but the problem is international. One can certainly try to make people more aware of the dangers and give people information and data. People make their own choices and young people have to be aware of the dangers to themselves. They are ultimately responsible for making their lifestyle choices. A lot of good work is being done. I thank the Members for some of the good remarks that have been made on this motion and I recommend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. We have debated this problem on many occasions over the years and nobody has the answer. In the developed western world there is more and more use and misuse of drugs, and hard drugs have become recreational drugs for many and have become part of their lives.</P>
      <P>We have to think differently about how we approach the question of drugs, although I do not think this will happen. I want to raise some issues that need to be addressed and challenged and do not expect anybody to agree with me. We should be absolutely honest about some of the issues involved. The first thing we should do in most of our advertising is concede the fact that tobacco is more addictive than heroin. I have never seen any public statement to this effect but it is the reality. All studies have proven this and those who were addicted to both will confirm it. It is harder to kick a tobacco habit than a heroin habit.</P>
      <P>We need to remember that heroin does not necessarily kill people. Heroin addicts who die tend to die not so much from heroin but from dirty needles and the kind of lifestyle and life of crime that accompany drugs misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the overdoses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly do kill people, but these deaths comprise the minority.</P>
      <P>The biggest problem being created by drugs today is the associated crime. It is absolutely hypocritical for anybody to stand up in the House and say he is driven by constituents who are worried about drug abuse. The people who drive us, telephone us and write to the newspapers do so because of the crime associated with drugs misuse. This is the reality and we should examine it.</P>
      <P>We are wasting time dealing with cannabis, which is less dangerous than tobacco. One can like this fact or lump it. I am not in favour of having another drug of choice by making cannabis available &ndash; this is not my point &ndash; but we should recognise that it is less dangerous and addictive than tobacco and that we are wasting huge amounts of resources in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one sense, the problem is in our hands. Demand for heroin is the reason for crime and we all know that the money involved in the heroin trade drives the crime attaching to it. It does <Col N="975" />not take a great mind to arrive at that conclusion. If we were to do something daft and stupid tomorrow morning, namely, make heroin freely available to anybody who wanted it, the crime wave would effectively end. Admittedly, people would kill themselves using drugs, addiction would continue and we would have a subculture of people in society with whom it would be impossible to deal. Nevertheless, there would be no crime if there was free access to heroin &ndash; people would not break into old people's homes, no one would be shot for carrying drugs and half the Garda Síochána would not be chasing drug dealers.</P>
    <P>While I am not suggesting we should take this approach, I am suggesting we should bear it in mind when trying to address the problem. Even if one could not make heroin freely available, one could do certain things. The Minister of State referred to methadone treatment. Making heroin available is only a small step from making methadone treatment available. Successful experiments have been carried out in this regard, including one in Wirral near Liverpool a few years ago in which the British state made heroin available to registered heroin addicts through doctors. The impact of the programme was that participants were able to live normal lives in that they worked and did not commit crime. The programme worked well and also allowed the doctors administering the drugs to try to wean drug addicts off heroin.</P>
    <P>A similar programme should be introduced here. The reason this will not happen is that if the Minister were to make such an announcement tomorrow morning, people would say the Government had gone mad and was feeding junkies. Leadership requires that we take bold steps. Handing out heroin is no different from handing out methadone. The difference, however, would be that it would snooker the suppliers, the drugs trade and the criminals and allow the State to consider innovative, novel approaches to resolving the problem which would reduce crime, bring the drug addicts under the influence of medical professionals and allow people to make choices and move on. This has happened elsewhere and could happen here. I am sure the Minister of State has read as much about these experiments as I have.</P>

      <P>There is no question that this would happen and that one would encounter many problems. Can the Minister of State indicate a problem greater than those we currently face, where people are being shot, killed, robbed and tortured? I may have considered all these issues when I organised a pan-European drugs conference in 1986 on behalf of the Council of <Col N="976" />Europe and the European Community, but I do not purport to be an expert. I am proposing an approach we have not yet tried. The Minister of State's response should not be to list all the problems associated with my proposal, including the negative publicity it would attract, as I am already aware of them.</P>
      <P>Somebody will have to do something different on this issue as it will not be resolved by the current approach. Drugs use and misuse is increasing rather than decreasing for which, incidentally, I do not blame the Government because all Governments would face the same problem. Despite the important points raised as regards policy towards the Garda Síochána, nobody knows the answer to the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>At least by decriminalising drugs and making heroin and hard drugs controlled substances, my approach would afford us an opportunity to take a brand new approach to it. While I do not expect many people to agree with me, this approach has been tried and has worked. If we could finally snooker the criminal element, we could at least begin to deal with addiction and the medical and other issues associated with it. As long as drug prices are maintained at high levels because dealing in and taking them is a criminal activity, the industry we have created for unscrupulous drug barons will thrive. We know where the current approach is leading us and while I do not pretend to know the answer, I would like new ways of thinking to be brought to bear on the issue.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his informed contribution, which contained a great deal of information and has given me much to consider. While working as a teacher and counsellor in an extremely disadvantaged area between 1993 and 1997, I received no support. The Fine Gael Party was in Government during that period. When drug related problems arose in my school, I was left to handle them as best I could. At least this Government has instituted a strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that there is no fixed solution to the drugs problem. It is a colossal problem which goes deep into society. The fundamental question is why is it happening. Does it say something about the type of families we now have? Do we need to question the level of prosperity we now enjoy or examine how children are being brought up? When I was growing up I was not allowed out of the house and had to account for every movement I made. Is this happening today? Young children now go out from the ages of eight, nine and ten years. I welcome the Government's efforts to tackle this fundamental issue as money is not always the answer. We need an integrated approach, such as <Col N="977" />that taken by the local drugs task forces, which involve everyone concerned, namely, the community at large, community leaders, educationalists, the Garda Síochána and, above all, parents.</P>
    <P>Many fine programmes dealing with drug misuse and prevention are in place in schools. While they are in school, children listen but forget what they have learnt once they move into their environment. Parents must play a major role in this regard. The Government has made a commitment that the drugs issue is one of its top priorities, which is as it should be. As Senator O'Toole stated, there are no fixed answers and this will be a long process. It is wrong of the Fine Gael Party to suggest the Government is doing nothing when nothing was done between 1993 and 1997. It should give us credit for trying. We may not have a success story&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I will address specifically the issue of community employment schemes. The marginal additional cost of such schemes &ndash; 10% compared to unemployment assistance &ndash; is insignificant in terms of the benefits accruing to the community from them, notwithstanding that an individual who loses a place on a scheme may find himself on unemployment assistance which tends to result in higher costs in terms of health and associated costs. The basic principle of community employment is excellent. I am fully cognisant that the economy is growing, partially due to the world economy but principally as a result of Fianna Fáil Party policies over many years, which created economic success recognised throughout the world. Up to 20,000 work permits are required every year but there is still a demand for community employment schemes. I welcome the fact that a number of reviews of community employment schemes are underway. I have spoken at Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meetings, attended by the Taoiseach and Ministers, about the cuts in these schemes and I am hopeful that my concerns will be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wholesale cuts in community employment and jobs initiative schemes in deprived areas could lead to increased feelings of marginalisation. As a Government party, Fianna Fáil will discharge <Col N="978" />its responsibility and address such issues in a compassionate manner. The jobs initiative and community employment schemes are similar in that they aim to bring people, euphemistically described as &ldquo;distant from the labour market&rdquo;, back into that market. Run by FÁS, they are managed locally and offer work and training in sheltered environments to people who have few skills or have not worked for many years.</P>
    <P>The jobs initiative scheme is full time and open to anyone over the age of 35 years who has been unemployed for more than five years. Participants are paid &euro;298.40 per week. The community employment scheme is part time and open to anyone over 25 years who has been unemployed for more than a year. Participants receive &euro;149.20 per week, plus allowances for dependants. The cost of running the scheme is approximately &euro;25 per person more than the provision of social welfare. Widely regarded as having been enormously successful, the schemes have directed thousands of people, some of whom would have been regarded as unemployable, back into the workforce. They generally operate in non-profit operations that provide community services, such as home helps, meals on wheels, child care and environmental and heritage programmes.</P>
    <P>The rationale behind the cutbacks was that there was less need for the scheme with the economy on the upturn. However, there might always be a need to provide these types of schemes. FÁS is seeking to implement significant cuts in the level of participation in these schemes, which provide an essential service in many marginalised and socially deprived areas. Important services, such as child care, meals on wheels and school maintenance, will be affected by cuts. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, told <i>The Irish Times</i> in the first week of October that he was cognisant of the pain the cuts in community employment and jobs initiative schemes were causing and that he had brought proposals to Cabinet on revamping the community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>Tremendous work has been done through community employment schemes in County Tipperary. Villages have been enhanced by the construction of stone walls, the planting of flower beds and the renovation of old buildings, among other things. These might never have been done otherwise and we should not cease our commendation of that work. The benefits of these schemes far outweigh any small cost savings for the State brought about by their abolition. Even at a time when we give between 20,000 and 30,000 work visas, there still appears to be a need in the economy for these schemes. Their benefits far outweigh their cost.</P>

      <P>As has been pointed out forcibly and articulately by my colleague, Senator Feighan, whom I commend on bringing this timely and opportune motion before the House, the twin scourges of modern society in Ireland are alcohol and drugs. The report on the European survey, which I have read in detail, is excellent in its critical analysis and its recommendations. There have been numerous reports, including two ministerial reports, but the situation is getting progressively worse.</P>
      <P>Look at the figures for possession offences. In 1996, there were 355 possession of cannabis offences; in 1999, that number trebled to 904. The figures for possession of cannabis resin were 1,441 in 1996 and 3,281 for 1999; for heroin the figures were 432 in 1996 and they rose to 887 in 1999. In 1996 there were 340 seizures of ecstasy and in 1999, there were 1,223, another trebling of the figure. There is a huge market and it is growing all the time. There have been 18 gangland killings, each of which, including the murder of a 24 year old on waste ground at the back of a pub in Mulhuddart last night, is directly related to drugs.</P>
      <P>The quantities of drugs seized are frightening. In 1996, 2.4 kg of cannabis were seized; in 1999 the quantity was 66 kg. In the case of cannabis resin, the respective figures were 1,993 kg and 2,511. In the case of ecstasy, 19,000 tablets were seized in 1996; in 1999, a massive 229,191 tablets were seized. Our prisons are infested with drugs. If somebody who is not a drug addict is sent to prison, they generally emerge as an addict. There is no proper treatment centre or accommodation. There is no policy to clean out the prisons. Nobody should be let out of prison unless they are clean from drugs.</P>
      <P>Look at the number of deaths that have occurred. It is frightening. I commend the drugs squad on doing an excellent job but it is not being given sufficient manpower or monetary resources. I love to hear on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that there has been another massive seizure of drugs but the drugs squad cannot continue to operate with its hands tied.</P>
      <P>An excellent suggestion was made by our spokesman in the Dáil, Deputy O'Dowd, but the Minister of State did not address it tonight. The Government will not accept it. Deputy O'Dowd suggested that the period within which the money that is seized under the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation can be made available should be shortened from seven to three years. Second, all that money, &euro;44 million per annum, should be spent on drug treatment.</P>
      <P>We are losing the battle. I am not critical of the Government for that, although I am critical of it in terms of resources and the number of gardaí. We must tackle and beat the drug barons and the pushers. Above all, we must be effective in providing treatment. Drug problems thrive in areas of social deprivation and, as Senator Ormonde pointed out, that is the root problem. Those areas must be tackled but we are not doing so effectively at present.</P>

      <P>I wish to focus on the conflict in Limerick city, which has been in the news in recent days. The level of family feuding there is unparalleled in other parts of the country. Why has this happened? It is due to drugs.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government spoke about providing resources to deal with the drugs issue. There is an acute problem in Limerick with the provision of resources. A total of &euro;7 million was promised to provide adequate facilities in the main Garda station in Henry Street. There is no incident room in that station. There is an incident room in the Mayorstone sub-station but although the station covers about 40% of the population of Limerick city, it is only open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. from Monday to Friday and for a short time on Sunday. The image it projects, therefore, is wrong. The gardaí have not worked an hour of overtime since last July and they are investigating a series of murders. There have been 38 murders in the Limerick area since 1997.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of fear in the area. There is also fear among the gardaí, that they might be followed by people. They are fearful for themselves. The fear results from the number of assaults that have occurred, the stone throwing attacks on Garda cars and the fact that, in many cases, checkpoints are not manned by armed personnel. Armaments are rife in Limerick and that generates fear.</P>
      <P>The root cause of the problem is drugs. It all comes down to resources. The GRA representative in the area said that all Garda resources are dealing with criminal activities and cannot get involved in ordinary routine work and patrol duties in the Limerick city area. There is something wrong with that. I have seen debates on television in which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister of State at that Department have said there are ample resources. However, the GRA and the people on the ground say something different. Unless we get to grips with the issue of resources and the drugs problem in Limerick, this family feuding will continue.</P>
      <P>It must be acknowledged that a climate of fear prevails in the city. It ultimately results from drugs. The Minister spoke exclusively about drugs and what the Government is doing about it but he made no reference to the criminal activities fuelled by drugs. That is the problem in Limerick. The sooner proper resources are provided to tackle the problem, the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an excellent debate. I wish to make four brief points. I am a member of my local drugs task force in the Tallaght area and, knowing that this debate was taking place, I was asked to put some points to the Minister of State with responsibility for this issue. The first point relates to the community employment scheme. Community treatment programmes depend on CE. The people in my area want a commitment from the Minister of State, which we did not get in his speech, that there will not be <Col N="981" />any reduction in CE places for drug treatment schemes and programmes in the community. We did not get that solid guarantee from the Minister of State, which is worrying in light of his comment about tomorrow's Estimates. If there is any reduction in CE places, which other Government colleagues have promised will be ring-fenced, those communities will have to face the scourge of drugs they have been trying to counteract in the city. I ask the Minister of State to ensure there is no reduction in CE places for drug treatment programmes.</P>
      <P>Most of the people fighting the drugs problem in Dublin want CAB money ring-fenced for their communities because this is a huge psychological issue. The drug barons have ravaged some of the most deprived communities in the city as a result of plying their drugs trade. The people want the money back in their communities because they want to tell the younger children that the drug barons are in prison and that the money they got from their equestrian activities, their fine houses and their jewellery has been pumped back into the community. It has as much to do with psychology as with money. I make no apology for saying that an illuminated sign should be placed in the communities which receive CAB money stating that it represents a commitment from the Government and that the community is screwing the money from the people who screwed it for many years. I ask the Government to look at my party's proposal in that regard, which has the full backing of the communities that are fighting the drugs scourge in the city.</P>
      <P>I commend Senator Feighan for the way in which he put the motion to the House tonight, which has elicited an excellent debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan" hpid="Mr. Feighan Mr. Feighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who participated in this enlightened debate on a subject I fear we are not addressing. Senator Brady outlined the availability of ice, which is cheaper than speed, and its highly addictive qualities. The Senator <Col N="982" />made his case eloquently. It is a serious problem facing many communities.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned the great success of the drugs initiative projects. She asked if there was a point in producing studies and reports when more than 1,000 workers are involved in CE drug related projects. The Minister of State has not given us an assurance that these jobs will be saved. We have all spoken about drug-related crime. It was stated that many of the horrible deaths are not gangland related, but drug related. Many young people are becoming involved in these crimes.</P>
      <P>Senator Morrissey named a leading celebrity in Ireland who openly admitted taking drugs and who made it seem sophisticated. However, it is not sophisticated; it is damaging. Alcohol is a legal drug. Unfortunately, however, people take an extra ingredient which causes them to become violent. I live in a small town where 20 years ago people came out of pubs having consumed a lot of alcohol. However, there is now a more sinister threat from speed and other such addictive substances, which we must tackle.</P>
      <P>As regards the deployment of resources, someone said that an extra 2,000 gardaí will not make any difference. I believe they would be a big help. When the Government made that promise at the last general election, the electorate expected that the extra gardaí would be recruited immediately. No one told the people about the problems in Templemore. They were told that 2,000 gardaí would be put on the streets to deal with crime and drugs, but that has not happened. Will we be told before the next general election that extra gardaí will be put on the streets and that more people will be put on CE schemes? People will not believe that.</P>
      <P>This is an important subject. Some areas of Dublin have been tainted by the blight of drugs, while other areas are drug free. Time is of the essence. We cannot allow this drug culture to take root because if that happens, we will spend more money trying to eradicate the problem.</P>
