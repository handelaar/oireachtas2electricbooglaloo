      <P>I have received notice from Senator Brian Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to clarify when he intends to change the regulations concerning the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant to take account of hardship cases and to deliver on his promise made in September of this year; and the total number of cases where first-time buyers who had obtained pre-approval for the relevant grant but now cannot meet the 13 November deadline because their house has not been built.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to review the decision to refuse a visitor visa to a person (details supplied) and if he will outline the further requirements his Department might require to make a positive decision in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" />I have also received notice from Senator McCarthy of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to expedite the refurbishment of Dunmanway Garda station, County Cork, having regard to the totally unsuitable and inadequate conditions under which the Garda has to operate.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and of the House, I wish to express our sympathy on the sad death of Lady Valerie Goulding. She was a very distinguished Senator from 1977, when she was appointed by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, as one of his nominees to Seanad Éireann. She served in this House until August 1981. I am conscious that the Cathaoirleach came into the Seanad with Lady Goulding and I am sure he will have something to say about her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" />All of us in this country have a memory of Lady Valerie Goulding. We remember her energy and commitment and the way she tackled causes, in particular those of the disadvantaged. In the 1950s and early 1960s when Lady Goulding started that crusade, not many people rallied to her cause or looked at the causes of disadvantage. She came from a privileged background and was a person of means, but, nevertheless, she dealt directly with young people who, in the main, suffered physical handicap. She went on to work with others who had varying degrees of handicap.</P>
    <P>I met Lady Valerie Goulding on several occasions and remember being very impressed by her common sense approach. She had a very fine way of speaking, which could sometimes put one off, but when one spoke to her about the causes she espoused, one saw how her drive and determination would put to one side all the bureaucratic delays put in front of her. I have no doubt that her fine manner and the way she expressed herself brushed aside many a civil servant who in his or her day tried to put obstacles in the way of her very fine work. I can imagine her saying: &ldquo;That is just nonsense, we are going to go ahead with A, B, C, D&rdquo;&ndash; and she did so. Her fine way was truly remarkable.</P>
    <P>Lady Goulding stood for the Fianna Fáil Party in a general election and gathered a very respectable vote. However, it was her abiding desire to work with people of disadvantage that imprinted itself on many minds. Schools regularly ask politicians to talk to their students as they start their year. I was in a secondary school recently and asked the pupils if they had ever heard of Lady Valerie Goulding. More than half the class had heard of her, which was remarkable. They did not know I was going to ask them that, although her name had been in the newspapers because she had recently passed away.</P>
    <P>The Seanad was very ably represented at her funeral by the Cathaoirleach. On behalf of Fianna Fáil and as Leader of the House, I pay tribute to a very fine Senator who brought into the Seanad a genuine spirit of altruism and demonstrated its value to others. May she rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader in paying tribute to the life and times of Lady Valerie Goulding. The obituary in <i>The Irish Times</i> on the Saturday following her death during the summer bore the headline, &ldquo;An Aristocrat Who Did Something with Her Life&rdquo;, which caught the essence of Lady Goulding. It would have been easier for Lady Valerie Goulding and many other women in her position growing up in Britain and Ireland in the 1920s and 1930s not to engage with marginalised people and do something for them. Lady Goulding used her position in life and her influence to help those who were struggling. The Central Remedial Clinic in Clontarf is the most vivid example of this. I am originally from Clon<Col N="4" />tarf and I witnessed the development of the CRC which assists, on a daily basis, people with physical disabilities. That facility was developed as a result of Lady Goulding's determination, courage and skill and we will always remember her for that. </P>
      <P>Lady Valerie Goulding was involved not only in Irish politics, but also in British politics. Her late father was a significant Tory Minister and legal adviser to Edward VIII as he involved himself with the then abdication negotiations with Stanley Baldwin, the then Prime Minister. Lady Goulding described in her biography how she ferried messages between Prime Minister Baldwin and Edward VIII. She was intricately involved in British and Irish politics. It was an inspired choice for Jack Lynch to appoint her to the Seanad in 1977 in order that her contribution could be recognised. </P>
      <P>Something I admire greatly about Lady Valerie Goulding is that she never rewrote history. She remained to the day she died a great supporter of Charles J. Haughey. When others cast him off, she remained loyal to him. That was a sign of her character, loyalty and great fidelity. Charles J. Haughey gave her considerable assistance to establish the CRC and she repaid him with her support. She was a tremendous person and woman in her own right and those lucky enough to have served with her in this House will cherish her memory. Long may her memory continue alive and well in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senators O'Rourke and Brian Hayes. I did not know Lady Goulding well and did not serve with her in this House. She was a family friend so I knew her when I was younger. She was a unique person. As Senators O'Rourke and Brian Hayes said, she was a British aristocrat who came here and embraced the country with open arms. Instead of apologising for her background, which many in her situation did at the time, she took up the cudgel in the most effective way she could. </P>
      <P>It may have been an accident that she became a politician. She took up the cause of the handicapped and used her position to do good for other people. That is somewhat unique these days among the privileged. One of her great talents was her ability to lobby on behalf of the Central Remedial Clinic. She managed to lobby politicians effectively in that regard. Nominated to this House by Jack Lynch in 1977, she was a precursor of a type of nominee of great and independent mind and she used her position ruthlessly for the causes in which she believed. It was to her credit that she managed to straddle the divide between Jack Lynch's time as Taoiseach and Charles J. Haughey's time as Taoiseach. In spite of their differences, she was re-nominated and approved by both leaders of Fianna Fáil because they saw great merit in what she was doing, which is a great tribute to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="5" />It is also a great tribute to her independence of mind and immense courage in the face of opinions that might have discouraged her from doing so that, despite her background, she joined the most unlikely party she could have joined. It was an extraordinary decision, but it is a great tribute to her that she did so as it was most unlikely, considering her roots. She made a further decision, which showed she was a woman of great conviction, when she converted to become a member of the Roman Catholic Church. That was a sign of great independence and individualism and we are lucky that Lady Goulding was one of those who set the tone for the appointment of people of similar mind to this House in the 25 years since her appointment. I express my sympathy to her family and friends because we have a lost a woman who was unique in Irish public life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is trua nach raibh aon cheangal pearsanta idir mé féin agus Lady Valerie Goulding riamh. However, despite not meeting her as she had left the House before I joined and despite the fact that I lived in Cork, I, like half the country, felt I knew her, which is a commentary on the woman's calibre. She represented a progressive voice in terms of how our country would be built for people who at the time were virtually invisible. She did so at a time when there were great difficulties in politics as we faced a serious economic crisis, yet she was one of those who sustained in the public mind the view that those on the margins were important and deserved a service, whether Ireland was rich or poor.</P>
      <P>For people such as myself, who were looking on from a distance, she gave great evidence of the capacity of one person with conviction to make a difference. It is a lesson worth repeating that in a free society such as ours, a person of conviction similar to Lady Valerie Goulding can make a difference and leave a legacy in the form of the services she initiated from which so many people in Ireland benefited. On behalf of the Labour Party I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to her family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats Party, I join in the tribute to Lady Valerie Goulding. It is right that the House should mark her passing. It is extraordinary that somebody who came from a high Tory family and a position of privilege and whose father, Viscount Monckton, was a Minister in the British Government, was able to marry that privilege to a need. Her privileged background gave her access that otherwise might not have been available, but it is remarkable that somebody of her stature should have had a deep and abiding interest in underprivileged people who had been badly injured and hurt. The achievement of establishing the Central Remedial Clinic stands most remarkably to her memory. Similar achievements are taken <Col N="6" />for granted nowadays, but for a woman to have established such a clinic at that time leads one to believe that she must have been a formidable lady, although she was also a great lady.</P>
      <P>She met her husband at Fairyhouse races in the late 1930s and her family had a great connection with racing and the arts. The Goulding family and Lady Goulding, in particular, have left a significant mark on Irish life, which has been greatly of benefit to the nation and reflects extraordinarily well on her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to associate myself with the remarks about Lady Valerie Goulding that have been well made by other Senators. She restored real meaning to the title of &ldquo;Lady&rdquo; and to the terms &ldquo;courtesy&rdquo;, &ldquo;dependability&rdquo; and &ldquo;compassion and regard for others&rdquo;. She was one of the people who caused the foundation of the Ireland Fund and I knew her quite well through that organisation. She remained a member of the fund's committee until her death.</P>
      <P>I met her at a meeting towards the end of May, when she was as alive and alert as ever. She was deeply interested in what was going on in the North. Somehow one could see, in her willingness to meet people and to act as an intermediary between different groups and classes of people, the spirit of the teenager who carried messages during the abdication crisis in the UK.</P>
      <P>Her greatest monument in this country is the Central Remedial Clinic and the work that continues to be done there. She called attention to the needs of those who use the clinic. She rolled up her sleeves and started to work to help people. The best tribute that can be earned by anybody in public life is that they made life better, even for a small number of people. This is particularly true in respect of a group of people that had been disregarded or devalued by society until that time.</P>
      <P>The former Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, demonstrated wonderful imagination in nominating her to the Seanad in the first instance. She exemplified the sort of person Yeats had in mind when he spoke of the original Seanad and the function of this House. I hope the sub-committee examining the future of the Seanad will bear in mind the contribution made by people like Lady Valerie Goulding. Room should be left for the nomination of such people in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great privilege for me to have worked in the centre that was established by Lady Valerie Goulding in 1951. Along with her great friend, Kathleen O'Rourke, who was also a physiotherapist, she set about establishing a clinic in the humble beginnings of a one-room flat in Pembroke Street. That clinic has since become the Central Remedial Clinic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lady Goulding was involved with the clinic in many of the years I worked there, when her health was good. I saw at first hand her commitment, drive and compassion. She focused on <Col N="7" />doing as much as possible for children with physical disabilities, based on the need identified by her and her band of volunteers, friends and others she dragged along with her, as she was well capable of doing. I believe she decided to establish the Central Remedial Clinic and to put in place the services it offers today after she saw the anguish and concern of parents at first hand. The centre in Clontarf, which is internationally recognised, caters for the educational, medical and therapeutic needs of children with physical disabilities. Lady Goulding was the real and only motivator in that regard.</P>
    <P>It was a privilege for me to have known her in another guise as I had the privilege of driving her around in two Seanad campaigns. I assure those who think I got my political rounding in Drumcondra that I got it driving around the country with Lady Goulding during the Seanad campaigns. I suppose my experience at that time is part of the reason I am here today.</P>
    <P>Lady Goulding has left a wonderful legacy in the Central Remedial Clinic, which has over 400 clients and almost 300 workers today. When Members of the House leave the face of the earth, we will have done a great job if we leave a tenth of the legacy of Lady Goulding. She showed a great deal of kindness and compassion to people who are less well off than ourselves. She is much missed by all clients, particularly the children in the clinic. The staff of the clinic knew and loved her well and miss her dearly. May she rest in peace</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes that have been paid to the former Senator, Lady Valerie Goulding. I am the only Senator present who was privileged to serve with her in the House. I was elected to the Seanad in 1977 when she was appointed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch. She made valuable contributions, as one might expect. As a young English girl from a very conservative background, she made her home in Ireland and embraced Irish citizenship. She proved her independence when she became a Roman Catholic.</P>
      <P>At her funeral I listened to Father Farnan paying tribute to Lady Goulding and saying she could easily have led a life of indulgence and spent her time beside a swimming pool in the south of France. However, that was not her way. She and her great friend, Kathleen O'Rourke, identified a need and so was born the Central Remedial Clinic. She has left a great legacy in that clinic. </P>
      <P>Lady Goulding was a wonderful person who worked for the underprivileged. I was delighted to serve in the Seanad with her from 1977 until 1981. I expressed my sympathy to her family at her funeral and I repeat that expression of sympathy now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with great sadness that members of my party learned of Mr. Bernard <Col N="8" />Markey's death over the summer, not only because of his contribution to politics in the Fine Gael Party and in County Louth but also because he died, at a relatively young age, in his early 60s. We join other colleagues in expressing our sympathy to his wife, Anne, his daughter, Tara, and the extended Markey family on his untimely passing. </P>
      <P>Bernard Markey was a liberal politician long before it became fashionable. He took a stand on difficult issues in the 1970s and 1980s. I have great sympathy for the politicians who fought three general elections in the early 1980s &ndash; I think the Leader was one of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Bernard Markey fought three general elections in the space of 18 months. He won two and lost one. He lost the general election in November 1982 and so spent only a short period in the Dáil. He was a Senator from 1973 until the 1980s and made a distinguished contribution to this House. He was also a member of Louth County Council for 28 years and retired from that body in 1999. </P>
      <P>He was deeply rooted in his native Ardee, in the western part of County Louth and in the GAA. He was passionate about his local team and Louth football. He played for County Louth in the 1950s, which was probably not difficult.</P>

      <P>I join Senator Brian Hayes in paying tribute to the late Mr. Bernard Markey. I was a member of the Seanad from February to November 1982 when he served in Dáil Éireann and I had several conversations with him. I did not fight those three general elections. I was contesting Seanad elections at that time. I recall having a conversation with him in the corridor during which we spoke about politics. He had very interesting observations to make. I was struck by his commitment and devotion to his home town of Ardee, of which he spoke lovingly and vehemently. As Senator Brian Hayes said, he was also very much on the liberal wing of Fine Gael, which must have been difficult given the many causes he espoused. Some of them were very difficult to speak about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He retired from public life as a Member of the Oireachtas at a reasonably young age. He was under 50 when he did so and decided he would continue with his county council work and <Col N="9" />involvement in public affairs. He was hugely interested in his constituents and in representing them fairly and fully, and to that end he devoted considerable time. On behalf of my party, I pay tribute to his years of service in public office and join with Senator Brian Hayes in sympathising with his family.</P>

      <P>None of the Independent Senators has had the pleasure of working with or being a colleague of the late Senator and Deputy, Bernard Markey, but we would like to join in the expressions of sympathy to his family and recognise his years of commitment to public life and his work as a public representative for Louth, the broader constituency he represented in this House and his home town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the House for a period when Bernard Markey was a Senator. To be described as a liberal in the times he served as a Senator and a Deputy was not a great political asset and required courage and conviction. I recall the phrase, &ldquo;the forces of evil&rdquo;, being used to describe us collectively at one stage, and it took considerable courage to be of that mind in any political party at that time. I do not wish to suggest otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is tragic to see somebody who had such energy, conviction and interest in so many areas die at such a comparatively young age. It reminds us that what we do in politics is worth doing now because we do not know how much time the Lord will give us. It is wonderful for Bernard Markey's family to know that things were done by him which would not otherwise have been done by anybody else, and that issues were raised and constituents were looked after. We, in the Labour Party, would like to be associated with the remarks that have been made and with the sympathy extended to his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was slightly acquainted with Bernard Markey. He was a man of conviction and could make one aware of his views in fairly positive and well-argued terms. It is obvious that he served the needs of his constituents in Louth and his party colleagues in Fine Gael loyally and well over a very extended period. His having served for 28 years on the county council is quite a noteworthy achievement. He made a significant contribution to national life. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to his wife, daughter and party colleagues.</P>

We often had conversations on GAA matters. He was a fairly good footballer in the 1950s. Senator Brian Hayes should note that Louth won the All-Ireland Football Championship in 1957&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have a third former Member to mourn. Some in the Visitors Gallery may consider we are spending a long time on this, but it is correct that we make expressions of sympathy in respect of former Members who have passed on. I did not know of former Senator Louis Walsh, therefore I had to rely on what I could find. He served two terms in the Seanad. He was a solicitor and was elected to the House in 1954 on the cultural and educational panel. He was defeated in 1957 but was nominated in that same electoral period by the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, until he vacated his seat in November 1961 when he was appointed county registrar in County Donegal by the Government headed by Mr. de Valera. On his appointment to the Seanad by Éamon de Valera he was also appointed Leader of the House.</P>
      <P>He leaves a family of two sons and two daughters and we pass our sympathy to them, remembering that for them he was the most important person in their life. I meant to research some of the Seanad debates in which he was involved but faltered through lack of time. However, I found four or five contributions by him, concerned with legal and justice Bills and educational matters, as would have befitted his profession and the panel on which he became a Member.</P>
      <P>We express our sympathy on the passing of the late Senator to his two sons and two daughters, who are all serving in professions in this country. May he rest in peace.</P>

He made a significant contribution to the House, particularly on justice matters. On behalf of my colleagues I extend our sympathy to the Walsh family. Long may his memory remain in the House for his contribution both here and to Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my Independent colleagues I express our condolences to the family, friends and acquaintances of former Senator Louis Walsh who, were he still living, would have had some wonderful tales to tell back to the 1950s. I did not know him but we have heard a story of a public servant who ended his life in public service as the county registrar in Donegal, which is a rare path to take. I join with everybody in paying tribute to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reminder to us all of how quickly life passes that we are paying tribute to <Col N="11" />somebody nominated to this House by Éamon de Valera. The fact that somebody had a long and, I hope, fruitful life after his political career in this House does not detract from what we have been told, that Senator Walsh was an active and prominent Member of the House and a serious and thoughtful contributor. We in the Labour Party pay tribute to his contribution and his long life and with our colleagues we extend our sympathy to his family, friends and colleagues, especially in Fianna Fáil, who have lost a stalwart.</P>

As county registrar for Donegal he played a key role in the legal life of the county. It is appropriate that the Seanad should mark his passing. We extend our sympathy to his family and party colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak briefly because I am from the North and Louis Walsh was a Derry man. When he was elected to the House, he already had a considerable career behind him and had been very active in his early days. I think he was even in the Sinn Féin courts in east Derry. He was very active in political, cultural and other affairs in Derry and Antrim. He was a very cultured man who wrote movingly and kindly in a memoir of his early life which is worth reading. I too wish to be associated with the tributes to him and the sympathy to his family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Ms O'Rourke Ms O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a sessional order agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to be taken without debate; No. 2, a motion which was referred to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and on which the committee has completed its discussions, to be taken without debate; No. 3, a motion to refer to the Joint Committee on Health and Children the subject matter of No. 14 on the Order Paper concerning the need for the trustees of Simpson's Hospital to broaden its charter to include women as well as men because its original charter of 1789 <Col N="12" />only includes males and the hospital has been in discussions with the Eastern Regional Health Authority to develop services for older people, both male and female, and to allow the borrowing of money on the security of the charity's property for the development of services in partnership with the ERHA, to be taken without debate; No. 4, statements on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business until 5.30 p.m. and to resume tomorrow, with the contributions of all Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time; and No. 5, Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill 2003 &ndash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7.30 p.m, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, the contributions of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, Senators may share time and the Minister to be called on to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On No. 4, the Leader proposes to hold statements on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse today and tomorrow. Will she clarify whether she will provide time tomorrow at the conclusion of the debate to allow the Minister to answer questions? It would be much more useful than simple statements from both sides of the House. If the Minister was to remain for an hour or so and answer direct questions from Members on the issue, it would be a much more purposeful use of our time than simple statements on the matter. I ask the Leader to consider this proposal in the context of tomorrow morning's debate.</P>
      <P>Do Senators agree that the bravery shown yesterday on the streets of Dublin by two unarmed members of the Garda Síochána in apprehending violent criminals is an example of the kind of dedicated service members of the force perform on a daily basis? While the courage shown by the officers in question in the face of the most extreme danger was a wonderful example of the work of the Garda Síochána, it also puts in context the dangers members of the force confront daily. With gardaí having to counter criminals who use firearms at will, the notion of a civilian, unarmed police force is called into question. Members of the Garda Síochána are the people who stand between such criminals and the vast majority of law abiding citizens. Given the events of yesterday, the House should recognise their bravery.</P>
      <P>Last week the Leader was forceful in her remarks concerning the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, when she stated he should &ldquo;shape up and stop moaning&rdquo;. </P>

      <P>This relates to policy, namely, the fiasco of the Luas project, and has nothing to do with personalities. The Leader stated last week that she would seek statements from the Minister as soon as possible. Will she act on her statement? She also stated the Luas project was on budget and on time when she left office. &ldquo;I do not know what has happened,&rdquo; she said before asking how it had all gone wrong. These are the questions we would also like to ask the Minister. I ask the Leader to ensure that statements from the Minister feature on the Order of Business on Thursday morning and that he comes before the House to confront the Opposition and the Leader. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In echoing Senator Brian Hayes's comments about the actions of members of the Garda Síochána yesterday, we should remember that such actions have a long tradition in the force. As a young Garda sergeant, the current Garda Commissioner also faced down an armed gunman for which he received the Scott Medal. I referred to this matter on the day of Commissioner Conroy's appointment.</P>
      <P>The public is in a state of confusion and perplexity as to who is the Government which appears to consist of the Fianna Fáil Party, the independent Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party, all of which have different views of the world. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A telephone box sized party called the independent Progressive Democrats has also emerged recently. There is utter confusion in the House and among the public. It would be worthwhile if we sorted out the matter among ourselves to find out exactly where people stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rather than having a re-run of the kind of problems we had on the issue of child abuse, which we will discuss later, it would be interesting to know where Senators stand on the tobacco issue. We should have a debate to allow Senators <Col N="14" />to publicly state their positions. A slíbhín, behind one's hand approach is being taken with people telling one side they favour the ban on smoking in the workplace and the other they oppose it. Let Senators place their position on the tobacco ban on the record. We will then see if the vintners will follow the builders as a group which managed to defeat the Government this year. It would be a worthwhile exercise and everybody would be happier afterwards. Let us get the matter off our chests to find out where we all stand. </P>
    <P>Another issue to be addressed &ndash; Senator Brian Hayes got to it before me &ndash; is the question of transport. I agree with the comments made by the Leader and cited by Senator Brian Hayes. We knew what was happening when she was Minister for Public Enterprise, but we have been confused and perplexed since she left office with the issue growing more confusing by the day. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader is correct that somebody needs to shape up and questions need to be answered. I would like to hear answers to the questions raised by the spokesman for the Fine Gael Party, Senator Brian Hayes. I also have others, for example, will the two Luas lines ever meet and, if so, how will they be linked?</P>
      <P>What will happen at the Red Cow roundabout? What will happen with the connection to the airport? What is happening with the Sligo-Limerick-Rosslare line? We knew the position on these matters when the Leader of the House was Minister for Public Enterprise. As she said, things have gone downhill since she left that office. It is time to get the current Minister into the House for questions so we will at least know where things stand. We could also inquire about the Dublin-Navan line.</P>
      <P>The House could do worse than inform the nation where members of the Government parties in the Houses of the Oireachtas stand on the tobacco and transport issues. People should know what is going to happen, when it will happen, what it will cost and who will pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise another issue to put this in perspective. There were ten road deaths over the weekend and approximately 100 road deaths over the three months since this House last met. There were 1,500 deaths from smoking related illnesses over the same period. When we recommence the debate about smoking, we should remember that it will kill, on average, 15 times more people than the appalling carnage on the roads.</P>
      <P>Much nonsense is spoken about delays, consultation and unproven research. Imperial Tobacco in Britain has entered a defence in a case to the effect that it has not been proven that cigarette smoking causes cancer. The same quality of debate is being put forward by the Irish hospitality federation and, tragically, it has been swallowed by some members of Fianna Fáil. Can we sort out this smoking issue once and for all? Contrary to what many people think, I do not believe it is a diversion. It is a central issue of public health and it is time the Government defined its position, conveyed that to its members and told those who do not agree with it that there is a place on the backbenches for them. They cannot have one foot in Government and one foot in the vintners' organisations, depending on their geographical location.</P>
      <P>I join in the tributes to the two brave members of the Garda Síochána. It was an extraordinarily courageous action, which reflects extremely well on the quality of the people who are joining the force. However, I dissent from any suggestion that the next step in this case should be to arm gardaí. Is it now the policy of the largest Opposition party that members of the Garda should be armed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes" hpid="Mr. B. Hayes Mr. B. Hayes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, nobody on this side of the House mentioned that. I said we were seeking a debate on the matter. To suggest it is the policy of our party is erroneous and the Senator knows it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have a debate on it. To float the issue and then say one is not expressing an opinion on it is not helping the matter. I do not believe arming uniformed gardaí would achieve anything. It would result in more deaths and tragedies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want a debate on transport; I am sick of debating it. I seek a debate on our infrastructure in general. Public transport is part of that, as are telecommunications. We are now reconstructing a telecommunications infrastructure to operate parallel to the one we sold to Tony O'Reilly and company some years ago, which is now being run down even as the assets are being <Col N="16" />stripped from what used to be a fine State company. There is a report from the OECD which suggests that, with regard to public capital accumulation, this State is at the bottom of the list. That means that we have the worst infrastructure and the worst investment in the OECD. There cannot be any future prosperity in the State unless we sort out all our infrastructure. I urge the Leader to allow a good, detailed debate with a serious Minister who knows what is Government policy &ndash; which is a difficult one. That Minister must tell us what the Government will do about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan2" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too wish to be associated with the Leader of the House in expressing our sincere thanks and gratitude to the members of the Garda Síochána, especially the two brave, unarmed gardaí who carried out their duties at Goatstown yesterday. The pictures on television from the village of Adare last night brought back sad memories of when two gardaí, Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and his partner, Detective Garda Ben O'Sullivan, were shot there. One shooting was fatal. The people of Adare in County Limerick expressed their sincere gratitude to the gardaí for the work that they carry out daily on our behalf. I also express our sincere good wishes and prayers to Charlie Chawke for a speedy recovery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon" hpid="Mr. Bannon Mr. Bannon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I too compliment the Garda Síochána on their fine act of bravery yesterday, which was performed with very limited resources. A promise was made in the run-up to the last general election that we would have 2,000 extra members of the Garda Síochána on the streets. We are still waiting for them.</P>
      <P>On planning, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to debate the issue. The Planning and Development Act 2000 seems to be flawed in the light of statements made by the Taoiseach at a recent Fianna Fáil seminar in Sligo regarding loosening restrictions on one-off housing in rural areas. We have drawn that to the Government's attention time and time again. There seems to have been a change of heart on the issue and I hope it is not another false promise in the run-up to the local elections next year. We have had a great deal of dithering from the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

Throughout the last session there were several calls for a debate on planning and I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a good, clear, detailed debate on the issue. There is now a gross level of inconsistency and downright subjectiveness in each planning authority. We must address it now.

      <P>We all know of the great work done throughout the country by community employment schemes. There have been cutbacks in these schemes already and there is uncertainty about further cutbacks.

    <P>I join with others in complimenting the gardaí on the outstanding bravery they showed yesterday. We all commend and salute the force on that.

      <P>I have raised the issue of school bullying in the past and now do so again. This problem will not go away and recent events not far from where I live led a young person to the ultimate step of taking his own life. I am not going to name names but this matter has been brought to my attention on more than one occasion. Two members of my family have suffered from this in the past and it must be dealt with effectively. There is no easy solution to bullying, but it will have to be put at centre stage here and debated in such a way as to find a suitable resolution.</P>
      <P>I subscribe to the view that planning is an extremely difficult area of public life. At this point most counties, including mine, have recently concluded reviews of their county development plans. However, all those county development plans should be reviewed. A nit-picking process is in place with planners around the country and, in one case close to home, a word has caused a delay of three months. I could go further.</P>

As someone who worked in a pub and in a psychiatric hospital, where smoking is a very important part of the everyday life of patients, I have first-hand knowledge of the implications of the practice of smoking. I will be supporting the Minister without apology.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Glynn's remarks about the smoking ban. I do not accept there is a right to smoke at all. It is not a right that lines up with the right to free speech or freedom of expression. As Senators have pointed out, we have a duty and obligation as legislators to ensure we put in place an environment free of a serious hazard we know to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children when he will publish the Hanly report, the third of three reports commissioned in the last few years by the Minister on the future of the health system. The Hanly report has huge implications, particularly for small hospitals, including one, by coincidence, in my constituency. At the weekend, the Minister made remarks about Nenagh hospital outside of the context of the publication of the Hanly report. This is an extremely serious matter and the report must be issued urgently. I ask the Minister to end the <Col N="19" />delay with this, to bring the report forward and to ensure we know where we are going. Perhaps the Minister will let us know if he knows where he is going with the future of the health service.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to arrange time for a debate on a report from a committee of which I am a member, the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It is a report on local radio and I seek a short debate on it because, as its author or rapporteur, I would like to hear the views of Senators on the future of local radio as the committee is making recommendations to the Minister. It is No. 15 on the Order Paper and I would be grateful if the Leader could arrange a debate in the relatively near future.</P>
    <P>There have been many attacks on An Taisce in this House, today and in the past, but an important point should be made about the body. First, its members are extremely committed and dedicated people, operating on a voluntary basis in communities around the country supposedly on behalf of An Taisce but, in reality, on behalf of their communities. An Taisce has a role and the fact that the leadership of An Taisce has overstepped that role should not negate or undermine the valuable contribution being made by individuals on the ground. Yes, we have a problem with planning but we should recall that it is the Seanad and the Dáil which passes legislation jointly as the Oireachtas&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will start where I finished during the last session by appealing to the Leader about the Cork School of Music. When I spoke here before we broke up for the summer recess, I pointed out that we would face industrial action in the autumn. That industrial action has commenced and is still unresolved. I appeal to the Leader to get a definitive direction and answer from the Minister for Education and Science as to where we are going with this matter.</P>
      <P>I also support the calls for a debate on planning. We sought this in the last session and I hope we can have it this time. It is totally confusing to see a local authority granting planning permission which is upheld by an inspector from An Bord Pleanála, only for the board to overturn that on foot of a handful of objections. A debate is needed and I hope the Leader facilitates it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also seek a debate on the Middle East. We spoke about this before the recess. There has been an escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent days, particularly with the attack on <Col N="20" />Syria, and the issue will escalate in the months ahead. As we approach our Presidency of the EU in the new year, it is important that we set out our stall and help generate a debate in Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>I join with previous speakers in congratulating the gardaí on yesterday's events. In doing so, Oireachtas Members should not forget the death of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, which was mentioned earlier. We should not support Members of these Houses using that killing for propaganda purposes. Posing for photographs with Garda killers is an outrageous affront to Members of these Houses and to the vast majority of people who support our democratic values.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Coghlan's comments on the community employment schemes. During the summer we saw leaks from what is believed to be a report by top level civil servants about the possible abolition of an additional 5,000 places on community employment schemes. This was discussed a number of times before the summer recess and should be debated again, as it is an important issue which affects every community in the country.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Minihan, I am confused by the planning situation. He expressed confusion about decisions which are reached by some planning authorities, whether they are local or national. I am confused by the pronouncements of the Taoiseach who should clarify his stance on planning. He was head of the Government that introduced the Planning and Development Act 2000, which restricted planning, and he said a few weeks ago that he wants access to planning in rural areas freed up.</P>

A number of local radio stations currently find themselves in a precarious position. I join the Senator in urging the Leader of the House to facilitate a debate on that issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I too support the call for a debate on planning, particularly in the context of rural development. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, was present for a debate on this issue during the previous session, but the public debate has broadened considerably in the meantime. This week alone two radio programmes featured this issue as well as &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and many other programmes. It is important to be clear about where the fundamental problems lie. Some 110 county councillors attended a conference on this subject in Caherciveen last weekend. The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, once again outlined the Government position. In fairness to the Taoiseach, the record should be set straight. He did not make his first statement in Sligo, he made it several months prior to that in Maam Cross when he outlined his position and that of the Government.</P>

There are currently 25 planners here from South Africa alone. I am not taking from their professionalism, but they are trained in a totally different school and have a totally different concept of planning from that which we have here. It is timely to once again have a debate on this issue.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader arrange at the earliest possible date for a substantive debate on the Comptroller and Auditor General's report of last week? Arising from his report there was much public discourse, and rightly so, and it will continue in terms of the church and State. The report indicated that in respect of many public projects currently under way and presumably being planned, there is an extraordinary overrun. Taxpayers are being ripped off on a daily basis as a result of overruns. We need to seriously examine that development. A substantive debate on this report would be helpful at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the extraordinary decision of Iarnród Éireann announced today, which was clearly taken some time ago, to periodically close down the DART service at weekends for most of the next 18 months. The Leader will be familiar with this decision because she made similar announcements on at least a half dozen occasions during her tenure as Minister for Public Enterprise. It seems extraordinary that it has taken Iarnród Éireann five or six years to use a plan, albeit a woefully inadequate one, to carry out what seems to be simple work. Eight-carriage trains, as opposed to the current six-carriage trains, will be in use. It is beyond me why it is necessary to close the network at weekends for the next 18 months to do this and I would like an explanation.</P>
      <P>It seems that the planning issue has little to do with planning and more to do with getting votes. The proposal in that regard is a cynical and opportunistic effort by some representatives of rural constituencies to defend the perceived right of farmers to destroy the rural environment by selling sites. There is a need to introduce balance in regard to this issue when we come to debate it.</P>

Many statements have been made by members of the Front Bench. I have heard different statements from the Minister responsible and from other Ministers. However, one Minister issued a statement this week that a decision on decentralisation would be made before Christmas and the towns <Col N="23" />designated would be announced. People in many towns have been waiting four years to hear this decision. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, announced four years ago that 10,000 jobs would be decentralised to areas which had previously not benefited. I would like the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance to come into the House and outline whether such a decision will be made before Christmas 2003 as opposed to another Christmas.</P>

As we all know, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, is in China with the President. That is part of his duties, where Ministers take turns to accompany the President. I understand, therefore, that the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will be here this afternoon.

      <P>Senator O'Toole also raised the tobacco ban issue, which we should debate in this House. Like others I will nail my colours to the mast. I am in favour of the proposals of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the action he is taking on the issue. Senator O'Toole also raised the transport issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan commented on the tobacco issue and on road deaths. He pointed out that since the last time the Seanad met, 100 people have died on the roads. That is a fairly chilling statistic. The Senator also said rightly that the Garda should never be armed. He said he is sick of the debate on transport but he called for a debate on infrastructure, which is a much wider issue.</P>
      <P>I commend Senator Brennan for the point he made so forcefully about the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe in Adare. This point was taken up by others, but it is good that it was first raised by a Member from the area.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon raised the planning issue. The Taoiseach is clearly in line with the Fianna Fáil Party's position on the matter.

      <P>The Senator will have to ask him. Ladies do not tell.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan commented on the community employment schemes. Senator Glynn raised the issue of bullying in schools. It would be very difficult to have a template to deal with school bullying and it should be up to the management board in each school to develop polices in that regard. It is a huge and growing issue. Senator Glynn also spoke about planning and about the smoking ban. He declared himself in favour of the proposals of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara spoke strongly on the smoking issue, about which I heard her talk on television during the summer. I agree that the Hanly report is overdue. With regard to No. 15, the Senator called for a debate on the future of local radio and I will try to arrange it. Apropos reports, we will have a period of perhaps two or three weeks when we will be awaiting Bills. The more reports we can debate which are meaningful to Members, the better.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan referred to the Cork School of Music and also called for a debate on planning. We have tried very hard to resolve the issue of the Cork School of Music. I support the Senator's call for a debate on the Middle East, which would be very useful. I also agree with his comments on the recent actions of the Garda in the light of the murder of Detective Garda Jerrry McCabe.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan called for debates on transport, community employment and local radio. Senator Ó Murchú rightly said that in Cahirciveen the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, laid out the Government stance on planning and we support it. Each individual county draws up its own development plan, subject to the county council executive. That is where strong input should be made.</P>
      <P>I must explain to Senator Bradford and to many others that we telephoned the private office of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to ask if it would be in order to debate in this House the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General. We put it on the initial agenda but then got a call informing us that Standing Orders did not allow us debate that report. When the select committee, on which there are no Seanad Members, makes its report, we can then debate it. I would have been very keen to have a debate on the original report.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, will make a statement in the House today regarding the Laffoy commission and child abuse.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator Ulick Burke's remarks, no teachers will be sacked. No public servant gets the sack, as the Senator so bluntly put it. There are offers of voluntary redundancy for those public servants who wish to avail of it. In the UK, teachers and others get the sack. It does not happen in this country, thanks to a general consensus that people in the public service are doing a very good job. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, raised the matter of voluntary redundancies in his comments last year on the Finance Bill and on the budget, but it has been made clear that voluntary redundancy will not be asked of teachers.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan spoke of his desire for the decision on decentralisation to take place by Christmas 2003. Senator Finucane mentioned the Garda and, given the particular area he comes from, he obviously has a deep interest in the issue. I join him and Senator Brennan in sending good wishes to Charlie Chawke for his recovery. The pictures of the robbery on television last night were shocking.</P>

    <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and related issues. Much has been said and written, especially in the past week, that attempts <Col N="28" />to portray the actions of this Government in relation to its handling of the issue of past childhood abuse as less than satisfactory. It is necessary, therefore, to remind the House that this Government is the first in the history of this State to listen to the victims of abuse, to apologise to them on behalf of the State and to take positive action to redress the wrongs inflicted on them in the past.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science have previously expressed their regret at Ms Justice Laffoy's decision to resign from her position as chairperson of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and have stated their appreciation of the work she carried out over the last number of years. I wish to place on record that I too regret that Ms Justice Laffoy has decided to resign upon the publication of an interim report of the commission which is expected in November. I thank her most sincerely for the very important work she has carried out to date and wish her well for the future.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Government has appointed Mr. Seán Ryan, SC, as chairperson designate of the commission. Mr. Ryan has a wealth of experience from his practice of law and has very direct experience of the issues relating to past child abuse having chaired the Compensation Advisory Committee. This committee drew up recommendations for financial awards to abuse victims under the residential institutions redress scheme. Mr. Ryan also acted as counsel to the Ferns inquiry. I am sure he will provide excellent leadership and guidance to the commission in its important work. Mr. Ryan's appointment can also be seen as a concrete sign of this Government's commitment to ensuring the work of the commission is completed, that victims of abuse are helped to find peace and healing in their lives and that those responsible for abuse are held accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the commission was established in 2000, it was the Government's intention that it would carry out its work free of the adversarial environment and legal formality of the courts and that it would have been able to deliver its final report within two years. As time went on it became increasingly obvious this would not happen. There were many reasons, but primarily the issue rests with the fact that, far from being a relatively informal forum, the investigation committee assumed the formality of the High Court, complete with teams of lawyers. In November 2002 the commission in a memorandum to the Department of Education and Science stated that on the basis of its caseload at that time, and even assuming some level of attrition in that caseload, it would not be in a position to deliver its final report for at least a further eight to 11 years. This timeframe was provided by the commission and was based on the resources it had at that time. A <Col N="29" />report by the commission in that timeframe would be far too late for many of those for whom it was established.</P>
    <P>Concern about the progress of the commission was shared by survivor support groups who urged that action be taken to ensure the report of the commission was delivered as soon as possible. In addition to the long delay, and the consequences of this for survivors of abuse, there was also serious concern that publication of the final report would be challenged by alleged abusers claiming they did not have due process in a court of law. The likely delays, the doubts about the ability to publish a full report, and the real probability that the State would have to pay legal costs of &euro;200 million, contributed to the need to review the investigation committee.</P>
    <P>The first phase of the review was completed and a report submitted to the Government. The recommendations are currently reflected in draft legislation being prepared by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. However, following on from that review, further amendments are being considered which are likely to result in further changes to the way in which the investigation committee operates. The Government also considers that, in the light of the Supreme Court judgment in the Meenan case, and the current case being taken by the Christian Brothers in the High Court, it is prudent to have regard to the judgments in framing amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Consultations with the main survivor groups is continuing. A number of meetings have been held with these groups, the latest of which took place on Thursday, 25 September. The meetings have been very constructive and have been extremely useful in considering how best to proceed. There is very much a strong sense that the groups and the Government share a common objective, namely ensuring the investigation committee can achieve its mandate in an effective and timely way. The Government remains committed to ensuring this process of review will be completed as quickly as possible and that appropriate amending legislation will be enacted which will allow for the completion of the work of the commission within a reasonable timeframe and without incurring exorbitant costs.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the residential institutions redress scheme and the indemnity agreement that was approved by Government which resulted in a voluntary contribution from the religious congregations to the value of &euro;128 million. There has been much misinformed discussion about this matter, especially since the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on this issue last week. The Opposition parties have in some way tried to imply that the conclusion of an indemnity agreement with the congregations for &euro;128 million could ultimately end up costing the State in the region of &euro;1 billion. This is not true. The conclusion of the indemnity agreement with the congregations is a separate matter from the decision of Government to put in place a compensation scheme for the survivors <Col N="30" />of childhood abuse. It was the decision of Government to put in place a compensation scheme for the survivors of abuse that has resulted in a liability ranging from the &euro;508 million estimated by the Department of Education and Science to the possible &euro;1 billion contingent liability identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>In so far as I can recollect, all the Opposition parties agreed with the proposals, as outlined in the Residential Institutions Redress Act, to establish such a scheme. Should the Government have done nothing because the exact final outcome of the level of compensation could not be accurately assessed? Should the fact that the final cost could not be estimated accurately and precisely have prevented the Government from doing anything? I do not believe so. The Government considered that the setting up of a system of redress for victims was the right thing to do. There was a serious humanitarian and legal problem crying out for a solution and the Government provided the response to that problem. The only alternative to a redress scheme was to continue to require the victims of abuse to sue through the courts. This was not acceptable to Government for a number of reasons: victims would have to face traumatic cross-examination by lawyers; it would have taken many years for the courts to finish hearing 2,000 to 4,000 cases; and having gone through that trauma the likelihood is that many of the cases would have failed in the courts because of the lapse of time since the abuse occurred.</P>
    <P>Concern for the victims was, at all times, a priority in the Government's considerations. Accordingly the redress scheme was set up and is now fully operational. The redress board has received 2,000 applications. To date, it has processed almost 200 cases. The Government continues to believe that it is entirely probable that the final cost of awards will not exceed &euro;508 million that being the amount estimated as the possible cost of the scheme. Following the announcement in October 2000 by Government of the intention to set up a redress scheme, the congregations indicated a willingness to become involved in principle with the Government in the setting up and implementation of the scheme. In this regard, negotiations with the congregations began in November 2000 and continued up to January 2002 at which stage an agreement in principle that the congregations would contribute cash, property and other services to the value of &euro;128 million was reached.</P>
    <P>The Government approved the agreement in principle and following further negotiations on the detail of the indemnity agreement, approved the terms of the indemnity agreement in June 2002. It has been argued that the Government let the congregations off lightly by agreeing to a contribution of &euro;128 million. However, it must be remembered that any contribution by the congregations is of a completely voluntary nature. The Government could not impose a contribution on them. Only time will tell whether the contribution <Col N="31" />represents 25%, 40%, 50% or other percentage of the total cost of the redress scheme.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, it is regrettable that the Minister responsible for this sorry saga is not present. I thought the Minister for Education and Science would come to the House and take the opportunity to clarify the misinformation emanating from his Department and provide accurate information to the public regarding what happened in the past. Unfortunately, he has failed to do so and I ask the Government to take responsibility for this issue from him and his Department because everybody will question the independence of the commission, given the trauma that has been caused over the past few months.</P>
      <P>While the Minister for Social and Family Affairs stated that this was the first Government in 30 years to address the issue, there must be a realisation that Fianna Fáil was in single party or coalition Government for much of that time and failed to take action. To verify and consolidate that stance, the Government and long-serving personnel in the Department of Education and Science, who knew about the disturbing features of institutions over the years, have failed to release pertinent documentation into the public domain. There has been collaboration between officials and for that reason I ask the Government to review the continuation of the process within that Department under the auspices of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>While the Taoiseach's apology was made in good faith, its sincerity rings hollow in the current climate. From the moment Ms Justice Laffoy resigned the chairmanship of the commission to inquire into child abuse on 2 September, the Government has engaged in a campaign of concealment to hide the misgivings of the commission, its role and funding. The victims of child abuse deserve better. The Government mishandled the commission from the beginning. It has serious questions to answer but nobody can get a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Taoiseach, the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform &ndash; the latter having been the former Attorney General &ndash; and the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, have all had their say in recent weeks but the position is still far from clear. Contradictions, accusations <Col N="32" />and counter accusations are the order of the day. Ms Justice Laffoy has been damning in her criticism of the Government. She stated there was no real engagement by the Department of Education and Science with the commission and she was worn out by expressions of contrition on the part of the Department which were not matched by delivery. That is one of the reasons I call for the removal of responsibility for the commission from the Department and the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>Ms Justice Laffoy claims the Department, under the direction of the Minister, did not co-operate with the commission established by the Oireachtas. This is an appalling charge against the Minister and, unfortunately, no member of Government has attempted to explain adequately why Ms Justice Laffoy felt obliged to resign her position. The contribution of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs does not indicate whether further insight will be provided into the reason Ms Justice Laffoy resigned. During recent meetings of the Joint Committee on Education and Science to discuss her resignation and the crisis facing the commission, the Minister for Education and Science could not answer critical questions that needed to be addressed. He was provided with an opportunity then and he has been provided with an opportunity today, but he is still foundering on this issue.</P>
    <P>Why did Ms Justice Laffoy feel she had no option but to resign? Why did she say she was worn out by the Department's approach to her commission's work? Why was her request for additional resources handled in such an awkward and obstructive way? Why did the Minister decide to review the commission's remit? Having completed one review, why did he decide immediately to conduct another? This was another planned obstruction to the work of the commission and it was the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of Ms Justice Laffoy's continuing as chairman.</P>
    <P>It is a shocking indictment of the Government that she wrote: &ldquo;The Commission has never been properly enabled by the Government to fulfil satisfactorily the functions conferred on it by the Oireachtas.&rdquo; This judgment is all the more damning of the Government when it is considered that it was passed by the person it chose to inquire into institutional child abuse. Ms Justice Laffoy is highly respected as a High Court judge and her independence and integrity have never been called into question. She does not have an axe to grind and she was merely seeking to do the job she was asked to do by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Ms Justice Laffoy, in her letter of resignation on 2 September, listed the principal ways in which the Government thwarted the work of her commission. The issue of compensation for the survivors of abuse, although raised in July 2000, was not dealt with until 2002. The issue of payment of legal costs to persons involved in the investigation committee, also raised in July 2000, was not dealt with until 2002. I refer to the decision to review <Col N="33" />the commission's mandate, which stalled its work, and the slow and contradictory way in which the commission's request for resources were handled. Ms Justice Laffoy proposed to allow the investigation committee to work as four committees instead of one. This would have incurred greater initial expenditure but would have resulted in a much more expeditious process for the victims of abuse. This would have alleviated the concerns expressed by the Minister, which ring hollow, and brought the work of the commission to a conclusion by 2005 and not 2011, by which time many people would have passed on, according to the Minister. That is not the case. If the resources were provided, four strands could work together and the matter would be cleared by the given date of 2005.</P>
    <P>Before I continue, I wish to state that the Government has disputed the timescale for completion. It based its calculations on the work rate of the commission since its establishment, but it failed to allow for the obstructions and delays for which it and the Department of Education and Science are responsible. If the commission had been given the additional resources it requested and had been assisted in its work by the Government, its work could have been finished by 2005. It should not have been harassed by the Government and the Minister.</P>
    <P>On 5 September 2002, Ms Justice Laffoy was told by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that the Government agreed in principle to the provision of additional resources. The Minister stated that the commission should proceed with the process of filling new posts in a gradual fashion and on a temporary basis. However, he said that it should employ additional staff on short contracts of about six months. How can it be said that this attitude seriously assisted the commission? Ms Justice Laffoy required long-term commitments to provide the resources needed to speed up radically the work of the investigative committee.</P>
    <P>The matter was further complicated by the Minister's announcement, in December 2002, of a review of the commission's work. The Minister said that he planned to conduct a review of the remit of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, to be completed in February 2003. Ms Justice Laffoy wrote in December 2002 that &ldquo;while the Government decision contemplates a completion of the remit review process by mid-February, its [the Commission's] experience to date does not give it great confidence that this time limit will be met&rdquo;. This was a clear advance reminder of Ms Justice Laffoy's doubts. She stated that there was a very real risk that the review would take longer than anticipated to conclude its work. She pointed out that amending legislation would be required if the review recommended that the remit of the commission be altered, with consequent delays. Ms Justice Laffoy stated that the investigation committee felt it was placed in an impossible position. She had flagged this development time and time again, but <Col N="34" />nobody cared to pick up on the notice she had given of the difficulties that had arisen.</P>
    <P>Ms Justice Laffoy was correct. The review was not completed on time and the commission found itself in the impossible position it had dreaded. The investigation committee was to press ahead with hearing cases and gathering information under the commission's existing remit. If that remit was later changed, however, the commission would leave itself open to the charge that it wilfully wasted public money by continuing with an expensive investigation in the knowledge that the review was taking place.</P>
    <P>Ms Justice Laffoy contacted the Department of Education and Science to say she feared that if the commission pressed ahead before the findings of the review became known, it might gather a large amount of information that might subsequently become useless. The Department's response was to state that the investigation committee must continue to discharge its statutory duties and to operate within its existing remit. While the Department was conscious of the resources mentioned by the Minister in her address today, it said that the investigation committee must continue to spend money for a purpose that might transpire to be useless after the review had been completed.</P>
    <P>In effect, Ms Justice Laffoy was told not to concern herself with wasting public money. When she pursued the matter, however, she was told in July of this year that it was manifestly in the public interest that costs did not continue to be incurred in respect of matters that might not ultimately be investigated. Is that not confusing? Is it not a contradiction? These events led to the frustration about which we know. Which advice should she have taken? She had no option but to seek legal advice on how to proceed. She received clear advice from a senior counsel who said that there was a strong case to the effect that the committee would be acting <i>ultra vires</i> in making any further discovery or production orders under one statutory remit in the knowledge that the results thereof would be likely to be used only in a significantly different statutory regime. He went on to state that this could be argued to be an improper purpose. The advice of the senior counsel is still valid and will have to be considered by the new chairperson of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.</P>
    <P>Where now for the work of the commission? Ms Justice Laffoy asked for additional resources to speed up its work, but the delays faced by the commission have been multiplied further as a result of her resignation. Legislation must be passed by the Oireachtas to make Mr. Seán Ryan a High Court judge to enable him to become chairman of the commission, which is in crisis. Amendments to legislation will have to be considered if changes are suggested following multiple reviews of the work and the remit of the commission. It is certain that this will take time. The Government is delaying the process which it intended to speed up. It claims that the slow pace <Col N="35" />of the process has caused the difficulties that have arisen. The Minister initiated a review in December 2002 and he went to Cabinet with the heads of a Bill in April 2003, but we have not yet seen what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>I did not have time to mention the deal that was agreed with the various religious orders. The deal is nothing short of madness. The response of the orders to what happened in the past involves the payment of &euro;128 million, of a total cost of &euro;1 billion. The Comptroller and Auditor General, who mentioned the figure of &euro;1 billion, is the only public figure to have engaged in a long investigation into this matter. One should take into account the fact that officials from the Department of Education and Science refused to make available letters that were sent as part of the Department's communication with the Attorney General and the commission. What can one say about progress when such action is being taken within a Department?</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reiterating my absolute request and demand that we remove responsibility for this matter from the Department of Education and Science in the interests of fair play for those who have suffered for so long. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has failed miserably to be constructive in any way during his term of office in the face of the problems that have arisen in this instance. The Department of the Taoiseach should be asked to deal with this matter in an independent manner. This is important so that we can ensure that those who have suffered so much can have the opportunity of telling their stories at least. I hope such people will be heeded and not impeded.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom fáilte a chuir roimh an Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Sláinte agus Leanaí. I am delighted that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, is present to listen to the statements of Senators in this debate. This important area is close and dear to where he is coming from as a Minister of State. The views he has articulated since his appointment as Minister of State represent a clear demonstration of the commitment he brings to the care of children. I commend him for that. I am aware of the work he has done in relation to the care of the aged.</P>
      <P>This debate relates to the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the related issues that pertain to it. I am delighted to have the opportunity to add to this series of statements, having followed the Dáil debate on this topic last week. I confess that I was quite confused, muddled, amazed and puzzled, to put it at its mildest, by some of the contributions that were made by prominent and eminent Members of the other House. I expect Opposition parties to oppose. By definition, the Opposition's duty is to oppose the Government to make it more efficient and better.</P>

However, this debate is radically different from anything I have experienced in recent times, and it is neither today nor yesterday that I first frequented the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>This Government is the first in the history of the State to listen to victims of abuse, apologise to them on behalf of the State and take positive action to redress the wrongs inflicted on them in the past. The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse is just one element of the overall Government response to this complex problem. The Government strategy also comprises a nationwide counselling service and a redress scheme. Over the past couple of weeks I have seen Opposition Members selecting segments of information from the various initiatives, putting them into a bowl, liquidising them and producing a plethora of muddled messages. No new initiative is being proposed by the Opposition. Nothing is positive or constructive. All is negative and denigratory.</P>

      <P>The leader of the Labour Party commented that the resignation of Ms Justice Laffoy from the commission would cause more people to take their cases to the High Court rather than the redress board. That there is no connection between the work of the commission and the redress board seems to have escaped his notice, or did it? Perhaps it has not escaped his notice but he is doing his best to make political capital out of this sensitive issue. If that is the <Col N="37" />case, it displays an appalling lack of responsibility in a national party leader.</P>
      <P>Other members of the same party commented that the redress board is not working well. I was not sure how to respond to this claim so I inquired for myself. I discovered that 97% of the awards made by the redress board have been accepted by the applicants without appeal. Surely that speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>I have heard it said, inside and outside the Houses, that people who receive an award from the redress board are at risk of losing that award if they speak in public about their experience of being abused. This has been trumpeted time and again in the past couple of weeks. I checked this claim and found that the contrary is true. The redress scheme is based on medical evidence and involves no finding of abuse. Consequently, if recipients of payments from the redress board speak in public about the payment being proof of the fact that they were abused by a specific person, they could be sued for defamation by that person. It would be a travesty if someone were to be successfully sued in those circumstances. The advice given to abuse victims is cautionary and is given in their own interests. To characterise the position as being otherwise &ndash; and it has been so characterised on numerous occasions recently &ndash; or to use it as a basis to criticise the redress board is an abominable disgrace.</P>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of Mr. Seán Ryan as chairperson designate of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. I wish him well in his task and in the review of the investigation committee. I hope the result of that review will be an improved process. The need for a different type of investigative process does not reflect on Ms Justice Laffoy, who has shown enormous dedication and commitment to the task of chairing the commission over the past number of years. Notwithstanding that, the Houses of the Oireachtas must face up to their responsibilities as a Legislature. We must not shy away from the issue of the commission's investigation committee needing reform. We have a duty to face up to that issue. The investigation committee has not made anything like the progress of the confidential committee, which has heard more than 700 witnesses and is already two thirds of the way through its task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the commission was established in 2000, it was the Government's intention that it would carry out its work free of the adversarial environment and legal formality of the courts and that it would be able to deliver its final report within a couple of years. This was promised to the survivors and repeated by the Taoiseach in his newspaper interview last weekend. However, as time went on, it became increasingly obvious to the Government that this was not going to happen and that the commitment entered into was not attainable within the expected timeframe. Following the deadline for receipt of statements in July 2002, the commission indicated that the total number of applications to the investigation com<Col N="38" />mittee was approximately 1,957. It became apparent that, given the rate of progress of the committee, if all of these cases were to be heard individually the commission would not be in a position to deliver its final report for between eight and 11 years. This timeframe was outlined by the commission and was based on the resources available to it. It would not be fair or reasonable that some of the people who had waited so long to have this commission established would not be dealt with for 11 years.</P>
    <P>Concern about the progress of the commission was shared by survivors' support groups and they urged the Department of Education and Science to take action to ensure that the report of the commission would be delivered as soon as possible. They made the point that some of their members had already waited more than 40 years for validation. In addition to the long delay and its consequences for survivors of abuse, there was also serious concern that publication of the final report would be challenged by alleged abusers in the courts because due process had not been made available to them. This serious implication also had to be considered. The likely delays, doubts about the ability to publish a full report and the real probability that the State would be faced with legal costs of &euro;200 million contributed to the necessity to review the investigation committee. The review has been trivialised by many members of the Opposition in both Houses and I assume we will hear more such remarks from the Members on the other side of this House today and tomorrow.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the very important fact that the commission was created by the Oireachtas, following proposals by the Government. It is the Government's bounden duty to return to the Oireachtas when it believes that reform is necessary to achieve the objectives of legislation, not only in respect of the legislation under discussion but in respect of any other equally serious legislation. If this were not the case, we could throw Committee Stage out the window and reject calls by the Opposition for amendments regarding timescales and targets to be reached. The process makes no sense unless we are prepared to ensure that the Government and the relevant Ministers commit themselves to the timescales involved, as envisaged by the original legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">

    <P>The purpose of the review, as was said, is to find a way through which, rather than around which, the mandate given to the investigation committee can be achieved more efficiently and quickly and more cost effectively for the taxpayer. This latter point has to be factored in as well, bearing in mind that the other considerations are of paramount importance. The <Col N="39" />Government has to consider the Supreme Court judgment on meaning and the case being taken by the Christian Brothers in the High Court when framing amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Originally, it had been intended that the redress scheme would follow the completion of the work of the commission. However, things do not always work out or fall into place as originally envisaged. This is not just limited to this area but also concerns many areas of Government activity, not just of this Government but of previous Governments, as I well know.</P>

      <P>It became clear that the lack of a redress scheme was seriously impeding the work of the commission and therefore the Government moved to establish one. The necessary legislation was enacted last year, as we know.</P>
      <P>On CORI and the question of what the Government did, would have done or should have done, very few positive proposals are being made by the Opposition. It is suggesting that the Government gave in too easily, that it made a mess of the matter and that it is hammering the taxpayer. The fact is that it decided from the beginning that the primary responsibility rested with it because it had been the supervisory and inspectorate authority for all the institutions concerned down through the decades, as the Minister will confirm. For the first time in the history of the State the Government rightly acknowledged in public that the primary responsibility rested with the State and the Government as the voice of the State. Therefore, it said it would set up the redress scheme. Only later did the religious orders decide that a voluntary contribution would be made.</P>
      <P>I am delighted that on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night &ndash; I did not see it but it I heard a report pertaining thereto this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;&ndash; Fr. Seán Healy invited the religious orders to conduct an audit of all their assets, properties and wealth and to publish the results in the public arena. Maybe some of the outlandish, reckless and widely sweeping statements we have heard from some media commentators and Opposition politicians might be brought better into focus when this is done and maybe they will see the error of their ways. Maybe they are right, but I believe they have been jumping the gun. Some of those who aspire to statesmanship and to senior positions in Government &ndash; I stress the word &ldquo;aspire&rdquo;&ndash; should note that the words they are using, the emotions they are generating and the confusion they are causing in the public arena serve them poorly with regard to their future careers.</P>

    <P>In 1998 the Government embarked on a process to bring healing and closure to the citizens <Col N="40" />who suffered abuse while in institutional care. In so doing, it took up a cause that the Rainbow Government simply did not want to and did not take up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which this issue has reared up and become so difficult is unfortunate. When we passed legislation some years ago, I recall that there was unanimity in the House, as there should be when approaching this issue. It is unfortunate that this is no longer the case.</P>
      <P>The Government may fire shots back across the floor at the Opposition, but I do not believe the Opposition can be blamed &ndash; I speak as an Independent &ndash; for raising issues which have upset people throughout the country. Whether the Government has acted honourably, correctly or legally and whether it took the advice of the Attorney General at the appropriate time are separate political issues that need be addressed. However, on the broad issue, people are upset by what is happening. I refer not only to victims of abuse, their relations and families but also to ordinary people who are asking how this matter arose. The Government has to take responsibility for it because that is what being in office is about. Therefore, it must accept the criticisms that go with that, whatever they may be. However, it is entitled to state what it regards as unfair criticisms.</P>
      <P>There are various decisions to be made, some of a political nature and others of a different nature. I do not understand why the Government does not say to CORI that the process is costing a lot more than anybody expected and that it should be prepared to pay more if the religious institutions have more assets. Let CORI say it will not do so publicly if it wishes. This would be useful for the public to hear. We would like to hear the Government say it wants to discuss the agreement again.</P>
      <P>It is grossly unfair to blame the Government for underestimating the costs. However much it underestimated them, I do not believe anybody could have estimated the actual costs at the time the agreement was made. Any reasonable person would say that. It could also be reasonably argued that, because we were unsure, the agreement should have been such that it would have allowed some revisiting of certain matters. This was not done and should be regarded as a mistake. I see nothing wrong with asking CORI to revisit the agreement and it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald and others mentioned that there is no connection between the redress board and the commission. He and I know this, as do some other Members of the Oireachtas, but 99% of citizens do not. No attempt has been made to <Col N="41" />explain to them the distinction between both bodies and that they are working under two different legal heads. I have to blame somebody in Government for not making it clear.</P>
    <P>The Government used the word &ldquo;sampling&rdquo;, which generated much abhorrence, opposition etc. However, there must be a case for examining sampling as opposed to dealing with every single case. We should consider it before dismissing it. I do not know the answer to this problem but I could certainly put forward four different templates that might provide possible solutions.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that, at investigation level, we dealt with the matter on the basis that the case of every alleged abuser be investigated and that conclusions be drawn from those cases without it being necessary to investigate every single act of abuse alleged to have been committed by each person concerned. A report could be published stating, depending on the appropriate words the commission is allowed to use, that such a matter has been investigated and that is has been concluded that the person in question is guilty of perpetrating the acts of which he is accused.</P>
    <P>The commission could also find that the person concerned perpetrated those acts of which he is accused but that a number of other accusations made against the person were not investigated. That aspect, and the listening role where people outline their experiences and views which is also part of the commission's work, should progress in tandem.</P>
    <P>From my experience of trade unionism and negotiations, I dislike situations where people have the option of pursuing two or three different courses of action. If people opt to use the redress board &ndash; they should be encouraged to do so &ndash; it should provide a forum which allows them a full and final settlement of their position<i> vis-à-vis</i> the State. This means that their accusations would not need to be addressed with the same urgency as those made by others. Some attempt should be made to bring together the redress and investigative aspects as it is not a good idea that they should be pursued separately. At some stage people will have to be compensated, but the separation of these aspects requires them to pursue two paths &ndash; the redress board for compensation and the commission for investigation. This leads to a duplication of work in that those involved in the redress board will sift through the same evidence as those in the commission, albeit not to the same forensic extent. While the commission will reach a conclusion about allegations, the redress board will decide on the compensation to be paid. This will lead to a duplication of work, which is not a good idea. There is a need to reconsider how both these aspects may be pursued together.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution to this debate was appalling. I wanted to hear the Government's answer to the allegations made by Ms Justice Laffoy, yet from what the Minister said it would appear that the judge had simply reached retiring <Col N="42" />age and was being thanked for her work on the commission. Did the Government read her letter where she outlined the numerous reasons for her resignation? It is on the public record and the Government has made various attempts to respond, but the Minister should have outlined its position in the House today.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Government was prepared to allocate &euro;1 billion to this area, yet it was not prepared to allocate to Ms Justice Laffoy the few million euro she requested to enable the commission undertake its remit. That makes no sense. Even in terms of the political process, I cannot understand how the Government can, on the one hand, say it is prepared to spend &euro;1 billion on this issue, while, on the other, Ms Justice Laffoy indicated that the couple of million euro she sought to enable the commission recruit additional staff to do its work was not available. This is what has caused confusion among members of the public. A person made a decision that is not in line with Government policy or the Government is not telling us what is its policy. I want honest answers on this aspect.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the general view that Ministers are not allowed to make mistakes. We all make mistakes in our lives. All Members of the Seanad have called it wrong on many occasions. If the Government has made a mistake, it should say so. If necessary, it should acknowledge that it underestimated the amount involved. In the other House last week the Taoiseach rightly said that nobody could have expected the number of cases involved to be so high. The next step is to indicate that the figures originally estimated by the Government are lower than it could have expected them to be. That is a reasonable approach to take. It does not amount to a hanging offence.</P>
    <P>However, there is a need to acknowledge that something must be done to address the matter. The first thing to do is to recall CORI for discussions and perhaps suggest it transfer to the Government a few more monasteries or round towers, or whatever it takes to meet the shortfall. There is nothing wrong with this approach. It is not a question of leaving people destitute or punishing those who do not need to be punished. There is a job to be done at a time when the victims feel they are being buffeted by the tidal energy of political parties and politicians, including myself. That approach is not working.</P>
    <P>We need to take a new look at this area. I agree with Senator Fitzgerald and disagree with those who oppose a review. In most areas of life there is a need to constantly review things. There is nothing wrong with that. However, it was wrong for Ms Justice Laffoy to hear that the Government was to undertake another review when the Minister had not spoken to her for six weeks. That is crazy. If a chief executive was to run a company in that manner he would be told to undertake a course in human resource management or public relations. What happened to Ms <Col N="43" />Justice Laffoy in this instance was a case of absolute mismanagement. It was wrong and a mistake and, in fairness, nobody has tried to defend it. No matter how important the issues have become, personalities are involved. It is unacceptable if a person in charge of a high profile issue such as this hears of moves behind the scene to make changes, whether they be good or bad.</P>
    <P>In this instance, such behaviour is all the more unacceptable because it has created an unnecessary chain of consequences. Ms Justice Laffoy had indicated that matters needed to be changed and this would have been the conclusion of any person looking at the matter. She concluded that there was a lack of resources, but it must be suspected that the Minister did not speak to her because he did not want to provide them. On that basis it is hard to understand why, on the one hand, the Government has indicated it is prepared to make all this money available for compensation while, on the other, it will not make money available for resources. These questions need to be answered. It is not about who was right or wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the questions surrounding the role of the Attorney General. I understand the Attorney General would only have been involved in the legalities of the agreement. Nobody has indicated to me that legal advice would have resulted in a different course of negotiation. The Attorney General was hardly likely to be called upon to give advice on the amounts involved or on the negotiation process. It has been suggested that the Minister and Secretary General should have been accompanied by a legal adviser in the negotiations. It is not that long ago that Deputy Noonan was hammered because he followed legal advice in the terrible case in County Donegal. I have often had to take decisions against legal advice and there is no harm in conducting negotiations in the absence of legal advisers. Most of the time they block negotiations because they will not allow people to speak freely. I do not have a principled objection to the fact that in this instance negotiations took place in the absence of the Attorney General's representatives because they always advise silence in view of the danger of incrimination and so on. Negotiation is concerned with the parties saying more than needs to be said.</P>
    <P>The issues of concern here can be addressed. It is possible to move forward. The Government should outline what was its stance at the start of this process, where it hoped the process would lead, what it considers to be the current position and its proposals for taking a different approach to dealing with it. It is not simply a question of a review; there is a structural problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the redress board, but my views on its role have changed. There is a duplication of work arising from the separate roles of the board and the commission. <Col N="44" />I understand why they were constituted separately and that to combine them would require new legislation. That might save much time. We could then deal with sampling in the context of the other two issues. It would save time and ensure people receive justice, a hearing, vindication and compensation. That is the way we should proceed.</P>

      <P>The issue of child abuse in institutions represents a dark period in the history of the State. The victims and survivors of this terrible period must not be forgotten. In the controversy that erupted last week, there was a real danger that the victims and our obligations to them would be forgotten. Rather than engage in useless political finger pointing, we should remember that the State failed in its obligation to these victims and, as citizens of the State, we all have an obligation to provide redress.</P>
      <P>In many cases the State removed children from abusive situations in the home only to entrust them to abusive situations in religious institutions. In other cases, children were placed in repressive regimes in State-run institutions. The State failed many children. This is a chapter in recent history of which we should be deeply ashamed. The only remedy is for the State to act honourably and fulfil its obligations to the survivors of abuse. We cannot let them down a second time.</P>
      <P>Last week, numbers were bandied about and assertions made that the redress scheme and indemnity deal with the religious orders could cost taxpayers up to &euro;1 billion. While it is important to make good estimates of potential costs, another more important figure has gone almost unmentioned. According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, approximately 29,500 people born since 1930 were committed by the courts to industrial and reformatory schools. It has become clear that a high proportion of these children and young people were physically, sexually and psychologically abused in the most shameful manner in these institutions. This figure of 29,500 is the most important, not &euro;1 billion, &euro;700 million or &euro;128 million. The figure constitutes 29,500 people, each with a story to tell, who were let down by society and the State. They should not be forgotten. In discussing costs, let us not forget the pain and suffering that lies behind each of their stories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information about child abuse in institutions first emerged in the 1970s, but unfortunately, like so many other issues in society, it was brushed under the carpet. The victims became more vocal in the 1980s, but successive Governments chose to ignore them. In 1999, the Government took a brave and honourable step by deciding it was <Col N="45" />time to bring the shameful past out into the open and begin the healing process.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach issued a sincere and long overdue apology on behalf of the people to the victims of institutional abuse. He spoke for us all, including Oireachtas Members and political parties. It was a true act of leadership. The Government was the first in the history of the State to listen to the victims of abuse, to apologise to them on behalf of the people and to take positive action to redress the wrongs inflicted on them. For that, the Taoiseach was applauded on both sides of the Houses and throughout the country. It was right that this happened.</P>
    <P>However, the apology came with a price and the time has now come to put our hands in our pockets. I find it ironic that the members of political parties who joined in that apology have climbed into their cupboards on the issue of the cost of compensation. When the Taoiseach issued the apology on 11 May 1999, the Government was faced with a stark choice. It could no more have chosen to do nothing than it could have chosen to leave the victims to fight tough battles in court, even after the State had apologised. That would have turned the apology into an empty and shameful gesture.</P>
    <P>Another option could have been for the Government to try to place all responsibility for payment on the religious orders, effectively bankrupting them. Some believe this would represent a just reward for the religious and there were loud calls for the religious to pay more, thus bleeding them dry. Such people forget the simple fact that the State was complicit in the abuse and largely responsible for not preventing it. The State entrusted vulnerable children into the care of religious orders and closed its eyes to what was happening. In many cases, the State knew of the abuse and neglected to do anything. It failed in its duty. The State was guilty.</P>
    <P>In making the apology, the Government owned up to this fact, and in so doing, the State assumed a legal liability. The truth is that the State made the first move. It got the religious orders on board. If it had dragged its feet or delayed, it would have been widely criticised. Moral pressure was the only weapon the State had at its disposal when negotiating with the 18 religious orders. They did not have to make nor could they be made to make a contribution. That irrefutable point strengthened their hand.</P>
    <P>The State, in issuing its apology, made a commitment to the victims to compensate them. It should be made clear that, before any agreement was reached with the religious orders on their contribution to the scheme, the Government had already decided that a redress scheme should be established regardless of any contribution. It was better for the State that the congregations made a contribution to the scheme than not have them make any.</P>
    <P>Critics of the deal claim that costs of redress should have been split evenly between the <Col N="46" />Church and State. That probably sounds like a reasonable suggestion to most, but it ignores the fact that one cannot say what proportion of liability should fall on the State and on the religious congregations. The only way strict legal liability could have been determined was by putting every case through a full court procedure. Was it a real or preferable option to drag every case into the courts with all the attendant delays and with the possibility that some cases might fail? I think not.</P>
    <P>At all times, concern for the victims had priority in the Government's considerations. In addition to concern for the victims, it was pointed out that, from a legal perspective, because much of the congregations' property is tied up in trusts, it could not have been taken, even by the courts. As the Tánaiste said last week, everything was guided by the desire to do right by the victims. There was concern in many quarters about the potential financial exposure to the State, and the Attorney General demonstrated his diligence in this regard as well. Ultimately, the overriding concern was to provide effective and speedy redress to the victims. In such circumstances, it is ironic that other parties are so critical when in power they stood by and did nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Kate Walsh for sharing time with me. I would also like to draw attention to the priority we should give to the victims in this. Our minds should be directed towards them.</P>
      <P>I do not like recrimination in these matters but it is clear that the tribunal of inquiry is not necessarily the best instrument for dealing with these matters and it is perhaps a salutary lesson to us all. There is a tendency when something arises or there is some rush of emotion to establish a public inquiry. The political landscape is dotted with inquiries which repeatedly create difficulties.</P>
      <P>It may not be possible in the Irish situation with our Constitution to prevent an inquiry becoming legalistic. If people's reputations are impugned, they have a right to defend themselves and assert their positions. I do not think it is possible in the Irish situation to have a Hutton-type of quick and easy inquiry. It all points towards the importance of following up the suggestions and proposals of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for another way of dealing with these subjects.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to Ms Justice Laffoy. It is a tragedy that the experience and knowledge she has gained in the past four years will not, perhaps, be available. I hope some way will be found to keep it on tap.</P>
      <P>The Act establishing the inquiry contained a clause requiring staffing and other matters to be approved by the Department of Finance. I have been involved in setting up inquiries where I was virtually held to ransom on the question of legal costs. It is important, therefore, that structures, business methods and so forth be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" />Senator O'Toole asked the reason, when one is prepared to spend &euro;1 billion on the inquiry, one cavils over the candle ends of administrative expenses. The difference is that the &euro;1 billion to which he refers, if this emerges as the final sum, would go towards redressing the hurt of victims, rather than legal costs which are a different type of charitable object.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach and the previous Government for taking the important step of assuming liability. They could have told victims to sue, which would have taken forever and involved putting them through the wringer. It is easy to make too much of the voluntary nature of the contribution of the religious orders. The reason it became voluntary was solely because the State removed liability and the religious orders should recognise this. While there may be legal inviolability, the religious orders still have a moral responsibility.</P>
    <P>I wish the religious orders would put away their law books and take up the New Testament for a while. I am not engaging in bashing the religious orders, having been educated by one, to which I owe an enormous amount. I also worked for a religious order and know hundreds of their members who have done outstanding work in caring for children and others. The fact remains, however, that some members of religious orders committed abuse, which I will not quantify, and a culture of denial and refusal to accept this fact obtained in the church.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the religious orders to reconsider their approach. They will have noted that the public outcry on this issue is largely related to the disparate nature of the contributions being made. I was heartened to read the remarks of Archbishop designate Martin the other day in which he stated he wanted a less adversarial approach to be taken in regard to victims. While the legal standing of the arrangement is one thing, its moral standing is another. I want the religious orders to re-examine the issue.</P>
    <P>To say this matter is exclusively the responsibility of the State because it did not properly police the system is like blaming the Garda for burglary. While there was fallibility on behalf of the State and a lack of supervision, the acts of abuse were, nevertheless, the responsibility of the religious orders and they should face up to this. It would be a pity if changes to the process resulted in victims not being able to tell their stories or express themselves, which was the reason the commission was established. It is for this reason that a system of sampling would not work.</P>
    <P>We should be prepared to take a radical look at the commission to ensure it is brought to a speedy conclusion. I am sure the original intention of the Government and the Oireachtas in establishing the current arrangement was, as the Minister stated this morning, to have a fairly informal and speedy process. The sooner we achieve this, the better.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald levelled accusations at the Labour Party to which I wish to respond. The motivation of the Labour Party is to ensure the victims of abuse carried out in religious institutions are compensated and their concerns addressed. The issue is not one of money but timely and appropriate recompense by those responsible for abuse. As an Opposition party, we also have a duty to hold the Government to account for its actions on this issue, as do backbench Members of the Government parties. The issues we have raised have been backed up by the Comptroller and Auditor General's report presented last week to the Committee of Public Accounts, Ms Justice Laffoy's correspondence with the Department, and Government Ministers, especially the former Attorney General and current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. We have raised valid concerns about the way in which the deal on indemnity was handled by the Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes welcomed the Government's decision to assume liability. The difficulty relates to the terms of the deal because the Government assumed liability on behalf of the taxpayer. We also raised concerns about the manner in which the Laffoy commission has been obstructed in its work. As these are a matter of public record, I do not propose to address them in detail. We have, however, been raising the issue of the reckless indemnity deal since the details first emerged more than a year ago.</P>
      <P>The contributions of Senator Fitzgerald and the Minister have shown again that the Government has still not accepted responsibility for its actions, which does not augur well as regards where we go from here. The Government response remains contradictory and demonstrates, through its counter accusations and avoidance of responsibility, the confusion of which Senator Fitzgerald accused the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the Taoiseach's apology which appeared to be genuine and is to be commended. It has not, however, been backed up by the Government's response in the intervening four years. My colleague, the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Rabbitte, noted the contradiction in its approach by, on the one hand, assuming open-ended responsibility in terms of the indemnity for the abuse by those in religious institutions while, on the other, obstructing to the point of collapse the work of the commission it established to inquire into child abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, stated his Department foresaw delays in the work of the commission while omitting to mention that the Government failed to respond to Ms Justice Laffoy's continued requests for additional resources and her recommendation that parallel hearings be held. He expressed concerns regarding legal costs of some &euro;200 million, yet signed off on an open-ended deal which could leave the State facing liability of up to &euro;1 billion. This is the conclusion of an <Col N="49" />officer of the State, the Comptroller and Auditor General, rather than an implication made by the Opposition, as the Minister indicated to the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked what else the Government could have done regarding the deal. At a minimum, it could have used its legal services, that is, the Attorney General's office, in concluding its negotiations. Referring to the contribution of &euro;128 million, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>However, it must be remembered that any contribution by the congregations is of a completely voluntary nature. The Government could not impose a contribution on them.</P>
    <P>It is as if the Government had no role in this affair. There is little hope that it will meet its responsibility and resign over its handling of the matter. I do not believe the Progressive Democrats will do the job to which they appointed themselves in the eyes of the electorate in the last election, that of watchdog in the Government. I call on the Minister and the Government to take responsibility and do what should be done.</P>
    <P>I hope the religious orders review their role and what they have agreed. I call on the Government to supply the recommended resources to the commission on child abuse and to act on the recommendations of Ms Justice Laffoy with regard to parallel hearings and so forth. Above all, the Government must accept responsibility for its actions and do whatever is necessary to address the mistakes it has made.</P>
    <P>I join in the tributes to Ms Justice Laffoy on her work and wish the new chairman of the commission, Seán Ryan, well in his work.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Tuffy for sharing her time. She spoke about the Government and the commission reviewing their roles. It is time everybody looked at the current situation and this debate is useful in that regard.</P>
      <P>Clearly, things have gone wrong with the structure that was set up and the way it has proceeded. That is not to say the structure is at fault but the input into it and the role of other parties, particularly the religious orders and the Government, are not working. It is time for the orders and the Government to stand back and look at what we are trying to achieve. Unless that happens, we will continue to be mired in this intractable process and we will not achieve the ambition we had when setting up the commission, that the victims of institutional abuse would not only get redress for that abuse but also that there would be closure for them and for us, as a society, on this serious issue. It is extremely important that this should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How will this happen? I call on the religious orders to examine the role they are playing in this process. It is not impressive, given what we know. Fr. Seán Healy said today that the orders should make public the information on their assets. However, journalist Mary Raftery, who has been <Col N="50" />a shining light of information and clarity on this issue, said on the radio at lunch time today that the experience in other countries was that it was difficult to obtain full information on the assets of religious orders. Some assets could be hidden, liquidations have occurred and, in some cases, property was tied up in trusts and so forth. This matter is not as simple as it looks. What is required is a level of honesty, openness and responsibility that has been absent to date. Instead, we are getting a defiant attitude of releasing as little information as possible. It is a lawyer-driven approach rather than the church-driven approach we would have expected from the religious orders.</P>
    <P>The role of the Government is to provide leadership. The Government is a player as well, given that the Department of Education and Science had a role in this issue in the past. That must be separated from the role of the current Government and the need for it to provide leadership and ensure matters proceed correctly. That is not an easy road to travel. It will require careful management of the issue and a considerable level of leadership, which has not been seen so far. There has been an apology from the Taoiseach but, as Senator Tuffy pointed out, that apology is empty because it was not followed up with clear action. The Taoiseach promised but he did not deliver. That, again, is a repetition of the experience many victims have had. Our society has promised them that it will live up to its responsibilities in terms of what happened to them in the past, and we are failing to do that. Until we succeed in doing that and face up to our responsibilities in this area, we cannot close this chapter and move on.</P>
    <P>Today, in the short time I had to listen to the radio, I heard a story about the last woman to work in a Magdalene laundry in Dublin. She was buried in Glasnevin cemetery in August after her death at the age of 51 years. She was buried under the name Mary but that was not her name. When a woman who knew her got in touch with Glasnevin cemetery to find out where she was buried in order that she could visit the grave, she discovered the woman had been buried under the name Mary. Have we learned nothing? We have known about the scandal of the Magdalene laundries for a number of years but we still seem to be caught in the same cycle of actions. These actions were offensive in the past and are offensive in the present. There is no reason that they should be offensive in the future if we learn lessons from the past and behave in a new way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome opportunity to discuss an issue that has been to the forefront of people's minds in recent weeks. It is important to remember the comments of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs not only on the Government apology to victims of abuse on behalf of the State but also the need to take positive action to redress the wrongs inflicted in the <Col N="51" />past. Like other speakers, I regret the decision of Ms Justice Laffoy to resign her position as chairman of the commission. She did important work and I hope her successor, Mr. Seán Ryan, will be successful as chairman.</P>
      <P>Some years ago the education committee discussed this legislation. The Acting Chairman, Senator Ulick Burke, was a member of that committee and I was its chairman. We had many requests for submissions from people who had been abused, including from Survivors of Child Abuse and Right of Place. Senator Ó Murchú, Senator Ormonde and Senator O'Toole were also members of that committee. We acceded to those requests and held many long debates on this serious issue.</P>
      <P>There were a number of representations from survivors of abuse living overseas, including a committee in London for female survivors of child abuse. Their situation was particularly bad. They spoke about their disadvantages and the fact that some of them had lived in destitution over the years because they were unable to get employment. They felt the need to come to our committee and to the commission to tell their story. One of the main points they made was that they hoped action would be taken quickly. The Right of Place committee was particularly keen to have the decision delivered as quickly as possible. They made the point that they were elderly and did not want the existing situation to continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>There was good reason for carrying out the review after the commission was established. The Minister for Education and Science set out his reasons for the review. We all hoped that action would be taken to ensure the report of the commission would be delivered as soon as possible. We did not want a situation to arise where a report would be challenged in the courts, leading to an adversarial situation in the courts which would delay a result for people who deserved to have final closure on this issue.</P>
      <P>There has been much discussion on the question of the contribution by the religious congregations. A figure of &euro;128 million was mentioned as a voluntary contribution by them. Subsequently, we heard from the Comptroller and Auditor General that the State ultimately could pay in the region of &euro;1 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that this Bill has been introduced in the Seanad and I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important subject. I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions. This is a short but important and extremely urgent Bill which needs to be viewed in the context of the constantly developing situation at EU and international level regarding regulatory matters aimed at preventing pollution by ships and providing adequate compensation for victims of pollution incidents.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the limits of compensation payable to victims of pollution resulting from spills of persistent oil from tankers to be increased by about 50%. I propose to introduce amendments on Committee Stage which will have the effect of further increasing, almost fourfold, the amount of compensation payable. Compensation is payable in accordance with the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992 &ndash; the liability convention &ndash; and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992 &ndash; the fund convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts 1988 to 1998 give effect to these conventions. The liability convention governs the liability of ship owners for oil pollution damage. The convention lays down the principle of strict liability of ship owners and creates a system of compulsory liability insurance. The ship owner is normally entitled to limit his or her liability to an amount which is linked to the tonnage of his or her ship. The fund convention is supplementary to the liability convention. The main function of the international oil pollution compensation fund is to provide supplementary compensation for damage under the liability convention. The compensation payable by the IOPCF for any one incident is limited to 135 million special drawing rights, approximately &euro;180 mill<Col N="53" />ion, including the sum actually paid by the ship owner or his or her insurer under the liability convention.</P>
    <P>On 12 December 1999 the Maltese registered tanker <i>Erika</i> broke in two in the Bay of Biscay, some 60 nautical miles off the coast of Brittany. The tanker was carrying a cargo of 31,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil of which some 19,800 tonnes were spilled. This incident led to a reassessment, at EU and international level, of many aspects of the regulatory arrangements which apply regarding maritime safety and the protection of the maritime environment. The arrangements which apply at international level regarding liability and compensation in respect of pollution caused by oil tankers are being examined in this context.</P>
    <P>The process was given added impetus in November 2002 when the Bahamas registered tanker <i>Prestige, </i>laden with 77,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil, broke in two off the coast of Galicia in Spain, spilling an unknown but substantial quantity of its cargo. While the examination has been underway at the IOPCF since the establishment of a working group in April 2000, it was considered that action needed to be taken with regard to compensation levels without awaiting the completion of the working group's business. The total amount of compensation of 135 million SDR fixed in the 1992 fund convention was considered unacceptably low and it was decided to increase the compensation levels by about 50% to a total of 203 million SDR. The increases, which are to apply internationally, are to take effect on 1 November 2003. The Bill gives effect to these measures and needs to be enacted by that date.</P>
    <P>Annual contributions to the IOPCF are levied by the fund administration on oil importers in member states who have imported, by sea, more than 150,000 tonnes of oil in a previous calendar year. Three importers in the State are liable for contributions to the fund, the ESB, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and Aughinish Aluminia. The size of the annual contributions vary according to the amount of oil eligible for levy and the number and size of claims settled in any one year. Claims arising out of a costly incident can push up the contribution required in any given year. The total contribution made by the Irish importers in 2002 was about &euro;200,000. While it is not possible to estimate accurately the effects of the revised limits, it is not anticipated that the current contribution levels will be significantly affected.</P>
    <P>While the IOPCF working group is continuing its examination, its deliberations led to the adoption of a protocol to the fund convention in May 2003 at the International Maritime Organisation. The protocol provides for the establishment of a supplementary compensation fund which will further increase the amount of compensation payable to victims to 750 million SDR, or approximately &euro;1 billion. The Committee Stage <Col N="54" />amendments which I propose to introduce provide for the protocol to have effect in Irish law.</P>
    <P>The supplementary fund was initially proposed by the European Commission as an EU measure. Member states preferred, however, to pursue the matter in an international context. Adoption of the protocol, with considerable support from EU states, followed. EU member states have been urged to introduce legislation to give effect to the protocol at the earliest opportunity and before the end of the year, if possible. The provision of adequate compensation for victims of oil pollution from tankers must be viewed as part of a wider framework involving the prevention of pollution and the response to incidents.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to introduce provisions of this Bill as part of the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003, which is a wide-ranging Bill relating to aspects of the marine environment that was published on 3 July 2003 and referred to this House. However, the provisions relating to the increased limits had to be fast-tracked and published separately in view of the approaching deadline. The amendments relating to the protocol are being proposed for inclusion in this Bill because, like the provisions relating to the increased limits, they involve amendments to the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts 1988 to 1998. It is more efficient and rational to include both elements in the same Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious that our legislation complies with accepted EU and international standards while addressing specific Irish concerns. The Irish Sea Pollution Bill 2003 updates our legislation in relation to the protection of the marine environment by giving effect in our law to several internationally agreed instruments. I propose to give the House a snapshot of the evolving situation at EU and international level by referring briefly to some of the measures which are included in that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999 gives effect in Irish law to the International Maritime Organisation's Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention. The IMO, in March 2000, adopted a protocol to OPRC, providing for a response measure similar to those for oil pollution to apply in respect of hazardous and noxious substances. The Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 gives effect to the protocol. Building on the arrangements adopted in respect of oil tankers and vessels carrying hazardous substances, a convention was adopted at international level in March 2001 in relation to civil liability in respect of pollution from spills of bunker oil, which is oil that is carried other than as cargo. The miscellaneous provisions Bill gives effect to that convention. The International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships 2001, the AFS Convention, was adopted by the IMO in October 2001 and the miscellaneous provisions Bill also gives effect thereto. The Sea Pollution <Col N="55" />Act 1991 provides for the prevention of pollution of the sea by oil or other substances and gives effect to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, done at London on 2 November 1973, as amended by the protocol done at London on 17 February 1978, also known as the MARPOL Convention. Regulations covering the various sources of ship-generated pollution were originally contained in the five annexes to the convention.</P>
    <P>MARPOL is under continual review at the marine environment protection committee of the IMO, and amendments are adopted as considered necessary. The convention was modified by the protocol of 1997, whereby a sixth annex was added, relating to the prevention of air pollution from ships. The miscellaneous provisions Bill amends the 1991 Act to enable the necessary regulations to be made in that respect. I look forward to discussing the miscellaneous provisions Bill with Senators in due course.</P>
    <P>I also wish to mention the Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill 2000, which is currently before the Dáil. The Bill gives effect in Irish law to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1996, known as the HNS Convention. The convention complements the arrangements regarding civil liability and compensation for oil pollution, which are the subject of the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>EU member states, including Ireland, have been to the fore in recent years in advocating improvements at international level to safety standards for ships and the protection of the marine environment. Ireland was one of several EU member states which co-sponsored the request to the IMO leading to increased limits, which are the subject of the Bill now before us. EU member states were also prominent in adopting, and supporting the adoption, of the supplementary fund protocol. Following the incident involving the<i> Erika</i>, measures were introduced and agreed regarding the regulation of ship classification societies, the accelerated phasing out of single-hulled oil tankers, the strengthening of the port state control measures and ship-reporting arrangements.</P>
    <P>The European Maritime Safety Agency was established by regulation in August 2002 for the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and preventing pollution of the marine environment within the EU. The agency is to enable the Commission to offer the full range of professional services needed to discharge its duties in that connection. All member states are represented on the agency's board. The Commission has recently published a proposal to amend the regulation to provide the agency with the necessary legal competence regarding pollution response and to specify its role regarding <Col N="56" />maritime security and the training of seafarers. That proposal has been examined at official working group level by member states.</P>
    <P>The incident involving the<i> Prestige</i> gave added impetus to the drive to improve ship safety and pollution prevention measures. EU Ministers committed themselves to building on the progress made during the previous few years. To that end, several new measures were introduced. The EU Council of Ministers and the Parliament have adopted a proposal by the Commission to further accelerate the phasing out of single-hulled tankers and to ban the carriage of heavy-grade fuel oil in such tankers. EU member states have requested that the IMO introduce similar arrangements, to be applied internationally. A Commission proposal concerning sanction for offences involving pollution of the marine environment is currently under consideration at EU official working group level.</P>
    <P>Belgium, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom decided earlier this year to present the IMO with a joint request to designate certain maritime areas as particularly sensitive sea areas, or PSSAs, to strengthen its protection of especially vulnerable areas. The limit of the PSSAs proposed coincides with the 15th meridian, the Porcupine Bank, and includes parts of the special waters of the north-west Europe zone, as defined under the MARPOL Convention, the English Channel and the coastal waters in certain parts of pollution response areas, and the exclusive economic zones along the Spanish, French and Portuguese coasts. The aim of the exercise is to protect our marine environment and coastline from oil spills by discouraging vessels from entering the PSSA. It is proposed to ban certain tankers. For example, single-hulled and some double-hulled tankers would have to state their intention to cross the area 48 hours in advance.</P>
    <P>The PSSA request was considered by the Marine Environment Protection Committee in July 2003. Irish experts from several Departments and agencies, together with colleagues from five other states, attended to support the request. The MEPC agreed in principle to the request for designation and referred the matter to an expert navigation committee for examination. That committee is expected to report to the MEPC next year. The MEPC did not accede to the request to ban tankers as proposed. It is open to the states concerned to introduce other protective measures. Possible proposals in that regard are being considered by the officials and experts concerned.</P>
    <P>While attention is properly being given to disasters such as the<i> Erika</i> and the<i> Prestige</i>, I remind the House that in Ireland we succeeded earlier this year in averting a serious oil spill. That incident, and the manner in which it was handled, was used at European level by our colleagues as an example of how a response to such an incident should be handled, rather than how they have been dealt with, in the case of the<i> Prestige</i> in par<Col N="57" />ticular. An incident occurred on 28 January 2002 off the Donegal coast involving a 22 year old single-hulled Panamanian-registered tanker, the <i>Princess Eva</i>, which had a potential for pollution similar to that caused by the<i> Prestige</i> and the<i> Erika</i>. The vessel was carrying 55,000 tonnes of heavy oil from Copenhagen to the USA. It experienced very heavy weather off the north-west coast of Ireland. Following an accident on board in which two crew members were unfortunately killed and another seriously injured, the vessel entered Donegal Bay, where the two bodies were transferred to shore. An oil spill was averted owing to actions taken by the Irish Coastguard and the maritime safety directorate of my Department. Such events serve to remind us of our coastline's vulnerability. Ireland has accordingly consistently supported measures at both EU and IMO level to bring about improvements in ships' standards, better protection of the marine environment and adequate compensation of victims. I propose to continue that approach.</P>
    <P>The events in question have also focused my attention on the provision of safety services. I am satisfied that the establishment of a single agency responsible for all safety matters is the best course of action. I intend to submit proposals to the Government for a decision in that regard as soon as possible. The matter is currently being discussed with trade union and staff representatives with a view to resolving the industrial relations issues which arise and charting the way forward for the development of the marine safety services. I look forward to debating the legislation required with Members of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very short but urgent. It must be enacted by 1 November 2003, the date on which the increased limits come into effect internationally. It is in the interest of both contributors and potential victims that the deadline be met. In the event of an accident off our coasts, the increased limits would apply only if our legislation were in line with that which applied internationally. On the other hand, if an incident occurred which affected a state whose legislation gave effect to the increased limits, Irish contributors would be required to pay towards meeting the extra costs involved. In the circumstances, I am asking the Seanad to deal with the Bill as expeditiously as possible. I will be making a similar request of the Dáil. I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions and have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>We will deal with the Bill expeditiously as it is short but important legislation to do with oil pollution and the measure of <Col N="58" />compensation. In the other House I was spokesman for the marine, and much legislation seemed to feature oil pollution. The first significant understanding that we had of oil pollution was probably <i>The Kowloon Bridge</i> in 1986, which I vividly remember, since the incident occurred off the west coast of Cork. There was much criticism on that occasion of Government inaction, and the Department of the Marine was subsequently formed.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Department got something of a fright with the formation of the new Government as we thought we would lose the Department's title. However, the fishermen's organisations prevailed, and the marine was included in the title. I very much respect that, as the whole marine industry is a very important feature and economic plank of the country.</P>
      <P>Cork County Council acquitted itself well on the occasion I referred to, although there was limited oil pollution. This came into play significantly with the disaster off the Spanish coastline and the damage done to Galicia, which is a very good fishing area, when 77,000 tonnes spewed out. We saw vividly on television the effect not only on the tourism potential of the coastline but on marine life in the area, as well as the long-term damage to the ecosystems there.</P>
      <P>The Minister is quite right regarding the <i>Princess Eva</i> incident in Donegal and the level of preparedness, but Galway, Mayo and Donegal were designated in a 1999 report as a sensitive region regarding the potential risk of pollution. Is the Minister happy with the level of pollution preparedness in harbours around the country? This was discussed on a previous occasion. Also, do we have the equipment we would need if there was a spillage? Do we have a tug recovery vessel to suck up this oil, if necessary? I do not think we have.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, promised in May 2000 that we would have a special tug involved, if we ever had a spillage in this area, which could be used for emergency towing purposes. Finance was available at the time but I do not think that tug was ever purchased. It was regarded at the time as valid to have such a tug in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went to Norway when we were getting our new research vessel and spoke in detail about our level of pollution preparedness. However, I do not think we have the resources and we were fortunate in Donegal. One was watching the wind direction to see if there was any potential risk to the coastline. I often wonder if we are prepared in this country, because while I agree with the Minister that the whole area of maritime safety has improved, according to the 1999 report the zone covering Donegal, Mayo and Galway was regarded as a high risk area. At any stage approximately 20 vessels are <i>en route</i> to harbours and approximately 100 fishing boats are in that zone. It is important to have pollution preparedness in place and when the Minister is <Col N="59" />summing up perhaps he can reassure us that it is in place and that resources are available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey stated in May 2000 that we were going to have an emergency towing vessel, but what happened to the resources for it? Was it purchased? Maybe I missed out on that among the press releases which come from the Minister's Department on a regular basis. I do not remember it but I would love to know what happened to the money when it was stated at the time that it was available.</P>
    <P>The authorities which deal with marine areas have strong responsibilities, particularly when it comes to responses. I grew up in the Shannon estuary, where there is a particular unit at a certain level of preparedness. There was an example of what could be done in June last year when a vessel went down off the Foynes coastline. At the time there were concerns about the pollution risk from oil and people were watching the situation very closely. Admittedly there were only 250 tonnes on board that ship but at least the unit swung into action, which proved the resources were there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. I do not believe in talking in great detail about it but it is extremely important for our economy. Our coastline is exposed and it is important to have the resources and equipment in place as well as the required level of pollution preparedness. If we ever have a situation where there are major leaks &ndash; I hope to God we do not &ndash; we should be fully prepared for it and follow the example set in Donegal, but by all means the resources should be provided as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge Senator Finucane for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>We will not hold up this legislation as we recognise the urgency of it. There is agreement on the principles of the legislation and there is no need to hold it up. There are some Government amendments but there is no necessity to be long winded. As the Minister said, this Bill has had to be disconnected from the other related legislation for the purposes of meeting this deadline and that is totally acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I echo Senator Finucane's comments on preparedness, as one can only imagine the devastation that would be caused to our coastline and the economic impact on tourism and fishing if we experienced a nasty oil spillage. The Minister referred to the <i>Erika</i>, which broke up in the Bay of Biscay in December 1999. I recall that we were then discussing in our house where we would go on our holidays the following year and France was the location under discussion. At the time we wondered how the beaches would be but the French took on the job to an extraordinary level. When we went to France the following summer I asked people how they had coped and most of the work of cleaning up the beaches was done <Col N="60" />voluntarily. There was not a single sign of the damage that had been done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I experienced it myself on a beach in Brittany which was badly polluted and cordoned off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw none of that but I thank the Minister for that information.</P>
      <P>To reiterate the point about preparedness and what we would do, God forbid, if something like that happened here, we need to be prepared even if we only have one incident in many years. We need to be ready and I hope resources are in place to ensure we would be able to deal with such an incident. The legislation is welcome and my one question, which the Minister does not have to answer today, relates to the increase in compensation. The Minister stated this is to be increased by about 50% and that amendments on Committee Stage will have the effect of increasing almost fourfold the amount of compensation payable. In dealing with the amendments I hope we can examine that in detail as I would like to explore this matter and see exactly how it would operate in practice, who would get the compensation, who would dispense that compensation and what structures would come into play to ensure that would happen. When it comes to how victims would access the compensation mechanism to be put in place, one cannot help but think of the people in Mayo who were hit by the extraordinary landslide recently. When people are in such a situation we must ask what the best structures are to deal with the fallout fairly, judiciously and speedily. I look forward to the completion of the debate on this legislation.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment Act 2003 and compliment the Minister on bringing it forward so quickly, following his announcement on 1 September last of a major increase in compensation payments for victims of oil spillages or pollution. The Bill is small and narrowly focused, running to only five sections and one of the Acts it proposes to amend, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment Act 1998 only ran to 18 sections. The Bill mainly amends the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection and enhancement of the marine environment is a function of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In addition, many other Departments and State bodies have responsibilities relating to the protection of the marine environment and it is important to ensure effective co-ordination between all ser<Col N="61" />vices delivered to maintain a high quality in the marine environment in accordance with international benchmarks and standards.</P>
    <P>Pollution is currently a subject of great debate and the polluter pays principle is very much in evidence here. Unfortunately, in other areas there are those who do not believe in this principle. However, any attempt to improve the environment, whether it be in the area of normal refuse collections, the hazards of tobacco smoke, the fallout from illegal incineration or oil pollution, is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The original 1988 legislation gave effect to the international convention agreed in Brussels in 1969 and updated in London in 1976. In 1971, the agreement on the establishment of an international fund for compensation was finalised in Brussels. This was further amended in 1992 and we are now putting into force the agreement made at the International Maritime Organisation in October 2000 to increase the limit of the international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the polluter pays principle, it is only right that the compensation funds I mentioned are financed by contributions paid for by the oil importing sector. It is only right that the limits should now be increased substantially bearing in mind the number of disasters we have had over the past few years. In this regard, a welcome consequence of this Bill is that the threat of increased compensation awards should encourage those in the shipping business to raise safety standards in order to reduce the risks of an oil disaster in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The international nature of shipping and of many other factors relating to the marine environment means that action at national level must complement that undertaken at EU and international level while addressing specific Irish concerns. Participation in meetings with relevant organisations and co-operation in areas of mutual interest with other States must be an essential part of the Department's strategy.</P>
    <P>The incident off the Spanish, Portuguese and French coastlines in November 2002 involving the oil tanker <i>Prestige</i> underlines the importance of ensuring that internationally agreed comprehensive construction and safety regulations are in place. In the wake of that incident the EU announced in January 2003 that new measures would be implemented to accelerate the phasing out of single hull tankers, restrictions would be introduced on the operation of such tankers in European waters and the EU's port state control regime, which is implemented by all member states, would be strengthened across the board. I understand a significant element of this work is likely to arise during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2004.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the legislation that the owner of a ship at the time of an incident would be liable for any damage that would occur, but I am <Col N="62" />unclear as to whether the owner would previously have had to show that he or she had insurance policies in place to cover any damage or to show he or she had posted a bond in advance with some relevant organisation that could be drawn down in time of need. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</P>
    <P>I am curious as to how the legislation has operated within the confines of our various harbours and fishery harbours. I realise an inspector has the right to stop or detain a ship in any harbour in the State if it appears that the owner has incurred a liability under the Act. I am not aware of how often we have had to have recourse to this legislation within the areas I mentioned. Given that it is 15 years since this Act was introduced, perhaps the Minister has information on that to which he might refer when replying.</P>
    <P>If the master of a ship has allowed an area to be polluted and subsequently sets sail and leaves our waters, what mechanism is available to have him apprehended? In such a situation do we notify other countries who are signatories to this convention to act on our behalf? Are we liable for any expenses they might incur in such apprehension or does it fall back on the owners of the vessel who caused the difficulty in the first place?</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister and the Government are continuing to do everything possible to prevent oil pollution disasters in our waters. In line with that, we are ensuring that in the event of an oil spillage occurring we are party to various international compensation agreements. This legislation ensures that any Irish victims will have recourse to the enhanced levels of international compensation pay-outs that are available.</P>
    <P>Section 4 purports to amend section 21 of the 1998 Act, but there were only 18 sections in that Act. Perhaps that point could be clarified, although I am very much a lay person regarding legislation and may be missing something here. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in welcoming the Minister to the House and I am pleased to contribute to this debate. I also welcome the Bill, which will have positive implications for those citizens affected by the terrible financial consequences of oil pollution of the sea. We have seen the importance of dealing with issues of compensation and civil liability in recent years following the incident involving the <i>Erika</i> off the French coast in 1999. This brought the question of oil pollution of the sea and the associated costs to the forefront of international debate, and this process was given added impetus following the incident involving the <i>Prestige</i> off the coast of Spain last November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the devastation caused and the cost incurred by those directly affected by oil pollution of the sea, a fourfold increase in the limits of funding will ensure that the victims of pollution are compensated by an amount far more rep<Col N="63" />resentative of the hardship and expense imposed on them.</P>
    <P>I commend the suggestion for the maximum payment to be increased to &euro;290 million as this will serve to further alleviate the cost of oil pollution. To date, the maximum amount payable under the 1992 fund was &euro;190 million. Recent oil disasters have made us realise the enormity of the costs associated with oil pollution and it is significant that the international oil pollution compensation fund is financed by contributions paid for by the oil importers sector.</P>
    <P>The international compensation fund is financed by contributions paid by any person who has received, in the relevant calendar year, in excess of 150,000 tonnes of crude oil or heavy fuel oil, in ports or terminal installations in a State which is a member of the relevant fund, after carriage by sea. This measure ensures a greater degree of responsibility on the part of oil importers since any clean up needed as a result of spillage from the oil carrier, which creates oil pollution, is then financed by the fund established by the oil sector. This responsibility is necessary as there is a lack of admission of guilt on the part of the oil sector to oil disasters. This initiative will ensure that adequate funds are accessible to victims of oil pollution.</P>
    <P>If oil importers have to pay for the destruction oil carriers wreak, they will ensure that measures are introduced on these carriers which increase safety standards, thereby decreasing the potential for disasters. Therefore, the effects of this amendment Bill are twofold. Its primary purpose is to provide funding for those affected by oil pollution and, subsequently, it places the onus of taking the necessary preventative steps on oil importers and carriers.</P>
    <P>This Bill further serves to ensure that those victims of oil pollution have recourse to the enhanced levels of international compensation payments. This legislation is important as we must strive to ensure that casualties of oil pollution are able to access the increased level of compensation. I congratulate the Minister and his officials on the drafting of this amendment Bill, which will further increase the amount of compensation payable to victims. I am also happy to hear that a review of the system is under way and a protocol to the fund convention to establish a supplementary fund was adopted by the International Maritime Organisation in May.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the initiative which was agreed at the International Maritime Organisation in October 2000 to increase the limit of the international fund is being realised. I praise the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his officials for their work on the Bill and I hope that we will see the increase take effect from 1 November.</P>
    <P>I am delighted it is anticipated that no additional Exchequer costs will be incurred in implementing the provisions of this Bill and that <Col N="64" />there will be no staff implications for the Department, State bodies or local authorities. This is worth acclaiming as this amendment Bill protects victims of oil pollution without placing extra burdens on the taxpayer or the State.</P>
    <P>The negligible cost to the Government is due to an increase in the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund by the IMO &ndash; close to &euro;1 billion. This final agreement follows the important proposals made by the European Commission in the aftermath of the disaster involving the<i> Erika</i> and, therefore, I would like to further congratulate the Commission on its forward thinking and proactive work in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
    <P>Now that such progress is being made in the area of compensation for oil pollution, we must strive to ensure that this legislation is quickly and effectively implemented in Ireland and that pressure is maintained at EU and international levels to avoid disasters such as those we have witnessed in recent years.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his commitment to the early implementation of the Bill as it is imperative that the Government tackles the financial burden associated with oil pollution compensation. This amendment Bill engages with this task successfully and the Minister has managed to negotiate a difficult issue productively and cost effectively.</P>
    <P>There have been further proposals to expand Ireland's emergency response capability. This is critical because although the amendment Bill will provide adequate compensation for victims of oil pollution, nobody can deny that prevention is better than cure.</P>
    <P>The security of knowing compensation is available for oil disasters is necessary for those affected. However, with preventative measures in place, I hope we will not see the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill 2003 being used regularly if indeed at all.</P>
    <P>It is critical that in addition to the measures outlined in the Bill to compensate those affected by oil spills, this Government also introduces guidelines whereby single-hulled oil tankers visiting Irish ports are subject to increased inspections to ensure the maintenance of a healthy and safe environment. Oil spills have a devastating effect on marine life and local communities. The Bill allows for more compensation for the pollution damage as well as a refund of costs incurred in preventing or minimising the effects of an oil spillage.</P>
    <P>While there are false claims about the Irish Government allowing unsafe ships into Irish waters, this Government is taking positive steps to ensure that in the unlikely event of a major oil pollution incident, adequate compensation arrangements are in place. If there is an oil spill <Col N="65" />which affects the Irish coast, this Bill will act as a robust contingency plan to minimise its effects.</P>
    <P>I fully support and encourage the quick implementation of this Bill. It serves to alleviate the costs of damage and destruction caused by oil disasters and I am delighted that the compensation is to be increased. This Bill is important not only for casualties of oil disasters. It is essential to ensure that oil carriers accept their responsibilities in this regard. If the people involved in oil transportation are asked to pay for the clean-up of the oil spilt, we will see an increase in the safety and quality of oil tankers operating in Irish waters. This is vital if we aim to prevent an oil spill. I hope this Bill may serve as a warning to the operators of unsafe ships, so we may not need to see the Bill used regularly if at all.</P>
    <P>The Bill is effective legislation in the prevention of oil disasters. I thank the Minister for drawing up such a comprehensive Bill and I look forward to its imminent implementation. I commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions. As I said to Senator O'Meara, I had occasion when I was on holiday after the <i>Erika </i>disaster to see the devastating effects on a beach in south Brittany which is quite a distance from the point where the <i>Erika </i>broke up near Brest. The <i>Prestige </i>disaster has given us an added impetus in our resolve.</P>
      <P>At EU level, Ireland has been very much to the fore, particularly during my time as Minister, in pushing for the fast-tracking of the issue in relation to the phasing out of the single-hull tankers. This phasing out has been brought forward quite dramatically. I appreciate that there are countries where this is imposing a much higher onus than for example on Ireland, which does not have a fleet to compare for example with that of Greece, which faces considerable difficulties in fulfilling the commitments on the fast-tracking of the phasing out process. With so many islands in Greece, the transportation of oil from one island to another, if it is to be by double-hull tankers, will create a very significant burden for the Greek authorities.</P>
      <P>Not all countries are similar, but Ireland was one of the strong promoters of the initiative and was supported by the vast majority of the other countries in the light of what happened to the <i>Prestige.</i>Regarding the particularly sensitive areas, Ireland has again been to the forefront in promoting their concerns at EU level and subsequently, based on the decision at EU level, will prosecute an application with the IMO in this respect. The results of that will become clear in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Senators for allowing this legislation to go through Second Stage as expeditiously as possible because there is a time constraint, and the sooner it is put in place the <Col N="66" />better. It will bring in a requirement for much higher levels of compensation which will be payable by the ship owners and insurance companies and by the IOPCF. It that regard the legislation brings significant change and assistance.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy of the State to purchase an emergency towing vessel, but a huge level of funding is required. We have been investigating the possibility of jointly funding the purchase with the UK authorities, who are interested in such a project. While one can never be absolutely certain in these matters, the response after the <i>Princess Eva </i>was damaged off the Donegal coast was very swift, with everyone working well. In relation to <i>Prestige,</i> decisions were unfortunately not made in a timely and co-ordinated way, and because of that time was lost at the initial phase of the incident. Dramatic consequences ensued for which the Spanish, the Portuguese and to a lesser extent the French are paying ever since.</P>
    <P>Ireland was one of the first countries to give equipment and make expertise available after the <i>Prestige </i>incident. There are arrangements at EU level whereby if an incident does occur, there is a pooling of resources, including towing vessels. The Irish marine research vessel has a capability not for towing but for holding a tanker in place and thus buying time so as to ensure other vessels can be made available. In the system there are contracts available whereby emergency towing vessels&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the research vessel not have very limited towing capacity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has some towing capacity, but more of a holding capacity. It is powerful enough to hold a drifting tanker in order to buy time until towing vessels arrive. There is a system in place whereby in the event of a disaster happening off the Irish coast there would be a rapid response. However, one can never say never, when one sees for example what happened in a country like Spain, with all its resources. To a certain extent the consequences of the tanker sinking off the Spanish coast last year were made far worse by prevarication and the late reaction to the incident. Lessons have been learned since then.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we might have an opportunity to tease out some of the sections but this is essentially a very simple Bill, though very important and timely, because of the potential disasters pending in the years to come.</P>
